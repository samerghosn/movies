1
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,979
Locutus.

2
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:46,280
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.

3
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:29,368
Authorisation: Picard 47-AT.

4
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:33,833
- Did I catch you at a bad time?
- No, Admiral, of course not.

5
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:40,215
I`ve just heard that our colony on
Ivor Prime has been destroyed.

6
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:43,885
- Long-range sensors...
- Yes, I know. The Borg.

7
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:52,186
Captain’s log: Stardate 50893.5.

8
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:56,857
The moment have dreaded for
nearly six years has finally arrived.

9
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:02,988
The Borg, our lethal enemy, have
begun an invasion of the Federation.

10
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,785
This time
there maybe no stopping them.

11
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:10,580
- How many ships?
- One, on a direct course for Earth.

12
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:15,919
They’ll be in Federation space soon.
Admiral Hayes is mobilising a fleet.

13
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,090
- It will take us three hours...
- We’re not going.

14
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:24,763
- What do you mean?
- We’re to patrol the Neutral Zone.

15
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:30,102
In case the Romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation.

16
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:37,068
There has been no unusual activity
along the Romulan border.

17
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:41,615
Does Starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time?

18
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:47,663
We`re ready! The Enterprise E is
the most advanced ship in the fleet.

19
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:52,627
I have gone over all this
with Starfleet. Their orders stand.

20
00:05:57,173 --> 00:06:00,928
Number One,
set a course for the Neutral Zone.

21
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:38,386
- Bizet?
- Berlioz. What do you have?

22
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:42,639
We`ve finished
our first sweep of the Neutral Zone.

23
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,311
Fascinating.
20 particles of dust per cubic metre.

24
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:51,900
52 ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a class-two comet.

25
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,070
This is certainly
worthy of our attention.

26
00:06:56,321 --> 00:07:00,075
Captain, why are we out here?

27
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:04,622
Starfleet has every confidence
in the Enterprise and her crew.

28
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,542
They`re just not sure
about her captain.

29
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:12,922
A man once captured
and assimilated by the Borg -

30
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:17,719
- should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again.

31
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:23,309
It would introduce an unstable element
to a critical situation.

32
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:28,523
Your experience makes you
the perfect man to lead this fight.

33
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,112
Bridge to Captain Picard.

34
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:38,658
We`ve received word from the fleet,
they`ve engaged the Borg.

35
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:46,876
Mr Data, put Starfleet frequency 1486
on audio.

36
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,549
Flagship Endeavour,
stand by to engage.

37
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:56,594
Defiant and Bozeman,
fallback to mobile position one.

38
00:07:56,844 --> 00:08:03,145
We have it in visual range.
A Borg cube on course 0215 ...

39
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:08,108
We are the Borg. Lower your shields
and surrender your ships.

40
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:13,197
We will add your biological
distinctiveness to our own.

41
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:18,285
Your culture will adapt to serve us.
Resistance is futile.

42
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:22,456
All units, open fire.

43
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:26,252
They`ve broken through
the defence perimeter.

44
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,259
Continue to attack.

45
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,888
We need reinforcements.

46
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:41,227
96 dead and 22 wounded
on the Lexington.

47
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:48,443
Lt Hawk, set a course for Earth.
Maximum warp.

48
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,075
I am about to disobey our orders.

49
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,705
Any of you who wish to object
should do so now.

50
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:07,714
I believe I speak for everyone here
when I say ...

51
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,803
... to hell with our orders.

52
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:21,146
Red alert. All hands to battle stations.
Engage.

53
00:09:57,435 --> 00:10:02,441
- Report!
- Power off-line, our weapons are gone.

54
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:11,033
Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed.

55
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,746
Sir, there`s another ship coming in.

56
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:18,917
It`s the Enterprise.

57
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:31,306
- The Defiant is losing life support.
- Beam the survivors aboard.

58
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,725
They`ve destroyed the admiral`s ship.

59
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:40,315
- What is the status of the Borg cube?
- The outer hull has been damaged.

60
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:44,112
I am reading fluctuations
in their power grid.

61
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:57,793
Number One,
open a channel to the fleet.

62
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:02,506
This is Capt Picard.
I`m taking command of the fleet.

63
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,137
Plot in the following coordinates.
Fire on my command.

64
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:12,350
- Is that a vital system?
- Trust me, Data.

65
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:17,398
The fleet has responded, sir,
they`re standing by.

66
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,111
Fire.

67
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:01,029
- Mr Hawk, pursuit course. Engage.
- Aye, sir.

68
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:11,456
- What?
- I can hear them.

69
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:17,380
I have a patient here
who insists on coming to the bridge.

70
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:21,884
- Welcome aboard, Mr Worf.
- Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:25,554
- The Defiant?
- Adrift, but salvageable.

72
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:29,226
- Tough little ship.
- Little?

73
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:33,606
Mr Worf, we could use some help
at tactical.

74
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:40,113
You do remember
how to fire phasers?

75
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,582
We`re detecting
chronometric particles.

76
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,087
- They`re creating a temporal vortex.
- Time travel.

77
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:07,977
- Data, report.
- We`re caught in a temporal wake.

78
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:11,314
Captain ... Earth.

79
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:18,822
There are high concentrations
of methane and carbon monoxide.

80
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:23,953
- Life signs?
- Approximately nine billion.

81
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,998
- All Borg.
- How?.

82
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:32,420
They did it in the past. They went back
and assimilated Earth, changed history.

83
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,465
Why are we still here?

84
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:41,014
The temporal wake protected us
from changes in the time line.

85
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,893
- The vortex is collapsing.
- Hold your course.

86
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:50,189
We must follow them back
and repair the damage they`ve done.

87
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,311
- Come on.
- Good night, Eddie.

88
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:28,231
Go home.

89
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:31,318
You`ll regret this tomorrow.

90
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:37,741
You should have learned by now
that I don`t have regrets.

91
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,621
- One more round, Lily.
- Z, you`ve had enough.

92
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,335
- I`m not flying with a drunken pilot.
- I can`t fly sober.

93
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,923
What is that?

94
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:57,554
- That is the constellation Leo.
- No, that!

95
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:10,569
- It`s the ECON.
- After all these years?

96
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:19,578
We`ve got to get to the Phoenix.

97
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,171
To hell with the Phoenix.

98
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:51,573
Shields are down.
Main power is holding.

99
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:55,535
We are in the mid 21st century.

100
00:15:55,827 --> 00:16:01,583
I would estimate we have arrived
ten years after the Third World War.

101
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:06,255
That makes sense. Most of the
major cities have been destroyed.

102
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:10,884
- 600 million dead. No resistance.
- Captain.

103
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,893
Mr Worf, quantum torpedoes.
Fire.

104
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,786
They were firing at the surface.
Location?

105
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:38,498
Western hemisphere.
North American Continent.

106
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:44,797
- A missile complex in Montana.
- A missile complex?.

107
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:48,593
Data, I need to know the exact date.

108
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,888
April 4th, 2063.

109
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:55,892
April 4th.
The day before First Contact.

110
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,690
The missile complex must be
where Cochrane is building his ship.

111
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,608
They came to stop First Contact.

112
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:07,614
- How much damage, Lieutenant?
- I can`t tell.

113
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:11,868
We`ll have to go down there
and find out what happened.

114
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,788
Have a security team ready.

115
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,584
Computer, 21st century clothing.

116
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,753
Number One, you have the Bridge.

117
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:34,185
Over here.

118
00:17:56,917 --> 00:18:00,213
They`re all dead.

119
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,930
See if one of them is Cochrane.
Data, let`s go check the warp ship.

120
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:34,709
The structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact.

121
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:38,045
The fuselage is slightly damaged.

122
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:44,303
We have the blueprints.
We need a team down here.

123
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:49,808
- Hold your fire. We`re here to help.
- Bullshit!

124
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:56,566
Captain, I believe I can handle this.

125
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,093
Greetings.

126
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:32,396
This woman
requires medical attention.

127
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:42,741
- Severe radiation poisoning.
- From the damaged ship.

128
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:47,247
I have to get her to sick bay.

129
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:51,417
No lectures on the prime directive,
l`ll keep her unconscious.

130
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,922
Tell Riker to beam down with
a search party to find Cochrane.

131
00:19:56,131 --> 00:20:00,928
Crusher to Enterprise.
Two to beam directly to sick bay.

132
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:09,437
In 48 hours
this ship has to be launched.

133
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:15,319
Geordi, the ship was damaged in the
attack. Get a repair crew down here.

134
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,950
I`m on my way. Alpha team,
we`re heading down to the surface.

135
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,121
Porter, take command while l`m gone.

136
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:30,794
Check out the environmental controls.
It`s a little warm in here.

137
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:53,110
Isn`t it amazing?

138
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,032
This ship
used to be a nuclear missile.

139
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:02,453
An historical irony. Using an
instrument of mass destruction -

140
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:06,166
- to inaugurate an era of peace.

141
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:22,058
A boyhood fantasy. I`ve seen
this ship in the Smithsonian, -

142
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:25,395
- but I was never able to touch it.

143
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:30,692
Does tactile contact
alter your perception of the Phoenix?.

144
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,698
For humans, touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way.

145
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:40,244
It makes it seem more real.

146
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:50,088
I`m detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing.

147
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,092
Temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

148
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:58,264
It is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago.

149
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:03,187
- Would you three like to be alone?
- What have you found out?

150
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:07,774
- There`s no sign of Cochrane.
- He has to be here.

151
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:12,278
This ship and this flight
were his dream.

152
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:17,285
We should consider the possibility
that Dr Cochrane died in the attack.

153
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:24,458
If that`s true ...
then the future may die with him.

154
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:36,974
- What do you think?.
- The entire system has gone crazy.

155
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:42,479
It`s affecting the entire deck.
I`ll check the EPS conduits.

156
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:55,534
- Hello? Hey!
- Are you talking to me?

157
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:59,456
Is anyone else working up here?

158
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:03,042
Not that I know of.

159
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:15,015
Paul?

160
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,732
Paul, are you okay in there?

161
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:42,336
Captain, what is it?

162
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:49,470
Picard to Enterprise. Mr Worf,
is everything all right up there?

163
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:54,808
We are experiencing some
environmental diffiiculties.

164
00:23:55,057 --> 00:24:01,064
Humidityhas risen 73()%()
and the temperature is up 10 degrees.

165
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:07,195
Mr Data and I will be right there.
Number One, take charge down here.

166
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:13,621
The damage to her cell membranes
is repaired. She should be fine.

167
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:17,167
Find out why it`s so hot in here.

168
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:21,171
- Now what?
- Crusher to Engineering.

169
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,715
Crusher to Bridge.

170
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:30,513
- Exactly what`s been happening?
- We`ve lost contact with Deck 16.

171
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:35,102
I was about to send
a security team to investigate.

172
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:39,732
No, seal off Deck 16. Post
security teams at every access point.

173
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:44,361
What environmental conditions
were last reported in Engineering?

174
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:49,660
92()%() humidity.
39.1 degrees Celsius.

175
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:54,916
39.1 degrees Celsius ...
Iike a Borg ship.

176
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:59,253
They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.

177
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:03,425
Somehow they transported over here
without being detected.

178
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:08,513
They`ll assimilate the Enterprise ...
and then Earth.

179
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:13,643
Picard to Riker.

180
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:18,525
Enterprise to Away Team.

181
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,446
Respond.

182
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:28,118
Main control is being re-routed
through Engineering.

183
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,830
Data, lock out the main computer.

184
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:44,845
I have isolated the main computer
with an encryption code.

185
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:49,266
The Borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

186
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:51,810
The Borg won`t stay on Deck 16.

187
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:58,568
You`re all right. Come on, wake up.

188
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:03,239
You are all right. Listen to me.

189
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:07,077
You`re going to be fine.
I need you to do as I say.

190
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:11,874
- Is the EMH programme on-line?
- It should be.

191
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:18,381
- Activate the EMH programme.
- What is the nature of the emergency?.

192
00:26:18,632 --> 00:26:23,470
20 Borg are about to break in here.
Create a diversion.

193
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:27,265
This isn`t part of my programme.
I`m a doctor.

194
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:31,730
Do a dance, tell a story,
just give us a few seconds.

195
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:45,036
According to medical research, Borg
implants can cause skin irritations.

196
00:26:45,243 --> 00:26:49,583
Perhaps you`d like
an analgesic cream.

197
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,215
Which way?.

198
00:26:56,464 --> 00:27:00,093
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.

199
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:19,115
Engineering will be the central point
from which they control the hive.

200
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:24,954
If we begin firing in there,
we may hit the warp core.

201
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:33,547
Our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks.

202
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:39,471
Plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact.

203
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,809
The Borg cannot survive
without their organic components.

204
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:48,940
All weapons will be set
on a rotating modulation.

205
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:53,277
The Borg will adapt quickly.
We`ll be able to fire 12 shots at most.

206
00:27:53,484 --> 00:28:00,493
You may encounter crew members
who have already been assimilated.

207
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:08,126
Don`t hesitate to fire. Believe me,
you`ll be doing them a favour. Let`s go.

208
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,201
Deanna!

209
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:45,876
Deanna!

210
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:51,215
Will, don`t turn off that ..!

211
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:58,057
Who is this jerk?. And who told him
he could turn off my music?

212
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:03,103
Will Riker, Zefram Cochrane.

213
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:08,901
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes.

214
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,403
- Husband?
- No?

215
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,990
Good.

216
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:18,119
- This, Deena ...
- Deanna.

217
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:23,291
This ... is the good stuff.

218
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,670
Dr Cochrane ...

219
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:31,216
To the Phoenix ...
May she rest in peace.

220
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:42,855
Okay, that wasn`t so good.

221
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:50,237
- We have to tell him the truth.
- Then the time line ...

222
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:55,577
This is no time to argue about time.
We don`t have the time.

223
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:05,004
- What was I saying?
- You`re drunk.

224
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:10,343
He wouldn`t even talk to me
unless I had a drink with him.

225
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:16,809
It took three shots of tequila
just to find out his name.

226
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:21,606
I`ve spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me.

227
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:26,152
So don`t go criticising
my counselling techniques.

228
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,743
It`s a primitive culture.

229
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:40,042
I`m just trying to blend in.
He didn`t believe our cover story.

230
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:45,381
We`re running out of time.
Will he be able to handle the truth?

231
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:54,933
If you`re looking for my
professional opinion ... He`s nuts.

232
00:30:55,226 --> 00:30:58,354
I`ll be sure to note that in my log.

233
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,289
Captain, I believe l`m feeling ...
anxiety.

234
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,667
It is an intriguing sensation.

235
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:41,049
Data, perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now.

236
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:46,263
Good idea, sir ... Done.

237
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:50,184
Data, there are times that I envy you.

238
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:07,203
It`s only me! We have wounded here.

239
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:14,084
- Get these people back to Deck 14.
- There was a civilian with us.

240
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:19,134
- We`ll watch for her.
- Please, try to find her.

241
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:46,371
Lower your weapons. They`ll ignore
us till the consider us a threat.

242
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,421
The manual release.

243
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,259
Mr Worf, hold this position.

244
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:46,187
Manualrelease on-line.

245
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:56,405
Perhaps we should just knock.

246
00:34:58,283 --> 00:35:00,744
Data.

247
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,842
Ready phasers.

248
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,150
Data, cover me.

249
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:40,244
Captain, they have adapted.

250
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:22,082
Regroup on Deck 15.
Don`t let them touch you.

251
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:27,755
- Captain!
- Data!

252
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:49,320
Here!

253
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:56,161
Help!

254
00:36:56,453 --> 00:36:59,457
Please, help.

255
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:23,315
- You! How the hell ..?
- Back off!

256
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:28,655
Who are you?
What faction are you with?

257
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:34,370
- I`m not with the Eastern Coalition.
- Just get me the hell out of here.

258
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:38,457
- Now!
- That isn`t going to be easy.

259
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:43,464
You`d better find a way,
or l`m going to start pushing buttons.

260
00:37:46,215 --> 00:37:49,761
- Follow me.
- Slow!

261
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,980
You won`t be able to break
the encryption codes.

262
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:40,732
Nor will you
be able to assimilate me.

263
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,153
Brave words.
I`ve heard them before.

264
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:50,160
From thousands ofspecies
across thousands ofworlds.

265
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,540
Butnow they are alIBorg.

266
00:38:53,789 --> 00:39:01,131
I am unlike any life form
you have encountered before.

267
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:05,386
You are an imperfectbeing,
created by an imperfectbeing.

268
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:10,850
Findingyour weakness
is only a matter oftime.

269
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:22,530
Let me make sure I understand you
correctly, Commander.

270
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,784
A group of cybernetic creatures
from the future -

271
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:32,207
- have travelled back through time
to enslave the human race.

272
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:38,339
And you`re here to stop them?
Hot damn! You`re heroic.

273
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:46,389
- We`re going to prove it to you.
- There she is! Beautiful!

274
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:51,894
- All right, take a look.
- Well, well, well ...

275
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:56,609
What have we got here?
I love a good peep show.

276
00:40:08,538 --> 00:40:14,253
That`s a trick.
How did you do that?

277
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:18,883
- It`s your telescope.
- That`s our ship. The Enterprise.

278
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:31,438
And Lily is up there?
Can I talk to her?.

279
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,985
We`ve lost contact with the ship.
We don`t know why yet.

280
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:42,409
- So what is it you want me to do?
- Conduct your flight as planned.

281
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:45,788
Why tomorrow morning?

282
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:53,795
At 1 1 o`clock an alien ship
will be passing this solar system.

283
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:57,884
Alien? You mean extra-terrestrials?

284
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:01,554
- More bad guys?
- Good guys.

285
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:05,100
They have no interest in Earth ...
too primitive.

286
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:14,986
When they discover that humans have
learned how to fly faster than light, -

287
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:19,616
- they alter their course and make
first contact with Earth right here.

288
00:41:19,866 --> 00:41:22,535
- Here?
- Actually, over there.

289
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:28,167
It`s a pivotal moment in human history.
You make contact with an alien race.

290
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,837
After you do,
everything begins to change.

291
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:37,678
Fleets of starships are built
and mankind explores the galaxy.

292
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:44,392
It unites humanity when they realise
they`re not alone in the universe.

293
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:48,898
Poverty, disease and war
will all be gone in 50 years.

294
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:54,863
But unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow, none of it will happen.

295
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:59,117
You people are all astronauts ...

296
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:02,328
... on some kind of star trek.

297
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:06,876
I know this is a lot to take in,
but we`re running out of time.

298
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:12,172
- We need your help.
- What do you say?.

299
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:26,355
Why not?

300
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:30,425
It looks pretty bad, sir.
They control decks 26 up to 1 1 .

301
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:34,888
When they took Deck 1 1 ,
they stopped.

302
00:43:35,138 --> 00:43:39,769
They`ve assimilated half the ship.
Why stop there?

303
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:45,065
- What is on Deck 1 1?
- Hydroponics. Deflector control.

304
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:49,571
They stopped there because
it gave them a tactical advantage.

305
00:43:49,822 --> 00:43:51,240
Return to your checkpoints.

306
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:56,746
What happened in sick bay?.
Where`s Dr Crusher?.

307
00:43:56,996 --> 00:44:00,624
- Why did you break the cease-fire?
- We didn`t attack you.

308
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:10,260
There`s a new faction that
wants to prevent tomorrow`s launch.

309
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:16,141
We`re here to help you.
You are not in Montana anymore.

310
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:21,522
You are on a spaceship
orbiting the Earth.

311
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:26,485
- Get me out of here.
- All right.

312
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:31,367
You want a way out. Here it is.

313
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:37,165
What is this?

314
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:44,172
Australia. New Guinea.
The Solomons.

315
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:50,137
Montana will be up soon,
but it`s a long way down.

316
00:44:50,346 --> 00:44:54,600
I`m not your enemy
and I can get you home.

317
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:58,688
Put the weapon down and trust me.

318
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:09,950
Jean-Luc Picard.
That`s my name, what`s yours?

319
00:45:13,037 --> 00:45:16,875
- Lily.
- Welcome aboard, Lily.

320
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:26,511
Thank you.

321
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,517
Maximum setting. If you`d fired this,
you`d have vaporised me.

322
00:45:34,352 --> 00:45:37,563
It`s my first ray gun.

323
00:45:53,831 --> 00:46:00,964
- There`s no glass.
- Forcefield.

324
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:08,014
- I`ve never seen such technology.
- It hasn`t been invented yet.

325
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:12,727
There`s more I have to tell you.
Come on.

326
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,570
Are you ready?

327
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,865
- Who are you?
- I am the Borg.

328
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:29,663
That is a contradiction. The Borg
have a collective consciousness.

329
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,999
There are no individuals.

330
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:45,013
I am the beginning, the end,
the one who is many.

331
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,198
I am the Borg.

332
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:06,202
Greetings.

333
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:10,039
I am curious,
do you control the Borg collective?

334
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:14,795
You imply disparity where
none exists. I am the collective.

335
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:20,384
I`ll rephrase the question.
I wish to understand their hierarchy.

336
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:23,721
Are you their leader?.

337
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:28,769
I bring order to chaos.

338
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:32,188
A cryptic response.

339
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,359
You are in chaos, Data.

340
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:39,364
You are a machine
who wishes to be human.

341
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:46,246
I am programmed
to evolve and to better myself.

342
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:49,749
We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves.

343
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:52,878
Evolving toward a state of perfection.

344
00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:57,759
Forgive me, but the Borg
do not evolve, they conquer.

345
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:05,558
By assimilating other beings we are
bringing them closer to perfection.

346
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:10,106
Somehow I question your motives.

347
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:17,154
That is because you haven`t
been properly ... stimulated yet.

348
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:28,625
You have reactivated
my emotion chip. Why?.

349
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:34,423
- Don`t be frightened.
- I am not frightened.

350
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:47,730
- Do you know what this is?
- It would appear to be organic skin.

351
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:53,820
What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift.

352
00:49:08,502 --> 00:49:12,048
Was that good for you?

353
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,933
- How big is this Federation?
- Over 150 planets.

354
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:26,313
- They span 8,000 light years.
- You mustn`t get home much.

355
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:32,195
I tend to think of this ship as home.
I get back to Earth whenever I can.

356
00:49:34,197 --> 00:49:39,286
- They haven`t broken the code yet.
- Who? The zombies?

357
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:43,540
- The Borg.
- It sounds Swedish.

358
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:56,263
- How big is this ship?
- 24 decks. 700 metres long.

359
00:49:56,512 --> 00:50:03,771
It took me six months to find enough
titanium just to build a cockpit.

360
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:10,779
How much did this thing cost?

361
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:15,033
The economics of the future
are somewhat different.

362
00:50:15,284 --> 00:50:19,705
Money doesn`t exist
in the 24th century.

363
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:23,459
No money?.
You mean you don`t get paid?

364
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:29,049
The acquisition of wealth is no
longer the driving force in our lives.

365
00:50:29,258 --> 00:50:32,470
We work to better ourselves ...

366
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,847
... and the rest of humanity.

367
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:42,855
Actually, we`re rather like
yourself and Dr Cochrane.

368
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,443
All right!

369
00:50:47,693 --> 00:50:52,158
- Come on.
- Is there another way around?

370
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:57,079
I know what l`m doing.

371
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:08,175
Definitely not Swedish.

372
00:51:39,459 --> 00:51:42,504
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:56,810
Perhaps something in satin.

374
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,993
I`m sorry, but we`re closing,
and we have a strict dress code.

375
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:14,830
If you boys don`t leave ...

376
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:22,005
- I`m looking for Nicky the Nose.
- He hasn`t been here in months.

377
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:28,762
This is the wrong chapter.

378
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:33,851
Computer, begin chapter 13.

379
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:41,609
Try and look
as if you`re having a good time.

380
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:57,753
No, look at me.
Try to act naturally.

381
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:05,928
There he is.

382
00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:20,778
- Ruby, this is not a good time.
- It`s never the time for us, Dix.

383
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:25,450
- Is that a case you`re working on?
- I`ll see you later.

384
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:30,289
Okay, but watch your caboose
and dump the broad.

385
00:53:37,712 --> 00:53:41,300
Look what the cat dragged in.
What`s shakin`, Dix?.

386
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,804
The usual, martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

387
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,313
- I`m going to take that personal.
- No offence.

388
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,148
Hey!

389
00:54:21,052 --> 00:54:24,222
I think you got him.

390
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:32,272
I don`t get it. I thought
you said this was a hologram.

391
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:38,696
I disengaged the safety protocols,
so even a holographic bullet can kill.

392
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:43,911
- What are you doing?
- Looking for the neural processor.

393
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:47,498
It`s like a memory chip.

394
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:52,961
It will contain a record of all the
instructions this Borg has received.

395
00:54:53,254 --> 00:55:00,512
- It`s one of your uniforms.
- Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.

396
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:04,892
Tough luck, huh?

397
00:55:07,395 --> 00:55:10,523
I`ve got to get to the bridge.

398
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,140
- Doctor ...
- Yeah?

399
00:55:41,348 --> 00:55:46,813
- Would you take a look at this?
- Yeah.

400
00:55:47,022 --> 00:55:54,363
I`ve constructed the intermix chamber
from what I remember in school.

401
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:58,326
- You learned about this in school?
- Yeah.

402
00:55:58,534 --> 00:56:05,333
``Basic Warp Design`` is required
reading. You`re the first chapter.

403
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:11,131
Well, it looks like you got it right.

404
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:17,513
This is what we`re using to replace
the damaged plasma conduit.

405
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:31,236
Yes, but you need to reinforce
the tubing with a nano-polymer.

406
00:56:31,485 --> 00:56:36,575
Dr Cochrane, I know this sounds
silly, but can I shake your hand?

407
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:43,040
It`s such an honour to work with you.

408
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:47,587
I never imagined l`d meet
the man who invented warp drive.

409
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:51,216
I`m sorry ... Thanks.

410
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:04,898
- Do they have to keep doing that?
- It`s just a little hero worship.

411
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:09,778
I can`t say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about you.

412
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:14,699
Or, what you`re aboutto do.
I shouldn`t say this, -

413
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:18,287
- but I went
to Zefram Cochrane High School.

414
00:57:18,537 --> 00:57:21,458
Really?.

415
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:30,175
- I wish I had a picture of this.
- What?

416
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:35,347
In the future, this whole area
becomes an historical monument.

417
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:40,561
You`re standing on the exact spot
where your statue is going to be.

418
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:43,066
Statue?

419
00:57:43,315 --> 00:57:48,695
It`s marble, about 20 metres tall.
You`re looking up at the sky.

420
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:53,117
Your hand
is reaching toward the future.

421
00:57:53,368 --> 00:57:56,704
I`ve got to take a leak.

422
00:57:56,954 --> 00:58:01,543
Leak?. I`m not detecting any leak.

423
00:58:01,793 --> 00:58:05,339
Don`t you people
from the 24th century ever pee?

424
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:09,010
Oh, leak! I get it.

425
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:15,224
- That`s pretty funny.
- Excuse me.

426
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:18,395
Commander ...

427
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:30,115
Reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated.

428
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:34,537
I found something you lost.

429
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:41,044
- I am a Klingon.
- Mr Worf, report.

430
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:47,635
The Borg control over half the ship.
There`s no power to the bridge.

431
00:58:47,885 --> 00:58:53,016
I`ve accessed
a Borg neural processor.

432
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:57,980
They`re transforming the deflector
dish into an interplexing beacon -

433
00:58:58,231 --> 00:59:04,154
- to establish a link with the Borg
living in the 21st century.

434
00:59:04,403 --> 00:59:07,657
But the Borg
are still in the Delta Quadrant.

435
00:59:07,906 --> 00:59:14,373
They`ll send reinforcements.
Humanity will be an easy target.

436
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:17,667
We must destroy the deflector dish.

437
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:22,506
We can`t get to deflector control
or a shuttle craft ...

438
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:28,930
Mr Worf, do you remember
your zero-G combat training?

439
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,226
I remember it made me
sick to my stomach.

440
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,982
- What are you suggesting?
- It`s time we took a little stroll.

441
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:48,285
There`s a humanoid life-sign
up ahead.

442
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:51,580
51 1 metres.

443
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:01,757
Cochrane?

444
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,720
It`s him, all right.

445
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:22,988
I`ve re-modulated the weapons,
but the Borg will be quick to adapt.

446
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:26,576
We must make every shot count.

447
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:31,915
Magnetise.

448
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,797
- Watch your caboose, Dix.
- I intend to.

449
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:05,452
- How are you doing, Worf?
- Not well, sir.

450
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:10,457
Try not to look at the stars.
Keep your eyes on the hull.

451
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:17,006
Let`s go.

452
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:44,204
Tell me, are you using
a polymer-based neuro-rely -

453
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:49,875
- to transmit organic nerve impulses
to my positronic net?

454
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:56,549
If so, how have you solved
the problem of signal degradation?

455
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,220
Do you always talk this much?

456
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:03,557
Not always, but often.

457
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:07,895
Why do you insist
on using this primitive language?

458
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:12,108
Your android brain
is capable of much more.

459
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,403
I am trying to become more human.

460
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:22,078
We used to be just like them.
Flawed, weak, organic.

461
01:02:22,285 --> 01:02:28,585
We evolved to include the synthetic.
We use both to attain perfection.

462
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:32,964
Your goal
should be the same as ours.

463
01:02:34,132 --> 01:02:39,889
Believing oneself to be perfect is
often the sign of a delusional mind.

464
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:44,602
A small being, trying to attack
what he doesn`t understand.

465
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:47,981
You have no real interest in me.

466
01:02:48,272 --> 01:02:52,319
Your goal is to obtain
the codes for the computer.

467
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:56,823
That is one of our goals,
one of many.

468
01:02:58,325 --> 01:03:01,829
And to reach it,
l`m willing to help you reach yours.

469
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:30,361
Is it becoming clear to you yet?

470
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:36,616
Look at you, standing there cradling
the new flesh l`ve given you.

471
01:03:36,868 --> 01:03:40,830
If it means nothing to you,
why protect it?

472
01:03:41,038 --> 01:03:45,543
I am simply imitating
the behaviour of humans.

473
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:50,007
You`re becoming more human all the
time. Now you`re learning how to lie.

474
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:57,848
My programming was not designed
to process these sensations.

475
01:03:58,058 --> 01:04:02,186
Then tear away your skin
as you would a defective circuit.

476
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:08,735
Go ahead, Data. We won`t stop you.

477
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:17,537
Do it. Don`t be tempted by flesh.

478
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:33,053
Are you familiar with
physical forms of pleasure?

479
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:40,145
If you are referring to ... sexuality, -

480
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:43,440
- I am fully functional.

481
01:04:44,983 --> 01:04:49,154
Programmed in multiple techniques.

482
01:04:49,446 --> 01:04:52,909
How long has it been
since you`ve used them?

483
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:58,081
8 years, 7 months,
16 days, 4 minutes ...

484
01:04:58,331 --> 01:05:01,501
Far too long.

485
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:34,495
- We should bring reinforcements.
- There`s no time.

486
01:05:34,704 --> 01:05:41,837
They`re building it on top of the particle
emitter. It will soon be activated.

487
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:47,260
- With phasers on full power ...
- The dish is charged with anti-protons.

488
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:52,099
It`d destroy half the ship.
We have to find another way.

489
01:06:12,078 --> 01:06:14,372
Doctor!

490
01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:22,589
- Still looking for the bathroom?
- I`m not going back.

491
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,970
- We can`t do this without you.
- I don`t want to be a statue.

492
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,684
- Stay away from me.
- We don`t have time for this.

493
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:51,663
You told him about the statue?

494
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:58,086
For this to work, all three maglocks
will have to be released.

495
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:11,983
The magnetic restrictors
are disengaged.

496
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:16,404
They`ve adapted.

497
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:18,181
Warning:
Decompression in 45 seconds.

498
01:10:42,332 --> 01:10:45,418
Hawk!

499
01:13:19,252 --> 01:13:22,299
We`ve had a change of plans, Data.

500
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:36,522
Assimilate this.

501
01:14:04,594 --> 01:14:08,932
- An hour to go. How are you?
- I`ve got a hangover.

502
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:14,354
Either from the whisky
or your laser beam ... or both.

503
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:17,275
But l`m ready to make history.

504
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:19,694
Troi to Riker.

505
01:14:19,945 --> 01:14:24,282
We`re ready to open the launch door.

506
01:14:36,337 --> 01:14:41,886
- Look at that.
- Is there no moon in the future?

507
01:14:42,135 --> 01:14:47,809
Sure, but there are
50 million people living on it.

508
01:14:48,058 --> 01:14:54,440
You can even see Tycho City
and Lake Armstrong on a clear day.

509
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:59,362
Please ...
don`t tell me it`s all thanks to me.

510
01:14:59,612 --> 01:15:05,494
I`ve heard enough about
the great Zefram Cochrane.

511
01:15:05,744 --> 01:15:10,416
You people have got some
pretty funny ideas about me.

512
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:14,713
You all look at me
as if l`m a saint or a visionary.

513
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:21,344
You`re no saint, but you did
have a vision. We`re sitting in it.

514
01:15:21,596 --> 01:15:28,185
You want to know what my vision is?
Dollar signs! Money!

515
01:15:28,436 --> 01:15:33,358
I didn`t build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity.

516
01:15:33,608 --> 01:15:38,446
You think I want to go to the stars?
I don`t even like to fly. I take trains.

517
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:44,871
I built this ship so that I could
retire to some tropical island, -

518
01:15:45,162 --> 01:15:48,624
- filled with naked women.

519
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:53,380
That`s Zefram Cochrane.
That`s his vision.

520
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:58,802
This historical figure
you keep talking about ...

521
01:15:59,052 --> 01:16:04,350
I never met him.
I can`t imagine I ever will.

522
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:09,397
Someone once said: ``Don`t try
to be a great man, just be a man.``

523
01:16:09,688 --> 01:16:15,528
- ``Let history be the judge.``
- Rhetorical nonsense.

524
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:20,826
- Who said that?
- You did, ten years from now.

525
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,537
You`ve got 58 minutes, Doc.
Get on the checklist.

526
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:32,131
They`re on the move again.
They`ve taken decks 5 and 6.

527
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:39,805
- They`ve adapted to our weapons.
- We`ll have to further modify them.

528
01:16:40,056 --> 01:16:44,019
In the meantime,
tell your men to stand their ground.

529
01:16:44,269 --> 01:16:49,190
- Fight hand-to-hand if they have to.
- Aye, sir.

530
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:55,323
Wait.
Captain, our weapons are useless.

531
01:16:55,573 --> 01:17:00,787
We must activate the auto-destruct
and evacuate the ship.

532
01:17:01,037 --> 01:17:04,957
If we destroy the ship,
we destroy the Borg.

533
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:09,672
- We`re going to stay and fight.
- We have lost the Enterprise.

534
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:14,051
We have not lost the Enterprise
and we are not going to.

535
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,223
- Not while l`m in command.
- I must object ...

536
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:22,143
- Your objection is noted.
- With all due respect ...

537
01:17:22,435 --> 01:17:26,858
You`re allowing personal experience
to influence yourjudgement.

538
01:17:29,276 --> 01:17:31,820
You`re afraid.

539
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:37,411
You want to destroy the ship
and run away. You coward.

540
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,789
If you were any other man,
I would kill you where you stand.

541
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:45,502
Get off my bridge.

542
01:17:58,182 --> 01:18:01,186
- What now?.
- Carry out his orders.

543
01:18:01,437 --> 01:18:05,232
Dyson, Kaplan,
modify the weapons system.

544
01:18:05,524 --> 01:18:10,571
- We should get off this ship.
- The captain has made up his mind.

545
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:18,747
- You son of a bitch!
- This isn`t the time.

546
01:18:19,038 --> 01:18:24,921
I know nothing about the future,
but everyone thinks this is suicide.

547
01:18:25,212 --> 01:18:29,967
- They`re just afraid to say it.
- The crew will follow my orders.

548
01:18:30,259 --> 01:18:36,392
- Even if they don`t make sense?
- They don`t know the Borg as I do.

549
01:18:36,684 --> 01:18:42,230
- No one does. No one can.
- What is that supposed to mean?

550
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:52,742
Six years ago, they assimilated me
into their collective.

551
01:18:53,911 --> 01:18:58,039
I had the cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body.

552
01:18:58,249 --> 01:19:04,631
I was linked to the hive,
every trace of individuality erased.

553
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,507
I was one of them.

554
01:19:07,759 --> 01:19:13,306
I have a unique perspective on Borg
and I know how to fight them.

555
01:19:13,598 --> 01:19:17,521
If you will excuse me,
I have work to do.

556
01:19:17,812 --> 01:19:24,986
I am such an idiot ...
It`s so simple.

557
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:29,323
The Borg hurt you, and now
you`re going to hurt them back.

558
01:19:29,617 --> 01:19:33,913
In my century we have
a higher sensibility than revenge.

559
01:19:34,162 --> 01:19:38,209
Bullshit! I saw the look on your
face when we were on the Holodeck.

560
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:45,007
- You were enjoying it.
- How dare you!

561
01:19:45,217 --> 01:19:51,098
You`re not the first man to get
a thrill from murdering someone.

562
01:19:51,348 --> 01:19:54,393
- Get out!
- Or what? You`ll kill me?

563
01:19:54,685 --> 01:19:59,232
- Like you killed Ensign Lynch?
- There was no way to save him.

564
01:19:59,523 --> 01:20:04,403
- Where was your sensibility then?
- I don`t have time for this.

565
01:20:04,696 --> 01:20:07,865
I didn`t mean to interrupt your quest.

566
01:20:08,116 --> 01:20:12,371
Capt Ahab has to go hunt his whale.

567
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:17,543
- What?
- You do have books in the future?

568
01:20:19,169 --> 01:20:22,715
This is about saving humanity.

569
01:20:22,967 --> 01:20:27,596
- Blow up the damn ship!
- No!

570
01:20:41,361 --> 01:20:44,573
I will not sacrifice the Enterprise.

571
01:20:44,782 --> 01:20:49,203
We`ve made
too many compromises already.

572
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:53,999
They invade our space,
and we fall back.

573
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:58,129
They assimilate entire worlds,
and we fall back.

574
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:03,468
Not again. The line must be drawn here.
This far and no further.

575
01:21:05,095 --> 01:21:10,476
And I will make them pay
for what they`ve done.

576
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:39,424
You broke your little ships.

577
01:21:49,185 --> 01:21:52,105
See you around, Ahab.

578
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:57,861
``And he piled upon
the whale`s white hump -

579
01:21:58,153 --> 01:22:03,033
- a sum of all the rage and hate
felt by his whole race.``

580
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:08,540
``lf his chest had been a cannon, he
would have shot his heart upon it.``

581
01:22:08,789 --> 01:22:11,710
What?

582
01:22:13,378 --> 01:22:18,717
- ``Moby Dick`.
- Actually, I never read it.

583
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:30,105
Ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him.

584
01:22:30,355 --> 01:22:37,696
A quest for vengeance.
But in the end it destroyed him -

585
01:22:37,947 --> 01:22:40,991
- and his ship.

586
01:22:42,368 --> 01:22:45,163
I guess he didn`t know when to quit.

587
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:12,108
Prepare to evacuate the Enterprise.

588
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,137
- ATR setting?
- Active.

589
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:43,184
Main bus.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.

590
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:48,273
Begin auto-destruct sequence.
Authorisation: Picard 47-AT.

591
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:54,530
Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Crusher 22-BC.

592
01:23:54,739 --> 01:24:01,787
Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Authorisation: Worf 37-GE.

593
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:07,044
Command authorisation accepted.
Awaiting final code.

594
01:24:07,294 --> 01:24:13,092
Destruct sequence A-1 .
15 minutes silent countdown.

595
01:24:16,638 --> 01:24:20,767
- Enable.
- Self-destructin 15 minutes.

596
01:24:21,016 --> 01:24:23,896
There willbe no audio warning.

597
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:29,819
- So much for the Enterprise E.
- We barely knew her.

598
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:33,030
Do you think they`ll build a new one?

599
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:37,369
There are plenty of letters left
in the alphabet.

600
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:40,163
Mr Worf ...

601
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:49,090
- I regret some of the things I said.
- Some?

602
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:55,638
As a matter of fact, I think you`re
the bravest man l`ve ever known.

603
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:00,810
Thank you, sir.

604
01:25:01,018 --> 01:25:04,356
See you on Gravett lsland.

605
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:30,885
Captain.

606
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:36,099
Data.

607
01:25:38,728 --> 01:25:41,564
Control to Phoenix,
final launch checks are complete.

608
01:25:41,856 --> 01:25:45,527
- Good luck.
- Everybody ready to make history?.

609
01:25:45,776 --> 01:25:51,616
I think I forgot something.
It`s probably nothing.

610
01:25:51,908 --> 01:25:55,286
Begin ignition sequence.

611
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:04,422
God! Now I remember!
Where is it?

612
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:10,136
We can`t lift off without it.
No, wait. I`ve found it.

613
01:26:11,179 --> 01:26:14,432
Ten, nine, eight ...

614
01:26:14,725 --> 01:26:18,186
Let`s rock `n` roll!

615
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:51,224
Can you turn that down a little?

616
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:56,313
We`ve got a red light
on the second intake valve.

617
01:27:00,483 --> 01:27:05,321
Ignore it. We`ll be fine.

618
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:08,576
Shutdown and separation
on my mark.

619
01:27:08,867 --> 01:27:13,414
Three, two, one ... mark.

620
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:32,727
Let`s bring the warp core on line.

621
01:27:37,273 --> 01:27:41,445
- Wow!
- You ain`t seen nothing yet.

622
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:47,743
If you see any of my crew,
give them this.

623
01:27:48,035 --> 01:27:52,915
Orders to live a quite corner of America
and stay out of history`s way.

624
01:27:53,082 --> 01:27:57,921
- Good luck.
- To both of us.

625
01:28:01,634 --> 01:28:05,180
You`re not leaving, are you?

626
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:10,309
When I was captured, my crew
risked everything to save me.

627
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:17,193
There is someone still on this ship,
and I owe him the same.

628
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:25,576
Go and find your friend.

629
01:29:56,300 --> 01:30:00,305
What`s wrong, Locutus?
lsn`t this familiar?.

630
01:30:00,555 --> 01:30:04,517
Organic minds
are such fragile things.

631
01:30:04,768 --> 01:30:09,691
How could you forget me so quickly?.
We were very close, you and l.

632
01:30:11,316 --> 01:30:14,528
You can still hear our song.

633
01:30:14,779 --> 01:30:19,951
Yes ... I remember you.

634
01:30:20,201 --> 01:30:24,080
You were there all the time.

635
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:30,212
But that ship and all the Borg on it
were destroyed.

636
01:30:30,463 --> 01:30:34,259
You think in such
three-dimensional terms.

637
01:30:34,508 --> 01:30:38,304
How small you`ve become.
Data understands me.

638
01:30:40,307 --> 01:30:47,481
- Don`t you, Data?
- What have you done to him?

639
01:30:47,732 --> 01:30:52,445
Given him what he always wanted,
flesh and blood.

640
01:30:52,694 --> 01:30:57,075
Let him go.
He`s not the one you want.

641
01:30:57,326 --> 01:31:03,957
- Are you offering yourself to us?
- Offering myself?

642
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:09,589
That`s it! I remember now.

643
01:31:09,838 --> 01:31:13,802
It wasn`t enough
that you assimilated me.

644
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:19,766
I had to give myself freely
to the Borg ... to you.

645
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:24,520
I`ve overseen the assimilation
of millions. You were no different.

646
01:31:24,814 --> 01:31:28,943
You`re lying. You wanted more
than just another Borg drone.

647
01:31:29,193 --> 01:31:35,033
You wanted a human being, a bridge
between humanity and the Borg.

648
01:31:35,283 --> 01:31:39,705
You wanted a counterpart,
but I resisted. I fought you.

649
01:31:39,955 --> 01:31:43,583
You can`t begin to imagine
the life you denied yourself.

650
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:51,593
It`s not too late.

651
01:31:53,386 --> 01:31:57,808
Locutus could still be with you,
just in the way you wanted.

652
01:31:58,058 --> 01:32:00,728
An equal.

653
01:32:00,978 --> 01:32:05,274
Let Data go, and
I will take my place at your side, -

654
01:32:05,524 --> 01:32:09,279
- willingly, without resistance.

655
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:12,824
Such a noble creature.

656
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:16,746
A quality we sometimes lack.

657
01:32:16,996 --> 01:32:21,500
We will add your distinctiveness
to our own.

658
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:25,255
Welcome home, Locutus.

659
01:32:30,886 --> 01:32:34,597
Data, you are free to go.

660
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:37,977
- Data, go.
- No.

661
01:32:40,562 --> 01:32:46,528
- I do not wish to go.
- I have already found an equal.

662
01:32:46,777 --> 01:32:50,700
Data, deactivate
the self-destruct sequence.

663
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:55,454
Data, no! Don`t do it!

664
01:32:56,538 --> 01:32:59,541
Data, listen to me ...

665
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:03,630
Auto-destruct deactivated.

666
01:33:06,549 --> 01:33:11,598
Now enter the encryption codes
and give me computer control.

667
01:33:11,889 --> 01:33:14,349
Data!

668
01:33:16,018 --> 01:33:19,021
Data ...

669
01:33:27,114 --> 01:33:30,158
He will make an excellent drone.

670
01:33:38,126 --> 01:33:44,258
Plasma injectors on-line. Everything
is looking good. I think we`re ready.

671
01:33:44,507 --> 01:33:50,181
We must break the warp barrier in the
next five minutes to get their attention.

672
01:33:50,431 --> 01:33:54,811
- Main cells are charged and ready.
- Let`s do it.

673
01:33:55,061 --> 01:33:57,939
Engage.

674
01:34:06,156 --> 01:34:11,537
Warp field is looking good.
Structural integrity is holding.

675
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:16,793
Speed:
20,000 kilometres per second.

676
01:34:19,838 --> 01:34:21,840
Sweet Jesus!

677
01:34:25,011 --> 01:34:28,848
Relax, they`re just here
to give us a send off.

678
01:34:33,269 --> 01:34:36,690
I am bringing
the external sensors on-line.

679
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:46,868
30 seconds to warp threshold.

680
01:34:56,462 --> 01:35:01,133
- Approaching light speed.
- We`re at critical velocity.

681
01:35:01,383 --> 01:35:04,428
- Quantum torpedoes locked.
- Destroy them.

682
01:35:12,604 --> 01:35:15,899
Watch your future`s end.

683
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:37,923
- Data!
- Resistance is futile.

684
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:07,896
That should be enough.
Take us out of warp.

685
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:25,249
- Is that Earth?
- That`s it.

686
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:28,795
- It`s so small.
- It`s about to get a whole lot bigger.

687
01:38:52,469 --> 01:38:57,892
- Captain.
- Data, are you all right?

688
01:38:58,183 --> 01:39:05,525
I would imagine
I look worse than I ... feel.

689
01:39:11,824 --> 01:39:14,535
Strange ...

690
01:39:14,784 --> 01:39:18,914
Part of me is sorry she is dead.

691
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:24,545
She was unique.

692
01:39:24,795 --> 01:39:29,844
She brought me closer to humanity
than I ever thought possible.

693
01:39:30,094 --> 01:39:34,555
And for a time,
I was tempted by her offer.

694
01:39:36,808 --> 01:39:40,981
How long a time?

695
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:45,110
0.68 seconds, sir.

696
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:50,491
For an android,
that is nearly an eternity.

697
01:40:03,129 --> 01:40:07,217
Captain`s log, April 5th, 2063.

698
01:40:07,467 --> 01:40:11,763
The voyage ofthe Phoenix
was a success ... again.

699
01:40:12,013 --> 01:40:14,935
The warp flight was detected, -

700
01:40:15,226 --> 01:40:20,315
- and the alien ship is on its way
to rendezvous with history.

701
01:41:31,726 --> 01:41:35,814
My God!
They`re really from another world.

702
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:41,278
And they`re going to want to meet
the man who flew that warp ship.

703
01:42:30,957 --> 01:42:33,501
Live long and prosper.

704
01:42:54,484 --> 01:42:57,945
Thanks.

705
01:43:00,616 --> 01:43:04,828
I think it`s time
we made a discreet exit.

706
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,790
Stand by to beam us up.

707
01:43:15,464 --> 01:43:18,802
You`ve got to go.

708
01:43:21,304 --> 01:43:25,809
I envy you.
The world you`re going to.

709
01:43:27,477 --> 01:43:33,317
I envy you. Taking these first steps
into a new frontier.

710
01:43:35,694 --> 01:43:39,199
I shall miss you, Lily.

711
01:43:52,838 --> 01:43:56,342
Picard to Enterprise, energise.

712
01:44:04,184 --> 01:44:09,148
The moon obscured our presence.
The Vulcans did not detect us.

713
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:14,363
I`ve reconfigured the chronometric
readings from the Borg sphere.

714
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:18,241
- All decks report ready.
- Helm standing by.

715
01:44:18,533 --> 01:44:24,081
Lay in a course for the 24th century.
Our future is waiting for us.

716
01:44:24,373 --> 01:44:29,754
- Course laid in, sir.
- Make it so.
