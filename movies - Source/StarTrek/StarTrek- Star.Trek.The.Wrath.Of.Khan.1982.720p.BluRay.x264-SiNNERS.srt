1
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:05,268
Captain's Log, Stardate 8130.3.

2
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,896
Starship Enterprise on training mission
to Gamma Hydra,

3
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:14,318
Section 14, coordinates 22-87-4.

4
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,030
Approaching Neutral Zone.
All systems normal

5
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,660
-and functioning.
-Leaving Section 14 for Section 15.

6
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,623
Stand by. Project parabolic course
to avoid entering Neutral Zone.

7
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,166
Aye, Captain.

8
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,004
Course change projected.

9
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,715
Captain, I'm getting something
on the distress channel.

10
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,008
On speakers.

11
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,721
Imperative! This is the Kobayashi Maru,
19 periods out of Altair VI.

12
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,224
We have struck a gravitic mine
and have lost all power.

13
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,894
Our hull is penetrated and we have
sustained many causalities...

14
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,480
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Your message is breaking up.

15
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,734
Can you give us your coordinates?
Repeat, this is the Starship...

16
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,112
Enterprise, our position
is Gamma Hydra, Section 10.

17
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,573
In the Neutral Zone.

18
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,242
Hull penetrated,
life support systems failing.

19
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,119
Can you assist us, Enterprise?

20
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,413
-Can you assist us?
-Data on Kobayashi Maru.

21
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,124
Subject vessel is
third class neutronic fuel carrier,

22
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,960
crew of 81,300 passengers.

23
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,838
Damn.

24
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,426
Mr. Sulu? Plot an intercept course.

25
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,181
May I remind the Captain
that if a starship enters the Zone...

26
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,059
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.

27
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,983
Estimating two minutes to intercept.

28
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,781
Now entering the Neutral Zone.

29
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,991
Warning.
We have entered Neutral Zone.

30
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,869
We are now
in violation of treaty, Captain.

31
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,164
Stand by, Transporter Room,
ready to beam survivors aboard.

32
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,583
Captain! I've lost their signal.

33
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:57,838
Alert. Sensors indicate three
Klingon cruisers, bearing 3-1-6 mark 4.

34
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,799
-Closing fast.
-Visual.

35
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,053
Battle stations. Activate shields.

36
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,305
Shields activated.

37
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,182
Inform the Klingons
we are on a rescue mission.

38
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,059
They're jamming
all the frequencies, Captain.

39
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,770
Klingons on attack course and closing.

40
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,481
We're over our heads.
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.

41
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,233
I'll try, Captain.

42
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,277
Alert. Klingon torpedoes activated.

43
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,238
-Alert.
-Evasive action!

44
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,413
-Engineering, damage report.
-Main energizer hit, Captain.

45
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,582
Engage auxiliary power.
Prepare to return fire.

46
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,879
Shields collapsing, Captain.

47
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,970
-Fire all phasers.
-No power to the weapons, Captain.

48
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,602
Captain, it's no use.
We're dead in space.

49
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,442
Activate escape pods. Send out
the log buoy. All hands abandon ship.

50
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,112
-Repeat, all hands abandon ship.
-All right. Open her up.

51
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,332
-Any suggestions, Admiral?
-Prayer, Mr. Saavik.

52
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,835
The Klingons don't take prisoners.

53
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,296
Lights.

54
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,298
Motors on.

55
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,427
Captain?

56
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,226
Trainees, to the briefing room.

57
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,938
Maintenance crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

58
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,484
Maintenance crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

59
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,279
-"Physician, heal thyself."
-Is that all you've got to say?

60
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,657
-What about my performance?
-I'm not a drama critic.

61
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,079
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you gonna stay
with the sinking ship?

62
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,624
-Permission to speak candidly, sir?
-Granted.

63
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,668
I don't believe this was a fair test
of my command abilities.

64
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,838
-And why not?
-Because there was no way to win.

65
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,759
A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face.

66
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,262
-Has that never occurred to you?
-No, sir. It has not.

67
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,017
How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with life,

68
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,727
wouldn't you say?

69
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,314
As I indicated, Admiral,
that thought had not occurred to me.

70
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,691
Well, now you have something new
to think about. Carry on.

71
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,528
Engineering cadets,
assemble on C-Level.

72
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,988
Admiral.

73
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,784
Wouldn't it be easier to just put
an experienced crew back on the ship?

74
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,539
Galloping around the cosmos
is a game for the young, Doctor.

75
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,874
Now, what is that supposed to mean?

76
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,466
Aren't you dead?

77
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,846
I assume you're loitering around here

78
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,557
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets?

79
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,767
I am understandably curious.

80
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,604
They destroyed the Simulator Room
and you with it.

81
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,649
The Kobayashi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc

82
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,901
with students and equipment.

83
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,405
As I recall,
you took the test three times yourself.

84
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,908
Your final solution was,
shall we say, unique.

85
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,161
It had the virtue
of never having been tried.

86
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,498
By the way, thank you for this.

87
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,418
I know of your fondness for antiques.

88
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,339
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times..."

89
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,093
-Message, Spock?
-None that I'm conscious of.

90
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,556
Except, of course, happy birthday.
Surely the best of times.

91
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,060
Captain Spock, Captain Spock,
space shuttle leaving in 15 minutes.

92
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,314
-Where are you off to now?
-The Enterprise.

93
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,734
I must check in before your inspection.
And you?

94
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,112
Home.

95
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,714
Why, bless me, Doctor.

96
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,716
What beams you
into this neck of the woods?

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,177
Beware Romulans bearing gifts.

98
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,307
-Happy birthday, Jim.
-Thanks.

99
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,356
Romulan ale.
Why, Bones, you know this is illegal.

100
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,900
I only use it for medicinal purposes.

101
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,402
I got a border ship that brings me in
a case every now and then

102
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,196
across the Neutral Zone.

103
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,865
-Now, don't be a prig.
-2283.

104
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,202
Yeah, well,
it takes this stuff a while to ferment.

105
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,956
Here, give me. Now, you open this one.

106
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,126
I'm almost afraid to. What is it?

107
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,754
Klingon aphrodisiacs?

108
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:54,718
-No.
-Bones, this is charming.

109
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,306
For most patients your age,
I usually recommend Retinax V.

110
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,726
-I'm allergic to Retinax.
-Exactly. Cheers.

111
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,395
Cheers.

112
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,364
Happy birthday.

113
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,620
-I don't know what to say.
-Well, you could say thank you.

114
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,038
Thank you.

115
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,880
Damn it, Jim,
what the hell's the matter with you?

116
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,132
Other people have birthdays.

117
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,633
Why are we treating yours
like a funeral?

118
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,679
-Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
-What the hell do you want?

119
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,395
This is not about age and you know it.

120
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,606
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console

121
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,650
when you want to be out there
hopping galaxies.

122
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,027
Spare me your notions of poetry,
please.

123
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,821
-We all have our assigned duties.
-Bull!

124
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,909
You're hiding,
hiding behind rules and regulations.

125
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,039
-Who am I hiding from?
-From yourself, Admiral.

126
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,923
Don't mince words, Bones.
What do you really think?

127
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,350
Jim, I'm your doctor and I'm your friend.

128
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,770
Get back your command.

129
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:32,358
Get it back before
you turn into part of this collection.

130
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,944
Before you really do grow old.

131
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,340
Starship Log, Stardate 8130.4.

132
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,843
Log entry by First Officer Pavel Chekov.

133
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,514
Starship Reliant
on orbital approach to Ceti Alpha VI

134
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,100
in connection with Project Genesis.

135
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,685
We are continuing our search
for a lifeless planet

136
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,896
to satisfy the requirement of a test site

137
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,566
for the Genesis experiment.
So far, no success.

138
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,402
Standard orbit, please.

139
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,488
Mr. Beach, any change
in the surface scan?

140
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:24,827
Negative. Limited atmosphere
dominated by craylon gas, sand,

141
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,455
high-velocity winds.
Incapable of supporting life forms.

142
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,626
Does it have to be completely lifeless?

143
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,837
Don't tell me you found something.

144
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,425
We've picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dynoscanner.

145
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,137
Damn. Are you sure?
Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment.

146
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:49,518
I suppose it could be a particle of
preanimate matter caught in the matrix.

147
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,022
All right.
Get on the comm-pic to Dr Marcus.

148
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,190
Aye, sir.

149
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,027
Maybe it's something we can transplant.

150
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,196
You know what she'll say.

151
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,450
Let me get this straight.
Something you can transplant?

152
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,993
Yes, Doctor.

153
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,912
Something you can transplant?

154
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,541
I don't know.

155
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,878
But it may only be a particle
of preanimate matter.

156
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:20,591
Then again, it may not.
You boys have to be clear on this.

157
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,136
There can't be so much as a microbe,
or the show's off.

158
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:25,888
Why don't you have a look?

159
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,639
But if it is something
that can be moved, I want...

160
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,184
You bet, Doctor. We're on our way.

161
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,816
Well, don't have kittens,
Genesis is going to work.

162
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,361
They'll remember you in one breath
with Newton, Einstein, Surak!

163
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,281
Thanks a lot.
No respect from my offspring.

164
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,408
Par for the course.

165
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,535
Are you teaming up with me
for bridge after dinner?

166
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,954
Maybe. What is it?

167
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,127
Every time we have dealings
with Starfleet, I get nervous.

168
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,549
We are dealing with something
that could be perverted

169
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,343
into a dreadful weapon.

170
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,680
Remember that overgrown Boy Scout
you used to hang around with?

171
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,058
-That's exactly the kind of man...
-Listen, kiddo.

172
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,437
Jim Kirk was many things,
but he was never a Boy Scout.

173
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,775
Captain Terrell, stand by to beam down.

174
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,293
Chekov, are you sure
these are the correct coordinates?

175
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,048
Captain, this is the garden spot
of Ceti Alpha VI.

176
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,510
I can barely see it.

177
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,816
There's nothing here.
The tricorder must be broken.

178
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,498
Chekov, over here.

179
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,967
Those look like cargo carriers.

180
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,353
Hey, give me a hand.

181
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,395
What the hell happened?

182
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,565
If they crashed,
then where's the rest of the ship?

183
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,413
What the hell is that?

184
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,762
Botany Bay.

185
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,848
Botany Bay?

186
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,685
Oh, no!

187
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,522
We've got to get out of here now. Damn.

188
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,692
-What about the tricorder.
-Hurry. Never mind that. Hurry. Hurry!

189
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:10,278
Chekov, what's the matter with you?
Chekov!

190
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,281
Come on! Hurry!

191
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,299
Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell.

192
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,970
This is Commander Kyle.
Will you please respond, Captain?

193
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,890
Captain Terrell. Respond, please.

194
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,940
Let's give them a little more time.

195
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,850
Khan.

196
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,825
I don't know you.

197
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,876
But you...

198
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,379
I never forget a face.

199
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,343
Mr. Chekov,

200
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,721
isn't it?

201
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,435
I never thought to see your face again.

202
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,605
-Chekov, who is this man?
-A criminal, Captain.

203
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,442
A product of late 20th century
genetic engineering.

204
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,986
What do you want with us?
Sir, I demand to be...

205
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,031
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

206
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,789
I, on the other hand,
am in a position to grant nothing.

207
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,044
What you see is all that remains
of the ship's company and crew

208
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,129
of the Botany Bay,

209
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:39,261
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

210
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,056
-Listen to me. You men and women...
-Captain, Captain, Captain.

211
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,354
Save your strength, Captain.

212
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,524
These people have sworn

213
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:57,153
to live and die at my command
200 years before you were born.

214
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,700
Do you mean he never told you the tale?

215
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,829
To amuse your captain? No?

216
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,960
Never told you how the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay,

217
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,130
lost in space from the year 1996,

218
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,259
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?

219
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,262
-I've never even met Admiral Kirk.
-Admiral?

220
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,472
Admiral.

221
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,183
Admiral.

222
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,233
Never told you how Admiral Kirk

223
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,531
sent 70 of us into exile
on this barren sand heap,

224
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:46,369
with only the contents
of these cargo bays to sustain us?

225
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,956
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life!

226
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,335
-A fair chance.
-This is Ceti Alpha V.

227
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:08,516
Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months
after we were left here.

228
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:14,189
The shock shifted the orbit of this planet
and everything was laid waste.

229
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:20,362
Admiral Kirk never bothered
to check on our progress.

230
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:29,037
It was only the fact
of my genetically engineered intellect

231
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,706
that allowed us to survive.

232
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,712
On Earth,

233
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,883
two hundred years ago,

234
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,428
I was a prince

235
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,891
with power over millions.

236
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,560
Captain Kirk was your host.

237
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:57,399
You repaid his hospitality by trying
to steal his ship and murder him.

238
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:15,542
You didn't expect to find me.
You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.

239
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,757
Why are you here?

240
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,518
Why?

241
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,154
Allow me to introduce you
to Ceti Alpha V's

242
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:48,450
only remaining indigenous life form.

243
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,130
What do you think?

244
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,966
They killed 20 of my people,

245
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,013
including my beloved wife.

246
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,572
Not all at once

247
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,954
and not instantly, to be sure.

248
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,513
You see, their young
enter through the ears

249
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,101
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

250
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,728
This has the effect
of rendering the victim

251
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,357
extremely susceptible to suggestion.

252
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,029
Later, as they grow,

253
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:15,161
follows madness and death.

254
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,672
Khan, listen to me.

255
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,384
These are pets, of course.

256
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,682
Not quite domesticated.

257
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,103
Khan,
Captain Kirk was only doing his duty.

258
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,605
No!

259
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,593
That's better.

260
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,432
Now, tell me, why are you here?

261
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:23,897
And tell me
where I may find James Kirk.

262
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,569
Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's shuttle.

263
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,281
You're cleared for docking.
Approach portside torpedo bay.

264
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,829
Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's party
on final approach.

265
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,832
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

266
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,182
I hate inspections.

267
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,437
I'm delighted.
Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.

268
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,283
Well, I, for one, am glad to have you
at the helm for three weeks.

269
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,077
I don't think these kids can steer.

270
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,929
Open the airlock.

271
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,599
-Permission to come aboard, Captain.
-Welcome, Admiral.

272
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:45,603
I think you know my training crew.
Certainly they have come to know you.

273
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,773
Yes. We've been through
death and life together.

274
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,614
Mr. Scott, you old space dog.
You're well?

275
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:00,076
I had a wee bout, sir,
but Dr McCoy pulled me through.

276
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,829
-A wee bout of what?
-Shore leave, Admiral.

277
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,163
Oh, yes.

278
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,418
And who do we have here?

279
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,879
Midshipman, first class,
Peter Preston, engineer's mate, sir!

280
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,506
First training voyage, Mr. Preston?

281
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,217
-Yes, sir!
-I see.

282
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,763
Well, shall we start
with the Engine Room?

283
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,141
We'll see you there, sir.
And everything is in order.

284
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,560
That'll be a pleasant surprise, Mr. Scott.

285
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:30,898
I'll see you on the Bridge, Admiral.
Company dismissed.

286
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:28,122
Well, Mr. Scott, are your cadets capable
of handling a minor training cruise?

287
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,834
-Give the word, Admiral.
-Mr. Scott, the word is given.

288
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,086
Aye, sir.

289
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,255
Admiral, what about
the rest of the inspection?

290
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,399
This is Starfleet Operations.
Enterprise is clear for departure.

291
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,359
Admiral on the Bridge.

292
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,862
-Pre-stage flux chillers, port.
-On.

293
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,074
-Pre-stage flux chillers, starboard.
-On.

294
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,243
Main stage flux chillers, port.

295
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,369
-Enabled.
-Running lights on.

296
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,038
-Main stage flux chillers, starboard.
-Enabled.

297
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,669
Very well, Mr. Saavik.
You may clear all moorings.

298
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,003
Aye, sir.

299
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,676
-All moorings are clear, Captain.
-Thank you.

300
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,597
Lieutenant?

301
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:31,352
Have you ever piloted a starship
out of space dock?

302
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,812
Never, sir.

303
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,116
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

304
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,953
Aye, sir.

305
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,298
For everything,
there is a first time, Lieutenant.

306
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,717
Don't you agree, Admiral?

307
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,761
-Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
-Aft thrusters.

308
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,684
-Would you like a tranquillizer?
-Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

309
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,769
Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

310
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,425
We are free and clear to navigate.

311
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,135
Course heading, Captain?

312
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:35,935
-Captain's discretion.
-Mr. Sulu, you may indulge yourself.

313
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,063
Aye, sir.

314
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,757
Does that about do it?

315
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,384
I don't think
there's another piece of information

316
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,095
we could squeeze
into the memory banks.

317
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,599
-Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
-Who'd wanna build it?

318
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,352
Dr Marcus? Comm-pic coming in
on hyperchannel.

319
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,815
-It's the Starship Reliant.
-On the screen, please, Jedda.

320
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,236
Come in, please.
This is the Reliant calling Regula I.

321
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,699
Repeat, this is U.S.S. Reliant.

322
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,329
Commander, we are receiving.
This is Regula I. Go ahead.

323
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,209
Dr Marcus. Good. We're en route to you
and should be there in three days.

324
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,964
En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months.

325
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,176
-Has something happened?
-Nothing has happened.

326
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,511
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

327
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:57,266
-Then I don't understand why you...
-We have received new orders.

328
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,560
Upon our arrival at Regula I,

329
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,773
all materials of Project Genesis
will be transferred to this ship

330
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,275
for immediate testing on Ceti Alpha VI.

331
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,861
-Who in the hell do they think they are?
-Please be quiet.

332
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,031
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

333
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,535
-I have my orders.
-Pin him down, Mother.

334
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,954
Who gave the order?

335
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,624
The order comes from

336
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,337
Admiral James T. Kirk.

337
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,674
I knew it! I knew it!
All along, the military's wanted to get...

338
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,426
This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov.

339
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,764
I have no intention of allowing Reliant
or any other unauthorized personnel

340
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,183
access to our work or materials.

341
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:44,355
I'm sorry that you feel that way, Doctor.
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.

342
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,860
Please prepare to deliver Genesis
to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

343
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,241
Well done, Commander.

344
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,163
You realize, sir, they will attempt
to contact Admiral Kirk

345
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,124
and confirm the order.

346
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,430
Hold, please.

347
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,101
Thank you, sir.

348
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,065
Lieutenant, are you wearing
your hair differently?

349
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,443
It's still regulation, Admiral.

350
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,739
May I speak, sir?

351
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,536
Self-expression doesn't seem
to be one of your problems.

352
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,043
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

353
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,754
I failed to resolve the situation.

354
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,798
There's no correct resolution.
It's a test of character.

355
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,343
May I ask how you dealt with the test?

356
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,514
You may ask.

357
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,186
That's a little joke.

358
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,355
Humor. It is a difficult concept.

359
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,984
It is not logical.

360
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,029
We learn by doing.

361
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,323
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

362
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,949
Thank you, sir.

363
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,162
-Did she change her hairstyle?
-I hadn't noticed.

364
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,248
Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale.

365
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,543
-Admiral Kirk?
-Kirk here.

366
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,130
I have an urgent comm-pic from
Space Lab Regula I for you, sir.

367
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,840
Dr Carol Marcus.

368
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,805
-I'll take it in my quarters, Uhura.
-Aye, sir.

369
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,015
It never rains, but it pours.

370
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,310
As a physician,
you of all people should appreciate

371
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,854
the dangers of re-opening old wounds.

372
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,776
Sorry.

373
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Jim, can you read me?

374
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,405
I can hear you, Carol. What's wrong?
What's the matter?

375
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,951
Why are you taking Genesis
away from us?

376
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,120
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

377
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,997
Who is taking Genesis?

378
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,917
-I can see you, but I can't hear.
-Carol...

379
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,503
Jim, did you give the order?

380
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,840
What order? Who's taking Genesis?

381
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,049
Please help us, Jim.

382
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,052
I will not let them have Genesis
without proper authorization!

383
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,973
-Have Genesis? Who's taking...
-On whose authority can they do this?

384
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,101
-No one's authority!
-Jim, please...

385
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,185
Uhura, what's happening?

386
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,938
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.

387
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,610
-Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
-Aye, sir.

388
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,446
I want to talk to Starfleet Command.

389
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:44,159
Quiet. We must have order in here.
This has to be some sort of mistake.

390
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,454
Mistake! We're all alone here.

391
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,583
They waited until everyone was on leave
to do this.

392
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,627
Reliant is supposed to be
at our disposal, not vice-versa.

393
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,045
It seems clear
Starfleet never intended...

394
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,881
-I know that, but...
-David, you were right.

395
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,716
I tried to tell you before.

396
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,302
Scientists have always been pawns
of the military.

397
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,053
Starfleet has kept the peace
for 100 years.

398
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:07,391
I cannot and will not subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

399
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,853
You may be right, Doctor.
But what about Reliant?

400
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,980
She's on her way.

401
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,993
We have a problem.

402
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,455
Something may be wrong on Regula I.
We've been ordered to investigate.

403
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:35,252
If memory serves, Regula I
is a scientific research laboratory.

404
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,757
I told Starfleet Command
all we had was a boatload of children,

405
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,844
but we're the only ship in the quadrant.

406
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,933
Spock, these cadets of yours,
how good are they?

407
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,101
How will they respond
under real pressure?

408
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,688
As with all living things,
each according to his gifts.

409
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,108
Of course, this ship is yours.

410
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,570
No, that won't be necessary.

411
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,782
Just get me to Regula I.

412
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:09,370
As a teacher on a training mission,
I'm content to command the Enterprise.

413
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,622
If we are to go on actual duty,

414
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,668
it is clear that the senior officer
onboard must assume command.

415
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,461
It may be nothing.

416
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,631
Garbled communications.

417
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,385
-You take the ship.
-Jim.

418
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,012
You proceed from a false assumption.

419
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,641
I'm a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

420
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,481
You're about to remind me
that logic alone dictates your actions?

421
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,026
I would not remind you
of that which you know so well.

422
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,115
If I may be so bold, it was a mistake
for you to accept promotion.

423
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,619
Commanding a starship is your first,
best destiny.

424
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,081
Anything else is a waste of material.

425
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,792
I would not presume to debate you.

426
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,294
That is wise.

427
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,715
In any case, were I to invoke logic,

428
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,842
logic clearly dictates

429
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,470
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

430
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,432
Or the one.

431
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,025
You are my superior officer.
You are also my friend.

432
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,820
I have been and always shall be yours.

433
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,451
-Stop energizers.
-Stop energizers.

434
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,286
Put me on speakers.

435
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,750
An emergency situation has arisen.

436
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,086
By order of Starfleet Command,
as of now, 1800 hours,

437
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,297
I'm assuming command of this vessel.

438
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,299
Duty officer, so note in the ship's log.

439
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,010
Plot a new course
for Space Laboratory Regula I.

440
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,470
Engine Room.

441
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,638
-Mr. Scott.
-Aye, sir?

442
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,892
-We'll be going to warp speed.
-Aye, sir.

443
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,438
-Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral.
-Engage warp engines.

444
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,150
-Prepare for warp speed.
-Ready, sir.

445
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,990
I know that none of you
were expecting this. I'm sorry.

446
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:14,244
I'm going to have to ask you to grow up
a little bit sooner than you expected.

447
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,788
Warp 5, Sulu.

448
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,501
So much for the little training cruise.

449
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,804
Course to intercept Enterprise
ready, sir.

450
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,055
Excellent.

451
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,058
-Helmsman?
-Sir, may I speak?

452
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,816
We're all with you, sir.

453
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,819
But consider this.

454
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:51,907
We are free. We have a ship
and the means to go where we will.

455
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,703
We have escaped
permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V.

456
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,836
You have proved your superior intellect
and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk.

457
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,257
You do not need to defeat him again.

458
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:14,179
He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him.

459
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,434
I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia

460
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,479
and round the Antares maelstrom

461
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:26,567
and round perdition's flames
before I give him up.

462
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,780
Prepare to alter course.

463
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,160
Space Station Regula I, please come in.

464
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,495
Dr Marcus, please respond.

465
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,083
This is Enterprise...

466
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,004
It's no use.
There's no response from Regula I.

467
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,007
-But no longer jammed?
-No, sir. No nothing.

468
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,641
There are two possibilities.

469
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,312
They are unable to respond.
They are unwilling to respond.

470
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,732
-How far?
-12 hours, 43 minutes, present speed.

471
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,196
"Give up Genesis," she said.

472
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,240
What in God's name does it mean?
Give it up to whom?

473
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:19,036
It might help my analysis
if I knew what Genesis was,

474
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,038
beyond the biblical reference.

475
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,916
Uhura, have Dr McCoy
join us in my quarters.

476
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,792
-Aye, sir.
-Mr. Saavik?

477
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,587
You have the conn.

478
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,509
Well, I've got Sickbay ready.

479
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,304
Now, will someone please tell me
what's going on?

480
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,309
Computer. Request security procedure

481
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,479
and access to Project Genesis
summary.

482
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,943
-Identify for retina scan.
-Kirk, Admiral James T.

483
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,537
-Security Scan approved.
-Summary, please?

484
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,587
Project Genesis.
A proposal to the Federation.

485
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,715
-Carol Marcus.
-Yes.

486
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,093
What exactly is Genesis?

487
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:21,640
Well, put simply,
Genesis is life from lifelessness.

488
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,770
It is a process whereby
molecular structure is reorganized

489
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,692
at the subatomic level into
life-generating matter of equal mass.

490
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,487
Stage one of our experiments
was conducted in the laboratory.

491
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,825
Stage two of the series will be
attempted in a lifeless underground.

492
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,537
Stage three will involve
the process on a planetary scale.

493
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,332
It is our intention to introduce
the Genesis device

494
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,627
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body,

495
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,546
a moon or other dead form.

496
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,923
The device is delivered,

497
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:58,552
instantaneously causing
what we call the Genesis Effect.

498
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,889
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

499
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:22,075
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

500
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,204
capable of sustaining whatever
life forms we see fit to deposit on it.

501
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,582
Fascinating.

502
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,625
The reformed moon simulated here

503
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,837
represents the merest fraction
of the Genesis' potential,

504
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,340
should the Federation
wish to fund these experiments

505
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,550
to their logical conclusion.

506
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,597
When we consider the cosmic problems
of population and food supply,

507
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,600
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

508
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,103
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you for your attention.

509
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,981
It literally is genesis.

510
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,485
Power of creation.

511
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,031
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

512
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,407
Well, the tape was made
about a year ago,

513
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:05,952
so I can only assume
they've reached stage two by now.

514
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,873
Dear Lord, do you think
we're intelligent enough to...

515
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:15,337
Suppose... What if this thing
were used where life already exists?

516
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,841
It would destroy such life
in favor of its new matrix.

517
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,888
Its new matrix? Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

518
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,643
I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.

519
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,561
As a matter of cosmic history,

520
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,940
it has always been easier to destroy
than to create.

521
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,193
Not anymore!
Now we can do both at the same time.

522
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,571
According to myth,
the Earth was created in six days.

523
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,992
Now, watch out. Here comes Genesis.
We'll do it for you in six minutes.

524
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,746
Really, Dr McCoy,
you must learn to govern your passions.

525
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,959
They will be your undoing.
Logic suggests...

526
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:57,504
Logic?
My God, the man's talking about logic.

527
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,799
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

528
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,719
-You green-blooded, inhuman...
-Bridge to Admiral Kirk.

529
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:08,598
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area, closing fast.

530
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:13,061
-What do you make of her?
-It's one of ours, Admiral. It's Reliant.

531
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,354
Reliant?

532
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,985
Try the emergency channels.

533
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,366
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

534
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,050
Slow to one-half impulse power.

535
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:50,140
-Let's be friends.
-Slowing to one-half impulse power.

536
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,311
Reliant in our section,
this quadrant, sir, and slowing.

537
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,524
Sir? May I quote General Order 12?
"On the approach of any vessel

538
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,318
"when communications
have not been established..."

539
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:04,988
Lieutenant. The Admiral is well aware
of the regulations.

540
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,407
Aye, sir.

541
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,164
Is it possible
their comm system has failed?

542
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,416
It would explain a great many things.

543
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,711
They're requesting communications, sir.

544
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,588
Let them eat static.

545
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,343
They're still running with shields down.

546
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,763
Of course. We are one big happy fleet.

547
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,559
Kirk, my old friend.

548
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,938
Do you know the Klingon proverb
that tells us,

549
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,608
"Revenge is a dish
that is best served cold?"

550
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,282
It is very cold in space.

551
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,127
This is damn peculiar.

552
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,840
-Yellow alert.
-Energize defense fields.

553
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,765
I'm getting a voice message.

554
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,269
They say their chambers coil
is overloading their comm system.

555
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,979
-Spock?
-Scanning.

556
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:21,731
Their coil emissions are normal.

557
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,488
-They still haven't raised their shields.
-Raise ours.

558
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,033
Their shields are going up.

559
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,868
Lock phasers on target.

560
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,746
Locking phasers on target.

561
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,999
-They're locking phasers.
-Raise shields.

562
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,166
Fire!

563
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,309
-Sulu, get those shields up.
-Trying, sir.

564
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,522
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

565
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,493
I need air! I need air!

566
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,667
I can't get power, sir.

567
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,046
Scotty?

568
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,966
-Uhura, turn off those damn channels!
-Mr. Scott on the screen.

569
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:34,471
We're just hanging on, sir.
The main energizer's out.

570
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:38,016
-Try auxiliary power!
-Aye, aye, sir.

571
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,601
Damage report.

572
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,485
They knew exactly where to hit us.

573
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,988
Who? Who knew where to hit us?
And why?

574
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:55,742
One thing is certain.
We cannot escape on auxiliary power.

575
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,079
Visual.

576
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,125
-Sulu, divert all power to phasers.
-Too late.

577
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,418
Hang on!

578
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,474
Scotty! What's left?

579
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,186
Just the batteries, sir. I can have
auxiliary power in a few minutes.

580
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,397
We don't have a few minutes!

581
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,698
-Can you give me phaser power?
-A few shots, sir.

582
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,200
-Not enough against their shields.
-Who the hell are they?

583
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,620
Admiral, the Commander of the Reliant
is signaling.

584
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,707
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

585
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,552
-Put it on screen.
-Admiral...

586
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,304
Do it! While we still have time.

587
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,688
On screen, sir.

588
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,491
-Khan.
-You still remember, Admiral.

589
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:24,706
I cannot help but be touched.
I, of course, remember you.

590
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:29,002
What is the meaning of this attack?
Where is the crew of the Reliant?

591
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,338
Surely I have made my meaning plain.

592
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,259
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

593
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,428
I've deprived your ship of power,

594
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,223
and when I swing around,
I mean to deprive you of your life.

595
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:48,396
But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you.

596
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:54,569
Khan, if it's me you want,

597
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:59,491
I'll have myself beamed aboard.
Spare my crew.

598
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,452
I make you a counterproposal.

599
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:09,334
I'll agree to your terms if,
in addition to yourself,

600
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:12,295
you hand over to me
all data and material

601
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,007
regarding the project called Genesis.

602
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:20,470
-Genesis? What's that?
-Don't insult my intelligence, Kirk.

603
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:24,599
Give me some time to recall
the data on our computers.

604
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,976
I give you 60 seconds, Admiral.

605
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,527
Clear the Bridge.

606
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,827
At least we know
he doesn't have Genesis.

607
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,372
Keep nodding
as though I'm still giving orders.

608
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,251
Mr. Saavik, punch up the data charts
of Reliant's command console.

609
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,710
Reliant's command?

610
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,962
-Hurry!
-45 seconds.

611
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,922
-The prefix code?
-That's all we've got.

612
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,597
-The chart's up, sir.
-Admiral.

613
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,599
We're finding it.

614
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,227
Admiral.

615
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,770
Please.

616
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,522
Please, you've gotta give us time.

617
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,275
The Bridge is smashed.
The computer's inoperative.

618
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,111
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

619
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,578
Damn!

620
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,790
-Admiral?
-It's coming through now, Khan.

621
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:40,633
-Reliant's prefix number is 16309.
-I don't understand.

622
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,761
You have to learn
why things work on a starship.

623
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,139
Each ship has its own combination code

624
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,601
to prevent an enemy
from doing what we're attempting.

625
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:55,440
We're using our console
to order Reliant to lower her shields.

626
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,610
Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination. He's quite intelligent.

627
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,695
Fifteen seconds, Admiral.

628
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,161
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

629
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,914
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral.

630
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,667
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

631
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,422
I see your point.

632
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,343
Stand by to receive our transmission.

633
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,931
Mr. Sulu, lock the phasers on target
and await my command.

634
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,557
Phasers locked.

635
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,896
-Time's up, Admiral.
-Here it comes.

636
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,899
Now, Mr. Spock.

637
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,491
Sir, our shields are dropping.

638
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,871
-Raise them.
-I can't!

639
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,209
Where's the override? The override?

640
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:57,877
Fire.

641
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,714
Fire.

642
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,763
Fire! Fire!

643
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,057
-We can't fire, sir.
-Why can't you?

644
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,728
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive. We must withdraw.

645
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,814
-No! No!
-Sir, we must!

646
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,700
Enterprise can wait.
She's not going anywhere.

647
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,211
-Sir, you did it.
-I did nothing.

648
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,298
Except get caught
with my breeches down.

649
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,134
I must be getting senile.

650
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,138
Mr. Saavik, you go right on
quoting regulations.

651
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:55,101
In the meantime,
let's find out how badly we've been hurt.

652
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,194
-Is the word given, Admiral?
-The word is given.

653
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,655
Warp speed.

654
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,201
Aye.

655
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:11,260
He stayed at his post
when the trainees ran.

656
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:15,348
-Admiral? This is Spock.
-Yes, Spock?

657
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,434
Engine Room
reports auxiliary power restored.

658
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,853
We can proceed at impulse power.

659
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:24,190
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out.

660
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,150
I'm sorry, Scotty.

661
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,072
Approaching Regula
and Space Lab Regula I.

662
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,617
Space Station Regula I,
this is the Starship Enterprise.

663
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,244
Please come in.

664
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,625
Space Station Regula I, do you read?

665
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:49,423
Space Station Regula I,
this is Enterprise. Please acknowledge.

666
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,886
This is Enterprise. Do you read me?

667
00:57:56,598 --> 00:58:00,893
Space Station Regula I, do you read?
Please come in.

668
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,729
There's no response, sir.

669
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,152
Sensors, Captain?

670
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,612
The scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

671
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:14,198
There's no way
to ascertain what's inside the station.

672
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:16,450
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

673
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,869
Precisely.

674
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,413
What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

675
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,331
Regula is Class-D.

676
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:26,169
It consists
of various unremarkable ores,

677
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,379
essentially a great rock in space.

678
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,339
And Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

679
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,341
A distinct possibility.

680
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,345
-Engineering.
-Aye, sir?

681
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,724
Mr. Scott? Do you have
enough power for transporters?

682
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,143
Barely, sir.

683
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,398
-I'm going down there.
-Khan could be down there.

684
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,317
He's been there,
hasn't found what he wants.

685
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,027
Can you spare someone?
There may be people hurt.

686
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,155
-Yeah, I can spare me.
-Begging the Admiral's pardon.

687
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,866
General Order 15,
"No flag officer shall beam

688
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,535
"into a hazardous area
without armed escort."

689
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,954
There's no such regulation.

690
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,836
All right, join the party.
Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

691
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:12,965
-Jim, be careful.
-We will.

692
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,950
Indeterminate life signs.

693
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,247
Phasers on stun.

694
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,293
Move out.

695
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,110
Jim!

696
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,455
Well, rigor hasn't set in.

697
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,707
This couldn't have happened
too long ago, Jim.

698
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,043
Carol.

699
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:16,380
This is Enterprise calling
Space Lab Regula I. Respond, please.

700
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:21,552
-Admiral, over here.
-Dr Marcus, come in, please.

701
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:47,870
Oh, my God.

702
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,872
Please acknowledge signal.

703
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,457
-Please...
-Commander Uhura,

704
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,544
this is Lieutenant Saavik.
We're all right. Please stand by. Out.

705
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,800
Oh, sir, it was Khan.

706
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,471
-We found him on Ceti Alpha V.
-Easy. Easy, Pav.

707
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:12,436
He put creatures in our bodies
to control our minds.

708
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,649
It's all right. You're safe now.

709
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,610
Made us say lies, do things.

710
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,738
But we beat him.

711
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:25,699
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

712
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,994
-The Captain was strong.
-Captain.

713
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:34,625
Where's Dr Marcus?
Where are the Genesis materials?

714
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,838
He couldn't find them.
Even the data banks were empty.

715
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,716
-Erased?
-He tortured those people,

716
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:47,847
but none of them
would tell him anything. He went wild.

717
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:53,018
He slit their throats.
He wanted to tear the place apart.

718
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,521
But he was late.

719
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,774
He had to get back to the Reliant
in time to blow you to bits.

720
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,694
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

721
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,865
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V.

722
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:10,995
He's completely mad, Admiral.
He blames you for the death of his wife.

723
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,289
I know what he blames me for.

724
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:22,840
The escape pods are all in place.
Where's the Transporter Room?

725
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,137
-Did he make it down here?
-It was not my impression.

726
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,388
He spent most of his time

727
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,807
trying to wring the information
out of the people.

728
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,727
-Anything?
-The unit's been left on.

729
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,647
Which means
nobody remained to turn it off.

730
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:43,110
Those people back there bought
escape time for Genesis with their lives.

731
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,570
This is not logical.

732
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:48,073
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula,

733
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,659
a planetoid we know to be lifeless.

734
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,582
If stage two was completed,
it was going to be underground.

735
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,043
It was going to be underground,
she said.

736
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,794
Stage two of what?

737
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:04,798
-Kirk to Enterprise.
-Spock here.

738
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,009
Captain Spock, damage report.

739
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:11,889
Admiral, if we go by the book,
like Lieutenant Saavik,

740
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,099
hours could seem like days.

741
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:18,354
-I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
-The situation is grave, Admiral.

742
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:23,484
We won't have main power for six days.
Auxiliary power has temporarily failed.

743
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:29,698
Restoration may be possible
in two days, by the book, Admiral.

744
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:33,202
-Meaning you can't even beam us back?
-Not at present.

745
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,708
Captain Spock. If you don't hear
from us within one hour,

746
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,962
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

747
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,714
take the Enterprise
to the nearest starbase

748
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:48,384
and alert Starfleet Command
as soon as you're out of jamming range.

749
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,803
Sir, we won't leave you behind.

750
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:55,432
Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.

751
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,311
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

752
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,731
If it's all the same, Admiral,
we'd like to share the risk.

753
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,819
Right. Let's go. Saavik?

754
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,949
-Go? Where are we going?
-Where they went.

755
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,412
Suppose they went nowhere?

756
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,374
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

757
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,821
Admiral.

758
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,920
Genesis, I presume.

759
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,223
-Phasers down.
-You.

760
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,735
-Where's Dr Marcus?
-I'm Dr Marcus.

761
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,111
Jim!

762
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,085
Is that David?

763
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:49,338
Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

764
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,758
Of course he didn't.

765
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,969
David, you're just making this harder.

766
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,306
I'm afraid it's even harder
than you think, Doctor.

767
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,601
Please don't move.

768
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:07,898
-Chekov.
-I'm sorry, Admiral.

769
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:12,236
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

770
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,866
I have indeed, Captain.

771
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:19,827
You have done well.

772
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,121
I knew it! You son of a bitch!

773
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:29,002
-Don't move! Anybody!
-Captain? We are waiting.

774
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,130
What's the delay?

775
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,132
All is well, sir.

776
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,384
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

777
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,472
First things first, Captain.

778
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,977
Kill Admiral Kirk.

779
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,073
Sir, it is difficult. I...

780
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:02,161
-I try to obey, but...
-Kill him.

781
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:03,996
I...

782
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:14,089
Kill him, Terrell, now.

783
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:39,323
God's sakes!

784
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,284
What is it?

785
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:04,223
Khan, you bloodsucker!

786
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,934
You're gonna have to do
your own dirty work now.

787
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,852
Do you hear me? Do you?

788
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,023
Kirk.

789
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,904
Kirk, you're still alive, my old friend.

790
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:26,245
Still, old friend, you've managed
to kill just about everyone else,

791
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,790
but like a poor marksman,
you keep missing the target.

792
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,594
Perhaps I no longer need to try,
Admiral.

793
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,770
-Oh, no.
-Let go. He can't take it!

794
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,275
Khan.

795
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:04,283
Khan, you've got Genesis,
but you don't have me.

796
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:07,035
You were going to kill me, Khan.
You're gonna have to come down here.

797
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,746
You're going to have
to come down here.

798
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,125
I've done far worse than kill you.

799
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:22,551
I've hurt you,
and I wish to go on hurting you.

800
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,140
I shall leave you as you left me,

801
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,309
as you left her,

802
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:35,522
marooned for all eternity
in the centre of a dead planet.

803
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,986
Buried alive. Buried alive.

804
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:43,989
Khan!

805
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,909
Khan!

806
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:57,544
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise. Can you read us?

807
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,715
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise. Can you read us?

808
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,592
-He's coming around.
-Pavel?

809
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,302
Can you read us?

810
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:10,891
It's no use, Admiral.
They're still jamming all channels.

811
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,561
If Enterprise followed orders,
she's long since gone.

812
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,230
If she couldn't obey, she's finished.

813
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,150
So are we, it looks like.

814
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,988
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?

815
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:27,491
Who is Khan?

816
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:31,244
-Well, it's a long story.
-We appear to have plenty of time.

817
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,125
Is there anything to eat?

818
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,212
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm starved.

819
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,923
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

820
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,425
First order of business, survival.

821
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,470
There's food in the Genesis cave.

822
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:53,517
Enough to last a lifetime, if necessary.

823
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,270
-We thought this was Genesis.
-This?

824
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:04,319
It took the Starfleet Corps of Engineers
10 months in spacesuits

825
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,405
to tunnel out all this.

826
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,867
What we did in there, we did in a day.

827
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:16,206
David, why don't you show Dr McCoy
and the Lieutenant our idea of food?

828
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,375
We can't just sit here.

829
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:21,753
Oh, yes, we can.

830
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,464
This is just to give us something to do,
isn't it?

831
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,844
Come on.

832
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:37,936
Admiral?

833
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:40,981
As your teacher Mr. Spock
is fond of saying,

834
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:44,609
"I'd like to think
that there always are possibilities."

835
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,876
I did what you wanted. I stayed away.

836
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,048
Why didn't you tell him?

837
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,092
How can you ask me that?

838
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:13,638
Were we together?
Were we going to be?

839
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,893
You had your world and I had mine,

840
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,605
and I wanted him in mine,

841
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,983
not chasing through the universe
with his father.

842
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:41,958
Actually, he's a lot like you
in many ways.

843
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,673
Please tell me what you're feeling.

844
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:55,263
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 15 years

845
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,349
who's trying to kill me.

846
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,687
You show me a son
that'd be happy to help him.

847
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,025
My son.

848
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,865
My life that could have been

849
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,493
and wasn't.

850
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,872
What am I feeling?

851
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,253
Old.

852
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,258
Worn out.

853
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,142
Let me show you something

854
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:46,022
that'll make you feel young,
as when the world was new.

855
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:02,080
Impulse power restored.

856
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:08,044
Excellent.
More than a match for poor Enterprise.

857
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,234
You did all this in a day?

858
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,362
The matrix formed in a day.

859
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:39,784
The life forms grew later
at a substantially accelerated rate.

860
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:47,959
Jim, this is incredible!
Have you ever seen the like?

861
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,173
Can I cook or can't I?

862
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,443
Where is she?

863
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,910
Sir, may I ask you a question?

864
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:25,622
-What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
-The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

865
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,124
Are you asking me
if we're playing out that scenario now?

866
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:31,836
On the test, sir,
will you tell me what you did?

867
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,589
I would really like to know.

868
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:38,718
Lieutenant, you are looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

869
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,221
who ever beat the no-win scenario.

870
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,139
How?

871
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,228
I reprogrammed the simulation
so it was possible to rescue the ship.

872
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,730
-What?
-He cheated.

873
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,358
I changed the conditions of the test.

874
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:56,486
I got a commendation
for original thinking.

875
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:58,697
I don't like to lose.

876
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:02,909
Then you never faced that situation,
faced death?

877
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,745
I don't believe in the no-win scenario.

878
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,834
Kirk to Spock. It's two hours.
Are you ready?

879
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,294
Right on schedule, Admiral.

880
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,879
Just give us your coordinates
and we'll beam you aboard.

881
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,298
All right.

882
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,594
I don't like to lose.

883
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:26,224
...report, we were immobilized.
Captain Spock said it'd be two days.

884
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,561
Come, come, Lieutenant.
You of all people go by the book. Spock!

885
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,313
-You know Dr Marcus.
-Why, of course.

886
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,732
-Hello, Mr. Spock.
-I'm taking this bunch to Sickbay.

887
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,984
-By the book?
-By the book.

888
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,864
Regulation 46A. "If transmissions
are being monitored during battle...

889
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:43,700
"No un-coded messages
on an open channel."

890
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:49,664
-You lied.
-I exaggerated.

891
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:53,460
Hours instead of days.
Now we have minutes instead of hours.

892
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,343
-They're inoperative below C-Deck.
-What is working around here?

893
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,470
Not much, Admiral.
We have partial main power.

894
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,930
-That's it?
-Best we could do in two hours.

895
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,411
-Admiral on the Bridge.
-Battle stations.

896
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,664
Tactical.

897
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:40,382
She can still outrun us and outgun us,

898
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:44,302
but there is the Mutara Nebula
at 1-5-3 mark 4.

899
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,179
Scotty, can we make it inside?

900
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,264
The energizer's bypassed
like a Christmas tree,

901
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,933
so don't give me too many bumps.

902
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:52,060
No promises. On your way.

903
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,853
Trouble with the nebula, sir,

904
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:57,690
is all that static discharge and gas
clouds our tactical display.

905
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,985
Visual won't function
and shields will be useless.

906
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,322
Sauce for the goose, Mr. Saavik.

907
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,409
The odds will be even.

908
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:57,542
There she is. There she is.

909
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,798
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

910
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,384
So much the better.

911
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,830
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

912
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,626
Reliant is closing.

913
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,971
If they go in there, we'll lose them.

914
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,265
Explain it to them.

915
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:05,985
That was close.

916
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,613
They just don't want us going in there.

917
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,789
One minute to nebula perimeter.

918
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,291
Why are we slowing?

919
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:25,672
Daren't follow them into the nebula, sir.
Our shields would be useless.

920
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,762
-They are reducing speed.
-Uhura, patch me in.

921
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,682
Aye, sir. You're on, Admiral.

922
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:39,269
This is Admiral Kirk.

923
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,564
We tried it once your way, Khan.
Are you game for a rematch?

924
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:49,320
Khan, I'm laughing
at the superior intellect.

925
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,326
-Full impulse power.
-No, sir.

926
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,538
You have Genesis.
You can have whatever you...

927
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:01,249
Full power! Damn you!

928
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,258
I'll say this for him, he's consistent.

929
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,178
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

930
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,772
Emergency lights.

931
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,179
Tactical.

932
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:59,557
Inoperative.

933
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,687
Raise the shields.

934
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:09,734
As I feared, sir, not functional.
I'm reducing speed.

935
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:53,903
Target, sir.

936
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:58,282
-Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
-Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.

937
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,710
Aft torpedoes, fire!

938
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,178
Hold your course.

939
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,077
Evasive starboard!

940
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,173
Fire!

941
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,863
Damage, Mr. Scott?

942
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:24,535
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

943
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:27,497
-It's the radiation...
-Scotty.

944
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:29,832
Joachim!

945
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:36,422
Yours is superior...

946
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:46,015
I shall avenge you.

947
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,111
Could you use another hand, Admiral?

948
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,656
Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

949
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,664
-Spock.
-Sporadic energy readings.

950
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,458
Port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.

951
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:16,420
He won't break off now.

952
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:20,675
He followed me this far, he'll be back.

953
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:24,011
But from where?

954
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:27,807
He's intelligent but not experienced.

955
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,853
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

956
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:40,945
-Full stop.
-Full stop, sir.

957
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:46,450
Z-minus 10,000 meters.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

958
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,505
Torpedoes ready, sir.

959
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,684
Look sharp.

960
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,689
Fire!

961
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:06,530
Fire!

962
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:45,319
Uhura, send to Commander Reliant,
"Prepare to be boarded."

963
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:46,696
Aye, sir.

964
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,408
Commander Reliant, this is Enterprise.

965
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:53,786
Surrender and prepare to be boarded.

966
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:58,791
Enterprise to Reliant. You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

967
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,471
Reliant, come in, Reliant.

968
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:16,142
You are ordered
to surrender your vessel.

969
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:20,896
Enterprise to Reliant. You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

970
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,496
No, Kirk.

971
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:40,791
The game's not over.

972
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:21,373
"To the last I will grapple with thee."

973
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,683
Admiral, scanning an energy source
on Reliant,

974
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,354
a pattern I've never seen before.

975
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,195
-It's the Genesis wave.
-What?

976
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:53,948
They're on a build-up to detonation.

977
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,785
-How soon?
-We encoded four minutes.

978
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,205
-We'll beam aboard and stop it.
-You can't.

979
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:08,003
Scotty, I need warp speed
in three minutes or we're all dead.

980
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,216
-No response, Admiral.
-Scotty!

981
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,094
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

982
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:16,428
Aye, sir.

983
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,052
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

984
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,597
No human can tolerate
the radiation that's in there.

985
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:03,267
As you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I am not human.

986
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,729
You're not going in there.

987
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:11,483
Perhaps you're right.
What is Mr. Scott's condition?

988
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,279
Well, I don't think that he...

989
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:19,116
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I have no time to discuss this logically.

990
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,622
Remember.

991
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,467
Spock! Get out of there!

992
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:38,427
Spock!

993
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,304
Spock! Get out of there!

994
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:54,610
-Time from my mark?
-Two minutes, 10 seconds.

995
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,821
Engine Room, what's happening?

996
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,657
Spock!

997
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,202
-Spock! Get out of there!
-Good God, man, get out of there!

998
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:06,789
-No! Don't! Don't!
-Spock! Spock!

999
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:38,070
Time?

1000
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:42,199
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

1001
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:51,375
-Distance from Reliant?
-4,000 kilometers.

1002
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:54,211
We're not gonna make it, are we?

1003
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,224
No.

1004
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,145
No, you can't get away.

1005
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:18,110
"From hell's heart I stab at thee.

1006
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:27,161
"For hate's sake
I spit my last breath at thee."

1007
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:44,053
-Sir, the mains are back online.
-Bless you, Scotty. Go, Sulu!

1008
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,890
My God, Carol. Look at it.

1009
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:45,656
Engine Room. Well done, Scotty.

1010
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:50,661
Jim, I think you'd better get down here.

1011
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:55,290
-Bones?
-Better hurry.

1012
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,171
Saavik, take the conn.

1013
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,994
No! You'll flood the whole compartment.

1014
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:34,746
-He'll die.
-Sir, he's dead already.

1015
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,128
It's too late.

1016
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:04,943
Spock!

1017
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:39,144
Ship out of danger?

1018
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:42,439
Yes.

1019
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:47,986
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1020
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:52,533
It is logical.

1021
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:59,289
The needs of the many outweigh...

1022
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:05,462
-The needs of the few.
-Or the one.

1023
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:19,142
I never took the Kobayashi Maru test.

1024
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,229
Until now.

1025
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,984
What do you think of my solution?

1026
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:30,988
Spock.

1027
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:48,422
I have been, and always shall be,
your friend.

1028
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:58,765
Live long and prosper.

1029
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,080
No.

1030
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:44,770
We are assembled here today

1031
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:47,898
to pay final respects
to our honored dead.

1032
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:58,241
And yet it should be noted that,
in the midst of our sorrow,

1033
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,703
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

1034
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:04,081
the sunrise of a new world,

1035
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:08,877
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect and nourish.

1036
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:13,048
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one,

1037
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:17,219
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom at these proceedings.

1038
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,183
Of my friend, I can only say this.

1039
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:31,692
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

1040
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:34,528
his was the most

1041
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:39,449
human.

1042
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,161
Honors!

1043
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,955
Come.

1044
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,503
I don't mean to intrude.

1045
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:19,007
No, not at all. I should be on the Bridge.

1046
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,428
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1047
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:25,347
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

1048
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:27,557
Lieutenant Saavik was right.

1049
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,978
You never have faced death.

1050
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:42,906
No, not like this.

1051
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:48,912
I haven't faced death.
I've cheated death.

1052
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:55,043
I've tricked my way out of death

1053
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:58,547
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1054
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:03,802
I know nothing.

1055
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:06,388
You knew enough to tell Saavik
that how we face death

1056
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:09,099
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1057
01:43:11,561 --> 01:43:14,020
-Just words.
-But good words.

1058
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,943
That's where ideas begin.
Maybe you should listen to them.

1059
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:27,701
I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.

1060
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:35,792
-Is that what you came here to say?
-Mainly.

1061
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:47,095
And also that I'm proud,

1062
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:52,851
very proud to be your son.

1063
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:26,051
Captain's Log, Stardate 8141 .6.

1064
01:44:26,636 --> 01:44:29,095
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

1065
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:31,806
to pick up the crew of U.S.S. Reliant.

1066
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:34,351
All is well.

1067
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:39,064
And yet, I can't help wondering
about the friend I leave behind.

1068
01:44:40,733 --> 01:44:43,693
"There are always possibilities,"
Spock said.

1069
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:48,073
And if Genesis is indeed life from death,

1070
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,327
I must return to this place again.

1071
01:44:57,124 --> 01:45:01,962
He's really not dead,
as long as we remember him.

1072
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:12,514
"It's a far, far better thing I do
than I have ever done before.

1073
01:45:15,518 --> 01:45:20,271
"A far better resting place I go to

1074
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:22,524
"than I have ever known."

1075
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:24,776
Is that a poem?

1076
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,657
Something Spock was trying
to tell me on my birthday.

1077
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:34,911
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

1078
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:39,666
Young.

1079
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:45,380
I feel young.

1080
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:01,164
Space, the final frontier.

1081
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:07,921
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

1082
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:14,677
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

1083
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:20,683
to seek out new life forms
and new civilizations,

1084
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:26,852
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.
