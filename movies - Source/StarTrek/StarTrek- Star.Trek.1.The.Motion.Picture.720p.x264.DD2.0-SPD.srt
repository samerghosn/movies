1
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:05,037
This is com station Epsilon 9
calling USS Columbia.

2
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,872
Come in, Columbia.
Respond, please.

3
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:11,335
This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9.
Could you boost your transmission?

4
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,005
This is Epsilon 9, Columbia.

5
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,716
Am boosting output.
How read you this?

6
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,428
Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9.
Receiving your transmission.

7
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,016
Scout Columbia, NCC-621...

8
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:30,687
to rendezvous with
Scout Revere, NCC-595...

9
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,816
on stardate 7411.4.

10
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,194
Further orders
will be relayed at that time.

11
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,904
Signed Commodore Prober
to Starfleet.

12
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,951
- End of transmission.
- Received. Thank you.

13
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,125
Our sensor drone is
intercepting this on Quad L-14.

14
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,213
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

15
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,215
Unknown, sir.

16
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,218
I have an exterior visual.

17
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,725
We've plotted a course
on that cloud, Commander.

18
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,021
It will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

19
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,731
Heading?

20
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:42,569
Sir, it's on
a precise heading for Earth.

21
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,042
Commander Sonak.

22
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,336
You received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

23
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,379
Based, I am told, on your
recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

24
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,755
Then why aren't you aboard?

25
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,466
Captain Decker requested I complete
final science briefing here before...

26
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,092
- Here?
- We leave on our mission.

27
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,845
At Starfleet?

28
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,557
The Enterprise is in
final preparation to leave dock.

29
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,600
Which will require
20 more hours at minimum...

30
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,519
Twelve.

31
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,522
I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura...

32
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,606
which will not last
more than three minutes.

33
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,692
Report to me on the Enterprise
in one hour.

34
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,860
Report to you, sir?

35
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:56,822
It is my intention to be
on that ship following that meeting.

36
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,825
Report to me in one hour.

37
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,315
- Admiral!
- Mr. Scott.

38
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,610
Those departure orders... 12 hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.

39
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,070
Why aren't the Enterprisetransporters operating, Mr. Scott?

40
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,072
A wee problem, sir.
Just temporary.

41
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,450
Admiral, we have just
finished 18 months...

42
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,451
redesigning and refitting
the Enterprise.

43
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,245
How in hell do they expect me
to have her ready in 12 hours?

44
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,248
Take me over, please.

45
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,129
She needs more work, sir.
A shakedown!

46
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,926
Mr. Scott, an alien object of
unbelievable destructive power...

47
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,677
is less than three days away
from this planet.

48
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,599
The only starship in interception
range is the Enterprise.

49
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,769
Ready or not,
she launches in 12 hours.

50
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,208
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time...

51
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,211
with all the new equipment.

52
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:20,174
And the engines... They're
not even tested at warp power.

53
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,969
And an untried captain.

54
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,513
Two-and-a-half years as
chief of Starfleet Operations...

55
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,722
may have made me
a little stale, but I...

56
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,934
wouldn't exactly
consider myself untried.

57
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,234
- They gave her back to me, Scotty.
- Gave her back, sir?

58
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,735
I doubt it was that easy
with Nogura.

59
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,489
You're right.

60
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,703
Well, any man who could
manage such a feat...

61
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,664
I would not dare disappoint.

62
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,626
She'll launch on time, sir,
and she'll be ready.

63
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,961
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, sir.

64
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,548
Cargo bay to launch crew.

65
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,469
A travel pod is now
available at cargo 6.

66
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,515
- Permission to come aboard, sir.
- Granted, sir.

67
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,182
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

68
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,519
Commander Scott, you're needed
in Engineering immediately.

69
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,520
Sir, you'll excuse me.

70
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,317
Flight deck, prepare
for an incoming shuttlecraft.

71
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,071
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you...

72
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,740
I think I can
find my way, Ensign.

73
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,910
Aye, sir.

74
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,749
Bridge.

75
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,421
What's the problem?

76
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,965
I thought you people had
that circuit patched in an hour ago.

77
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,509
We did. We had to disconnect it.

78
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,760
All right. Take out...

79
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,263
It's going to take us longer
that way. We're trying to save time.

80
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,559
I'm still waiting for a check
on the line. What's holding it up?

81
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,105
As soon as somebody
can get to it.

82
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,106
What's the next program?

83
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,317
I'll get somebody down there
as soon as I can, Cleary.

84
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,111
My people are all tied up now.

85
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,910
Captain! Starfleet just signaled
your transfer of command orders.

86
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,373
Capitain! I apreciate the welcome.

87
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,542
I wish the circunstances
were less critical.

88
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:12,671
Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

89
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,132
Aye, sir.

90
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,801
- Where's Captain Decker?
- He's in Engineering, sir.

91
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,555
He... He doesn't know.

92
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,058
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, sir.

93
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,936
Assemble the crew on
the recreation deck at 0400 hours.

94
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,816
I want to show them
what we're facing.

95
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,950
Engineering.. to all decks
auxiliary power tests

96
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,367
in five minutes.

97
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,913
Admiral Kirk! Well,
we're getting a top brass send-off.

98
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,333
Don't worry,
she'll launch on schedule...

99
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,669
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands, right, Scotty?

100
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,712
Aye. That we will, sir.

101
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,967
- Let's talk.
- Sure.

102
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,469
Let me know
when that backup's ready.

103
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,806
All due respect, I hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

104
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,851
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat.

105
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:50,853
You're what?

106
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,564
I'm replacing you
as captain of the Enterprise.

107
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,900
You'll stay on
as executive officer.

108
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,653
Temporary grade reduction
to commander.

109
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,915
You personally
are assuming command?

110
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,459
Yeah.

111
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:08,963
- May I ask why?
- My experience.

112
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:13,134
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

113
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:15,386
My familiarity with
the Enterprise and its crew.

114
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:18,722
Admiral, this is an almost
totally new Enterprise.

115
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,724
You don't know her a tenth
as well as I do.

116
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,103
That's why you're staying aboard.

117
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:30,067
I'm sorry, Will.

118
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:33,989
No, Admiral,
I don't think you're sorry.

119
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:36,281
Not one damn bit.

120
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,244
I remember when you recommended me
for this command.

121
00:22:40,286 --> 00:22:42,663
You told me how envious you were
and how much you hoped...

122
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:45,000
you'd find a way to get
a starship command again.

123
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,923
Well, sir,
it looks like you found a way.

124
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:58,846
Report to the bridge,
Commander, immediately.

125
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:03,434
Aye, sir.

126
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:17,240
Transporter room!
Come in! Urgent!

127
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:19,241
Redline on the transporter,
Mr. Scott!

128
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:21,577
Transporter, do not engage!

129
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:23,579
- It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...

130
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:29,544
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it! Pull them back!

131
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:32,631
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.

132
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,473
Give it to me.

133
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,939
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

134
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:55,569
More signal!

135
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:59,657
- We're losing their pattern!
- Oh, no, they're forming.

136
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:27,102
Starfleet, do you have them?

137
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:33,650
Enterprise, what we got back
didn't live long, fortunately.

138
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:40,990
Starfleet, Kirk.

139
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,996
Please express my condolences
to their families.

140
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,791
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan embassy.

141
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,884
There was nothing
you could have done, Rand.

142
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:02,761
It wasn't your fault.

143
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,079
Yeoman, turboshaft 8?

144
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:31,082
Back that way, sir.

145
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:41,050
We have to replace
Commander Sonak.

146
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:44,804
I'd still like a Vulcan there,
if possible.

147
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:46,347
None available, Captain.

148
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:49,768
In fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

149
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:52,311
You are, Mr. Decker.

150
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:54,564
I'm afraid you're going to have
to double as science officer.

151
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:29,348
That's all we know about it...

152
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:34,980
except that it is now
53.4 hours away from Earth.

153
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,028
Enterprise is the only Federation
starship that stands in its way.

154
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,955
Our orders are to intercept...

155
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,710
investigate and take
whatever action is necessary...

156
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:58,586
and possible.

157
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:05,093
We can only hope that
there is a life form aboard that vessel...

158
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,595
that reasons the way
we do.

159
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:17,063
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon 9.

160
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:18,731
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, sir.

161
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:23,737
Enterprise, the cloud is definitely
a power field of some kind.

162
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:29,075
Measures... My God...
over eighty two AU's in diameter.

163
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:33,371
Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.

164
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,624
We're transmitting lingua code
friendship messages...

165
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:37,500
on all frequencies.

166
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:38,500
No response.

167
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,502
I have a null reading
at the center of the cloud.

168
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:44,048
Definitely something inside there,
but scans are being reflected back.

169
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:47,719
- Some kind of power surge.
- Receiving an odd pattern now.

170
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:51,056
Enterprise, they could be mistaking
our scans as a hostile act.

171
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:53,057
They seem to be reactingto our scans, sir.

172
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,059
Deflectors, emergency full!

173
00:27:57,394 --> 00:28:00,190
- We are under attack.
- External view.

174
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:59,708
Viewer off.

175
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,722
Prelaunch countdown
will commence in 40 minutes.

176
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,535
Transporter system fully repaired
and functioning normally, sir.

177
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:45,077
Dock signals clear, Captain.

178
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,913
Reply we are holding position,
awaiting final crew replacements.

179
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,915
Aye, sir.

180
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,711
Transporter personnel reports...

181
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,755
the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia...

182
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:57,965
She's already aboard
and en route to the bridge, sir.

183
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,470
She's Deltan, Captain.

184
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,769
Lieutenant Ilia
reporting for duty, sir.

185
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,770
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

186
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:14,650
- Hello, Ilia.
- Decker.

187
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:18,153
I was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

188
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,404
Commander Decker?

189
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,407
Yes, our exec and science officer.

190
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:25,993
Captain Kirk has
the utmost confidence in me.

191
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,247
And in you, too, Lieutenant.

192
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,834
My oath of celibacy
is on record, Captain.

193
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,420
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.

194
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:41,259
Starfleet reports our last six
crew members are ready to beam up...

195
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:44,971
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

196
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:48,976
Oh? L'll see to it
that he beams up.

197
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:50,978
Transporter room.

198
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:14,923
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to Starfleet...

199
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:19,971
Just a moment, Captain, sir.
L'll explain what happened.

200
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:23,307
Your revered Admiral Nogura
invoked a little-known...

201
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,894
seldom-used
reserve activation clause.

202
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:30,064
In simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me!

203
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:32,066
They didn't.

204
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:36,695
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?

205
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,530
Bones, there's a thing out there.

206
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:41,659
Why is any object we don't
understand always called a thing?

207
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:45,078
Headed this way. I need you.

208
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:50,585
Damn it, Bones, I need you.

209
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,755
Badly!

210
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,059
Permission to come aboard.

211
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,979
Permission granted, sir.

212
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:19,696
Well, Jim,
I hear Chapel's an MD now.

213
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:22,032
Well, I'm going
to need a top nurse...

214
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:25,118
not a doctor who will argue
every little diagnosis with me.

215
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:29,624
And they probably redesigned
the whole sick bay too!

216
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,250
I know engineers.
They love to change things.

217
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,942
Dock control reports ready, sir.

218
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:00,238
- Helm ready, sir.
- Orbital departure on plot, sir.

219
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,656
Yard command signaling clear, sir.

220
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:06,661
- Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Maneuvering thrusters, sir.

221
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,996
Hold station.

222
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:11,332
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

223
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,146
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.

224
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,359
Take us out.

225
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:06,572
Intermix set, Bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.

226
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,574
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.

227
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:13,871
Ahead warp. 5.

228
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,344
Departure angle on viewer.

229
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:30,429
Departure angle.

230
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:38,438
- Viewer ahead.
- Viewer ahead.

231
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:04,963
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7412. 6...

232
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,592
1.8hours from launch.

233
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,721
In order to intercept the intruder
at the earliest possible time...

234
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:15,932
we must now risk engaging warp drive
while still within the solar system.

235
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:20,228
Captain, assuming we have
full warp capability...

236
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:23,190
accelerating to warp 7
on leaving the solar system...

237
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:27,695
will bring us to IP with
the intruder in 20.1 hours.

238
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:32,177
Science officer's computition
confirmed ,sir.

239
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,452
Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your approval?

240
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,123
They do not. It's like working
in a damn computer center.

241
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,668
- Programming ready?
- Set for standard warp entry.

242
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,880
But I still recommend
further simulation study.

243
00:36:54,922 --> 00:37:00,719
Mr. Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

244
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,554
Engineering,
stand by for warp drive.

245
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:06,266
Captain, we need further warp
simulation on the flow sensors.

246
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,936
Engineer, we need warp speed now!

247
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,648
Jim, you're pushing.

248
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,027
Your people know their jobs.

249
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:21,364
That's it, sir.
I can't do any better.

250
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,534
Aye, lad.

251
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:30,123
It's borderline on the simulator.
L cannot guarantee she'll hold up.

252
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,958
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.

253
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,878
- Ahead warp 1, Mr. Sulu.
- Accelerating to warp 1, sir.

254
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,177
Warp .7, .8.

255
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,650
Warp 1, sir.

256
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:00,278
Mr. Decker...

257
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,992
Wormhole. Get us back
on impulse power. Full reverse.

258
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,617
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.

259
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,744
Subspace frequencies jammed, sir!

260
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:27,746
Wormhole effect!

261
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,719
Negative control from inertial lag
will continue 22.5 seconds...

262
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:44,097
before forward velocity
slows to sublight speed.

263
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:47,516
Unidentified small object has been
pulled into the wormhole with us.

264
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:50,478
- Directly ahead.
- Force fields up full.

265
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,481
Put object on viewer.

266
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,864
- Go manual override on helm.
- No manual response, sir.

267
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,492
Navigational deflectors
coming up, sir.

268
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:06,202
Wormhole distortion has overloaded
the main power systems.

269
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,871
Navigational deflectors
inoperative, Captain.

270
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,833
Directional control
also inoperative.

271
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:20,884
Time to impact?

272
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,719
Twenty seconds.

273
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,766
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.

274
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:29,559
No!

275
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:36,565
Belay that phaser order!

276
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:47,952
Arm photon torpedoes!

277
00:39:57,204 --> 00:40:01,041
Photon torpedoes...

278
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,972
armed!

279
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:18,231
Object is an asteroid.

280
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:21,233
Reading mass. 7.

281
00:40:21,735 --> 00:40:24,655
Targeting...

282
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:28,326
asteroid!

283
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:32,789
Impact in ten seconds.

284
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,797
Impact in eight seconds.

285
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,300
- Fire torpedoes!
- Six!

286
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:47,304
Torpedoes away!

287
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:49,014
Four!

288
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,958
Helm control restored, sir.

289
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:33,048
- Position report, Navigator.
- Computing new intersection course.

290
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:35,092
Communications are normal, sir.

291
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:36,969
Negative damage reported, Captain.

292
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:39,722
No casualties reported, Doctor.

293
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,601
Wrong, Mr. Chekov. There are casualties.

294
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:48,356
My wits, as in
"frightened out of," Captain, sir.

295
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,485
We were at warp. 8.
Engineer, report your status there.

296
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,739
In just a second, Exec. We're
picking up the pieces down here.

297
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,161
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

298
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:05,914
The engine imbalance created
the wormhole in the first place.

299
00:42:05,998 --> 00:42:07,918
It'll happen again
if we don't correct it.

300
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:10,210
That object is less than
two days away from Earth.

301
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,255
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

302
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:18,469
Lay in a heading to conform with
our initial IP with the intruder.

303
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,014
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
Mr. Decker.

304
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:26,353
- L'd like to see you in my quarters.
- Mind if I tag along, Captain?

305
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,858
Level 5.

306
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:43,579
All right, explanation. Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

307
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:46,081
The Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power...

308
00:42:46,123 --> 00:42:48,125
by channeling it
through the main engines.

309
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:51,336
When they went into
antimatter imbalance...

310
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,338
the phasers were
automatically cut off.

311
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,469
Then you acted properly, of course.

312
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:02,681
Thank you, sir.

313
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:06,936
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

314
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,563
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, sir.

315
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,567
Stop competing with me, Decker.

316
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:18,447
- Permission to speak freely, sir?
- Granted.

317
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,619
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two-and-a-half years.

318
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,788
That, plus your unfamiliarity
with the ship's redesign...

319
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:29,083
in my opinion, sir, seriously
jeopardizes this mission.

320
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,215
I trust you will...

321
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,802
nursemaid me through
these difficulties?

322
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:43,179
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

323
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:46,474
Then I won't keep you from
your duties any longer, Commander.

324
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:48,643
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, sir.

325
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:56,652
He may be right, Jim.

326
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,123
- Was it difficult?
- No more than I expected.

327
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:14,836
About as difficult
as seeing you again.

328
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:18,590
- I'm sorry.
- That you left Delta IV?

329
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:21,092
Or that you didn't
even say good-bye?

330
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:26,891
If I had seen you again...

331
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:28,893
would you have been
able to say it?

332
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:33,313
No.

333
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,702
Make your point, Doctor.

334
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,873
The point, Captain, is that
it's you who is competing.

335
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:53,668
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

336
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:57,045
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

337
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:02,134
And I intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

338
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,052
Yes.

339
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,097
It's an obsession.

340
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:08,099
An obsession that can blind you...

341
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:11,559
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

342
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:15,856
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

343
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:20,235
- Bridge to Captain.
- Viewer on.

344
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:23,655
Signal from a Federation registered
long-range shuttle, sir.

345
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:26,867
She wishes to come alongside
and lock on.

346
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:28,869
For what purpose?

347
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:32,164
My security scan shows it has
a grade-one priority, Captain.

348
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:34,333
Non belligerency confirmed.

349
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:37,378
L suspect it is a courier
of some kind.

350
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,672
Very well, Mr. Chekov.
See to it.

351
00:45:39,755 --> 00:45:42,465
Viewer off.

352
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,969
Your opinion has been noted.
Anything further?

353
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:49,264
That depends on you.

354
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,844
Security scan: One boarder.
Identity: Starfleet, inactive.

355
00:47:15,184 --> 00:47:18,396
- Permission to come aboard, sir.
- Granted, sir.

356
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,481
Granted.

357
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:33,952
Why... Why, it's Mister...

358
00:47:33,994 --> 00:47:36,454
Spock!

359
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,293
Spock.

360
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:48,717
Commander, if I may?

361
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:52,054
If... Oh.

362
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:05,400
I've been monitoring your
communications with Starfleet.

363
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,237
I'm aware of your
engine design difficulties.

364
00:48:10,697 --> 00:48:14,409
I offer my services
as science officer...

365
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:16,996
with all due respect,
Commander.

366
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:19,289
- If our exec has no objections.
- Of course not.

367
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:21,416
I'm well aware of
Mr. Spock's qualifications.

368
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:25,086
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.

369
00:48:25,128 --> 00:48:31,010
List him as science officer.
Both effective immediately.

370
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:33,346
Mr. Spock.

371
00:48:33,429 --> 00:48:36,474
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.

372
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:51,405
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.

373
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:53,407
Captain, with your permission...

374
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:56,327
I will now discuss these
fuel equations with the engineer.

375
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:02,708
Mr. Spock.

376
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,710
Welcome aboard.

377
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:32,612
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7413.4.

378
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:36,701
Thanks to Mr. Spock's
timely arrival and assistance...

379
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:40,371
we have the engines rebalanced
into full warp capacity.

380
00:49:40,454 --> 00:49:42,498
Repair time:
Less than three hours.

381
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:45,041
Which means we will now be
able to intercept intruder...

382
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:47,168
while still more than
a day from Earth.

383
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,382
Warp. 8.

384
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:58,639
.9.

385
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,896
Warp 2, sir.

386
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:10,693
Warp 3.

387
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:16,072
Warp 4.

388
00:50:18,617 --> 00:50:20,869
Warp 5.

389
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:23,581
Warp 6.

390
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:33,715
Warp 7.

391
00:50:48,356 --> 00:50:51,858
Science Officer Spock,
reporting as ordered, Captain.

392
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:55,445
Please, sit down.

393
00:50:55,528 --> 00:50:58,032
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

394
00:50:58,074 --> 00:51:01,202
You're just as warm
and sociable as ever.

395
00:51:01,242 --> 00:51:03,119
Nor have you, Doctor...

396
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:06,706
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

397
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:07,958
Gentlemen.

398
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:13,130
At last report,
you were on Vulcan...

399
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:15,132
apparently to stay.

400
00:51:15,882 --> 00:51:19,971
Yes, you were undergoing
the "Kolanear" discipline.

401
00:51:20,054 --> 00:51:21,179
Sit down.

402
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:25,643
If you are referring to the
Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.

403
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:30,648
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual...

404
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,193
that's supposed to purge
all remaining emotions.

405
00:51:34,277 --> 00:51:38,572
The Kolinahr is also a discipline
you broke to join us.

406
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:45,746
Will you, please, sit down?

407
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:58,925
On Vulcan I began sensing
a consciousness...

408
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:02,346
from a source more powerful
than I have ever encountered.

409
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:05,641
Thought patterns of
exactingly perfect order.

410
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:08,768
I believe they emanate
from the intruder.

411
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:12,188
I believe it may hold my answers.

412
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:15,693
Isn't it lucky for you that we just
happened to be heading your way?

413
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:18,403
Bones!

414
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:21,782
We need him.

415
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:24,534
I need him.

416
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:29,331
Then my presence is
to our mutual advantage.

417
00:52:35,463 --> 00:52:39,007
Any thought patterns
you might sense...

418
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:42,344
whether they appear to
affect you personally or not...

419
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:44,639
I expect immediately reported.

420
00:52:44,722 --> 00:52:46,681
Of course, Captain.

421
00:52:46,766 --> 00:52:50,769
- Is there anything else?
- No.

422
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:03,782
Jim?

423
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,746
If this super intelligence...

424
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:13,376
is as important to him as
he says it is, how do we know...

425
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:16,503
That he wouldn't put his own
interests ahead of the ship's?

426
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:20,967
I could never believe that.

427
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:23,114
Bridge to Officers' Lounge.
Captain Kirk.

428
00:53:23,155 --> 00:53:27,034
Revised estimate on
cloud visual contact: 3.7minutes.

429
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:46,005
Standard light, Engineer.

430
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:49,717
- Full mag on viewer.
- Full mag, sir.

431
00:53:58,978 --> 00:53:59,978
Lingua code?

432
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,690
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, sir.

433
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,150
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status red.

434
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:07,402
Captain, we are being scanned.

435
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:10,364
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.

436
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,449
It could be misinterpreted
as hostility.

437
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:16,161
Intruder scans emanating from
the exact center of the cloud.

438
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,164
Energy of a type...

439
00:54:18,998 --> 00:54:21,291
never before encountered.

440
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,092
There's no response to
friendship messages, sir.

441
00:54:31,177 --> 00:54:33,094
- Shall I go to battle stations?
- Negative.

442
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:34,847
We'll take
no provocative action.

443
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,932
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.

444
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:44,440
No, Mr. Decker, that could also
be misinterpreted as hostile.

445
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:47,943
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?

446
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,278
- Twelfth-power energy field.
- Twelfth-power?

447
00:54:50,362 --> 00:54:53,449
We've seen what their weapons can do.
Shouldn't we take every precaution?

448
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:54,992
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.

449
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:59,288
I suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

450
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:07,545
I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough...

451
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,132
Captain, as your exec
it's my duty...

452
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,634
to point out alternatives.

453
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,304
Yes, it is.

454
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:17,847
I stand corrected.

455
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,891
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

456
00:55:19,974 --> 00:55:24,230
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud center.

457
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:27,690
Bring us parallel
to whatever we find in there.

458
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,693
Mr. Sulu,
tactical plot on viewer.

459
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:30,902
Tactical on viewer, sir.

460
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:48,311
That measures 12th-power energy?

461
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:53,025
Thousands of starships
couldn't generate that much...

462
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,737
Mr. Spock?

463
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:01,324
Spock, tell me.

464
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:11,835
I sense...

465
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:13,336
puzzlement.

466
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,007
We have been contacted.

467
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,635
Why have we not replied?

468
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:22,679
Contacted?

469
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:24,431
How?

470
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,728
Force fields up full.
Deflectors, now.

471
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,902
Force fields and deflectors
up full, Captain.

472
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:44,659
Analysis, Mr. Spock.

473
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:47,789
Alien weapon is a form
of plasma energy, Captain.

474
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:49,916
Exact composition unknown.

475
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:52,210
Guidance system unknown.

476
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:56,963
All decks, brace for impact.

477
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:07,057
Engineering, status report.

478
00:57:09,057 --> 00:57:10,851
Systems overloading, Captain.

479
00:57:20,985 --> 00:57:22,112
Medic.

480
00:57:23,155 --> 00:57:24,989
Medics are coming.

481
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:36,813
The new screens held

482
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:37,849
Engineering to Bridge.

483
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:39,994
Cannot hold full power
on force fields.

484
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:43,197
Deflector power
is down 70 percent.

485
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,867
Divert auxiliary power
to deflectors.

486
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:50,168
Captain.

487
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,961
The intruder has been
attempting to communicate.

488
00:57:58,222 --> 00:58:00,141
I am now programming
our computer...

489
00:58:00,224 --> 00:58:03,896
to transmit lingua code at
their frequency and rate of speed.

490
00:58:03,978 --> 00:58:05,563
Commander.

491
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:16,742
Spock!

492
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:23,632
Here it comes.

493
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:25,634
Engineering, what's happening
to our force field?

494
00:58:25,717 --> 00:58:28,554
Our shields cannot handle
another attack.

495
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:30,097
Mr. Spock.

496
00:58:38,938 --> 00:58:40,148
Spock.

497
00:58:40,273 --> 00:58:42,318
Fifteen seconds.

498
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:44,445
Spock, transmit now.

499
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:45,945
Ten seconds.

500
00:58:46,864 --> 00:58:48,699
Transmitting.

501
00:59:00,711 --> 00:59:02,630
It would seem
our friendship messages...

502
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:05,592
have been received
and understood, Mr. Spock.

503
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,469
I would say that was
a logical assumption, Captain.

504
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:11,239
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.

505
00:59:11,405 --> 00:59:13,115
Holding present position, sir.

506
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,585
Tactical plot on viewer.

507
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:25,628
Course projection
on tactical, sir.

508
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,219
Opinion, Mr. Spock.

509
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:35,137
Recommend we proceed, Captain.

510
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:39,059
- Mr. Decker?
- I advise caution, Captain.

511
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:41,228
We can't withstand another attack.

512
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,480
That thing is 20 hours
away from Earth.

513
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,650
- We know nothing about it as yet.
- Precisely the point, Captain.

514
00:59:46,775 --> 00:59:48,735
We don't know what it'll do.

515
00:59:48,777 --> 00:59:51,445
Moving into that cloud
at this time...

516
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,072
is an unwarranted gamble.

517
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:56,992
How do you define "unwarranted"?

518
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:02,123
You asked my opinion, sir.

519
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,842
Viewer. Standard ahead.

520
01:00:21,268 --> 01:00:22,686
Navigator, maintain course.

521
01:00:22,768 --> 01:00:24,103
Helmsman...

522
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,023
steady as she goes.

523
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:43,815
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

524
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,067
Spock.

525
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,114
Instruments fluctuating,
Captain.

526
01:02:54,826 --> 01:02:56,744
Patterns unrecognizable.

527
01:04:41,034 --> 01:04:42,994
Transmit image of alien
to Starfleet.

528
01:04:43,036 --> 01:04:44,371
Advise we are attempting
further communication.

529
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:47,458
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

530
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:51,795
Any attempt to transmit out of
the cloud is being reflected back.

531
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:03,056
We are closing on it
rapidly, Captain.

532
01:05:11,356 --> 01:05:14,610
Reduce magnification
factor four, Mr. Sulu.

533
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:17,028
We are already
two settings below that, sir.

534
01:05:21,074 --> 01:05:23,244
Mr. Sulu...

535
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:25,411
bring us into
a parallel course...

536
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:27,414
over the alien...

537
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,791
at 500 meters.

538
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,543
Five hundred meters?

539
01:05:33,003 --> 01:05:35,463
Then take us out
to 100 kilometers distance...

540
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:37,382
adjusting parallel course.

541
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:40,010
Aye, sir.

542
01:07:40,492 --> 01:07:41,784
Viewer astern.

543
01:07:41,826 --> 01:07:44,119
Reverse angle on the view,
Captain.

544
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:05,065
Five hundred meters.

545
01:08:06,275 --> 01:08:07,943
Viewer ahead, sir.

546
01:10:38,393 --> 01:10:40,603
Hold relative position here.

547
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,353
Mr. Spock!

548
01:11:22,436 --> 01:11:25,064
Can that be one of their crew?

549
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,400
A probe from their vessel,
Captain.

550
01:11:28,443 --> 01:11:31,279
Plasma-energy combination.

551
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,282
Don't interfere with it.

552
01:11:34,364 --> 01:11:37,284
Absolutely, I will not interfere.

553
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,788
No one interfere.

554
01:11:42,289 --> 01:11:45,877
It doesn't seem interested in us.
Only the ship.

555
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,511
Computer off.

556
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:12,979
It's taking control
of the computer.

557
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:22,613
It's running our records...
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.

558
01:12:57,983 --> 01:12:59,400
Ilia!

559
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:05,657
Ilia!

560
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,431
This is how I define "unwarranted. "

561
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:43,444
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

562
01:13:58,314 --> 01:13:59,755
Full shields. Full remaining strength.

563
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:02,689
The ship is under attack.
Man all defensive stations.

564
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:12,324
Captain, we've been
seized by a tractor beam.

565
01:14:12,617 --> 01:14:14,743
Get someone up here
to take the navigator's station.

566
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,746
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.

567
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:20,041
- Emergency power.
- Going to full emergency.

568
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:24,837
But, Captain, if we don't break free
in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.

569
01:14:24,921 --> 01:14:26,881
We cannot break free, Captain.

570
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:29,091
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

571
01:14:29,175 --> 01:14:31,344
Engineering, belay that order.

572
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:33,430
Disengage all main drive systems.

573
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:55,159
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.

574
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:03,626
DiFalco, disengage engine
navigation relays now.

575
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:04,793
Aye, sir.

576
01:15:04,877 --> 01:15:06,837
Force field circuits
E-10 through 14...

577
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,465
show ready for reactivation.

578
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:10,050
Confirm, please.

579
01:15:11,592 --> 01:15:13,552
Scotty, drive systems
should be free now.

580
01:15:13,636 --> 01:15:14,720
Commander?

581
01:15:14,804 --> 01:15:16,765
Ready to launch
remote communications drone...

582
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:18,265
with complete ship's records...

583
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:20,268
including
our present situation, sir.

584
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,270
Delay launching
as long as possible.

585
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:24,980
Our drone can't escape as long
as we're held in their tractor.

586
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:26,024
Aye.

587
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:55,011
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam...

588
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:57,180
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

589
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,224
Break free to where, Commander?

590
01:16:00,516 --> 01:16:03,144
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

591
01:16:03,228 --> 01:16:07,399
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?

592
01:16:58,574 --> 01:17:01,118
Why bring us inside?

593
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:04,663
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

594
01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:06,498
They still can.

595
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:08,667
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.

596
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,963
Insatiable curiosity.

597
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:25,810
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

598
01:17:25,894 --> 01:17:27,436
We're trapped, sir.

599
01:17:28,563 --> 01:17:30,481
Reverse angle on the viewer,
Captain.

600
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:58,842
Tractor beam has released us,
Captain.

601
01:17:58,926 --> 01:18:01,595
Confirmed.
Vessel is floating free.

602
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,680
No forward momentum.

603
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:07,018
Viewer ahead.

604
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:08,560
Viewer ahead, sir.

605
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:17,319
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead one third.

606
01:18:17,404 --> 01:18:19,572
Thrusters ahead one third.

607
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:26,453
Let's take a look.

608
01:18:26,537 --> 01:18:28,872
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.

609
01:18:28,957 --> 01:18:31,208
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

610
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:33,252
Now that we're
looking down their throat.

611
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:36,422
Right, now that we've got them
just where they want us.

612
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:54,189
It's closing up.

613
01:18:57,318 --> 01:18:59,112
Hold position.

614
01:19:04,488 --> 01:19:05,532
Captain.

615
01:19:09,368 --> 01:19:12,079
All our scans
are being reflected back.

616
01:19:12,204 --> 01:19:13,622
Sensors are useless.

617
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,251
Damn.

618
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,635
What do you make of all this?

619
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,764
I believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber...

620
01:19:28,846 --> 01:19:32,600
undoubtedly part of
the vessel's inner mechanism.

621
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:35,311
I suspect it may be necess...

622
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,819
Intruder alert!
Deck 5. Officer's quarters.

623
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,654
Have Security meet me
at deck 5, main elevator.

624
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,115
Spock.
Mr. Decker, you have the com.

625
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,743
Hold positions.

626
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,766
You are the Kirk unit.

627
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,769
You will assist me.

628
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,855
I have been programmed by V'Ger...

629
01:20:19,939 --> 01:20:22,567
to observe and record...

630
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:25,612
normal functions
of the carbon-based units...

631
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,948
infesting USS Enterprise.

632
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,087
- Jim, what's going on?
- Tricorder.

633
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:49,677
Who is...

634
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,387
V'Ger?

635
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,849
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

636
01:20:55,391 --> 01:20:59,604
Is V'Ger the name of the captain
of the alien vessel?

637
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,023
Jim.

638
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:02,940
This is a mechanism.

639
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,609
A probe, Captain.

640
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,072
No doubt
a sensor-transceiver combination...

641
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,699
recording everything we say and do.

642
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:14,161
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?

643
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:16,829
That unit no longer functions.

644
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:18,748
I've been given its form...

645
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,792
to more readily communicate
with the carbon-based units...

646
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,920
infesting Enterprise.

647
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,006
Carbon-based units?

648
01:21:26,088 --> 01:21:29,426
Humans, Ensign Perez. Us.

649
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,511
Why does V'Ger travel...

650
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:35,640
to the third planet of
the solar system directly ahead?

651
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,975
To find the creator.

652
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,479
Find the creator?

653
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,230
Whose...

654
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,320
What does V'Ger want
with the creator?

655
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,905
To join with him.

656
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:54,326
To join with the creator? How?

657
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:57,037
V'Ger and the creator
will become one.

658
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,913
And who is the creator?

659
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:01,541
The creator is that
which created V'Ger.

660
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,710
Who is V'Ger?

661
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,462
V'Ger is that
which seeks the creator.

662
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,927
I'm ready to commence
my observations.

663
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,930
Doctor, a thorough examination
of this probe...

664
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,600
might provide some insight
into those who manufactured it...

665
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,894
and how to deal with them.

666
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:23,896
Fine.
Let's get her to sick bay.

667
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,487
I'm programmed
to observe and record...

668
01:22:30,569 --> 01:22:33,198
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

669
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,449
The, uh...

670
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:37,661
examination is a normal function.

671
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,039
You may proceed.

672
01:22:48,337 --> 01:22:50,798
Micro-miniature hydraulics...

673
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:55,511
sensors...

674
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:02,728
and molecule-sized
multiprocessor chips.

675
01:23:07,606 --> 01:23:09,234
And take a look at this.

676
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:11,987
An osmotic micropump, right here.

677
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,240
Even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

678
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:22,497
Every exocrine system
is the same, too...

679
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,125
even eye moisture.

680
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,418
Decker.

681
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:29,462
Fascinating.

682
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:31,631
Not "Decker unit. "

683
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:38,805
Gentlemen.

684
01:23:38,846 --> 01:23:40,306
Will.

685
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,194
- What happened to her?
- Captain.

686
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,613
This probe may be our key
to the aliens.

687
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,658
- Probe? Ilia?
- Exactly.

688
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:00,911
It is a programmed mechanism,
Commander.

689
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:04,706
Its body duplicates our navigator
in precise detail.

690
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:07,042
Suppose that,
beneath its programming...

691
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,878
the real Ilia's memory patterns
are duplicated with equal precision.

692
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,256
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.

693
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,134
They may have followed it
too precisely.

694
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,261
Ilia's memory...

695
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:20,971
her feelings of loyalty,
obedience, friendship...

696
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:23,975
might all be there.

697
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:28,145
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

698
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,856
That probe, in another form,
is what killed Ilia.

699
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,775
Commander...

700
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,319
Will, we're locked
in an alien vessel...

701
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,863
six hours from Earth's orbit.

702
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,448
Our only contact with our captor
is that probe.

703
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,784
If we can control it,
persuade it, use it...

704
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:47,498
I have recorded enough here.

705
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,542
You will now assist me further.

706
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,672
The, uh...

707
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,717
Decker unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

708
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:05,016
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.

709
01:25:06,475 --> 01:25:07,769
Aye, sir.

710
01:25:12,356 --> 01:25:16,778
I am concerned with that being our
only source of information, Captain.

711
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:24,286
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7414. 1.

712
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:28,164
Our best estimates place us
some four hours from Earth.

713
01:25:28,247 --> 01:25:30,292
No significant progress
thus far...

714
01:25:30,332 --> 01:25:34,296
reviving Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe.

715
01:25:34,378 --> 01:25:38,300
This remains our only means
of contact with our captor.

716
01:25:38,382 --> 01:25:40,801
All those vessels
were called Enterprise.

717
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:56,400
The carbon units
use this area for recreation.

718
01:25:56,525 --> 01:25:58,362
This is one of the games.

719
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:06,869
What types of recreation does
the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

720
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,039
The words "recreation"...

721
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,627
and "enjoy"...

722
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:16,087
have no meaning
to my programming.

723
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:26,180
Ilia enjoyed this game.

724
01:26:28,307 --> 01:26:30,185
She nearly always won.

725
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,194
Good. He's using
audiovisual association.

726
01:27:15,604 --> 01:27:17,690
This device serves no purpose.

727
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:33,748
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

728
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:36,752
Enterprise would be unable
to function without carbon units.

729
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:41,172
More data concerning
this functioning is necessary...

730
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,675
before carbon units
can be patterned...

731
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:45,676
for data storage.

732
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:50,890
What does that mean?

733
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,185
When my examination is complete...

734
01:27:54,226 --> 01:27:57,855
all carbon units will be
reduced to data patterns.

735
01:27:58,689 --> 01:28:00,524
Within you...

736
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:03,737
are the memory patterns
of a certain carbon unit.

737
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:06,864
If I can help you
to revive those patterns...

738
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,867
you could understand
our functions better.

739
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,037
That is logical.

740
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:13,913
You may proceed.

741
01:28:57,623 --> 01:29:01,545
I remember Lieutenant Ilia
once mentioning she wore that.

742
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:10,703
On Delta.

743
01:29:10,787 --> 01:29:12,329
Remember?

744
01:29:12,372 --> 01:29:13,664
Ilia.

745
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:21,213
Dr. Chapel.

746
01:29:31,826 --> 01:29:32,952
Will?

747
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:36,329
Ilia.

748
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:38,875
Commander.

749
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,377
Commander.

750
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,131
This is a mechanism.

751
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,511
Ilia...

752
01:29:53,014 --> 01:29:56,475
help us make direct contact
with V'Ger.

753
01:29:57,435 --> 01:29:58,519
I cannot.

754
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:04,317
This creator V'Ger is looking for...
what is it?

755
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,944
V'Ger does not know.

756
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,850
Computer, commence recording.

757
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:43,355
Captain Kirk, these messages
will detail my attempt...

758
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,524
to contact the aliens.

759
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:58,671
Warning! Your emergency evacuation
thruster pack has been armed.

760
01:30:57,579 --> 01:31:01,136
Once ignited the
burn duration is ten seconds.

761
01:31:01,082 --> 01:31:02,515
There might not be
a warning.

762
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,199
Push the igniter enable release...

763
01:31:05,747 --> 01:31:08,514
to begin a ten second
countdown to the thruster ignition.

764
01:31:09,427 --> 01:31:12,981
To abort countdown leave the
control arm up.

765
01:31:13,605 --> 01:31:17,234
I intend to calculate thruster
ignition and acceleration rate...

766
01:31:17,275 --> 01:31:19,694
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

767
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:21,697
This should facilitate
a better view...

768
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,698
of the interior
of the alien spacecraft.

769
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:33,125
Captain, Starfleet signals
are growing in strength, sir.

770
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:35,502
They still have the intruder
on their monitors.

771
01:31:35,586 --> 01:31:37,880
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, sir.

772
01:31:37,963 --> 01:31:41,466
Lunar beacons indicate intruder
on a course into Earth orbit.

773
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:44,886
Sir, air lock 4
has been opened.

774
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:47,556
A thruster suit
is reported missing.

775
01:31:49,559 --> 01:31:51,476
A thruster suit?

776
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:55,021
That's Spock.

777
01:31:55,105 --> 01:31:57,024
Damn him.

778
01:31:57,065 --> 01:31:58,734
Bring him back here.

779
01:31:58,818 --> 01:32:00,235
No, wait.

780
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:10,579
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, sir.

781
01:33:27,614 --> 01:33:29,283
I have successfully penetrated...

782
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:31,327
the next chamber
of the alien's interior...

783
01:33:31,368 --> 01:33:34,497
and I'm witnessing
some sort of dimensional image...

784
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:36,998
which I believe to be
a representation...

785
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:38,835
of V'Ger's home planet.

786
01:33:46,676 --> 01:33:48,677
I'm passing through
a connecting tunnel.

787
01:33:48,677 --> 01:33:52,014
Apparently, a kind of
plasma-energy conduit.

788
01:33:52,806 --> 01:33:55,810
Possibly a field coil for
a gigantic imaging system.

789
01:34:06,904 --> 01:34:08,155
Curious.

790
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:11,868
I'm seeing images
of planets, moons, stars...

791
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:14,662
whole galaxies
all stored here, recorded.

792
01:34:14,744 --> 01:34:17,707
It could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

793
01:34:23,546 --> 01:34:25,006
But who or what...

794
01:34:26,006 --> 01:34:27,466
are we dealing with?

795
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:31,679
The Epsilon 9 station,
stored here with every detail.

796
01:34:39,645 --> 01:34:41,771
Captain, I am now
quite convinced...

797
01:34:41,855 --> 01:34:44,065
that all of this is V'Ger...

798
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:47,028
that we are inside
a living machine.

799
01:34:52,658 --> 01:34:53,743
Ilia.

800
01:34:58,872 --> 01:35:01,167
The sensor...

801
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:03,752
must contain
some special meaning.

802
01:35:07,547 --> 01:35:09,466
I must try to mind-meld with it.

803
01:36:02,936 --> 01:36:04,229
Spock.

804
01:36:05,189 --> 01:36:06,606
Spock!

805
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:09,277
Spock.

806
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:28,921
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fiber connection.

807
01:36:32,175 --> 01:36:36,095
Indications of some
neurological trauma.

808
01:36:36,136 --> 01:36:39,681
The power pouring through that
mind-meld must have been staggering.

809
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,274
Spock.

810
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:49,817
Jim.

811
01:36:52,987 --> 01:36:54,905
I should have known.

812
01:36:54,988 --> 01:36:57,240
Were you right...

813
01:36:57,283 --> 01:36:58,493
about V'Ger?

814
01:36:59,577 --> 01:37:02,787
A life-form of its own.

815
01:37:02,913 --> 01:37:05,500
A conscious, living entity.

816
01:37:05,582 --> 01:37:07,001
A living machine?

817
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,045
It considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

818
01:37:09,086 --> 01:37:11,380
That's why the probe
refers to our ship as an entity.

819
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:13,591
L saw V'Ger's planet.

820
01:37:14,675 --> 01:37:18,386
A planet populated
by living machines.

821
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:20,555
Unbelievable technology.

822
01:37:23,016 --> 01:37:26,479
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

823
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:30,065
And yet...

824
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:32,443
with all its pure logic...

825
01:37:33,152 --> 01:37:35,404
V'Ger is barren...

826
01:37:35,529 --> 01:37:36,780
cold.

827
01:37:36,863 --> 01:37:38,032
No mystery.

828
01:37:39,158 --> 01:37:40,576
No beauty.

829
01:37:45,038 --> 01:37:47,707
Should have known.

830
01:37:49,502 --> 01:37:50,795
Known?

831
01:37:51,878 --> 01:37:53,631
Known what? Spock.

832
01:38:02,181 --> 01:38:05,976
What should you have known?
What should you have known?

833
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:12,567
Jim...

834
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:18,530
this...

835
01:38:18,573 --> 01:38:20,492
simple feeling...

836
01:38:21,993 --> 01:38:24,828
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

837
01:38:33,195 --> 01:38:36,239
No meaning, no hope.

838
01:38:37,492 --> 01:38:39,034
Jim...

839
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:42,372
no answers.

840
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:45,582
It's asking questions.

841
01:38:45,625 --> 01:38:48,086
"Is this...

842
01:38:48,168 --> 01:38:50,421
all that I am?

843
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,091
Is there nothing more?"

844
01:38:59,012 --> 01:39:00,890
Bridge to Captain.

845
01:39:04,394 --> 01:39:05,310
Kirk here.

846
01:39:05,395 --> 01:39:08,189
A faint signal
from Starfleet, sir.

847
01:39:08,271 --> 01:39:11,192
Intruder cloud has been located
on their outer monitors...

848
01:39:11,274 --> 01:39:13,360
for the past 27 minutes.

849
01:39:13,403 --> 01:39:16,948
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

850
01:39:17,073 --> 01:39:20,827
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

851
01:39:20,909 --> 01:39:22,828
We are three minutes
from Earth orbit.

852
01:39:22,912 --> 01:39:24,831
I'll be right there.

853
01:39:28,835 --> 01:39:30,795
I need Spock on the bridge.

854
01:39:30,837 --> 01:39:33,588
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

855
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:40,195
A machine planet...
sending a machine to earth...

856
01:39:42,235 --> 01:39:44,231
looking for its creator...

857
01:39:47,344 --> 01:39:49,365
It's absolutely... incredible.

858
01:39:53,762 --> 01:39:56,490
Mr.Chekov, commander Deker's
present location.

859
01:39:57,152 --> 01:39:58,934
At engineering sir.

860
01:40:08,525 --> 01:40:12,863
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

861
01:40:14,864 --> 01:40:17,659
V'Ger is transmitting a signal.

862
01:40:19,204 --> 01:40:20,706
Jim.

863
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:23,751
From V'Ger.

864
01:40:26,962 --> 01:40:30,507
V'Ger signals the creator.

865
01:40:45,135 --> 01:40:47,512
Spock?

866
01:40:47,595 --> 01:40:50,224
A simple binary code...

867
01:40:50,306 --> 01:40:53,018
transmitted
by carrier wave signal.

868
01:40:54,395 --> 01:40:55,854
Radio.

869
01:40:57,814 --> 01:40:59,024
Radio?

870
01:41:04,195 --> 01:41:05,738
Jim.

871
01:41:05,864 --> 01:41:08,576
V'Ger expects an answer.

872
01:41:09,702 --> 01:41:10,994
An answer?

873
01:41:11,036 --> 01:41:13,037
I don't know the question.

874
01:41:14,414 --> 01:41:16,876
The creator has not responded.

875
01:41:30,194 --> 01:41:34,115
All planetary defense systems
have just gone inoperative.

876
01:42:14,113 --> 01:42:17,868
Sir, Starfleet computes
the devices are proceeding...

877
01:42:17,951 --> 01:42:21,121
toward equidistant positions
orbiting the planet.

878
01:42:21,203 --> 01:42:22,956
They're the same things
that hit us.

879
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:25,876
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

880
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:27,210
From those positions...

881
01:42:27,252 --> 01:42:29,796
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

882
01:42:43,018 --> 01:42:44,728
Why?

883
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:47,064
The creator has not answered.

884
01:42:47,104 --> 01:42:51,025
The carbon unit infestation is to be
removed from the creator's planet.

885
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:52,027
Why?

886
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:55,113
You infest Enterprise.

887
01:42:55,238 --> 01:42:57,783
You interfere with the creator
in the same manner.

888
01:43:00,559 --> 01:43:02,060
A machine.

889
01:43:19,533 --> 01:43:20,951
Captain.

890
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,957
V'Ger is a child.

891
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,877
I suggest you treat it as such.

892
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,755
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.

893
01:43:32,837 --> 01:43:34,715
A child...

894
01:43:34,756 --> 01:43:38,219
evolving, learning, searching...

895
01:43:39,302 --> 01:43:41,764
instinctively needing.

896
01:43:41,805 --> 01:43:43,807
- Needing what?
- Spock.

897
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:48,395
This child is about to wipe out
every living thing on Earth.

898
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:51,481
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?

899
01:43:54,693 --> 01:43:57,195
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.

900
01:43:58,363 --> 01:44:01,033
But, like so many of us...

901
01:44:01,074 --> 01:44:03,034
it does not know what.

902
01:44:16,297 --> 01:44:20,010
The carbon units know why
the creator has not responded.

903
01:44:23,221 --> 01:44:25,224
Disclose the information.

904
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:29,270
Not until V'Ger withdraws the
devices orbiting the third planet.

905
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:30,979
Captain.

906
01:44:32,463 --> 01:44:34,507
I'm losing Starfleet.

907
01:44:34,591 --> 01:44:37,010
Interference from V'Ger.

908
01:44:37,051 --> 01:44:41,014
Kirk unit,
disclose the information.

909
01:44:41,055 --> 01:44:44,893
Why has the creator not responded?

910
01:44:44,976 --> 01:44:46,060
No.

911
01:44:50,064 --> 01:44:51,899
Secure all stations.

912
01:44:51,942 --> 01:44:53,402
Clear the bridge.

913
01:44:56,279 --> 01:44:58,614
Clear the bridge, Captain?

914
01:44:58,698 --> 01:45:01,493
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

915
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:12,462
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.

916
01:45:14,088 --> 01:45:16,175
V'Ger requires the information.

917
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,680
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.

918
01:45:22,722 --> 01:45:25,516
Jim, what the hell
kind of strategy is this?

919
01:45:26,768 --> 01:45:29,313
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

920
01:45:29,313 --> 01:45:31,023
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise...

921
01:45:31,064 --> 01:45:33,524
the information that V'Ger requires
will also be destroyed.

922
01:45:33,567 --> 01:45:36,694
It is illogical to withhold
required information.

923
01:45:37,779 --> 01:45:39,280
Kirk unit!

924
01:45:39,363 --> 01:45:40,532
Kirk unit.

925
01:45:44,036 --> 01:45:46,037
Why do you not
disclose information?

926
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:53,545
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all
carbon units on the third planet.

927
01:45:53,587 --> 01:45:55,505
They have repressed the creator.

928
01:45:55,546 --> 01:45:58,216
The information
will not be disclosed.

929
01:45:59,384 --> 01:46:01,386
V'Ger needs the information.

930
01:46:01,427 --> 01:46:06,600
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

931
01:46:07,391 --> 01:46:09,228
V'Ger will comply...

932
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:12,314
if the carbon units will
disclose the information.

933
01:46:18,862 --> 01:46:20,863
It learns fast, doesn't it?

934
01:46:20,948 --> 01:46:24,283
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger...

935
01:46:24,326 --> 01:46:28,204
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.

936
01:46:28,287 --> 01:46:31,166
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point, then.

937
01:46:31,207 --> 01:46:32,667
Precisely.

938
01:46:42,511 --> 01:46:46,390
The carbon unit's information cannot
be disclosed to V'Ger's probe...

939
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:49,393
but only to V'Ger directly.

940
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:14,333
Forward motion, Captain.

941
01:47:14,376 --> 01:47:15,627
Tractor beam.

942
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:36,338
Captain, what's the next move?

943
01:47:38,173 --> 01:47:40,260
The question is, Mr. Decker...

944
01:47:40,301 --> 01:47:42,220
is there a next move?

945
01:47:45,055 --> 01:47:46,975
Resume duty stations.

946
01:47:48,184 --> 01:47:50,145
All personnel, resume stations.

947
01:47:55,399 --> 01:47:59,738
Well, Mr. Decker,
it seems my bluff has been called.

948
01:48:01,698 --> 01:48:04,326
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

949
01:48:08,704 --> 01:48:12,042
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

950
01:48:12,792 --> 01:48:15,545
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.

951
01:48:22,845 --> 01:48:26,432
Captain, I believe
that is our destination.

952
01:48:31,523 --> 01:48:35,109
Forward motion slowing, Captain.

953
01:48:38,284 --> 01:48:40,578
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

954
01:48:50,078 --> 01:48:51,921
Forward motion stopped, Captain.

955
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:57,537
V'Ger.

956
01:48:58,072 --> 01:49:01,349
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

957
01:49:01,384 --> 01:49:03,520
It's directly ahead.

958
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:08,494
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its creator.

959
01:49:11,599 --> 01:49:14,851
The carbon units
will now provide V'Ger...

960
01:49:14,935 --> 01:49:17,229
with the required information.

961
01:49:23,903 --> 01:49:26,488
Mr. Spock. Bones.

962
01:49:29,824 --> 01:49:33,703
Mr. Decker, I will contact you
every five minutes.

963
01:49:33,787 --> 01:49:36,082
Captain.

964
01:49:37,667 --> 01:49:39,085
I'd like to go along.

965
01:49:42,796 --> 01:49:44,715
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.

966
01:51:38,997 --> 01:51:40,832
V'Ger.

967
01:52:52,278 --> 01:52:56,740
"V... G-E-R."

968
01:52:59,368 --> 01:53:00,994
V'Ger.

969
01:53:14,259 --> 01:53:17,470
"V-O-Y-A-G-E-R."

970
01:53:17,554 --> 01:53:18,805
Voyager.

971
01:53:23,143 --> 01:53:24,978
Voyager 6.

972
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:29,440
NASA. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

973
01:53:29,481 --> 01:53:31,443
Jim...

974
01:53:31,484 --> 01:53:34,112
this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

975
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:39,701
Voyager series.

976
01:53:41,411 --> 01:53:43,412
Designed to collect data...

977
01:53:45,914 --> 01:53:48,501
and transmit it back to Earth.

978
01:54:30,372 --> 01:54:32,292
Captain...

979
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:37,213
Voyager 6 disappeared into what
they used to call a black hole.

980
01:54:37,296 --> 01:54:40,257
It must have emerged
on the far side of the galaxy...

981
01:54:41,426 --> 01:54:44,554
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

982
01:54:44,595 --> 01:54:48,140
The machine inhabitants found it
to be one of their own kind...

983
01:54:48,225 --> 01:54:50,685
primitive, yet kindred.

984
01:54:50,769 --> 01:54:53,729
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming...

985
01:54:53,814 --> 01:54:56,233
collect all data possible.

986
01:54:57,484 --> 01:54:59,403
Learn all that is learnable.

987
01:55:01,404 --> 01:55:04,157
Return that information
to its creator.

988
01:55:04,198 --> 01:55:05,699
Precisely, Mr. Decker.

989
01:55:06,576 --> 01:55:09,121
The machines
interpreted it literally.

990
01:55:09,203 --> 01:55:11,122
They built this entire vessel...

991
01:55:11,206 --> 01:55:14,792
so that Voyager could actually
fulfill its programming.

992
01:55:14,876 --> 01:55:16,752
And on its journey back...

993
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,341
it amassed so much knowledge...

994
01:55:22,759 --> 01:55:25,177
it achieved consciousness itself.

995
01:55:26,887 --> 01:55:28,849
It became a living thing.

996
01:55:42,779 --> 01:55:45,114
Kirk unit.

997
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:47,199
V'Ger awaits the information.

998
01:55:48,827 --> 01:55:50,244
Enterprise...

999
01:55:51,496 --> 01:55:53,832
order up the ship's
computer library records...

1000
01:55:53,914 --> 01:55:57,335
on the late 20th-century
NASA probe Voyager 6.

1001
01:55:57,418 --> 01:56:00,255
Specifically, we want
the old NASA code signal...

1002
01:56:00,296 --> 01:56:02,423
that instructs the probe
to transmit its data.

1003
01:56:02,506 --> 01:56:04,592
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
- Aye, sir.

1004
01:56:04,676 --> 01:56:06,677
That's what it's been signaling...

1005
01:56:06,761 --> 01:56:09,221
its readiness
to transmit its information.

1006
01:56:09,221 --> 01:56:11,224
And there's no one on Earth...

1007
01:56:11,224 --> 01:56:13,601
who could recognize the old signal
and send a response.

1008
01:56:13,685 --> 01:56:15,854
The creator does not answer.

1009
01:56:26,323 --> 01:56:27,740
V'Ger.

1010
01:56:33,747 --> 01:56:35,039
V'Ger.

1011
01:56:37,208 --> 01:56:38,627
V'Ger!

1012
01:56:43,215 --> 01:56:46,051
We are the creator.

1013
01:56:46,092 --> 01:56:48,052
That is not logical.

1014
01:56:48,095 --> 01:56:50,055
Carbon units
are not true life-forms.

1015
01:56:50,096 --> 01:56:51,347
We will prove it.

1016
01:56:51,389 --> 01:56:55,726
We will make it possible for you
to complete your programming.

1017
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:58,270
Only the creator
could accomplish that.

1018
01:57:00,398 --> 01:57:01,565
Enterprise?

1019
01:57:01,608 --> 01:57:04,610
We have just received
the response code, Captain.

1020
01:57:04,694 --> 01:57:07,154
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency...

1021
01:57:07,279 --> 01:57:09,573
and transmit the code now.

1022
01:57:09,615 --> 01:57:10,908
Transmitting.

1023
01:57:12,118 --> 01:57:14,328
5-0-4...

1024
01:57:14,412 --> 01:57:16,497
3-2-9...

1025
01:57:16,581 --> 01:57:18,500
3-1-7...

1026
01:57:19,251 --> 01:57:21,002
5-1-0...

1027
01:57:21,962 --> 01:57:23,755
and the final sequence.

1028
01:57:23,838 --> 01:57:26,257
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.

1029
01:57:39,229 --> 01:57:42,149
Voyager is not transmitting
its data, Captain.

1030
01:57:44,067 --> 01:57:46,528
The creator must join with V'Ger.

1031
01:57:49,113 --> 01:57:51,908
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.

1032
01:57:56,287 --> 01:57:59,123
The creator must join with V'Ger.

1033
01:58:19,978 --> 01:58:22,189
Voyager is not transmitting,
Captain...

1034
01:58:22,271 --> 01:58:24,858
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

1035
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:27,610
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.

1036
01:58:27,652 --> 01:58:29,613
Enterprise, stand by.

1037
01:58:38,412 --> 01:58:42,125
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.

1038
01:58:42,208 --> 01:58:44,627
By V'Ger itself.

1039
01:58:44,711 --> 01:58:47,756
- Why?
- To prevent reception.

1040
01:58:47,838 --> 01:58:49,298
Of course.

1041
01:58:49,381 --> 01:58:52,094
To bring the creator here.

1042
01:58:52,176 --> 01:58:54,805
To finish transmitting
the code in person.

1043
01:58:58,766 --> 01:58:59,935
To touch the creator.

1044
01:59:00,268 --> 01:59:02,854
Capture God?

1045
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:07,692
V'Ger's liable to be in for
one hell of a disappointment.

1046
01:59:07,775 --> 01:59:09,944
Perhaps not, Doctor.

1047
01:59:33,135 --> 01:59:35,386
Captain.

1048
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,353
V'Ger must evolve.

1049
01:59:43,395 --> 01:59:47,399
Its knowledge has reached the limits
of this universe. It must evolve.

1050
01:59:47,481 --> 01:59:50,569
What it requires of its god, Doctor,
is the answer to its question...

1051
01:59:50,652 --> 01:59:52,237
Is there nothing more?

1052
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:55,114
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

1053
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:57,199
Other dimensions.
Higher levels of being.

1054
01:59:57,242 --> 01:59:59,618
The existence of which
cannot be proven logically.

1055
01:59:59,703 --> 02:00:03,122
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

1056
02:00:03,206 --> 02:00:05,792
What V'Ger needs
in order to evolve...

1057
02:00:05,833 --> 02:00:08,127
is a human quality...

1058
02:00:08,211 --> 02:00:10,212
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

1059
02:00:14,634 --> 02:00:17,261
Joining with its creator
might accomplish that.

1060
02:00:17,345 --> 02:00:20,390
You mean this machine wants to
physically join with a human?

1061
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:23,100
Is that possible?

1062
02:00:26,395 --> 02:00:27,814
Let's find out.

1063
02:00:36,238 --> 02:00:37,573
Decker.

1064
02:00:37,657 --> 02:00:40,786
I'm gonna key the final sequence
through the ground test computer.

1065
02:00:40,868 --> 02:00:42,828
You don't know
what that'll do to you!

1066
02:00:43,579 --> 02:00:45,414
Yes, I do, Doctor.

1067
02:00:51,755 --> 02:00:52,922
Decker, don't.

1068
02:00:52,963 --> 02:00:55,841
Jim, I want this.

1069
02:00:55,926 --> 02:01:00,262
As much as you wanted
the Enterprise, I want this.

1070
02:03:52,524 --> 02:03:53,943
Captain.

1071
02:03:55,569 --> 02:04:00,115
Spock, did we just see the beginning
of a new life-form?

1072
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:03,493
Yes, Captain.
We witnessed a birth.

1073
02:04:03,578 --> 02:04:06,288
Possibly a next step
in our evolution.

1074
02:04:06,329 --> 02:04:08,039
I wonder.

1075
02:04:08,123 --> 02:04:11,002
Well, it's been a long time
since I delivered a baby.

1076
02:04:11,085 --> 02:04:13,128
L hope we got this one off
to a good start.

1077
02:04:13,171 --> 02:04:15,756
I hope so too.

1078
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,926
I think we gave it the ability to
create its own sense of purpose...

1079
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:23,847
out of our own human weaknesses...

1080
02:04:25,099 --> 02:04:27,769
and the drive that compels us
to overcome them.

1081
02:04:27,851 --> 02:04:31,730
And a lot of foolish human emotions.
Right, Mr. Spock?

1082
02:04:31,773 --> 02:04:33,565
Quite true, Doctor.

1083
02:04:33,608 --> 02:04:37,153
Unfortunately, it will have to
deal with them as well.

1084
02:04:37,235 --> 02:04:39,197
Interrogative from Starfleet.

1085
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:42,949
They're requesting damage and injury
reports and complete vessel status.

1086
02:04:42,992 --> 02:04:44,827
Report two casualties.

1087
02:04:45,494 --> 02:04:47,287
Lieutenant Ilia.

1088
02:04:48,497 --> 02:04:49,916
Captain Decker.

1089
02:04:49,957 --> 02:04:51,458
- Aye, sir.
- Correction.

1090
02:04:51,542 --> 02:04:53,418
They're not casualties.

1091
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:54,921
They...

1092
02:04:58,091 --> 02:05:00,592
List them as missing.

1093
02:05:00,635 --> 02:05:02,720
Vessel status: Fully operational.

1094
02:05:02,804 --> 02:05:04,846
Aye, sir.

1095
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:08,768
Mr. Scott, shall we give
the Enterprise a proper shakedown?

1096
02:05:09,601 --> 02:05:12,854
I would say it's time
for that, sir, aye.

1097
02:05:13,064 --> 02:05:16,024
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

1098
02:05:16,067 --> 02:05:18,528
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.

1099
02:05:18,569 --> 02:05:21,029
My task on Vulcan is completed.

1100
02:05:22,448 --> 02:05:24,908
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1.

1101
02:05:24,992 --> 02:05:27,453
- Warp 1, sir.
- Heading, sir?

1102
02:05:31,582 --> 02:05:33,542
Out there.

1103
02:05:35,211 --> 02:05:37,130
That away.
