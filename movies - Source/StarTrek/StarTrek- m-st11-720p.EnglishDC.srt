1
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:11,846
All right, so,
we should talk about this immediately.

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,182
Who are you, by the way?

3
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,141
- I'm J.J. Who are you?
- I'm Damon.

4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,643
- Where's Bob?
- Hey, I'm over here. Hi, guys.

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,437
- Alex, you around?
- I'm right here.

6
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,899
- So this piece of music...
- Bryan Burk, sound off.

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:24,693
- Is Bryan there?
- Hi. I'm here. I'm in New York.

8
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:27,905
- This is ridiculous.
- Bryan is joining us via satellite today.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,824
This music was not the original piece
of music in this opening sequence.

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,161
Michael Giacchino had this recorded

11
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,664
like two weeks before
we finished the mix,

12
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,960
- and I think this is a genius move.
- Unbelievably awesome.

13
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,463
It's great 'cause it makes
the Bad Robot logo really creepy.

14
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,884
- It does. It's very ominous.
- It is scary.

15
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,427
- For the first time ever that robot...
- Is actually bad.

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,054
...freaks me out.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,936
The movie didn't originally
open with this.

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,148
- Nope.
- It opened with the birth of Spock.

19
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:07,986
And why was it changed, J. J?

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,823
Well, we had the birth of Spock.
Then we had the birth of Kirk.

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,367
Then we had young Spock,
then young Kirk.

22
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,328
Then we had older Spock,
then older Kirk.

23
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:19,831
And it just was too much back and forth
for too long,

24
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:23,918
so we removed the birth of Spock

25
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,006
and made the Kirk birth sequence
a pre-credit sequence

26
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:31,926
to kind of reset the movie, which I think
helped the pace of the open.

27
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,097
I can't imagine the movie
starting any other way than this.

28
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:39,100
That's very funny because
we only debated it for a year and a half.

29
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,811
- But until we all saw it...
- Until we saw it.

30
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:43,063
- Until we saw it.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,816
I mean, I think the thing
that's so genius about this is that

32
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,069
you're dropping the audience
right into the middle of a situation

33
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,405
and a terror that's so cool.

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,365
That was Randy Pausch, by the way,
who walked right past Robau.

35
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,411
We were also really concerned
about canon and continuity,

36
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,246
because Spock is older than Kirk.

37
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,915
- Right. That's right.
- So you couldn't do this scene first,

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,626
and then Spock's birth because of that.

39
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:09,923
So, it was either start the movie
with this scene and lose Spock's birth,

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,758
which was... We're basically like,

41
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:13,801
"If we lose that,
we lose his attachment to his mother.

42
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,929
"We don't understand
that his mom is human."

43
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,431
Because in the other scene
that Winona is in,

44
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,058
her ears are actually wrapped,

45
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:24,562
so other than dialogue,
you don't know that she's a human.

46
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,397
But enough about that.

47
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:30,318
I love the way that the weapon systems
on the <i>Narada</i> work.

48
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:33,739
The other thing that's genius for me
about this is the way you cut it.

49
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,240
What's the <i>Kelvin</i> named after?
Oh, sorry.

50
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,659
- I thought you were done.
- Kelvin was my grandfather. Sorry.

51
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,954
Oh, yeah.
No, you should tell that story first.

52
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,500
Harry Kelvin was my grandfather.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,001
I love that story.

54
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,920
I use his name in almost everything
that I've worked on.

55
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:50,004
- That story gets me every time.
- Fade out.

56
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,258
No, but he was the guy
who sort of inspired me

57
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:56,844
to make movies and make things,
and have things work.

58
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,388
So he was sort of the...

59
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,974
Bryan Burk, was this your idea
for sound design, right here?

60
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,185
I'd like to take credit for this,

61
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,271
but this was J.J.'s sound design
from the very first cut.

62
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,067
I love the idea that everything goes out

63
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:12,819
when we enter
the cold vastness of space.

64
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,865
Well, it's a weird thing 'cause I wanted
to do silent space from the beginning,

65
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,909
but the truth is it feels like
the movie's not completed

66
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,495
when you actually
have silence in space.

67
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,829
It feels like the weight is not there.

68
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,292
I sort of did the, you know, occasional...

69
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:31,003
Acknowledgement
that you're aware of reality.

70
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,381
Yeah, that it sort of says that

71
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:33,924
the reality is that there's silence
in space,

72
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,510
but I wanted to, you know,
give the sequences,

73
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:41,889
for the most part, the sound that
you would expect to feel in here.

74
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:49,230
If you roll back, not us, but you,
the viewer, on the shot of the screen,

75
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,316
- you'll see there's this...
- How could we roll back?

76
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,985
Are you in a coffee can?

77
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,736
There are these handrails,
which is really kind of a testament

78
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,448
to Scott Chambliss,
our production designer,

79
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:01,325
who really made the ship really tangible.

80
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,871
And I remember being on set
with a friend who was visiting,

81
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,122
who was commenting that
when you think about it,

82
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,000
and you're flying through space
and you're bouncing around,

83
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,461
just the fact that these are here
and you can hold on to them

84
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:13,546
is something that you would assume
would be on all spaceships.

85
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,341
And I can't remember seeing it
in another film.

86
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,509
There they are.

87
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,762
I love the way that Robau there says,
"You're the captain now, Mr Kirk."

88
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,557
Because if you've never seen
<i>Star Trek</i> before, or if you have,

89
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,768
in that moment, watching this movie,
you're like,

90
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,187
"That's Kirk.
I've just been introduced to Kirk."

91
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,149
Because you've never seen
Chris Pine before.

92
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:35,819
And the actor that we cast looks enough

93
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,654
- like Chris Pine that you're like...
- My sister thought it was Chris Pine.

94
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,492
She said to me, "Why did you cast
the same actor as the father and Kirk?"

95
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,701
- Right.
- It's like, "I didn't."

96
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,329
The thing is
this is one of my favourite sequences

97
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:51,959
because this was shot, literally all
of this if you include the CG stuff,

98
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,545
months if not over a year apart.

99
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,798
So, you know,
Robau going from the Bridge,

100
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,968
which we shot at Paramount,
to going down the turbo lift,

101
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,637
which was shot at a power plant
in Long Beach,

102
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:06,098
to his walking down the corridor
and into the shuttle,

103
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:09,394
which we shot in two different locations
back at Paramount.

104
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,274
You know, all these sequences
have dozens if not hundreds of pieces

105
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,526
that are shot so far apart.

106
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,612
It's just the fun of filmmaking
seeing them all come together.

107
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:22,031
And so how much in prep
did you end up...

108
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,492
I mean, what of it was improvised
and what of it was prep?

109
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,161
- Was all of it prep?
- Well, in general,

110
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:33,334
what I tried to do is prep as little
specifics as possible in terms of shots.

111
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,838
So, I wanted to be able to go to the set
and make things up as I went along,

112
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,841
and sort of, you know, wing it.

113
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:42,136
But then there are certain sequences,
like the space jump that come later

114
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:44,471
and some of the <i>Kelvin</i> attack,

115
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,807
that we needed to know
what we needed to build.

116
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:52,103
So, within the parameters
of what we had, you know,

117
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:55,481
I tried to storyboard nothing
so that the thing would have an energy

118
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,528
and would feel vital, and we get
to make it up as we went along.

119
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:03,031
And yet, certain things we needed
to know how we were physically

120
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:04,783
ever gonna do them.
I remember the first time

121
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,660
they saw the space jump,
they were like, "What?"

122
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:09,036
- Right.
- "Forget it. We can't shoot this."

123
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,372
I love Bana here.

124
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,209
It's awesome
that he doesn't say a single word.

125
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,793
Yeah, he's terrific.

126
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,923
I mean, I remember the first day
that I shot on this set,

127
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,468
I literally just broke out in a sweat
because I was surrounded

128
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:27,180
by all these bald dudes with face tattoos

129
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:31,726
and pointy ears and the wardrobe.

130
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:37,274
And I was so afraid
that it was gonna look insanely stupid.

131
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,858
- I really was.
- My favourite cut

132
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,485
is coming up right here.

133
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,697
Now that's all one shot.
We actually cut it.

134
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,115
Right here. The fact that you cut out

135
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,408
- before he finishes his sentence.
- That's right.

136
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,326
That is so great. That is my favourite.

137
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,995
- I actually debated that.
- Can you talk about that?

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,747
Because, literally, it is the most brilliant
editing choice ever.

139
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,125
It was because he said it,
and then it cut, and I just thought,

140
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,711
"You know what? Let's..." It just felt
like the energy of the moment

141
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,213
- wanted to move ahead.
- Yeah. Yes.

142
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:01,464
- It just was like...
- Because, you know,

143
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,300
- it's just genius.
- Yeah, it's funny. I didn't know

144
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:05,218
- you realised. That's hysterical.
- Are you kidding?

145
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:09,514
It's funny because, you know, editorially,
Mary Jo and Maryann,

146
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,893
it was this way on the <i>Lost</i> pilot, too.

147
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:15,437
You basically spend 75% of your time

148
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,980
editing a couple sequences
in one of these things,

149
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,108
- and the other 30% on everything else.
- Yeah.

150
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,235
And in this movie,

151
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,072
it felt like every time I came
and visited the editing room,

152
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:26,906
- you guys were working on the <i>Kelvin.</i>
- Yeah.

153
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:31,536
And this was actually
Bryan's genius suggestion, as I recall...

154
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,454
- Yeah.
...which was we,

155
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,415
in the script
and in several cuts before this,

156
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:42,422
introduced Kirk's mom
many, many scenes prior to this.

157
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:45,591
And the idea to basically say,
we're gonna intro her here,

158
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,427
the idea that she's pregnant,
I thought, was genius.

159
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:49,221
I remember, Bryan, when you
brought that up, and I fought you on it.

160
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:52,182
I remember, Bryan, when you
brought that up, and I fought you on it.

161
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:54,768
I think we actually physically wrestled
in the editing room.

162
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:58,896
But you were so smart,
because it engaged you,

163
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:04,153
it let you engage in a deeper way,
on one level,

164
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,904
and then, unexpectedly, it deepened it,

165
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,908
as opposed to kind of telegraphing
what the story was gonna be.

166
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,161
- I think it was a smart...
- You're already so into the sequence,

167
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:16,831
it's so insane, and then it
just ratchets up the stakes 10,000%

168
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:19,042
when you realise
there's a pregnant woman on the ship,

169
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:21,836
and subliminally start to realise
that this must be Kirk in there.

170
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:24,255
It just bifurcated the focus,
having it earlier.

171
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,300
And, Bryan,
you want to talk about that or no?

172
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:31,596
For me, I mean,
Jennifer has this one sequence here

173
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,724
where she's so powerful and emotional,

174
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,394
and you're completely moved by her
in this one moment.

175
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,897
And it felt like, you know,

176
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:45,943
this alone was able to carry the birth
of Kirk and it was kind of heartbreaking.

177
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,279
And I remember,
one of the things that we talked about

178
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:49,822
early in the development of the script,

179
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,951
and this is a place where I really dug in
and was dead wrong,

180
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:57,206
was that she doesn't
make it off the <i>Kelvin,</i>

181
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,082
that Kirk needs to be beamed.

182
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,293
There was a whole thing
where basically,

183
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,379
in a emergency scenario,
like a caesarean,

184
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,465
you could actually beam a baby
out of a mother's womb.

185
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,966
We wrote that version. Yeah.

186
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:11,010
But if you did it, you kill her
because it's an inexact science.

187
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,596
Which is a really cool idea.

188
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:16,975
But the idea that...
We ended up playing it straight,

189
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,977
that it was a conventional birth
that everybody could identify with,

190
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,773
and that the first time that you actually
use the transporter in the movie

191
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:24,274
- is in the space jump.
- Right.

192
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,153
Where we didn't overuse
our beaming gags,

193
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:30,113
I think was really smart.

194
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,365
More importantly, she survives.

195
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,620
You know, which is really important.
There is a victory.

196
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:42,292
Well, it's funny, because we ended up
cutting a sequence later

197
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,961
where you saw their uncle,

198
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:48,005
who now in this film
became the stepfather,

199
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:51,134
the question is sort of
what role she played.

200
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,053
It was an interesting thing,
'cause there was a while

201
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,515
where she was on the phone call,
and she was mad at Kirk.

202
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,184
And it felt like... You love her so much
from this sequence,

203
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,148
that to have her being mean to Kirk later
felt counterintuitive.

204
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,274
It felt like, "I don't want to not like her.
I just loved her."

205
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,902
So, we ended up
having it just be the stepfather.

206
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,614
But, I think, you know, given how
few minutes she's actually onscreen,

207
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,283
I think Jennifer Morrison
did an amazing job.

208
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:17,536
And I think, you know, for us,
for the five of us,

209
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:20,956
when we first started talking about <i>Trek,</i>
I remember in the very first meeting,

210
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:23,500
probably about five minutes in,
we basically said,

211
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,379
"How in God's name are we gonna get
our wives to go and see this movie

212
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,465
"other than the fact
that they're married to us?"

213
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,384
You know, we will not be successful
in rebooting <i>Trek</i>

214
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,221
unless we can get women
to enjoy the movie.

215
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:38,682
And that's where I feel like...

216
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:41,476
At least the birth of Spock
really had that going for it.

217
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,979
But opening the movie with this
and kind of saying,

218
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:46,230
in the midst of all this
space battle craziness,

219
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,359
this is what the movie is, you know.

220
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,320
This is the moment where my wife,

221
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,238
when she first saw it,
sort of grabbed my hand,

222
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:56,616
and I looked over at her
and her eyes were all moist,

223
00:10:56,741 --> 00:11:00,203
and I was like, "Okay.
I think maybe this is gonna work."

224
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,956
And from a canon point of view,
this is the first canon divergence.

225
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,585
- Whereas Kirk was always born in lowa.
- Yeah, that's right.

226
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,753
He would have been born there...

227
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,462
Well, actually,
the Romulans showing up alone.

228
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,506
- Exactly.
- Nero's showing up and changing...

229
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,424
Created the premature contractions.

230
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,302
And the idea that Kirk was born
in space in mid-battle

231
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:19,096
always seemed like a great reason
to break canon.

232
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:20,599
I should just also point that

233
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:23,976
Giacchino's score in that sequence,
I think, really was genius.

234
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:28,481
- And this transition is unbelievable.
- And this transition was not here.

235
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:32,193
This musical transition was actually,
and is still in the film later,

236
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,154
when they are going up to space
for the first time to see the <i>Enterprise.</i>

237
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,280
And I moved this to here

238
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,494
'cause it felt more like an announcement
that <i>Star Trek</i> is back.

239
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:44,539
Well, I think what happens here is that
your heart breaks, but then it soars.

240
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:46,834
You know? And that's an amazing thing
to have happen

241
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,585
in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

242
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,129
First breaks... I'm writing this down.
First breaks, then soars.

243
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:54,549
This title card here, by the way,
was done by Andrew Kramer,

244
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:57,260
who is this 23-year-old kid,
who I found online...

245
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,220
who is this 23-year-old kid,
who I found online...

246
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:59,388
Nice.

247
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,640
...who did the <i>Fringe</i> opening titles,
and he's a brilliant guy.

248
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,559
- And he did this and then the end...
- Amazing.

249
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:06,727
Let's talk about the scene
that came before this that's not...

250
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,312
- That's right.
- That's shot, but not in the movie.

251
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,606
- We just alluded to it.
- We had the scene where

252
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:15,028
you basically saw George,
his older brother,

253
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,864
Kirk's older brother, running away.

254
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:20,283
- Product placement.
- Thanks to Burky.

255
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,287
There's Greg Grunberg,
our good luck charm.

256
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,746
I think we have the deleted scenes after,
so I don't know

257
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,707
- if we have to talk about them now.
- Well, if it's there,

258
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,126
you'll see the scene. But it was cut,

259
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,337
and I think, ultimately,
I really enjoyed the scene.

260
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:34,673
My favourite thing about that scene,
by the way,

261
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:37,176
was there was a forced perspective
miniature of the house

262
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:38,927
that we used that I hated to lose.

263
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,303
All right, now, this is what everybody

264
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:43,347
is buying this DVD to find out.
In this scene,

265
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:45,600
we have to talk about
the song selection.

266
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,269
J.J., why <i>Sabotage</i> by the Beastie Boys?

267
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,356
It's because it's a kick-ass song.
That's the true answer.

268
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,025
It had nothing to do with Shatner.

269
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,360
- It was just a happy coincidence.
- Happy coincidence.

270
00:12:56,486 --> 00:13:00,198
But I want to just point the one thing out,
which is that all these shots of the kid,

271
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:02,658
it was my least favourite stuff
that we had shot, his close-ups.

272
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,913
Not that shot, but the close-ups.
And they weren't working.

273
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:09,207
And this was
a very hard sequence to do.

274
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:10,583
See, a shot like this, right?

275
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,919
There were all these different rigs
that we used for him,

276
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,379
and I just didn't get good close-ups
on the day.

277
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:19,426
And so we ended up going back
and shooting all of his close-ups again.

278
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,886
Every close-up you see,
there are 11 shots,

279
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,681
and they were all re-shot,
except for that one.

280
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:29,937
They were all re-shot on the roof
of the 20th Century Fox parking lot.

281
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:32,230
- Including his final line here, right?
- That one right there, too.

282
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,816
Yes, that shot right there.

283
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,860
All these shots were all done in
the parking lot, just shaking the camera,

284
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,321
and then the last shot of him
standing up, saying his name.

285
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:43,200
And also when we shot it originally,
the stuntman/actor

286
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,786
who's actually on the motorcycle,
you could see his face,

287
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,496
but I just thought it looked silly.

288
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,375
And so I ended up
actually having his face replaced.

289
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,544
And I wrote him a note 'cause
I felt bad that I covered his face.

290
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,130
But the mask was put on digitally later,

291
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,798
and I think
it actually makes all the difference.

292
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,926
And for the nitpickers, yes,
there's no cliffs in lowa,

293
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:03,177
- but this is clearly a quarry.
- It's a quarry, my friend.

294
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,514
- There were no cliffs in lowa.
- That's right.

295
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,018
- Until the earthquake of 2011.
- The great quake of 2011.

296
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,520
So, is the idea here
that this guy is a robot?

297
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:15,691
I don't know.
I mean, I think he was in a bad accident.

298
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,860
That's my voice, by the way.

299
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:21,154
It's amazing to me how
the original version of this sequence,

300
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,740
with the close-ups
that you ended up replacing,

301
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,659
- the energy level went up 10,000 times.
- Well, you know what it was?

302
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,120
Because we knew
what his experience was.

303
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:30,413
This is one of my favourite shots
in the movie.

304
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,124
This shot, for some reason,
destroys me.

305
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,209
I love it. ILM is... Look at ILM.

306
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,626
- Look what they do.
- It's crazy.

307
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,794
I also love that, by the way,

308
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,088
there's like a title in the earlier scene
that says lowa.

309
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,549
Like, "Sure, I know where lowa is."
And the next one's, like, Vulcan.

310
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,635
Like, "Oh, yeah, of course, Vulcan. Sure.
I know where that is."

311
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,221
My wife's like, "What now?

312
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:49,307
"Where is that in relation to lowa?
Is that somewhere in Europe?"

313
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:53,269
So we had four of these,
or three-and-a-half of these bowls

314
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:56,606
actually physically built,
and then the rest were put in later.

315
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,110
And these were actual projections
that were augmented later by ILM.

316
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,322
This kid, Kogan...

317
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,283
- Joshua. Jacob, that's right.
- Jacob.

318
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:07,826
- He was in a movie called <i>Joshua.</i>
- That's right.

319
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:09,870
That's why I got confused.
He's a terrific actor.

320
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:13,624
And Sean Gerace, actually,
who was our primary <i>Trek</i> researcher,

321
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:15,458
- turned us on to this actor.
- Who was in the earlier scene.

322
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,336
- Yes.
- He was one of the guys on the <i>Kelvin.</i>

323
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:19,712
That always gets a laugh.

324
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,799
Yeah, and affirmative was...
This was a change that we made,

325
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:25,344
'cause he used to say,
"Your mother is a human whore" there.

326
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:28,931
And Nicole,
one of the people at Bad Robot,

327
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,974
suggested that
we not have it happen here,

328
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,351
but have it happen at the end
before the fight happens.

329
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,520
So we ended up changing that.
We made some changes

330
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:38,899
in literally the last week
before we locked the picture

331
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:42,778
that I think were huge improvements
in a number of sequences.

332
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:46,697
Picture and music, as well.
And that was one of the little ones.

333
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,491
It always amazes me that that happens

334
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,828
- in the last two weeks of a movie.
- That last minute...

335
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,496
- It's frightening, actually.
- Yeah, it is.

336
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,542
- We still might make changes.
- I have some notes.

337
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:01,879
There was a lot of streamlining
in these sequences here.

338
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:06,969
This used to start with the bit
between Sarek and Amanda.

339
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:08,595
- Yeah, there was a great little...
- Right.

340
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,221
It was one of my favourite shots,
actually,

341
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:14,268
this fight between the two of them,
which we should also put on the DVD.

342
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:18,272
But we ended up cutting it, again,
just for pace.

343
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:21,149
- And you wanted to get to...
- The heart of it.

344
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,693
Yeah, and you wanted
to get to Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto

345
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,821
as quickly as possible.
Ben Cross was terrific.

346
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,033
It was amazing how his bone structure
looks so much like Nimoy's to me.

347
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,202
- I just think he's terrific.
- And also like Mark Lenard's,

348
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,413
- who played the original.
- That's right. That's right.

349
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:38,292
Who was actually, a little point
that probably only Bob knows,

350
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:41,169
Mark Lenard
actually played a Romulan...

351
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,379
- That's right.
...in his first appearance in <i>Trek</i>

352
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,340
in "Balance of Terror."

353
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,009
And they liked him so much,
they recast him as Spock's dad.

354
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,135
And they liked him so much,
they recast him as Spock's dad.

355
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,014
- For what it's worth, we... Yes?
- That's right, Damon.

356
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,811
I got that off the Internet.
It was my one fun fact to...

357
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:01,105
- Impress the fans.
...illegitimately prove my Trekitude.

358
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:05,234
We looped this scene for Jacob,

359
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,071
and he did an amazing job
looping these lines.

360
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:13,618
And so, originally, this went
from young Spock to young Kirk,

361
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,038
and we had the driving scene,
the fight with the uncle

362
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,789
and everything after this.

363
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:21,210
But using this dissolve
sort of allowed for a time passage.

364
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,506
And I just love this entrance that
you just saw him, he was a little boy,

365
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,465
and now when he comes in,
he's taller than his mother.

366
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,301
And you've just heard that she's human,
so you're tracking it nicely.

367
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:33,262
Now this whole set
is actually a real building.

368
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:35,973
And we just put
a huge greenscreen up behind it.

369
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,142
A church, right?

370
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:39,394
- Yeah, it's like a chapel...
- It's a mortuary.

371
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,270
- Yeah, at a cemetery.
- At a cemetery.

372
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,358
So, here's Winona.

373
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,278
With some slight old age
stipple makeup on.

374
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,366
She looked so beautiful
in the first scene,

375
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,161
where she's giving birth,
and she looks older here.

376
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:00,082
And it was a nice contrast,
but I think it works well here anyway.

377
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:04,961
I love the way that you guys
wrote Spock's dialogue throughout.

378
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,463
"May I ask a personal query?"

379
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,090
Little things like that, I think,

380
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,344
are the things that really impressed
the hardcore Trekkers,

381
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:16,056
but sort of immediately presented
to people from outside of <i>Trek</i>

382
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:20,269
the idea that this is what a Vulcan is.
This is how they talk.

383
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,520
Also, this is one of our first days
of shooting.

384
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,523
Can we just discuss Zachary Quinto?

385
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:28,902
I mean, the guy showed up,
we knew he looked the part,

386
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:32,280
but this was the first time
we were actually filming with him.

387
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:35,284
And it was literally like...
He was so impactful that I forgot...

388
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,121
Akiva Goldsman to the right, right there.
Akiva Goldsman. Now he's gone.

389
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,250
But I gotta say that Zachary,

390
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,712
he was so good

391
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:53,301
that I actually forgot sometimes
what Nimoy's Spock was like.

392
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,138
He became Spock in a way
that I'd have to actually think

393
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,182
to differentiate them in my mind.
It's very strange.

394
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:04,020
J.J., can you please tell the story
of doing ADR with the Council?

395
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,022
- With the Council.
- Yeah, the gentleman...

396
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,650
ADR, by the way, is dialogue
that is recorded after the fact.

397
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:09,984
Additional dialogue recording.

398
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:12,570
That actor, who he's speaking with,
whose name eludes me,

399
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,656
this is horrible. Oh, God.
See, now it's not a good story.

400
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:17,742
Anyway, I met him at the ADR,
and I said,

401
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,036
"Hey, how you doing? Good to see you."

402
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,163
He's like, "Yes." I said,
"Did you have fun doing the movie?"

403
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:24,333
He was like,
"The director was a slave driver."

404
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,919
And he started talking about
the director, not realising it was me.

405
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:28,127
- And I was like, "What?"
- He's like,

406
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,757
- "He had me do three hours of it."
- Hilarious.

407
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:37,221
And I didn't know if he was joking.
And I was like, "I'm J.J."

408
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,598
He's like, "Oh, sorry. Sorry!

409
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,227
- "Did I say slave driver?"
- I meant...

410
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,144
"Where I come from,
that is a term of affection."

411
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:46,355
"Where I come from,
that is a term of affection."

412
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,942
- It's awesome.
- Yeah, it was great.

413
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,778
I love the song choice here.
Now we're back in lowa.

414
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:58,032
And I think that this is just such
an awesome way to introduce Uhura.

415
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,201
I just love that walk. It basically tells you

416
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,619
everything you need to know
about her right there.

417
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:02,871
She is spectacular.

418
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,832
Yeah, we shot this
at an American Legion.

419
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:08,836
This song was written
by our director, J.J. Abrams.

420
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,003
- I did the song.
- Slave driver.

421
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,506
I believe it's called, <i>I Love My Puppy.</i>

422
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,048
- What's it called?
- With George Jaculius.

423
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,174
But it's got a funny name.

424
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,511
It's a weird name.
It's Kurosawa backwards.

425
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,388
J.J., who is that sitting next to,

426
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,349
not next to Uhura,
but on that gentleman's left?

427
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:25,352
If you look right here,
that's my dad right there.

428
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,354
- And now that's Chris Pine.
- Before Pine enters frame, yeah.

429
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:31,900
And next to my dad is my wife's father.
So it's Gerald Abrams and Jim McGrath.

430
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,236
I love how Kirk's entrance
is basically like,

431
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:36,363
the camera
is just about to reveal J.J.'s dad,

432
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:39,031
and then,
"Hello, Chris Pine, star of the movie."

433
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,367
Was your dad difficult to work with?

434
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:44,538
It took us about a week longer
to do this sequence than it would have.

435
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:45,873
He also thinks you're a slave driver.

436
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:50,001
By the way, the gentleman
sitting between Kirk and Uhura,

437
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,837
- that's not makeup. No, he...
- That's so weird.

438
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:55,173
Bryan Burk, ladies and gentlemen.

439
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:57,843
That's amazing makeup
by Barney Burman.

440
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:02,055
And I never, during the, I think,
three days we were in this set,

441
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:05,142
I never met that man
without his makeup on.

442
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:08,644
So I only knew him... And the
character's name literally was Bryan.

443
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,230
I swear to God.
And I just knew him with that makeup.

444
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,773
And then the other night,
I was at a party,

445
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,734
and this guy comes up to me
and he's like,

446
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:18,238
"Hi, I was the guy at the bar."
I actually got to meet him.

447
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,405
- And that guy?
- Bryan Burk.

448
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,699
Mr Will Ferrell.

449
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:23,743
True story.

450
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:25,703
- Not a true story.
- Not a true story.

451
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:29,625
And here's another place where I think
there were, like, key dialogue lifts

452
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,250
that basically really punched it up.

453
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,711
Because their flirtation lasted for

454
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,131
- a page and a half, I think.
- It went on a little longer.

455
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:38,674
And here's the "cupcake."

456
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,885
You know, he used to say,
"A joke, like your hairline,"

457
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,305
which I always thought was funny,
but maybe not.

458
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:44,807
It's not funny to me.

459
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:50,604
By the way, the stuntman who,
in this moment...

460
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:53,356
There was a very weird move here.
We ended up kind of cutting it down.

461
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:58,028
But, in this moment here, when he falls,
right there... Oh, man, that really hurt.

462
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,365
Did he land on his head? 'Cause it really
looks like he landed on his head.

463
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,990
Yeah, he really did.

464
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,493
Yeah, it was bad. Oh, no, sorry.
He's fine.

465
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,871
That's a great Harrison Ford moment
right there.

466
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:11,250
By the way, I think the boob gag works
because you didn't have a close-up of it.

467
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,211
As many directors I believe would have,
you didn't do that.

468
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:18,757
Yeah, I debated. There are the father
and father-in-law right there.

469
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,174
By the way, question.

470
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,220
Are there really still glass bottles
this far in the future?

471
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:26,765
- Have we come...
- By the way, it's not glass.

472
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,392
- It isn't?
- It's titanium crystal.

473
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,144
- Of course. See?
- There you go.

474
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,813
I can't say enough good things
about Bruce Greenwood.

475
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:35,606
- I can't say enough bad things.
- But I'm not gonna try.

476
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,484
Here's one of my favourite lines
in the movie.

477
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,278
And Chris totally just rocked it.

478
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:41,529
There's a great ADR line, by the way,

479
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,656
where someone goes,
"I just got a drink."

480
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:50,329
He really grounds and gives credibility
to the whole idea of Starfleet.

481
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,290
- And that head tilt is amazing.
- There's something about him

482
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,041
that makes you
take everything seriously.

483
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,420
By the way, that shot that just passed,
what was cool is

484
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:59,256
that there were already
all these little old planes hanging

485
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,717
- and we added a starship...
- Cool.

486
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:04,135
...in the foreground,
just to kind of add to it.

487
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,221
Tony Guma is an actor, and he plays
the bartender who's in all this.

488
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,016
But you never see him onscreen,
but he did a great job.

489
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:10,433
- Wait, wasn't Tony in <i>M: i: III?</i> Yeah.
- He was.

490
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,603
- He was the guy at the mailbox.
- He was the guy in the bathroom,

491
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:15,646
- right? Oh, right, right, right, right.
- No, at the mailbox place.

492
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,523
So, here's... Go ahead.

493
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,859
Just from a story point,
this is one those scenes

494
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:22,028
where basically everything
that you need to know

495
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:24,780
about a character's motivation to do
everything they're doing in the movie

496
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,407
happens in a single scene.

497
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,577
And I think that's a testament
to Alex and Bob's writing,

498
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:32,038
but also Greenwood's performance
and Chris's performance,

499
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:35,666
'cause it's so understated,
but the power of the scene...

500
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,461
It's basically like
you hear all this dialogue

501
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,046
in all the trailers
leading up to the movie.

502
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:42,089
Our trailer guys basically just won
a couple of awards.

503
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:43,800
It sells the movie.

504
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,636
This was a hard scene to write.

505
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:51,517
Well, it's interesting. We shot it
with two cameras simultaneously.

506
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,769
I wanted the actors
to feel as comfortable as possible

507
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:56,480
to give them the chance
to sort of overlap

508
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,440
- and I cleared out the set.
- That's cool.

509
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:01,652
So it was just really the two of them,
two cameras, really quiet.

510
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:06,656
It really helped, you know, give them...
And also that background.

511
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,407
Scott Chambliss,
our production designer,

512
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,285
- did an additional amazing thing...
- Fantastic.

513
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,663
...which is, like, he took that old bar,

514
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:16,458
which is, again, a real
American Legion bar in Hollywood,

515
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,794
and that background, those lights...
I just wanted it to feel...

516
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,837
I wanted it to have that
kind of <i>Blade Runner-y</i> future feel

517
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:24,007
where it's like,
were those advertisements?

518
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:27,970
Was it information?
Was it entertainment?

519
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:30,096
Was it just a light show?
It doesn't matter.

520
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:32,932
But just that idea that in that bar,
there's that weird background.

521
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,934
I dare you to do better.

522
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:38,313
By the way, that was an adjustment
of a line from Maryann Brandon,

523
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,231
the editor of this sequence.

524
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,567
She edited this scene,
didn't she, Bryan?

525
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,111
- This one?
- Yes.

526
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:46,154
And it was just that addition of,
"He saved all those lives."

527
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,614
- What were you gonna say?
- Salt shaker, by the way.

528
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,409
Dan Mindel, our genius DP, said
something very interesting about that.

529
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,868
I had them put the salt in, by the way.
Sorry.

530
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:54,037
- Oh, really? How funny.
- Isn't that funny?

531
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:56,248
What'd that cost us?

532
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:59,000
- $600,000?
- Yeah, about $100,000.

533
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,336
About not being afraid
to have something moving.

534
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:05,507
I'm so sorry. That shot right there,
that's the same angle, just flopped.

535
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:06,842
I had him drive toward us
and away from us.

536
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,009
How funny.

537
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:09,470
And then that shot we stole real quick.

538
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:12,138
We were driving by the field
and I was like,

539
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,765
"Pull over quick.
Get the camera on the truck."

540
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:17,560
And here's our Tatooine moment,
before Alex continues

541
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:20,146
to talk about something that happened
nine minutes ago.

542
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:22,566
- Continues?
- Where basically...

543
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:26,987
We did talk about...
A lot of fun-poking has happened

544
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:30,907
in terms of how we sort of echoed
the storytelling in <i>Star Wars.</i>

545
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:34,912
But that is sort of the great myth
of our childhood,

546
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:35,746
in the sort of Joseph Campbell tradition.

547
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:36,872
in the sort of Joseph Campbell tradition.

548
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:39,540
We always talked about
rebooting <i>Trek</i> in terms of saying,

549
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,752
"Where's our moment
where Luke is looking at the twin suns?"

550
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,046
- And, you know, that was it.
- Yeah.

551
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,338
I gotta see that movie.

552
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:46,882
- <i>Star Wars?</i>
- Very good.

553
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:48,884
This was shot at...

554
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:50,802
Start with <i>The Phantom Menace,</i>
so it'll make sense.

555
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,221
This is one of my favourite things,

556
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:55,891
when the bike comes in
and there's no spokes on the wheel.

557
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,226
Yeah, it's...

558
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,769
- Did ILM take those out?
- They did.

559
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:03,856
This was actually at a power plant
outside of Los Angeles,

560
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,652
and we just dressed it
and brought in these shuttles.

561
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:09,112
- It was my favourite thing about the...
- Who flew the shuttles in?

562
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,948
Bryan did.

563
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:13,032
This was one of those things where...

564
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:17,328
This is at Paramount, shot about
a month and a half before the location.

565
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:19,038
Did you guys
come up with that on the day?

566
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,624
That gag right there
where he bangs his head?

567
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:21,750
- Yes. Yeah.
- Love it.

568
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:25,461
What I like about it is later in the movie,
in a very similar shot,

569
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,423
when he's saying goodbye to Spock,
he doesn't hit his head,

570
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,384
and it still says low clearance.

571
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,221
But anyway, one of my favourite things
about the production design

572
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:37,516
is the sort of tangible quality of it.

573
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:40,144
And so trying to use
as many locations as possible.

574
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,395
So, you know,
we use a bunch of power plants.

575
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,439
You'll see later the Budweiser plant.

576
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,442
I also love this, that, like,
now he's joined and there she is.

577
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:48,568
And it kind of makes you feel like,

578
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:51,154
"There's gonna be some kind of
fun flirtation and romance going on."

579
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,907
Of course, now Karl Urban,
a man from New Zealand who came in,

580
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,577
having been the stud
in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>

581
00:26:57,702 --> 00:26:58,828
and the bad guy in <i>Bourne,</i>

582
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:01,874
and suddenly was
the funniest Kentucky doctor,

583
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:04,667
and just blew my mind
and channelled Bones.

584
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:08,672
This is one of those scenes
that you guys wrote that did not change.

585
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:12,675
It was this way in the first draft,
and it sort of stayed the same.

586
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,553
As Bones' introduction, this sort of idea

587
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:18,140
that he actually
was a spaceophobe, or...

588
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:20,976
I don't know what the technical term
for the fear of space is.

589
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:23,686
- And divorced.
- And by the way, this line about,

590
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:27,106
"All I got left are my bones,"
was Karl Urban's line.

591
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,775
And that was something
he came up with on the day.

592
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:32,528
- So good. Yeah.
- And I gotta tell you, it's amazing.

593
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:35,782
- It just defines everything.
- Everything. Yeah.

594
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,368
And his character, and it just explains it.

595
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,830
It explains a conversation
that never happens.

596
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,750
The audience gets to fill the blanks in.
I just love that.

597
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,544
- He's terrific in the movie.
- He's amazing.

598
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,378
You know, we worked with him
on <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Xena.</i>

599
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:51,214
That's right.

600
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,924
And by the way, this music,

601
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,676
this used to be the music
at the beginning of the movie,

602
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:57,054
- from <i>Star Trek.</i>
- For the credits, right?

603
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,180
- For the <i>Star Trek</i> logo.
- That's right.

604
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,932
I moved it here 'cause it felt more like,
the first time you hear

605
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:03,684
the echoing
of the Alexander Courage theme,

606
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,605
right there, felt like it was finally earned.

607
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,316
Like, it's finally, Kirk's on his way
to the <i>Star Trek</i> that we know.

608
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:09,817
Like, it's finally, Kirk's on his way
to the <i>Star Trek</i> that we know.

609
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,609
Let's talk a little bit about...

610
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,737
Or I guess this will be covered
in the deleted scenes,

611
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,196
but we do want to talk a little bit about...

612
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,405
- The prison?
...how we ended up

613
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:18,951
coming to this as our Nero midpoint?

614
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:23,497
There used to be a sequence, that is
on the DVD, showing Nero in prison,

615
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:26,250
which was a cool sequence,

616
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,920
and confounding to anyone
who watched it in context.

617
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:31,255
This shot, by the way,

618
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,632
- was used in that earlier sequence.
- The prison sequence.

619
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:35,717
But I felt you needed to see Nero again

620
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:38,554
and just hold on him,
and let it burn into your brain.

621
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,097
So I took this shot,
which used to be him being tortured,

622
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:43,142
lying on the table, and I moved it here,

623
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:46,686
and I put a sound of a guy off-camera
saying, "He's ready for you,"

624
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,272
just so you actually could
think about Nero for a second.

625
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:50,398
And then you go into this scene,

626
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,567
so you actually thought
about the bad guy.

627
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:55,028
There's a whole movie
that you didn't see,

628
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:59,074
where basically the <i>Kelvin</i>
and sort of its kamikaze run,

629
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:01,742
when George Kirk
runs it into the <i>Kelvin,</i> it becomes...

630
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,244
- Knocks it into the Neutral Zone.
- Right.

631
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,705
And then they get
picked up by some Klingons,

632
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,460
and they get imprisoned by the Klingons
for 25 years.

633
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:11,920
And during that period of time, basically,

634
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:14,589
Nero is working on these calculations
to figure out

635
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:19,303
when Spock Prime
is going to emerge from this singularity.

636
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:22,221
And he figures it out, and then
they plan this whole prison break

637
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:26,101
and they steal their ship back.
You didn't need to see any of it.

638
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:27,685
It was really hard
for the audience to understand.

639
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,564
"Who is the bad guy now?
I don't understand."

640
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:33,942
But by removing it,
it eliminated the questions.

641
00:29:34,317 --> 00:29:38,654
- This was shot at Northridge...
- Library.

642
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:42,284
At the library there.
And, obviously, ILM did an amazing...

643
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:45,913
I wanted to do an establishing shot
that was part of a scene.

644
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:48,790
So you see...
"Look, there's future San Francisco."

645
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,961
By the way, now is as good of a time
as any to talk about Michael Kaplan.

646
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:56,548
I just love the costumes.

647
00:29:57,048 --> 00:30:00,259
Yeah, he's the costume designer
who, it was infuriating,

648
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,638
'cause every time I'd go
into his workshop, I would just say yes.

649
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:06,724
Like, he never had a bad idea.
He's amazing.

650
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:09,728
I wanted to not reveal the green
until the lights came on,

651
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,605
so we did some colour work here.

652
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,148
That's Rachel Nichols,
who was in <i>Alias.</i>

653
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,858
This was obviously something
we could have done

654
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,693
a whole bunch more elaborate makeup,

655
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,738
but we wanted to sort of do something
that was real throwback

656
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:23,075
to the original series, that felt
completely connected to the old show.

657
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:28,038
We re-shot this scene.
It was done originally

658
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:32,375
a different version of this scene,
in which, among other things,

659
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,295
Uhura did not get undressed.
And I literally felt like,

660
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,132
Chris Pine's in his underwear,
this girl's, you know... I just thought,

661
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:41,300
like, the idea of all three of them being
in their underwear was so funny to me.

662
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:44,011
It just felt like a ridiculous situation.

663
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:45,931
That's the way you're gonna justify it?

664
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,933
- It's not bad, actually.
- I almost bought that.

665
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:53,020
And also, I wanted to, you know,
have Uhura get undressed.

666
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:54,272
No, but it was one of those moments

667
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:58,527
that felt like it really did emphasise
Kirk's love of her,

668
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:00,737
which I think also helped
the reversal later,

669
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:03,365
when you discover, you know,
that she's with Spock.

670
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,657
So, I love the idea that, you know,

671
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:08,996
you really think you're playing
on the axis of the Kirk/Uhura story.

672
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,542
I love the way that Spock, Kirk's
and Uhura's triangle plays,

673
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,171
which is the idea that,

674
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:20,007
you know, in a conventional movie,
Kirk is gonna get the girl.

675
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:21,133
- And the fact that he...
- That's right.

676
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:22,259
I love her in this shot, by the way.

677
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:25,053
He lost her before
the movie even started.

678
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,305
- That's right.
- You know, I mean, because she...

679
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,432
- But you don't realise that until later.
- She's still in play, maybe, in the bar,

680
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:32,644
but at some point in these three years,
she's fallen for Spock.

681
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:35,439
Now, this is the same set
that we used in the <i>Kelvin.</i>

682
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:39,984
It was redressed a little bit, but it has
much more of the submarine vibe.

683
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,113
And then this was actually,
you know, part of the set.

684
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:49,368
And they had to rebuild it
over about a month or so,

685
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:51,997
but it was interesting
working on the same set.

686
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:53,749
And we changed
the camera movements

687
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:55,375
so that it was very static.

688
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,295
Even though the camera's on a dolly,
it never felt like it was really moving.

689
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,464
So even though the ship is being shot
and everything, I wanted to make sure

690
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,258
it didn't feel like
it was supposed to be a real ship.

691
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:06,428
Now, Kobayashi Maru, on a script level,

692
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:09,765
we spent a lot of time
talking about this sequence.

693
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,432
Well, the green girl
used to be a huge part of this.

694
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:15,520
She was the one who ended up
basically planting the bug.

695
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:16,896
Kirk had been sleeping with her

696
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,483
specifically to get her to insert
the virus into the computer.

697
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:22,819
But it somehow felt more fun
to keep it a mystery as to who did it.

698
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:24,654
That sounds so dirty, what you just said.

699
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:28,450
The other major change that happened
was that in its original conception,

700
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,786
we didn't know
we were in the middle of a test.

701
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,913
The top of, kind of, the midpoint of...

702
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:36,916
Once Kirk went off to Starfleet
and you came back three years later,

703
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,836
he was in the middle
of being the captain,

704
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:41,255
so the intention was originally
to trick the audience into thinking

705
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,839
- he had become captain.
- It felt a little bit like...

706
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,173
- And we went away from that.
- Yeah.

707
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,925
It just felt a little bit like
you saw it coming

708
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,760
in a way that wasn't as fun.

709
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,596
J.J., what about the apple?

710
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,057
- I don't know. It's so funny.
- Where'd that come from.

711
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:55,644
Someone, I can't remember who it was,
was like, "I hate it when actors eat..."

712
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:59,314
Maybe it was Josh Reims, "I hate it
when actors eat apples in movies."

713
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:02,108
And you were like, "We need an apple.
Let's get an apple on set."

714
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:03,527
For some reason
while we were shooting, I thought,

715
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:06,154
"You know what? If the guy is eating
an apple, he's so much cockier."

716
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:09,115
I just love that this is the moment,
this whole sequence is really about that.

717
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,784
It's about, "This is where they cross."

718
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:14,328
People think it's a reference
to an original <i>Trek</i> episode.

719
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:15,788
<i>Wrath of Khan.</i>

720
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,207
It's not.

721
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:18,500
Tyler Perry, who agreed
to be in this movie,

722
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,670
who had never been
in anyone else's movie,

723
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:23,881
never been on anyone else's set,

724
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:27,259
and he did this movie,
which I was so grateful for.

725
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:30,636
He's such a nice guy
and a terrific actor, I thought.

726
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,346
- By the way, to the right...
- I think he is really good.

727
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:36,101
Ben Binswagner to the right,
who's the biggest <i>Trek</i> fan I've ever met,

728
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:39,229
an old friend of mine.
So we put him in there.

729
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:42,982
Who I also don't think had ever been in
anyone else's movie or on any other set.

730
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:44,609
Only in Tyler Perry's film.

731
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:48,989
This shot was fun.

732
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,575
We just had these guys
just sitting on the ledge up there.

733
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,538
This is one of those scenes that you
kind of, you know, eagerly await writing

734
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:58,164
and also are terrified to write.

735
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:01,042
There's a version, I think,
that's three times as long as this.

736
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,711
- It was a much longer scene.
- There was a lot of stuff,

737
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,253
- and we ended up just trimming.
- And you just realise

738
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,131
what's expendable when you go to it.

739
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:09,760
But what's so great about it,
you know, is that it's...

740
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:13,012
Spock actually goes
to a very emotional place here.

741
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:16,682
Even though he's presenting it
as a logical Vulcan,

742
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:19,644
he plays the dead dad card.

743
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:25,692
Which, you know,
is sort of a brutal piece of debating.

744
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:26,902
Yeah.

745
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:29,612
That was a set extension shot.

746
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:30,280
If you look behind Spock,
the green girl is there,

747
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,949
If you look behind Spock,
the green girl is there,

748
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,324
Rachel Nichols' character right there.

749
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,829
She's playing angry in the sequence,
if you watch it, because she was used.

750
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:40,123
So in the original version of this shot,
of this scene,

751
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:43,668
she was mad, arms crossed,
because Kirk had used her.

752
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:47,338
There was actually a second green girl,
as well, later in the movie.

753
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,215
- That was a very funny scene.
- Yeah.

754
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,552
Where Kirk basically goes
and apologises to her.

755
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:52,927
By the way,
we gotta put that on the DVD, as well.

756
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:54,221
- That's a great scene.
- That has to be on the DVD.

757
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:56,974
But actually,
I think a lot of that stuff went away

758
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:59,476
because Matt Reeves
came to see the movie.

759
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:04,731
And one of his feelings and concerns
was that we were playing Kirk too cocky.

760
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:08,652
He hated Kirk.
His note was, "I did not like Kirk."

761
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:11,947
And we did a pass that was literally to,
you know, answer that.

762
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:13,574
And that included...

763
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:16,952
- He also hated green girls, though.
- Good point.

764
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,913
He also hates everybody.

765
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,505
I love McCoy here.

766
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:33,552
For canon fanatics, we always imagined
that this could have been the way

767
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:34,760
For canon fanatics, we always imagined
that this could have been the way

768
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:37,264
that Spock and Kirk
met in either universe.

769
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:39,266
He always cheated
on the Kobayashi Maru,

770
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:40,893
as known by <i>Star Trek II.</i>

771
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:43,561
And the idea that their first meeting
was in conflict was kind of the way

772
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:46,398
we reverse engineered what
the arc of their characters would be.

773
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:49,233
If you met them as friends, what's
as far away as you can meet them?

774
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,527
Well, you can meet them as enemies.

775
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,780
That's what I liked about it,
regardless of it being <i>Star Trek,</i>

776
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,239
these two characters
who meet up in this way.

777
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:58,117
- Right.
- We shot this at a real hangar.

778
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:03,664
It used to be a blimp hangar.
And two of those shuttles are real.

779
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,460
Almost all the ones
you're seeing right now are not.

780
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:08,836
It was a huge shot,
'cause the shot is a long shot.

781
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,465
- Yeah.
- And ILM did an amazing job on this.

782
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:15,677
It's throughout the movie,
so I should mention it now.

783
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,554
J.J. and Dan Mindel had this crazy idea

784
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,974
to have flares non-stop
throughout the movie.

785
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:22,476
I don't know what you're talking about.

786
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:23,851
And you may notice all these flares.

787
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:28,523
And Dan was shining a flashlight
directly into the lens in a lot of cases.

788
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:30,567
- Right there is an example.
- Is that like piece of flair,

789
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:32,027
like in <i>Office Space?</i>

790
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:38,742
I was gonna say, at least for me,
not only does it keep everything alive

791
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,994
and there's this perpetual idea
that there's something off-screen,

792
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,621
what also was kind of great
about the flares

793
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:46,166
is later, when ILM
was doing their visual effects,

794
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:51,838
you'll notice that most
of the visual effects have flares, as well,

795
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:55,675
where you can actually see the lens
and you can see the dirt on the lens,

796
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,010
which is all, of course, fake.

797
00:36:58,137 --> 00:37:01,056
Yet it's all giving the illusion
that there's really a cameraman there,

798
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:02,974
with a camera, actually filming in space.

799
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:07,353
And I think it all stems from this idea
of making everything real and palpable.

800
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,940
Yeah, the flare thing,
the idea was sort of that,

801
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:13,152
the future is so bright
it can't be contained in the frame.

802
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:14,318
And I know there's a lot of it,

803
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:17,239
and there are a few shots
where it's preposterous.

804
00:37:17,364 --> 00:37:22,911
But I just thought
it was a fun piece of business to do.

805
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:24,621
I think where it went over, though, is

806
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:26,081
when we went out to dinner
the other night,

807
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:28,666
and Dan Mindel was shining a light
in my eyes over your shoulder.

808
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:31,711
- I think the live flare...
- Going too far.

809
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,338
In life, it's called squinting.

810
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:38,010
So, here is sort of
the longest running gag in the movie,

811
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:42,681
which is the sort of hypospray.
Which is, you know, the idea that...

812
00:37:42,806 --> 00:37:46,059
I've sort of gone back
and looked at the other <i>Trek</i> movies

813
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,938
and some of the original series,
and it only hurts in this movie.

814
00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:52,398
You know, the whole point of them
developing hypospray

815
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,443
- is that it's supposed to be painless.
- Yeah.

816
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:56,695
But I guess when you get it in the neck...

817
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,655
I'm not sure
that it was the injection itself,

818
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:01,742
as much as it was
the chemical he was reacting to.

819
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:04,369
This is Alex Nevil, by the way,
who I went to high school with,

820
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:06,996
who plays... He's a terrific actor.

821
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,289
Speaking of terrific acting,

822
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:09,500
- I love Chris here.
- Come on, look at Pine.

823
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,460
- Look what's he doing. It's ridiculous.
- Yeah, he's amazing.

824
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:15,963
So here's the music that's
from the opening of the movie, again.

825
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,175
This is one of my favourite shots
in the whole movie right there.

826
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,885
- On the left is the Tagruato...
- Unbelievable. Just so good.

827
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,804
...the Slusho company.
- And this one, too.

828
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:24,681
- I love this, you know.
- This transition is amazing.

829
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:27,016
I mean, it's just like...

830
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:28,559
But what Bryan's saying, you know,

831
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,063
using flares in the CG shots
kind of made it seamless.

832
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,567
I remember I was on set this day
when you guys shot this.

833
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:39,070
And, you know, they were actually
on a gimbal rig, right?

834
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:42,907
- They were not, but the camera was.
- The camera was.

835
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:49,789
I think James Clyne designed that.

836
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,291
But this was a shot
where we actually went by

837
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:55,838
the little piece of shuttle we'd built.
And of course the rest of this.

838
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,173
And this sequence,
I wanted it to feel like

839
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:02,635
what I experienced when I saw
the original Robert Wise film,

840
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:06,639
<i>The Motion Picture,</i> because
there was a five-minute sequence...

841
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:07,932
- Of just introducing the <i>Enterprise.</i>
- Yeah.

842
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:11,478
Of just Kirk taking his shuttle
to the <i>Enterprise.</i> And it felt real.

843
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:14,481
And I saw the panels
on the skin of the ship,

844
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,608
- and it just felt tangible.
- The guys flying outside the ship,

845
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,235
- and operating. It was amazing.
- The whole thing.

846
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,735
And all the floodlights and everything.

847
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:23,532
So I really wanted this to be,
as much as possible,

848
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:27,161
you know, an homage
to that amazing original sequence.

849
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:33,750
- And this is all Budweiser.
- What does NCC stand for, Bob?

850
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:35,210
I have no idea.

851
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:38,172
- What?
- That's unbelievable.

852
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:41,048
- I've never stumped him before.
- Wow, on the spot, failed.

853
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,010
By the way, this shot here,
watch this shot here.

854
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:48,389
So, there you are, see,
in the Budweiser plant.

855
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:50,726
And then here he is there.

856
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:52,101
And how did you do it, J. J?

857
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,436
- Literally, my favourite thing.
- Where's the cut?

858
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:57,148
We were on the set, and we just had
a guy holding up a greenscreen,

859
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,818
and Zachary walked in,
the door closed, the guy walked away.

860
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:01,360
Door opened,
and they just put that thing in later.

861
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,989
But it was one of my favourite
things to do.

862
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:06,407
This sequence also, which is, you know,

863
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,869
knowing it was the introduction
of the Bridge,

864
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:13,373
I just tried to do as many, sort of,
wide shots of the place.

865
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:16,168
This shot, when he sits down,
you see the light in his eyes.

866
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:17,503
That's an homage to the original show,

867
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:20,672
'cause they had that strip of light
on Kirk's eye all the time.

868
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,759
And now we start to meet
all the characters, you know.

869
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:25,010
I think the choreography of...

870
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:27,512
Also one of my favourite shots
right there, with the music swell.

871
00:40:27,637 --> 00:40:29,264
- It just kills me.
- Come on. Giacchino's score here

872
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,349
- is awesome.
- Oh, my God. The choreography

873
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:34,769
of camera movement on the Bridge
in every scene is amazing to me

874
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,771
because there's a lot of time spent
on that Bridge,

875
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:38,481
and every time you're there,
it's interesting

876
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:41,568
and kind of compelling,
and it just moves.

877
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:44,570
Yeah, I did try, in the early sequences,

878
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:46,405
to keep the camera moving
as much as possible,

879
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:49,827
knowing that any second now,
there was about to be no movement,

880
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:51,327
and it needed to feel
much more static, so...

881
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:54,373
This is great, 'cause the last thing
you're expecting here is a gag,

882
00:40:54,498 --> 00:40:56,916
and the way to introduce Sulu as...

883
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,628
I love John's performance here.

884
00:41:00,753 --> 00:41:03,005
This brings up, I think,
one of the challenges that we all had

885
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:04,925
in introducing characters

886
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,971
and finding ways to pop them
into the story in the most organic way.

887
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:11,431
I mean, it's funny,
early on in the process,

888
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:14,809
we all made a list of things
we wanted to see in <i>Trek</i>

889
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:18,313
and character traits
we knew we had to employ.

890
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:21,858
And in breaking the story,
all of us coming together

891
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,818
and figuring out
where we were gonna drop in Sulu,

892
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:26,989
and how we were gonna meet Uhura.
And, you know, those are...

893
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:31,242
If you go one molecule wrong
on the introduction, you're screwed.

894
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,661
Roger suggested doing the, you know,

895
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:35,998
zoom dolly move there,
and I was like, "Really?"

896
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,458
Then we did it,
and I was like, "That's cool."

897
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:41,628
- I love that Kirk...
- That was his... Go ahead.

898
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:43,380
I was just gonna say...

899
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:45,965
- This is Roger Guyett.
- Numerous places

900
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,344
we could talk about this, but
we could talk about our sound design,

901
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:50,887
where we had
an incredible sound designer,

902
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:52,264
a guy named Mark Stoeckinger,

903
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:55,516
who I think you first worked with
on <i>Mission: Impossible III.</i>

904
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,143
- Right. Yeah.
- Correct?

905
00:41:57,853 --> 00:42:03,233
And a lot of these sounds,
the warp, I think, came from him,

906
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:04,485
and a lot of that came from him.

907
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,362
And then as we were doing the final mix,

908
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:13,242
we wanted to keep
the iconic sounds alive

909
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,454
and figure out how we could kind of

910
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:19,833
do the 2009 version of those sounds
created 40 years ago.

911
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,793
And we all...

912
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,586
Best gag in the movie, by the way.

913
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:26,047
Sorry for interrupting.
Best gag in the movie.

914
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:29,967
We found out we could get Ben Burtt,
who had done all the original sound

915
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:33,137
on <i>Star Wars</i>
and all the movies we grew up on.

916
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:36,974
And he was available. And he came
down, and the first thing he did

917
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,896
was hang up his original
Benjamin Burtt <i>Star Trek</i> certificate,

918
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:44,315
which he had when he was a kid,
and hunkered down,

919
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,528
and for a month, really helped
find the sound design for this film.

920
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:52,532
Well, one of the first sounds
in the movie, that kind of sonar ping,

921
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,659
none of those things
were in the film originally.

922
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,579
And he really brought back
the original sounds of the doors and,

923
00:42:57,704 --> 00:43:01,708
you know, the communicator
and the sounds of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

924
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:03,751
I just want to say real quick
about Anton Yelchin.

925
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:08,422
You know, he's Russian born, but U.S.
raised, and he's an amazing actor.

926
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,675
Here's Barney Burman's hands, again.

927
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,802
I was asked by a number of people
if that was CG.

928
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:15,429
But they're just real latex giant hands.

929
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,684
And that was certainly a conversation,
in terms of script, basically saying,

930
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,351
- "Okay, is the swollen hands too broad?"
- Just tone. Yeah.

931
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:21,686
- "Okay, is the swollen hands too broad?"
- Just tone. Yeah.

932
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,231
- But I think it plays great.
- Yeah.

933
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:29,110
And I love ZoĂ«'s reaction when
she sees the hands for the first time.

934
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:31,405
Yeah, that was another
two-cameras-at-the-same-time thing,

935
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,157
which we only did because of time.
We were running out of time.

936
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:37,034
This set now, what you just saw,
was at Paramount.

937
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:38,744
This is now at the Budweiser plant.

938
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:42,373
That's beer in those big
aluminium containers.

939
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,543
- It was cold there. It was freezing.
- And it's freezing and loud.

940
00:43:45,668 --> 00:43:49,422
But this is one of those things
we were running out of time,

941
00:43:49,547 --> 00:43:51,048
so we shot this with two cameras,
as well.

942
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:55,762
By the way, I think that it's inspired
that Uhura is basically sort of a peon

943
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:57,847
- amongst thousands of peons...
- Yeah. That's right.

944
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:02,768
...in the bowels of the <i>Enterprise.</i>
And basically it's Kirk, you know,

945
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:06,606
- basically drafts her into the mission.
- Need of her.

946
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:09,777
And the fact that she speaks these
dialects of Romulan,

947
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:10,443
and the guy who is currently,
played by Osgood Perkins,

948
00:44:10,443 --> 00:44:13,405
and the guy who is currently,
played by Osgood Perkins,

949
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,657
you'll see him in a minute on the Bridge,
doesn't understand Romulan,

950
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:19,244
that's what basically gets her
her promotion.

951
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,456
And that's the key, is figuring out
ways to get your characters...

952
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:24,166
That's what the audience is waiting for,

953
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,001
is watching them take their place
on the Bridge,

954
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:28,503
- getting them there.
- We moved this, too, by the way.

955
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:32,382
You know, I think coming to it here
as opposed to earlier,

956
00:44:32,507 --> 00:44:35,719
- before Chekov starts his...
- Yeah, this used to happen

957
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:38,012
immediately after the Council meeting,

958
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:41,557
before the hangar scene,
and we moved it later.

959
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:47,063
We were just talking about
something else.

960
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,398
- I was gonna say something.
- What's a prod, by the way?

961
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:50,858
- Praetor.
- Isn't it supposed to be Praetor Nero?

962
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:54,237
- Praetor Nero.
- But it sounds like he says Prod Nero.

963
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:08,501
Scenes like this were fun to do
because they had nothing to do

964
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:11,755
with visual effects, and this is a movie
that has so much of that.

965
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,422
So these are the kind of scenes,
this one,

966
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:16,677
the one later when they're trying
to debate what action to take

967
00:45:17,177 --> 00:45:20,304
was another one, where it was just, like,
the fun of having the actors

968
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:23,684
rehearse it, just run through it,
sort of see what they would do,

969
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:25,601
and then, you know, doing it
like a regular scene.

970
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:29,188
It was just kind of a relief to get to do,
you know,

971
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,775
like we were saying,
like the drawing room scenes, almost.

972
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:36,447
Now this scene is classic <i>Trek.</i>

973
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:39,407
You know, this scene,
and then the scene where basically

974
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:42,286
Kirk and Spock, you know, are delivering

975
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:45,956
the massive exposition of, you know,
an angry future Romulan,

976
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:51,503
I think the idea that you're getting
exposition out in the context of conflict.

977
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:54,547
And, again, a big, big shout-out
to Bob and Alex,

978
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,132
because this is not easy stuff to write.

979
00:45:56,257 --> 00:46:00,512
And Kirk here used to say "fact,"
used to say "fact" before every fact.

980
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:02,847
And we just lost all the "facts"

981
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:06,684
and just made it one, you know,
smoother line. It was funny.

982
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,394
And I love that Uhura
gets his back there,

983
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,733
because here's the triangle in play,
literally the way that you've blocked it.

984
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:15,818
You know, here is...
And I love the fact that he's in blue

985
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,403
and Kirk is in black and...

986
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:22,409
Well, the key also, you know, for Uhura
and for all the main characters,

987
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:25,788
there's Osgood,
was that each of these characters

988
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:28,623
needed to have a critical role
in the story.

989
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:32,168
That without each of these characters,
they wouldn't end up where they end up.

990
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:35,005
And that was important.
Osgood actually,

991
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:38,090
he was in <i>Six Degrees of Separation</i>
that I was in.

992
00:46:38,217 --> 00:46:40,469
- That's when I met him.
- Yeah. We went to college with him.

993
00:46:40,594 --> 00:46:41,762
- So funny.
- I went to college with him.

994
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:43,554
- Yeah. We were both at NYU.
- NYU. Yeah.

995
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,097
- We didn't know each other at college.
- That's right.

996
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:48,184
- We were there the same year.
- We don't know each other now.

997
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:51,521
One of the moments, by the way,
just to go back 30 seconds,

998
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:55,317
is I love that Spock says,
"The cadet's logic is sound."

999
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:56,735
'Cause in that moment, you're like,

1000
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,739
"Okay, Spock cares more about
the ship than he does about..."

1001
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:03,324
They all have that moment.
Uhura in supporting Kirk,

1002
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:05,702
- Pike in allowing...
- Now look, they all tilt that way,

1003
00:47:05,827 --> 00:47:07,996
but the ship goes the other direction.
So, go figure.

1004
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,623
Bryan, is there a little Easter egg
coming up

1005
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:12,083
that people should be
looking for here on the DVD?

1006
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,253
There are Easter eggs.
One of my favourite things,

1007
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,003
- actually, in these shots...
- It just passed.

1008
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,755
That was it? Are we pointing it out?

1009
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,467
No, there's just something
that you might want to look for.

1010
00:47:23,052 --> 00:47:25,472
There's also bodies floating
throughout this shot,

1011
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:28,099
which is really disturbing and...

1012
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:30,853
- Love the sound design here.
- Amazing.

1013
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:33,438
This was a lot of what Ben worked on,
as well.

1014
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:34,856
This is one of my favourite sounds.

1015
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:37,025
Right here,
if you're watching this in surround,

1016
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,735
you actually hear the sound
as it passes the camera,

1017
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:42,072
- as if it's hitting the cameraman.
- Yeah, that was it. That was it.

1018
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:46,076
And by the way, listening to a DVD
commentary is great in surround.

1019
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:48,369
That's really... You'll hear J.J.

1020
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,954
- slightly back and to the left.
- Right behind you.

1021
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,289
- Just behind you.
- Yeah. Exactly.

1022
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:53,458
Now pitching, Manny Mota, Mota.

1023
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:56,961
Here's another thing, just very briefly,
that I wanted to ask you, J.J.,

1024
00:47:57,086 --> 00:47:59,422
- 'cause I don't think I ever did.
- Jewish.

1025
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:03,427
I think it was genius
that the Romulans speak English

1026
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:06,597
and that there's no subtitles.
'Cause if you think about it, you're like,

1027
00:48:06,722 --> 00:48:09,266
"Why would they be speaking English?"
But I'm so glad that they do.

1028
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:11,809
By the way, this shot has more
lens flares than anything.

1029
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:14,271
And I wanted to point out, also,

1030
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:17,565
that that was a shot that I never...
I can't figure out why I did this.

1031
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,818
I had Sulu look over his right shoulder,
as opposed to his left shoulder.

1032
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,237
I can't figure out why I did that.

1033
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,574
Because he should have looked
towards camera.

1034
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:29,161
I just think we all, you know, we
discussed it. I think that the answer was,

1035
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:33,373
"Let's not have the characters...
Let's not try and confuse it by having

1036
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:37,418
- "too many other languages."
- But it makes this moment.

1037
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:40,338
- I love Bana's delivery here.
- He's so funny.

1038
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:41,465
- Yeah, unbelievable.
- "Hello, Christopher."

1039
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,840
- Yeah. "Hi, Christopher."
- That was genius.

1040
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:44,967
That deadpan thing was brilliant.

1041
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:47,346
- "Hi, Christopher. I'm Nero."
- What does NCC stand for?

1042
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,931
- We've already been here.
- Somebody look it up, for God's sakes.

1043
00:48:50,056 --> 00:48:51,224
- Sorry.
- Okay, wait a minute. That guy,

1044
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:53,811
a lot of people think that's Kal Penn
because John Cho's in the movie.

1045
00:48:53,936 --> 00:48:55,061
- Yeah, it's not.
- It's not.

1046
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:58,440
I actually think it stands for
"no can comment."

1047
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,362
But the... Yeah, this was...

1048
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:07,115
It was very funny, when we were
shooting this, I remember,

1049
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,826
"Oh, my God, we're actually shooting
a <i>Star Trek</i> movie."

1050
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:11,202
'Cause we had this greenscreen
and we had the actors talking to it.

1051
00:49:11,327 --> 00:49:14,664
It just felt like,
this must have been what it felt like

1052
00:49:14,914 --> 00:49:17,793
when they used to do <i>Star Trek.</i>
And here we are doing <i>Star Trek.</i>

1053
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:20,211
This is a staple
of all time travel storytelling,

1054
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:23,340
which is when one character
recognises another one,

1055
00:49:23,715 --> 00:49:24,800
and then that character says,

1056
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:26,717
"I don't know you."
And then the character says,

1057
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,427
- "You don't know me yet."
- "Not yet."

1058
00:49:28,554 --> 00:49:30,847
Because we're in a time travel story.

1059
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:32,891
Not a classic time travel story, though.

1060
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:35,393
- Yes. This is a non-classic.
- I also like how the viewscreen

1061
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:38,730
is also, you know, a window.

1062
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,275
- Thank you.
- So you can kind of see through it.

1063
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:46,864
You know, one of the things
that I love about Chris' performance,

1064
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:49,949
and I love so many things,
is that, you know,

1065
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:52,327
he can actually kind of put on
his captain's hat,

1066
00:49:52,452 --> 00:49:54,371
and that's what he's doing there
when he's basically saying,

1067
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:56,039
- "Now is not the time for diplomacy."
- That's right.

1068
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:57,623
You're like, "Wow,
this guy's actually very bright."

1069
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:01,170
That was the hardest thing to come up
with, remember, in casting this part.

1070
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:02,920
You know, some people were good
at playing rebel.

1071
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:05,673
Some people were good at delivering
captain's dialogue.

1072
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:08,135
- Nobody was good at doing both.
- Yeah, Chris could sort of do it all.

1073
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,262
- We actually, when we did this shot...
- I love this shot.

1074
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:11,637
- Yeah, amazing.
- We actually had

1075
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,016
this crazy rig.
It was really hard 'cause the roof

1076
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,478
or the ceiling of the stage
wasn't as high as I wish it had been.

1077
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,813
But anyway, we did this whole thing
with this crazy crane,

1078
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:23,150
and, of course, ILM did the rest.
But it was cool to get.

1079
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:24,693
- You didn't shoot it in space?
- We did shoot...

1080
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:26,487
That was the one shot we actually
built everything.

1081
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:30,574
- This to me is a... Look at that.
- We shot it in space, too.

1082
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,659
So much of that background was CG.
It's amazing.

1083
00:50:32,784 --> 00:50:36,454
Like, we built a piece of the ramp.
Everything else was CG.

1084
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:39,541
But this was one of those sequences
that, you know, I'm not quite sure

1085
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:43,420
what is landing for the audience, but
we were showing them that this guy is

1086
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,505
going in and doing something
somewhere.

1087
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,925
And I don't think you're supposed to
understand it quite yet.

1088
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,425
But hopefully, as time goes on,
you realise,

1089
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,762
- "This is Spock's ship." Yeah.
- That they're in the squid.

1090
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:54,556
We made a lot of choices
like that that I think make it so

1091
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,934
that when you see the movie over
and over, there's more cool stuff.

1092
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:59,436
- Yeah.
- I like not patronising the audience.

1093
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:01,271
I like patronising the audience.

1094
00:51:01,396 --> 00:51:03,023
- I know, Alex is totally about patronising.
- Totally.

1095
00:51:03,148 --> 00:51:05,067
I want the audience
to patronise the movie,

1096
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:08,570
- but I don't want to patronise them.
- Patronise the audience.

1097
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,074
We had to stabilise this shot later.
Not that it matters.

1098
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:15,619
I was there the day that we shot this,
as well, and this was at Budweiser.

1099
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:18,246
And this is the first time that I...

1100
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:19,831
That was the day that you decided to

1101
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:21,500
- swear off beer, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

1102
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:25,378
I was sitting next to Bruce Greenwood,
and for some reason,

1103
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:28,132
I just always get star struck around
that guy. You know, he just...

1104
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:30,300
- 'Cause he's awesome.
- It's coming off him in waves.

1105
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:32,552
One of the things that I love
when they enter the shuttle,

1106
00:51:32,677 --> 00:51:35,972
- is the radio check, all that filter stuff.
- Yeah.

1107
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:38,141
There's something about it.
It creates an amazing energy,

1108
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:39,768
along with the music change
that happens there.

1109
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:42,563
- It's fun.
- Well, that... The music change...

1110
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:44,731
It's funny, 'cause this sequence
is another one of those things

1111
00:51:44,856 --> 00:51:48,193
we made these changes
where we ended up changing the score

1112
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:49,193
in the last, you know, days of the cut.

1113
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,362
in the last, you know, days of the cut.

1114
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,947
I love that look right there between

1115
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:54,782
the two of those guys.
'Cause it just, you know,

1116
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:58,286
the fact that they're still unresolved
and, you know, at odds, I think is...

1117
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:01,331
I think there's this great moment
in the writing, you know,

1118
00:52:01,456 --> 00:52:02,916
and also in the way
that you blocked it, J.J.,

1119
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,085
in that it harkens back to the <i>Kelvin,</i>

1120
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,005
where basically Robau
says to George Kirk,

1121
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,213
"You're the captain now."

1122
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:11,215
Well, you literally just played
the same scene again

1123
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,010
- as the guys are getting in the elevator.
- That's right.

1124
00:52:13,135 --> 00:52:14,510
Which means you know bad things
are gonna happen.

1125
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,554
Exactly. The handoff has occurred.

1126
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:19,974
And just back to Greenwood again,
tying this back to the '60s

1127
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:21,768
and how Kirk and the Captain Pike
were kind of models

1128
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:22,603
and how Kirk and the Captain Pike
were kind of models

1129
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:25,773
of a Kennedyesque kind of a figure,
Greenwood really just brings that,

1130
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:29,358
not just because he played
Kennedy in <i>Thirteen Days,</i>

1131
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:32,905
but he played that role great
'cause he has that genuine centre.

1132
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:36,074
I love that we just embraced the fact
that this guy is dead.

1133
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:38,409
He's dead with a capital "D."

1134
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:41,704
- Red shirt number one.
- What were you gonna say, Bryan?

1135
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:42,914
Well, the drill sequence

1136
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,335
- wasn't in the original script.
- That was our last-minute add.

1137
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,878
- Space jump.
- Quite a thing to add at the last minute.

1138
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:50,213
- Yeah.
- The sequence was here,

1139
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:52,632
- but it just didn't involve the drill jump.
- Right.

1140
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:54,300
- The space jump.
- There was still everything else.

1141
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:55,552
Production was thrilled that we...

1142
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:57,094
To think about the movie
without the space jump...

1143
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:58,764
"Can we have $6 million more, please?"

1144
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:01,766
Yeah, exactly. But it was worth it.
I mean, you know...

1145
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:05,144
Well, this sequence is sort of
the centrepiece of the movie in a way,

1146
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,606
- you know, this whole thing.
- And this is one of the last things

1147
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,650
you shot, J.J. I remember,
right as we were about to wrap,

1148
00:53:10,775 --> 00:53:13,027
going to the Paramount lot
and you were shooting in the...

1149
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:14,362
- The shuttle?
- No,

1150
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:16,907
you were shooting
the three actors basically

1151
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:21,369
- being pushed around on dollies.
- The sky...

1152
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:23,914
Well, yeah, but what was crazy

1153
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,958
when we were doing this sequence
was trying to find a way

1154
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,460
to get the shots of them
as they were diving.

1155
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:32,672
'Cause they had a lot of dialogue,
and when you hang the actors

1156
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:35,634
upside down, you know,
their blood is just rushing to their head,

1157
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:39,137
they're getting headaches.
It's really uncomfortable.

1158
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:40,722
It just never worked.

1159
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:44,559
And so this is one of the two places
where I wanted the silence.

1160
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:47,311
And there's that, you know,
ring out of sound.

1161
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:49,940
When we'd go to the theatre,

1162
00:53:50,065 --> 00:53:53,527
we went around and watched
real live audiences watching the movie

1163
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:55,778
after we'd seen it a thousand times,

1164
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,614
in that silence, you can always
hear them kind of, you know,

1165
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,534
whispering to each other.
It was always cool.

1166
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:03,036
- Like, "Wow."
- "Are the speakers broken?"

1167
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:07,081
But what's cool about this is, like,
when they go through the atmosphere...

1168
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:10,626
So these shots are on their faces
that are coming up now,

1169
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:14,465
like for a shot like this or this one
what we ended up doing was,

1170
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,842
we couldn't get them, and so we ended
up taking these big pieces of mylar

1171
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:21,804
and putting them down in the parking
lot, just like 6-by-6 foot square,

1172
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,764
and having the actors stand on them,

1173
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:26,226
and we put the camera above them
looking down.

1174
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:30,396
And so you had sky behind them.
They're actually standing up,

1175
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:32,315
and we're just shaking the camera
like crazy.

1176
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,650
- That's great.
- It's so funny.

1177
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:36,652
Like Pine, here, he's just standing.

1178
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,989
J.J. keeps referring
to shaking the camera,

1179
00:54:39,114 --> 00:54:41,282
and if you go through some of
the making of, you'll see what he...

1180
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,536
He really stands on top and holds
the magazine where the film is

1181
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:48,706
and really shakes it back and forth.
All these shots really are given

1182
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,585
- a sense of life because it feels...
- Kinetic energy, yeah.

1183
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,920
Well, <i>Lost</i> was the first time
I really started doing that,

1184
00:54:54,045 --> 00:54:56,422
when we were doing
the aeroplane crash.

1185
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:58,842
And it just gave it
that sense of movement

1186
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:01,469
that the cameraman can't do himself,

1187
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,096
'cause it's just impossible
to get that kind of

1188
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:06,599
high-frequency vibration
and hold the camera.

1189
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:10,896
You want to talk a little bit about
how we ended up

1190
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:14,483
coming to the blocking
of this sequence on the drill?

1191
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:17,945
Well, first of all,
all this stuff here was done

1192
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,030
at the parking lot at Dodger Stadium.

1193
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:23,367
We built essentially a third of the drill,

1194
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:30,706
and, you know, we shot it outside,
mostly because, you know,

1195
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:35,586
I knew that even if the light wasn't
great, when you had real sunlight,

1196
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:38,172
you would know
you were not inside on a stage.

1197
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:41,385
And I think it helped enormously
giving the thing a sense of realism.

1198
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,637
What did you want to talk about, Alex?
The blocking?

1199
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:47,474
We just didn't know how we were gonna
play out this sequence on the drill.

1200
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,643
I mean, we knew what it was,
but we didn't, the moves of it

1201
00:55:49,768 --> 00:55:52,728
and, tonally, how much fun
we wanted to have with it

1202
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:55,773
versus, you know, how much gaggery
could we put in there?

1203
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:58,610
And we said to ourselves,
we really want it to be like

1204
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:01,405
when Indiana Jones
in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

1205
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,284
is basically... It's the spinning plane
sequence, where Marion is basically

1206
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:08,911
inside the plane, and then, you know,

1207
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:13,625
every time he does something that is
successful, it creates a new obstacle

1208
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,003
that makes the situation
more life threatening.

1209
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:19,547
The best thing about that sequence,
by the way,

1210
00:56:19,672 --> 00:56:24,260
in <i>Indiana Jones,</i> or in <i>Raiders,</i> is that
the Ark is not even on that plane.

1211
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:25,429
- That's right.
- That whole sequence happens,

1212
00:56:25,554 --> 00:56:26,929
you're like, "It wasn't even on the plane."

1213
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,764
I think one of the things that
that movie taught us,

1214
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:31,559
among all those kinds of movies, is that

1215
00:56:31,684 --> 00:56:35,563
the way these action sequences
work best is you set up a problem,

1216
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:37,690
you relieve the tension,
and then another problem is created.

1217
00:56:37,815 --> 00:56:39,568
And it just happens over and over
and over again,

1218
00:56:39,693 --> 00:56:42,153
so the audience never gets
a sense that it's gonna rest.

1219
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:45,740
And I remember we were kind of talking
about the logistics of this,

1220
00:56:45,865 --> 00:56:48,702
and we broke for lunch on
the <i>Enterprise</i> set,

1221
00:56:48,827 --> 00:56:53,748
and Steven came by, Spielberg,
and we all sat and had sandwiches,

1222
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:57,376
literally on the Bridge,
and talked about this.

1223
00:56:57,503 --> 00:56:59,545
I got home that day, and my wife
was like, "How was your day?"

1224
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,257
And I was like, "Pretty good. Not bad."

1225
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:05,719
That was really among
the most surreal...

1226
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:07,971
I remember, actually, Steven visited
when we were shooting

1227
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:11,016
the Kobayashi Maru sequence,
and someone said to me

1228
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:14,894
about five minutes before he got there,
"You know, today is his birthday."

1229
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:16,396
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- I'm like, "What?"

1230
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:19,190
So I'm like, "Cake! Get a cake!"

1231
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:21,235
- "Good God, get a cake!"
- So, before he left,

1232
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,320
there was a cake for him.

1233
00:57:23,445 --> 00:57:24,530
Oh, my God.

1234
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:29,451
Yeah, this sequence was obviously,
you know,

1235
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,704
crazy challenging
'cause of all the moves in it

1236
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:34,331
and the amount of time that we had.

1237
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:38,210
But all the actors,
the stunt actors, you know,

1238
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,838
obviously John and Chris,
they just all did an amazing job.

1239
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:44,675
- And it was a lot of work.
- By the way, this is all Sulu.

1240
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,469
I mean, Sulu basically kills both
these Romulans

1241
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:49,637
- and saves Kirk's life.
- Yeah, Sulu is a massive hero in this.

1242
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:51,264
Well, what's great about the gag setup
is that

1243
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:53,182
- when you hear fencing...
- That's a weird cut.

1244
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,976
No, that's good.
But when you hear fencing, you go,

1245
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:58,938
"It's not... Fencing?"
And then it turns out that he's a ninja.

1246
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:01,023
Well, I gotta say,
the swashbuckling vibe,

1247
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,608
you cannot deny how much fun that is.

1248
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:04,445
- Totally.
- I love the background.

1249
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,905
That was CG done later,
and then this is all real.

1250
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,449
Of course, then the CG on the left.

1251
00:58:09,574 --> 00:58:12,786
It's just an amazing thing to see
how ILM seamlessly intercuts,

1252
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:15,539
or not intercuts,
but combines actual footage.

1253
00:58:15,664 --> 00:58:16,873
Here's another thing
where we were like,

1254
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:19,960
"What? How do they disable the drill?
Should they have to open up a..."

1255
00:58:20,085 --> 00:58:21,753
Well, originally, in the script,
they went inside.

1256
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:23,338
- Right. Yeah.
- And I was like,

1257
00:58:23,463 --> 00:58:25,257
- "Let's just shoot the thing."
- Yeah, exactly.

1258
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,550
We need to cut $200,000
out of the sequence.

1259
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:29,635
- How about they just shoot it?
- Just shoot it.

1260
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,139
Yeah, you don't miss that scene.

1261
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:34,349
Love that moment, too,
where he slips up.

1262
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:37,101
Although I keep referencing
that moment as,

1263
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:41,315
because of that screw-up,
it is the reason why Amanda dies.

1264
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,525
There used to be a moment here,
by the way, where the guy said,

1265
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,235
"The drill's been sabotaged,"
and Nero shot him.

1266
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,282
- But it was so stupid.
- The design of this device is amazing.

1267
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:53,534
- Incredible. Just so cool.
- It is pretty cool.

1268
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,077
- The way it stabilises.
- Who did that?

1269
00:58:55,204 --> 00:58:59,750
Scott Chambliss oversaw the design,
but James Clyne did a lot of the design.

1270
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,418
I'm not sure who did that pod.

1271
00:59:03,128 --> 00:59:04,128
This shot's... I like this kind of thing.

1272
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:07,090
'Cause this is on a dolly going one
direction, and then on the whip here...

1273
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:08,592
- Yep, love it. Love it.
...we cut to a dolly

1274
00:59:08,717 --> 00:59:10,344
- going the other direction.
- Yeah. So good.

1275
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:14,597
And then he turns around,
and there are more lens flares.

1276
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:21,396
I love Anton's delivery here,
which is basically, this is the moment

1277
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:23,898
where the audience realises,
"Wait a minute,

1278
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:26,275
"are they actually gonna
destroy Vulcan?"

1279
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,447
Just, you know, again, in one of those
very first story meetings that we all had,

1280
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:32,990
we basically said,

1281
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:34,534
- "If we're gonna change things..."
- "Let's do it."

1282
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:38,288
- "...we've gotta change it in a big way."
- Watch ZoĂ«'s eyes right here.

1283
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:42,126
There are two things in particular

1284
00:59:42,251 --> 00:59:44,585
that blow my mind about her
in this movie.

1285
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,132
Right here.
That little thing she does right there,

1286
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:49,757
- it just says so much to me.
- A lot, yeah.

1287
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:51,927
- It says she loves him.
- Yep. There it is.

1288
00:59:52,052 --> 00:59:53,887
And you just see
there's a whole inner life going on.

1289
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:55,889
I mean, she's amazing.

1290
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:03,730
So, what I loved about this was
just the idea that, you know,

1291
01:00:03,856 --> 01:00:06,775
you think, "It's gonna be one of those
save the guy with a parachute."

1292
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,025
And then the fact that, you know,

1293
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:10,112
we go one step further
and have the parachute break.

1294
01:00:10,237 --> 01:00:11,237
Yeah.

1295
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:12,447
Just was one of my favourite
story points.

1296
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:14,907
Right, because of the audience
who has not been initiated to <i>Trek...</i>

1297
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:16,827
- That's right.
- lf you ask somebody,

1298
01:00:16,952 --> 01:00:18,369
"Hey, do you know anything
about <i>Star Trek?"</i>

1299
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:20,079
"I've never seen a movie."
"Beam me up, Scotty?"

1300
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:22,416
They just know that. But they've never...

1301
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:24,041
So in this moment
when the parachute breaks,

1302
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:26,210
for those people, they're like,
"These two are dead.

1303
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:28,005
- "There's no way to save them."
- Now, in these shots

1304
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:32,217
where you see close-ups of them,
like when they're falling together,

1305
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:36,929
like this, they're just hugging
and turning on the mirror

1306
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:40,309
and the camera is shaking. That was
the day that Walter Koenig visited,

1307
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:42,643
who played the original...
And I think he thought this was gonna be

1308
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,188
the worst movie of all time.

1309
01:00:44,313 --> 01:00:45,856
I was so embarrassed. I was like,

1310
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:50,318
"Mr Koenig, I swear, it's not gonna just
look like two guys hugging on a mirror."

1311
01:00:50,443 --> 01:00:52,403
I'd watch that, though.

1312
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:55,324
This was one hallway, and we cut there

1313
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:57,409
to make it look like a bigger hallway.

1314
01:00:57,534 --> 01:01:00,036
For some reason, it's one
of my favourite cuts in the movie.

1315
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:03,206
By the way, I think we've all gone
on record as saying

1316
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:05,583
one of our favourite <i>Trek</i> films
is <i>Galaxy Quest.</i>

1317
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:09,253
And this sequence
is clearly an homage to

1318
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:12,257
- Tony Shalhoub's great save in that film.
- It's a brilliant, brilliant movie.

1319
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:14,384
God, that movie is good.

1320
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:19,681
And I love the way

1321
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,599
- the beaming effects look there.
- The beaming.

1322
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:23,518
That it breaks.
That it kind of shatters there.

1323
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:23,851
That it breaks.
That it kind of shatters there.

1324
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:26,396
When he says, <i>"Yo-moyo,"we</i> were
in Moscow and he said that line,

1325
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:27,773
the audience went
insane at the premiere.

1326
01:01:27,898 --> 01:01:29,065
What does it mean?

1327
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,318
I can't really say it with
my daughter listening.

1328
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:33,653
- Okay.
- But it's a sort of colloquialism.

1329
01:01:33,653 --> 01:01:35,405
- Okay.
- But it's a sort of colloquialism.

1330
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:40,409
- Involving borscht.
- "I'm so happy?"

1331
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:43,914
Roughly translated it means,
"Good borscht!"

1332
01:01:44,123 --> 01:01:45,833
Exclamation point.

1333
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,586
I love that Spock assumes
the transporting position.

1334
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:54,048
This was the first shot, by the way,
that we did with Zachary

1335
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:55,550
- in the movie, this very one.
- I remember these were

1336
01:01:55,675 --> 01:01:59,762
the first dailies I saw. Obviously <i>sans</i>
anything crumbling behind him.

1337
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:03,057
- So that's a shuttle leaving the planet?
- Yeah.

1338
01:02:05,018 --> 01:02:07,353
- These are all real rocks.
- No, that's not true.

1339
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:09,063
There's the katric ark.

1340
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:14,027
And this was, again,
another piece of music that we added,

1341
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,574
- you know, put back in in the last mix.
- Makes a huge, huge, huge difference.

1342
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:21,117
This was one of my favourite shots
that ILM, I think,

1343
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:25,204
just did an amazing job, which
was referencing existing <i>Trek</i> lore.

1344
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:27,916
By the way, in watching the movie,
you know, one of the things

1345
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:29,918
that occurred to me,
'cause I remember seeing these dailies,

1346
01:02:30,043 --> 01:02:33,755
was basically like, "Wow, I don't think
I've ever seen Spock run before."

1347
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,923
- I'm sure he ran in the original series.
- No.

1348
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,384
Yeah, you saw him run a little bit,

1349
01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:38,719
- but not like this.
- But very, very infrequently.

1350
01:02:38,844 --> 01:02:42,764
- Yeah, this is a whole other...
- When that guy eats it there,

1351
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:45,684
it's very pleasurable for some reason
for me. I don't know why.

1352
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:48,603
- That is even more pleasurable.
- And that was all practical.

1353
01:02:48,728 --> 01:02:51,063
Literally. That was a stuntman who was
just standing behind the rock,

1354
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:53,692
but it sure looks like it took him out.

1355
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:56,068
Vulcan elder known as Splat.

1356
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,864
- Terrible.
- Thank you.

1357
01:03:00,532 --> 01:03:02,867
And this is great.
I love this moment that Winona gives us,

1358
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:05,329
- which is basically, "Wait a minute."
- "I know I'm about to eat it."

1359
01:03:05,454 --> 01:03:08,831
- "This is not gonna work."
- "Yeah, see you later."

1360
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:22,346
I just love Anton's performance there,
just how he feels his failure.

1361
01:03:23,514 --> 01:03:24,681
This is a great series of shots,

1362
01:03:24,806 --> 01:03:29,436
but one of the performances that I really
love here, again, is Ben Cross',

1363
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:30,561
- which is basically, like...
- I agree.

1364
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:33,398
"Okay, I want you to play the fact
that your wife is dead.

1365
01:03:33,565 --> 01:03:35,983
- "But you're a Vulcan."
- But you're Vulcan. Go.

1366
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,568
"And action."

1367
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:40,822
- And let's begin. So there it is.
- Well, same for Zach, for your mother.

1368
01:03:40,947 --> 01:03:45,702
It's basically like, "Wow, I really want
to be very upset, but I'm a Vulcan."

1369
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:53,085
And I just love how in the script,
you guys went from a high

1370
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,672
of everyone being saved moments ago
to the planet and his mother dying,

1371
01:03:56,797 --> 01:04:00,259
- which is just tragic.
- This is a great effect, by the way.

1372
01:04:00,384 --> 01:04:02,344
I mean, you basically say to someone,

1373
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:05,179
"Planet sucked into internal black hole."

1374
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:07,431
- Yes, it's easier to write than it is to...
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1375
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:08,766
- Have fun with that.
- And by the way...

1376
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,226
It should look like the <i>Poltergeist</i> house.

1377
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:13,646
The sound there, that was
another great move done, I think,

1378
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:18,985
by Mark and Ben and Andy Nelson,
the sound mixers, Anna.

1379
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:24,157
But by having the planet get absorbed
and kind of like muffled

1380
01:04:24,282 --> 01:04:27,577
and kind of get sucked in, and then have
the whoosh of the ship go by.

1381
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:29,454
They just did an amazing job
with the sound.

1382
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:33,375
By the way,
just to kiss up to you again, J.J.,

1383
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,878
I feel like, in these kind of movies,
it's so easy

1384
01:04:37,003 --> 01:04:40,590
to use slow motion
over and over and over and over again.

1385
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:44,802
And I think that, if memory serves,
this is the only time in the entire movie

1386
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,514
- that you shot slow-mo.
- There's one other time.

1387
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:50,349
- Where?
- When Spock is

1388
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:52,101
dismissed from the Bridge.

1389
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:54,271
- Oh, right. Yes.
- And he walks down the hallway.

1390
01:04:54,396 --> 01:04:57,983
But it's so effective,
when you use it there,

1391
01:04:58,108 --> 01:05:00,777
just in terms of the emotion about
saying, "We're slowing the movie down."

1392
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:02,653
- Thanks, man.
- And here basically...

1393
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,405
That was a nice little cut, by the way,
when he stood up.

1394
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,742
There was a cut from one shot
to another wider.

1395
01:05:06,867 --> 01:05:12,581
I remember, basically Bob and Alex
and I and Mr Leonard Nimoy

1396
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:19,086
took the movie to Austin
to show it to sort of the <i>Star Trek</i> geeks,

1397
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:20,463
- for lack of a better word.
- And they had no idea

1398
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,048
- they were gonna see it.
- And we sprung it on them.

1399
01:05:22,173 --> 01:05:25,510
But basically they were really
reacting to the movie positively,

1400
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:27,971
up until this moment.
And we were all basically like,

1401
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:31,809
"All right, this is where we basically,
completely could lose them."

1402
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:33,393
Because this is, I think,

1403
01:05:33,518 --> 01:05:36,021
the most intensive departure
from canon in the movie,

1404
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:38,148
and I know J.J. wants to talk
about their performances here,

1405
01:05:38,273 --> 01:05:40,858
but I just feel like this was
the gutsiest thing that we did.

1406
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:43,362
Blowing up Vulcan was nothing
compared to saying,

1407
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:45,780
"Spock and Uhura are in love
with each other

1408
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:48,659
"and are having
this incredibly intimate relationship."

1409
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:52,871
Whenever I watch this scene,
I'm watching it, you know,

1410
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:54,748
I've seen it a gazillion times, and I think,

1411
01:05:54,873 --> 01:05:56,166
"Okay, I'm not really emotional
while watching.

1412
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,001
"I'm not emotional, I'm not emotional."

1413
01:05:58,126 --> 01:05:59,710
And then she does this thing
when she says, "Okay."

1414
01:05:59,836 --> 01:06:03,172
This, yeah. Yeah.

1415
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:11,431
And literally, even now, watching that,
she is so great in that moment.

1416
01:06:11,556 --> 01:06:15,101
I just cannot... And it was interesting
talking to her about it.

1417
01:06:15,226 --> 01:06:19,690
We were in Mexico
for the release of the film there,

1418
01:06:19,815 --> 01:06:23,860
and she was telling me
what she was processing

1419
01:06:23,985 --> 01:06:25,153
when she was doing that scene.

1420
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:27,072
And it was actually kind of amazing
to hear.

1421
01:06:27,197 --> 01:06:28,614
- What'd she say?
- Well, she was going through

1422
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:32,286
this whole thing, like, thinking
that his mother, his mommy, died,

1423
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:36,331
you know, the woman who gave birth
to him and breastfed him,

1424
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:40,168
and she had this whole story
in her mind of his loss

1425
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:42,170
and how emotional she was.

1426
01:06:42,295 --> 01:06:45,007
And literally she thought of a story
that was a very personal story

1427
01:06:45,132 --> 01:06:48,510
about her family,
what she and her family went through.

1428
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:51,637
It was a fascinating thing,
actually, to hear

1429
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:54,932
the depth to which she had considered
what Uhura would go through,

1430
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,936
and then how to find strength
and not just pure vulnerability.

1431
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:01,106
But you see in that fraction
of a moment when she says, "Okay,"

1432
01:07:01,231 --> 01:07:03,400
you see that vulnerability come through,

1433
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:05,027
and I just love it
that she was so restrained.

1434
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:07,905
- Do Vulcans breastfeed?
- She's not a Vulcan.

1435
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,157
- You mean, do Vulcan babies?
- No, I'm just saying, he was.

1436
01:07:10,282 --> 01:07:13,034
No, the point was she was just trying
to, you know...

1437
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,704
- No, no, I'm just trying to make a joke.
- The answer is yes.

1438
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:17,246
It was funny.

1439
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:20,793
It brings a whole new level to it.

1440
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:26,632
Once again, I think, Eric Bana,
this is really his scene, you know,

1441
01:07:26,757 --> 01:07:31,302
and it's the scene that, especially now
with the prison sequence gone,

1442
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:35,724
it's the first time you really get to,
you know, empathize.

1443
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:39,811
There's a comic book that explains all
of this incredibly well, with great detail,

1444
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:42,563
- that's actually quite good.
- It is.

1445
01:07:44,858 --> 01:07:48,152
This shot goes on too long.
That's all I'm gonna say.

1446
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:55,702
It's funny, 'cause he makes it look easy,

1447
01:07:55,827 --> 01:07:58,831
but Eric Bana had to be a bad guy
in a space adventure.

1448
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:00,706
- He does make it look easy, though.
- You know.

1449
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:02,166
His accent's also amazing.

1450
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:03,710
- Yeah, he did an...
- Really amazing.

1451
01:08:03,835 --> 01:08:06,505
He really brought so much
to this character.

1452
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:11,009
I've always felt that one of the greatest
compliments an actor can ever be paid

1453
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,679
by the critics
is the word "unrecognisable."

1454
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:15,847
- Yeah.
- And I just saw that

1455
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:21,395
sort of across the board. Every time
I read a review of the movie, they said,

1456
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,565
"Eric Bana was unrecognisable."
And I just think that that's amazing.

1457
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:27,109
'Cause it's not the makeup.
It's his performance.

1458
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:31,572
It's also interesting, you know,
that Cameron Crowe

1459
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:34,574
saw a very early cut of the film,
and he was like,

1460
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:36,201
"Who was the bad... Who was Nero?"

1461
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:38,078
- Oh, yeah.
- I said, "Eric Bana." He goes, "What?"

1462
01:08:38,203 --> 01:08:40,456
He literally didn't know who it was.

1463
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:43,792
All this dialogue, by the way,
was put in later.

1464
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:45,918
Yep. Remember how many times
we rewrote this line?

1465
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:49,088
Yes. But I think the thing about
learning... 'Cause we didn't want

1466
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:52,842
Pike to have squealed.
And if we learn that

1467
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:55,720
what this bug did was force him
to reveal the truth,

1468
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:59,515
it wasn't his fault any more
that he revealed the codes.

1469
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,100
There was also a lot of debate
about how it did that.

1470
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:04,104
- Yeah, right.
- Wrapping around your brainstem and...

1471
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:07,899
This was one of my most favourite
sequences to shoot.

1472
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:14,739
Now, I remember, on the set that day,
you guys were just running the scene,

1473
01:09:14,907 --> 01:09:16,949
and everybody was just running
their lines.

1474
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:21,872
And Chris was sitting in that chair,
and Zach improvised that, right?

1475
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:24,707
- Or you basically said...
- I told him to say it,

1476
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:27,211
but then I didn't know
if we should do it or not.

1477
01:09:27,336 --> 01:09:29,128
- But I kind of felt like...
- You were like, "Is it funny?"

1478
01:09:29,253 --> 01:09:30,380
I was like, "It's really funny."

1479
01:09:30,506 --> 01:09:32,591
It was just one of those scenes
where I just thought it...

1480
01:09:32,716 --> 01:09:35,551
- It gets a laugh every time in the theatre.
- I don't know. It made me laugh.

1481
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:37,845
Huge laugh.
'Cause it talks about the destiny.

1482
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,430
You know,
and the audience is in on the joke.

1483
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:40,932
- Yeah.
- They know that

1484
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:42,184
Kirk's gonna end up in the chair.

1485
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:43,726
And it's a relationship moment
between them.

1486
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,938
That's why the joke plays.

1487
01:09:46,063 --> 01:09:49,190
But this sequence was a long...
It's a long scene.

1488
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:52,860
My favourite scene in the movie, oddly.

1489
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:54,154
This was a fun scene to write.

1490
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:57,824
But it was also fun just to have
all the characters in that room together

1491
01:09:57,949 --> 01:09:59,784
finally doing their thing, you know?

1492
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:00,618
finally doing their thing, you know?

1493
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:02,246
This is where we basically say,

1494
01:10:02,371 --> 01:10:05,414
"Okay, you've been asking us,
how are we gonna make a movie

1495
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:09,627
"for the Trekkies, Trekkers,
loyal fans for 40 years,

1496
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,213
"and make it accessible to people
who have never seen <i>Trek."</i>

1497
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:15,007
And this is the scene that
basically says, "All right,

1498
01:10:15,134 --> 01:10:17,552
"this is how we're gonna do it.
This is our best shot.

1499
01:10:17,677 --> 01:10:20,930
"It's a parallel universe,

1500
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:24,560
"and we're gonna follow
the parallel universe from here on out."

1501
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,229
Well, that was really, I think,
the brilliance of the script

1502
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:31,358
is that it allowed it to be true
to <i>Star Trek.</i>

1503
01:10:31,483 --> 01:10:34,862
But to someone like me,
again, who is not really

1504
01:10:34,987 --> 01:10:38,282
- a <i>Star Trek</i> fan to begin with, I was...
- And still not, ironically.

1505
01:10:38,407 --> 01:10:40,993
- You hate it even more.
- Well, now I hate it.

1506
01:10:41,118 --> 01:10:43,036
Yeah. I didn't hate it as much before.

1507
01:10:43,162 --> 01:10:47,916
No, but now I feel like, you know,
these are my characters now.

1508
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,461
It's not just that group of people.
It's sort of everyone's.

1509
01:10:50,586 --> 01:10:53,463
I love that Kirk is really angry
about what we've done, too.

1510
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:58,594
He's basically like,
"I don't like angry future Romulans.

1511
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,386
"I don't like parallel Earths.

1512
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:04,725
"I just want to go and save Captain Pike
and get into space fights."

1513
01:11:06,643 --> 01:11:12,149
We talked a lot about how you needed
to see the qualities of the Kirk

1514
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:15,944
that we knew before this movie
in this scene, in his reactions.

1515
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:18,113
I love that Kirk also says,
you know, he also said...

1516
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:20,532
There's a very real quality to that.

1517
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:23,368
He also said, "Come get me." It's like...

1518
01:11:23,493 --> 01:11:25,787
That was actually something...
It feels very real for some reason,

1519
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:27,497
- that little exchange.
- Well, and it was important to us

1520
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:28,873
- that they were both right.
- Yeah, that's right.

1521
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:31,417
Neither one of them could be wrong.
And part of the inspiration, again,

1522
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,421
going back to the '60s,
was Lennon and McCartney

1523
01:11:34,546 --> 01:11:35,756
and looking at their friendship.

1524
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:38,382
They'd both lost their mothers
very young.

1525
01:11:38,509 --> 01:11:40,135
Lennon's, run over by a cop.

1526
01:11:40,135 --> 01:11:40,719
Lennon's, run over by a cop.

1527
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:42,887
And they were, in a way, opposites.

1528
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:45,556
And that bond allowed them to actually
see past each other.

1529
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:47,266
And now they have the same goal,

1530
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:48,393
and yet they want
to approach it differently.

1531
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:54,774
There is one line that I always loved
in the script

1532
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:58,694
that I miss in the movie every time
that I see it, which is when Kirk sort of

1533
01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:04,201
starts doing his log supplemental here,
he kind of goes on this tirade

1534
01:12:04,326 --> 01:12:07,912
about Spock, where he goes,
"Whose only way of expressing emotion

1535
01:12:08,037 --> 01:12:11,082
"is by using his eyebrow," or some such.

1536
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:13,042
- But, I know...
- It's in the audio book.

1537
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:14,877
- You can still see it.
- I know why we lost it

1538
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:17,381
because in sort of like its tone...

1539
01:12:17,506 --> 01:12:18,631
Well, you couldn't hear it
in the snowstorm.

1540
01:12:18,756 --> 01:12:19,966
Yeah. It's tonally weird a little bit.

1541
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:23,970
There's one line coming up
in the Nimoy introduction scene

1542
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:26,722
that I desperately wish
we'd kept in the movie,

1543
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:30,185
because it's the thing we've been
nailed on the most in all of the...

1544
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:33,229
It was the line that kind of embraced
the coincidences of...

1545
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:34,439
I agree.

1546
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:36,024
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
we got nailed.

1547
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:37,525
There's a quantum mechanical
explanation for each...

1548
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,902
This scene went on for so long.

1549
01:12:39,027 --> 01:12:40,445
This was all done
at the Dodger Stadium.

1550
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,072
You can watch it on the DVD, too.

1551
01:12:42,197 --> 01:12:44,867
This scene was
originally supposed to be in Iceland,

1552
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:46,743
- and then we got the bill.
- Right.

1553
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:50,872
This shot was done, actually,
second unit in Alaska,

1554
01:12:50,997 --> 01:12:53,792
with an actor walking,
and then they added the snow,

1555
01:12:53,917 --> 01:12:56,712
the snow falling later
and the distant mountains.

1556
01:12:56,837 --> 01:12:59,797
- But the... Go ahead.
- What J.J. is also not talking about

1557
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:01,550
is when we were doing this
at Dodger Stadium,

1558
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:04,677
in order to make our schedule
and finish the movie,

1559
01:13:04,802 --> 01:13:09,099
is we had all these sequences
all being shot at the same time.

1560
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:12,770
We had the drill sequence set up
right next door to this sequence.

1561
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:15,939
And J.J., there were literally days
where you were running

1562
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:18,024
- from one sequence to the other.
- Yeah. Even worse.

1563
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:21,487
We'd be shooting the drill sequence,
and you'd have little snow particles

1564
01:13:21,612 --> 01:13:24,530
flying over to the drills.
Like, could we get the snow

1565
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:26,617
- not to come over to the...
- Not to be in the desert?

1566
01:13:26,742 --> 01:13:27,743
Above Vulcan.

1567
01:13:27,868 --> 01:13:31,997
I remember one of those days,
all the international distributors

1568
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:35,000
came to Dodger Stadium,
and it was just, like,

1569
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:37,002
"Okay, over here we're shooting this.

1570
01:13:37,127 --> 01:13:38,962
"Over there we're shooting
the drill sequence."

1571
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:42,256
It was like the factory floor. Like,
"Here are the different models of cars

1572
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:43,759
- "we're making for <i>Star Trek."</i>
- That's crazy.

1573
01:13:43,884 --> 01:13:48,430
Originally, this creature
came out a different way.

1574
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:54,310
He was sort of behind a big snowdrift.
And Roger Guyett had a brilliant idea

1575
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:56,313
that he just looks over
and sees this thing charging at him

1576
01:13:56,438 --> 01:13:59,649
from the beginning.
And then this big red creature...

1577
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:04,445
You know, again, all this was done
on a fairly small piece of set

1578
01:14:04,654 --> 01:14:08,033
at Dodger Stadium.
But you know, all that snow is paper.

1579
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:11,328
We had a little teeny piece of a...
Well, not a teeny,

1580
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:14,206
but a smaller piece of this little hill built.

1581
01:14:14,331 --> 01:14:19,211
But Chris Pine inhaled probably,
like, four reams of paper

1582
01:14:19,336 --> 01:14:22,797
shooting this sequence,
and just worked his ass off.

1583
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:36,019
And this is a staple of sort of classic,
old school spirit of <i>Trek.</i>

1584
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:41,233
You know, here's the massive alien
and there's Kirk.

1585
01:14:41,358 --> 01:14:43,444
- And Campbell mythology. The cave.
- That's a kid, by the way.

1586
01:14:43,569 --> 01:14:47,655
That guy running in is a 5-year-old kid
dressed in a suit,

1587
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,367
to make the hole look bigger
of the cave.

1588
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:53,412
How much of the monster
was the <i>Cloverfield</i> monster?

1589
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:55,538
Designed by the same guy,
Neville Page,

1590
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:58,167
but a very, very different creature.

1591
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:01,795
- Just a totally different personality.
- Looks completely different.

1592
01:15:02,171 --> 01:15:03,881
- Different tastes.
- And here's another homage

1593
01:15:04,006 --> 01:15:05,548
to the original <i>Star Wars.</i>

1594
01:15:05,673 --> 01:15:09,219
Obviously, Obi-Wan sort of first
appears to Luke

1595
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:12,180
by making the call of the Krayt dragon.

1596
01:15:12,305 --> 01:15:15,809
He used to speak in this shot,
saying that was the Hengra,

1597
01:15:15,934 --> 01:15:19,104
who's notoriously afraid of heat.
Which we cut, thank God.

1598
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:21,856
- Much better here.
- Hengra being?

1599
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:24,650
- When we were in Austin...
- A reference to my kids.

1600
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:27,237
...the roof pretty much blew off
the Alamo Drafthouse

1601
01:15:27,362 --> 01:15:30,407
when Leonard turned around.

1602
01:15:30,532 --> 01:15:33,786
'Cause he was there watching it
with those guys,

1603
01:15:33,911 --> 01:15:36,579
and it was just one of those moments,
you know, in life

1604
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:38,332
- where I was basically, "Wow."
- I wish I had been there.

1605
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:40,125
- I can't believe you weren't there.
- I cannot stand it.

1606
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,335
It's so wrong.

1607
01:15:42,002 --> 01:15:43,962
And unlike other time travel stories,
this is the first time

1608
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:46,756
where the knowledge of time travel
is even relevant to this story.

1609
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:49,426
Everything to this point could have
played completely linearly,

1610
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:52,805
and as such, it doesn't rely
on the time travel gimmick at all.

1611
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:55,224
And the perfect use of a curse
in a movie, right there.

1612
01:15:55,349 --> 01:15:57,893
I remember
when I first saw <i>Temple of Doom,</i>

1613
01:15:58,101 --> 01:16:00,186
and Indiana Jones is in the middle
of the bridge,

1614
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:02,146
and he looks,
and basically Mola Ram's guys

1615
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:06,400
are coming at him from both sides,
and he just says, "shooot."

1616
01:16:06,568 --> 01:16:10,948
And I just felt like,
"Wow, you know, I can't believe..."

1617
01:16:11,073 --> 01:16:13,367
There were no curses in <i>Raiders.</i>

1618
01:16:13,492 --> 01:16:14,534
- That's funny.
- The fact that they just

1619
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:17,621
basically deployed
their one bad word there.

1620
01:16:17,746 --> 01:16:24,418
And I felt like, again, an equally
judicious use of the doody word.

1621
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:29,591
So this sequence coming up,
the mind-meld was sort of a...

1622
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:31,092
We didn't spend any time on this
sequence at all.

1623
01:16:31,217 --> 01:16:33,345
It was like the first time we did it,
that's what ended up onscreen.

1624
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:34,470
It took us, like, five minutes.

1625
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:38,684
Not only did it take
obviously a million passes,

1626
01:16:38,809 --> 01:16:42,563
I think everyone trying something
at least a few times,

1627
01:16:42,688 --> 01:16:48,109
but we also recorded Leonard doing it
I think half a dozen times

1628
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:49,485
in different ways.

1629
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:52,280
But, finally, literally in the last night,
I believe in the last, like,

1630
01:16:52,405 --> 01:16:56,952
half hour of overtime that we had
on the mix of this movie,

1631
01:16:58,078 --> 01:17:00,956
I decided to mix it up
and just make it weird and mysterious.

1632
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:05,293
I felt that if we said to the audience
that you are not intended or expected

1633
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,587
to hear and understand everything,

1634
01:17:07,712 --> 01:17:12,384
that somehow it removed the burden
of not following it.

1635
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:13,760
- Right.
- It also makes you weirdly

1636
01:17:13,886 --> 01:17:17,014
pay attention more, as opposed to
it's just a bunch of words that drone on.

1637
01:17:17,139 --> 01:17:18,765
Yeah, just having it be
more of a drug trip,

1638
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,810
and just this bizarre kind of, you know...

1639
01:17:21,935 --> 01:17:23,645
More of a mind-meld
and less of a lecture.

1640
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:28,442
There's the squid ship, which I feel,
you know, some key design elements

1641
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,110
came from Bryan Hitch,
who is a great comic book illustrator.

1642
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,780
The hardest part about this sequence,
though, is just that

1643
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:36,199
you either get the audience to go,
"That is really cool.

1644
01:17:36,324 --> 01:17:39,036
"Now I understand everything,"
or they say, "You've just lost me

1645
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:40,662
- "because it's too complicated."
- I gotta say,

1646
01:17:40,787 --> 01:17:44,582
what blows my mind is
in the early screenings that we had,

1647
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:47,836
we had so many notes
and questions and confusions

1648
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:49,712
- about this whole sequence.
- About that sequence, yeah.

1649
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:54,134
And by losing the prison sequence,
and by making this more obtuse,

1650
01:17:54,259 --> 01:17:59,931
intentionally obtuse, and sort of esoteric,
people accepted it more as a...

1651
01:18:00,056 --> 01:18:02,518
And by the way,
it allowed the music that I think was,

1652
01:18:02,643 --> 01:18:05,604
we were...
Again, Giacchino, brilliantly done.

1653
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:07,980
It allowed the sequence
to be more impactful.

1654
01:18:08,106 --> 01:18:11,652
So even moments like this, when
the ships get pulled into the black hole,

1655
01:18:11,777 --> 01:18:13,904
you feel them more,
and you experience it more,

1656
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:17,115
and it's less about intellect,
and more about a visceral moment.

1657
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,161
And we learn that story over and over
again on everything we work on,

1658
01:18:21,286 --> 01:18:24,622
whether it's <i>Lost</i> or <i>Fringe,</i>
or you guys on <i>Alias,</i> that,

1659
01:18:25,457 --> 01:18:30,128
what is the balance of exposition that
the audience needs to follow the story?

1660
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:33,881
And that if you cross over that line,
you confuse them

1661
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:36,510
- as opposed to elucidate them.
- Yeah, and you lose them.

1662
01:18:36,635 --> 01:18:37,845
Yeah, it's true.

1663
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,762
This was the one shot
from the prison sequence

1664
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,390
that we kept in the movie.

1665
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:44,184
- Which is a much bigger moment than...
- And you can see that his ear

1666
01:18:44,309 --> 01:18:46,353
got bitten off somewhere.

1667
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:53,734
And this is a very cool sequence,
to basically say, like,

1668
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:57,029
"Nero was waiting around for 25 years,
but it was just a second for me."

1669
01:18:57,155 --> 01:18:58,907
- Yep.
- I always liked, too, the idea that

1670
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:02,911
the black hole was both a staple of
time travel devices in science fiction,

1671
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:06,206
but can also be used as a weapon.
So, this one item,

1672
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:08,750
- even though it's double duty.
- Yeah.

1673
01:19:09,835 --> 01:19:12,796
The ending of the mind-meld in every
iteration was always the same,

1674
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:16,257
because we basically said, you know,
as an expositional tool

1675
01:19:16,382 --> 01:19:19,802
to explain to the audience
what happened, it's really important.

1676
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:22,139
But what's even more important
is that we come out of this,

1677
01:19:22,264 --> 01:19:24,891
and Kirk's takeaway
from this entire event is,

1678
01:19:25,016 --> 01:19:27,853
"Wow, Vulcans actually have
the capacity for emotion.

1679
01:19:27,978 --> 01:19:30,354
"You guys do feel."
So it always had to sort of end

1680
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,774
with this moment of grandiose emotion.

1681
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:36,653
And I really feel like Leonard played
it beautifully here.

1682
01:19:42,868 --> 01:19:45,287
I am so grateful to him.
I mean, obviously,

1683
01:19:45,412 --> 01:19:46,497
we couldn't have
made this movie without him.

1684
01:19:46,622 --> 01:19:52,418
But to have, you know, Leonard come
back and be Spock again.

1685
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:54,837
I mean, something I don't think
he necessarily thought he would do.

1686
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:56,506
It was just it was such an honour
to work with him.

1687
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:58,382
- No, for us it was...
- And to do it to continue it on,

1688
01:19:58,509 --> 01:20:01,511
it's so generous. That's what's amazing.
His presence here is so generous

1689
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:02,845
- and heroic and loving.
- Totally.

1690
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,681
And he was so great to Zachary.
I mean, I remember, you know,

1691
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:08,310
when we were on set shooting
that scene between the two Spocks

1692
01:20:08,435 --> 01:20:10,479
at the end, and, you know,

1693
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:13,064
he could not have been
more supportive of Zachary.

1694
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:14,440
And he didn't have to be, you know?

1695
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:16,109
Here's this young kid coming in,

1696
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:19,113
assuming this role that he created
40-some years ago,

1697
01:20:19,238 --> 01:20:22,240
and he was nothing but...
And when he says, "Good luck,"

1698
01:20:22,365 --> 01:20:24,493
I literally feel like he's saying to Zachary,
"Good luck."

1699
01:20:24,618 --> 01:20:26,912
- Like, "I got to live this life doing..."
- I think he's saying...

1700
01:20:27,037 --> 01:20:29,456
- It's amazing.
- "Thrusters on full," at the end,

1701
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:29,832
which was the moment
that he kind of came up with on set...

1702
01:20:29,832 --> 01:20:31,750
which was the moment
that he kind of came up with on set...

1703
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:32,876
That was his line.

1704
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:35,753
That is such a sort of blessing
to the future of <i>Star Trek.</i>

1705
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:38,590
And when you go from that moment,
and you...

1706
01:20:38,756 --> 01:20:39,550
Maryann Brandon just hard cut
to Sulu saying, you know,

1707
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,969
Maryann Brandon just hard cut
to Sulu saying, you know,

1708
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:44,262
"Thrusters at max," it's just crazy.

1709
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:48,684
The line that I wish we'd kept
in the earlier scene, just to make clear,

1710
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:51,520
was that at one point we had written
a thing where, you know,

1711
01:20:51,645 --> 01:20:55,815
Kirk sort of asks the question,
"I don't understand.

1712
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:58,902
"You're saying that our lives were
diverged from the original timeline,

1713
01:20:59,027 --> 01:21:02,197
"but there's all these coincidences,
and how's that possible?"

1714
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:04,449
And Nimoy says, you know,
"There's no real way to answer it,

1715
01:21:04,574 --> 01:21:06,784
"but perhaps it's the timestream's way
of mending itself."

1716
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:10,122
Which was essentially a way
of embracing the coincidences and...

1717
01:21:10,247 --> 01:21:11,998
Well, if you study your quantum
mechanics, though,

1718
01:21:12,123 --> 01:21:14,710
- there's a good explanation for it.
- And he also...

1719
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:18,671
He runs down, he asks, like,
"So, who's the helmsman?" "Sulu."

1720
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:22,341
You know,
"Who's the chief security officer?"

1721
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:26,430
And he's running them all down
so that even getting to Scotty,

1722
01:21:26,555 --> 01:21:29,015
you know, felt like
a little less coincidental.

1723
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,893
Well, it's funny, 'cause literally,
it was the thing that,

1724
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:32,310
I remember
when it was first pitched, like,

1725
01:21:32,435 --> 01:21:36,981
"How are you guys ever gonna make
running into Spock in the cave work?"

1726
01:21:37,106 --> 01:21:38,192
Right, you were really stuck on that.

1727
01:21:38,317 --> 01:21:39,568
- You just didn't... Yeah.
- I was,

1728
01:21:39,693 --> 01:21:43,029
but what you guys did so brilliantly is,
like, by saying it's fate,

1729
01:21:43,154 --> 01:21:46,283
that it's destiny,
these characters must be together,

1730
01:21:46,408 --> 01:21:49,661
that to me, I was like, "Oh, my God."
It literally just for some reason,

1731
01:21:49,787 --> 01:21:51,872
just made...
'Cause you know what the answer is?

1732
01:21:51,997 --> 01:21:53,039
- 'Cause you want it.
- Right.

1733
01:21:53,164 --> 01:21:55,833
- That's a <i>Lost</i> trick, which is...
- It is such a <i>Lost</i> trick.

1734
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:59,962
...do not mistake coincidence for fate.
- That's exactly right.

1735
01:22:00,296 --> 01:22:03,050
This moment originally didn't have
music over it.

1736
01:22:03,175 --> 01:22:07,261
This was another one of those pieces
that we added at the very last minute.

1737
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:09,305
By the way, for some reason,
my son is obsessed with Keenser,

1738
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,266
and he's never seen him,
just based on describing Keenser.

1739
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:15,145
I'm obsessed with Spock's coat here.

1740
01:22:15,604 --> 01:22:17,189
- I just feel like, why does...
- I'm buying you one.

1741
01:22:17,314 --> 01:22:19,274
Why does this coat not exist
in the real world?

1742
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:21,109
By the way,
half their jackets are amazing.

1743
01:22:21,234 --> 01:22:24,570
- Yeah, the other half, though...
- Let's go raid the wardrobe after.

1744
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:27,448
So we're shooting this...
We're back at Budweiser.

1745
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:31,619
Yeah, I saw this corridor
when we were doing the location scout.

1746
01:22:31,744 --> 01:22:33,162
I'm like, "This is cool."

1747
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,582
In the original cut,
the first time I saw this scene,

1748
01:22:35,707 --> 01:22:39,293
it took Keenser about 20 minutes
to run down the hallway.

1749
01:22:39,627 --> 01:22:41,921
I mean, literally, it just went on and on.

1750
01:22:42,046 --> 01:22:43,966
But the anticipation of it is so great,

1751
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:47,261
'cause you've just seen
the giant squid monster try and kill Kirk.

1752
01:22:47,386 --> 01:22:48,386
I love his eyes here.

1753
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:49,971
- This is Deep Roy, of course.
- Deep Roy, of course,

1754
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:53,975
playing the guy. He's awesome.
Deep is fantastic.

1755
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:00,606
And actually deep.

1756
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,527
You could really talk to that guy
about philosophy.

1757
01:23:03,652 --> 01:23:05,820
Look for a tribble in this scene.

1758
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:09,615
- There it is.
- Trib.

1759
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:20,293
So I think that our list of potential
Scottys was about one-name long,

1760
01:23:20,877 --> 01:23:22,546
Simon Pegg.

1761
01:23:22,671 --> 01:23:25,716
When I e-mailed him, I just said,
"Do you want to play Scotty?"

1762
01:23:25,841 --> 01:23:29,677
And I got an e-mail back that said,
"I don't think I could do that."

1763
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:32,346
So I sent an e-mail back saying,
"Well, that's too bad.

1764
01:23:32,472 --> 01:23:34,140
"Maybe next time." You know,
"We'll find something else."

1765
01:23:34,265 --> 01:23:35,725
'Cause we worked on
<i>Mission: Impossible III.</i>

1766
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:40,104
I instantly, almost before I sent it,
got an e-mail back from him that said,

1767
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:44,234
"Wait, wait, not so fast."
And he just, you know...

1768
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:48,572
Keenser, those eyes were put in later
by Digital Domain.

1769
01:23:49,448 --> 01:23:52,242
They did a couple sequence in the
movie and shots. They did a great job.

1770
01:23:52,367 --> 01:23:57,456
Scotty's obsession with food here,
and obviously, you know,

1771
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:01,877
the grapefruit beagle story is something
that came out of the sides

1772
01:24:02,002 --> 01:24:03,127
- that we...
- Yeah.

1773
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:07,048
That we wrote in the event
that Simon was gonna pass.

1774
01:24:10,094 --> 01:24:12,679
It's funny. When we were shooting
on this location, once again,

1775
01:24:12,805 --> 01:24:16,891
at the Budweiser plant,
we were in this real machine room area,

1776
01:24:17,016 --> 01:24:21,521
so every, you know, 109 seconds,

1777
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:24,817
there would be this crazy
steam release.

1778
01:24:24,942 --> 01:24:29,529
And it'd be this crazy whistle that would
be just... It would go on for 30 seconds.

1779
01:24:29,654 --> 01:24:32,240
And we'd just have to stand there,
and it was late,

1780
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:33,908
and I just remember
shooting this sequence was, like,

1781
01:24:34,033 --> 01:24:36,662
we could never quite figure out
the timing of it,

1782
01:24:36,787 --> 01:24:38,162
and it was always interrupting shots.

1783
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:40,498
By the way,
when we leave <i>Trek,</i> you know,

1784
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:43,668
or we're fired off of it
and replaced by somebody else,

1785
01:24:43,793 --> 01:24:46,755
I feel like the way that
we should mark the end of

1786
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,757
our sort of tenure here is

1787
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:52,386
that Admiral Archer's beagle
should just show up.

1788
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:54,595
- I agree.
- 'Cause it always bugs me.

1789
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,014
- Where is that dog?
- I agree. I agree.

1790
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,600
- It shows up in the novelization.
- By the way, that's right, it does.

1791
01:24:58,725 --> 01:25:04,355
That sandwich line was another
last-minute addition to the movie,

1792
01:25:05,815 --> 01:25:07,650
that line of Simon's.

1793
01:25:08,152 --> 01:25:10,028
I love that the shuttle is, like,
between those poles.

1794
01:25:10,154 --> 01:25:12,405
Literally, it's like it's just shoved in there.

1795
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:15,324
- Yep.
- This is one of my favourite

1796
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:17,493
shots for some reason.
I don't know why.

1797
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:18,703
- Just 'cause it was...
- Yeah, totally.

1798
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:22,582
One of the things that I love about this
is that the first time I saw this

1799
01:25:22,707 --> 01:25:25,502
in the dailies, it reminded me of <i>Alien.</i>

1800
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:26,670
- It looked like <i>Alien.</i>
- It does.

1801
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:29,046
It had the tactile feeling
of that dirty ship.

1802
01:25:29,172 --> 01:25:31,425
- And it was lit similarly.
- Yeah.

1803
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:35,554
And all those movies that we grew up on
always made it feel so real.

1804
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,599
Nothing felt digital about being in space.

1805
01:25:38,724 --> 01:25:42,144
What was it like
when Simon met Leonard?

1806
01:25:42,269 --> 01:25:43,936
Simon being, you know, one of us?

1807
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:47,774
Well, he met at the read-throughs.

1808
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,318
We just did some read-throughs.

1809
01:25:49,443 --> 01:25:53,529
And I remember they met there,
and Simon was appropriately starstruck.

1810
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:57,201
By the way, one of the great moments
in music in this movie

1811
01:25:57,326 --> 01:26:00,244
is the "Live long and prosper" moment.

1812
01:26:00,453 --> 01:26:02,831
Giacchino's score in that moment
when Kirk disappears.

1813
01:26:02,956 --> 01:26:04,416
So crazy good.

1814
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:07,836
- I love that Spock is lying to Kirk here.
- Yeah, that's right.

1815
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:10,087
- He's using the old Doc...
- Well, it's not exactly a lie.

1816
01:26:10,213 --> 01:26:11,840
- He's using the Doc Brown thing.
- He's implying.

1817
01:26:11,965 --> 01:26:13,050
- He's implying.
- Yeah, exactly.

1818
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:16,470
But it's like, you know, this is
another road of time-travel storytelling.

1819
01:26:16,595 --> 01:26:18,846
Don't tell me that I'm warning you.

1820
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:21,182
Look at Nimoy's face.

1821
01:26:21,307 --> 01:26:22,850
- It's just the greatest.
- Yeah.

1822
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:24,520
His face is spectacular.

1823
01:26:24,645 --> 01:26:26,563
This cue literally makes me want to cry.
I'm gonna cry.

1824
01:26:26,688 --> 01:26:29,399
That's an erhu.
It's a Chinese two-stringed instrument

1825
01:26:29,524 --> 01:26:31,609
being played
by this amazing woman who...

1826
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:36,489
Look at Pine's nose here. Look at it.
Just, it's amazing.

1827
01:26:36,614 --> 01:26:38,449
I don't understand. What just happened?

1828
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:42,162
Did you steal my wallet? What was that?

1829
01:26:43,122 --> 01:26:44,957
- And this is our...
- I didn't know you were an organ donor.

1830
01:26:45,082 --> 01:26:48,001
The headline is gonna be, you know,

1831
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:51,462
- "Lindelof has crush on Pine's olfactory."
- Pine's nose.

1832
01:26:51,587 --> 01:26:54,048
Now I can't take my eyes off it, though.

1833
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:55,926
- Look at it. Look at it.
- I just stole your wallet.

1834
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:59,430
Just look at the left nostril.
Especially here.

1835
01:27:00,012 --> 01:27:02,724
See, he just missed
the low clearance bar in the shuttle.

1836
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,350
Okay, get ready
for the greatest moment ever.

1837
01:27:04,475 --> 01:27:06,979
Here it comes. Music. Ready?

1838
01:27:07,104 --> 01:27:08,188
Here we go.

1839
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,692
And cue.

1840
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:14,944
- Come on, stirring. Stirring.
- What's better than that? Nothing.

1841
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:16,988
- Nothing is better than that.
- And look at that look.

1842
01:27:17,113 --> 01:27:19,323
- Chris Pine.
- God, look at the nose.

1843
01:27:24,662 --> 01:27:25,956
- Come on.
- By the way, the hack in me

1844
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:29,542
always wants to put that light that's
behind him in between the fingers,

1845
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,043
and I'm so glad you didn't.

1846
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,046
That's why you're good at directing,
and I'm not.

1847
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:35,340
- By the way, that sound, that actually...
- So good!

1848
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,341
- By the way, that sound, that actually...
- So good!

1849
01:27:36,466 --> 01:27:37,926
That was the sound he actually made
when we shot it.

1850
01:27:38,051 --> 01:27:39,261
- Really?
- Yeah.

1851
01:27:39,386 --> 01:27:43,681
This was another Digital Domain
sequence with Scotty in the pipes.

1852
01:27:43,806 --> 01:27:46,310
So here's a sequence, basically,
you know, Mark Evans,

1853
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:48,686
who is basically one of
the huge champions of the movie,

1854
01:27:48,811 --> 01:27:50,605
along with Brad Weston
and others at Paramount,

1855
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:53,984
basically, we got into
these conversations about,

1856
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:56,069
how do we get the budget down?

1857
01:27:56,194 --> 01:27:59,280
How do we afford to make <i>Trek?</i>
And this scene sort of kept coming up.

1858
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:01,240
Do we need Scotty in the pipes?

1859
01:28:01,365 --> 01:28:03,827
And I'm just glad that everybody
came together to...

1860
01:28:03,952 --> 01:28:08,707
Everyone kept saying, "Yes, we need it."
'Cause it's such a great reversal.

1861
01:28:08,832 --> 01:28:11,542
You're basically saying,
if you're gonna beam these guys,

1862
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,045
if you're gonna transwarp beam,

1863
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,587
which has never been done
on <i>Trek</i> before,

1864
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:17,006
- there needs to be some side...
- Danger.

1865
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:20,344
Some side effect.
It can't go off without a hitch.

1866
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:21,970
Well, it's one of those things
for me where it's like,

1867
01:28:22,095 --> 01:28:24,305
I don't think, honestly,
the average moviegoer understands

1868
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:28,185
the difference between warping
and warping when a ship is in...

1869
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,811
- The fans do.
- Of course.

1870
01:28:29,936 --> 01:28:32,230
But I think that
for the average moviegoer,

1871
01:28:32,355 --> 01:28:36,984
it's just a fun piece of business
to have in the movie.

1872
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,278
And, yes, you're right.

1873
01:28:38,403 --> 01:28:39,988
It serves a story purpose, as well,
which I love.

1874
01:28:40,113 --> 01:28:41,864
By the way,
why is that emergency hatch there

1875
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:43,492
right before the spinning blades?

1876
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:44,993
Just in case somebody
gets caught inside.

1877
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:47,246
- For this very reason.
- Yeah, exactly.

1878
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:48,788
Thank God it's there.

1879
01:28:53,252 --> 01:28:55,712
There was a cut right there
when you went behind that pipe.

1880
01:28:55,837 --> 01:28:57,256
It was a stuntman
that actually did the drop,

1881
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:00,134
and then we threw Simon in.

1882
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:04,762
I like Sarek just hanging out
on the Bridge.

1883
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:07,474
He's like,
"And this button, what does that do?"

1884
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,524
This is one of my favourite shots.

1885
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:17,317
- Yeah, this was a...
- Yeah, this is an amazing shot.

1886
01:29:17,443 --> 01:29:20,069
- So where did you...
- This is all at Budweiser.

1887
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,320
- Yeah.
- And it's all real,

1888
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:25,993
except for the markings
on the side of those big barrels.

1889
01:29:26,618 --> 01:29:27,953
But that was all done on a Skycam,

1890
01:29:28,078 --> 01:29:30,288
- on a computer-controlled camera.
- Right.

1891
01:29:30,413 --> 01:29:31,789
So there's no one up there
with the camera.

1892
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:32,582
- It's just on an arm.
- No, that was all just...

1893
01:29:32,582 --> 01:29:33,500
- It's just on an arm.
- No, that was all just...

1894
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:35,418
Actually it was on three wires.

1895
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:37,378
- The longest callback ever.
- "Cupcake."

1896
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:38,588
- "Cupcake."
- Yeah.

1897
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:40,506
That's from another movie.
That's how long that is.

1898
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:42,717
And I love, love, love Simon here.

1899
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:47,639
Because, again, the idea
of who is the audience in this scene?

1900
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:49,265
And there's Scotty.

1901
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:52,853
You taking your clothes off?
What are you doing?

1902
01:29:52,978 --> 01:29:54,854
Bryan, what's going on in New York?

1903
01:29:56,774 --> 01:29:58,567
- Who's there with you?
- Are you eating another pineapple?

1904
01:29:58,692 --> 01:30:00,277
I was actually putting my...

1905
01:30:00,402 --> 01:30:02,488
- Just had to take off your cloak.
- Putting it back on.

1906
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:05,490
- Who's there with you? Is it Chris Pine?
- Sorry.

1907
01:30:05,615 --> 01:30:09,077
- Can I get a towel, please?
- Just putting my clothes back on.

1908
01:30:09,953 --> 01:30:10,953
Oh, that's good.

1909
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:23,759
This was all, you know, shot long before
we shot any of the stuff at Budweiser.

1910
01:30:24,717 --> 01:30:30,224
It's just very funny.
When we actually shot the Bridge,

1911
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:33,435
there were a bunch of things
we didn't know exactly.

1912
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,481
For example, we weren't sure
how the water pipe sequence would go.

1913
01:30:38,606 --> 01:30:41,944
When Kirk and Spock
walk back on to the Bridge

1914
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:45,029
after beaming back from the <i>Narada,</i>
and they talk to Nero,

1915
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:47,282
originally Nero and Kirk never met.

1916
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:51,703
And when we shot that sequence,
they would not have met,

1917
01:30:51,828 --> 01:30:55,373
and so when Kirk introduces himself,
he was being literal.

1918
01:30:55,498 --> 01:30:57,126
But as it plays in the movie now,
they've already met,

1919
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:59,418
and it sounds like it's a point of pride.

1920
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:03,590
So it's interesting shooting things so
out of sequence sometimes, you know.

1921
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:06,009
I love the ferocity of...

1922
01:31:06,135 --> 01:31:07,344
Yeah,
I love the fight choreography here.

1923
01:31:07,469 --> 01:31:10,096
And the sound effect of the glass
breaking right there when he landed.

1924
01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:12,224
It was fantastic. And what's cool is,

1925
01:31:12,349 --> 01:31:15,435
who would win in a fight
between Kirk and Spock?

1926
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,311
The answer is Spock.
Vulcans are strong.

1927
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:19,398
People don't know that. Right, Bob?

1928
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:21,024
And they know the pinch.

1929
01:31:22,818 --> 01:31:28,782
We actually, visually,
we put these red marks on Chris' neck.

1930
01:31:28,907 --> 01:31:31,659
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.
- 'Cause we did not do it in makeup,

1931
01:31:31,784 --> 01:31:33,369
and it felt like there would be marks left,

1932
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:36,289
so we actually put those little marks
right there on his neck.

1933
01:31:36,414 --> 01:31:38,458
Cost? $700,000.

1934
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:40,418
- $4 million.
- Yeah.

1935
01:31:42,171 --> 01:31:46,007
I love how long you sustain that
beyond Sarek saying, "Spock."

1936
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:47,341
- That it's like...
- Yeah.

1937
01:31:47,467 --> 01:31:49,427
- And in any other movie...
- And what Zachary did right there,

1938
01:31:49,552 --> 01:31:52,805
with his eyes,
like coming out of a stupor. Yeah.

1939
01:31:53,097 --> 01:31:54,182
We actually extended
some of these shots.

1940
01:31:54,307 --> 01:31:56,310
Like, this one was a new shot
we put back,

1941
01:31:56,435 --> 01:31:58,270
and we added head to this shot, too.

1942
01:31:58,395 --> 01:32:01,314
We extended this one, too,
in those last days.

1943
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:09,655
I love that in the <i>Trek</i> universe,
and this is another decision that

1944
01:32:09,782 --> 01:32:12,868
and I think was so true
to the original spirit of,

1945
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:16,704
you know, the Roddenberry <i>Trek</i>
is the idea that

1946
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:20,375
the best way to commit mutiny
is to hurt somebody's feelings.

1947
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:25,713
That's right. Or, in this case,
make them reveal that they have them.

1948
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:30,676
- How great was Zach in that scene?
- Zachary is wonderful.

1949
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:37,643
- There's the empty chair.
- And now, here comes a great line.

1950
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:45,149
Just a home run.

1951
01:32:52,908 --> 01:32:55,118
And what's great is
McCoy is sort of with Spock there.

1952
01:32:55,243 --> 01:32:56,953
Yeah, everyone is.

1953
01:32:59,957 --> 01:33:02,333
This shot was sort of tricky,
'cause we had this crazy arm

1954
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:05,420
on the camera going over the console,

1955
01:33:05,962 --> 01:33:07,881
and for some reason,
it took a long time to get it.

1956
01:33:08,006 --> 01:33:10,300
Can I ask you a weird question?
What made you decide to use...

1957
01:33:10,426 --> 01:33:12,886
- Jewish.
- Use the crazy arm?

1958
01:33:14,304 --> 01:33:15,389
- For that shot?
- Yeah, yeah.

1959
01:33:15,514 --> 01:33:16,765
'Cause I wanted to go over the console,

1960
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:18,182
and there was no other way to do it.

1961
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:20,685
Yeah, here's the other slow-mo.

1962
01:33:22,979 --> 01:33:25,314
I like that it's,
"Advanced me to acting captain,"

1963
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,525
- as opposed to promoted me, because...
- That's right.

1964
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:29,694
I also love how those guys
coming down the ladder there.

1965
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:32,488
It gives the sense that
there's something above and below.

1966
01:33:36,284 --> 01:33:38,494
So this is basically Kirk's first moment.

1967
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:41,707
I cannot believe, by the way,
I didn't have him look over and...

1968
01:33:41,832 --> 01:33:43,207
I guess it was beside the point,

1969
01:33:43,332 --> 01:33:46,420
but I wanted to have him excuse
the security guy. Didn't matter.

1970
01:33:46,545 --> 01:33:49,046
Here's another day that I'll always
remember when I was on set.

1971
01:33:49,172 --> 01:33:53,761
And you were directing the scene, J.J.
And it's an incredibly challenging scene,

1972
01:33:53,886 --> 01:33:55,052
both to play for the actors,

1973
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:57,597
but also to direct,
because they're Vulcans.

1974
01:33:57,722 --> 01:34:00,309
And they're talking about
this incredibly emotional thing,

1975
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:02,685
and they're talking about
how to express emotion.

1976
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:07,315
And I remember you got
a lot of different takes from Ben here,

1977
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:11,069
as to, you know,
how is he gonna answer this question?

1978
01:34:11,194 --> 01:34:14,989
How's he gonna play this line
about loving Amanda?

1979
01:34:15,114 --> 01:34:17,533
Well, that was always the scene that,
in the script, when I read it,

1980
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:21,622
I got an emotional reading,
when Sarek would say, "I loved her."

1981
01:34:21,747 --> 01:34:25,542
Like, for some reason, that was like
a massive revelation for me.

1982
01:34:25,667 --> 01:34:27,002
I don't know. I just loved that idea.

1983
01:34:27,127 --> 01:34:29,837
That actually came out of a conversation
we had with Nimoy where,

1984
01:34:29,962 --> 01:34:33,091
I think the first time we all met him,
and we pitched him roughly the idea,

1985
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:37,762
and asked him, "We always
imagined that Sarek loved Amanda."

1986
01:34:37,887 --> 01:34:39,847
And he said, "Well,
I always assumed it was just logical,

1987
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:42,225
"as a result of him being ambassador."

1988
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:45,854
So the idea of having the loss actually
accelerate both of their emotion

1989
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:48,356
to the point where,
in the original movies it had to,

1990
01:34:48,481 --> 01:34:49,483
he had to go through a whole lifetime

1991
01:34:49,608 --> 01:34:51,777
to admit that he loved her,
and now here we have it in one movie.

1992
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,947
The movie is sort of secretly
about Spock,

1993
01:34:55,072 --> 01:34:57,658
- because the idea that...
- Yep.

1994
01:34:57,949 --> 01:35:00,409
The idea that, you know,
that's a scene where,

1995
01:35:00,536 --> 01:35:04,997
basically, how do you reconcile being
half Vulcan and being half human?

1996
01:35:05,457 --> 01:35:10,962
And the idea that, in that moment,
his father is saying, "Even I feel still.

1997
01:35:11,546 --> 01:35:14,800
"And it's okay." And that's the thing
that allows him to sort of give in

1998
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:16,135
- to that feeling.
- Reconcile.

1999
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,386
And, by the way, I've always felt,

2000
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:19,887
though I've never discussed this
with you guys,

2001
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:23,391
but my feeling is always,
his partnering up with Kirk

2002
01:35:23,516 --> 01:35:25,726
is what allows him
to embrace fully his Vulcan,

2003
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:29,689
because he knows that
having that human,

2004
01:35:29,814 --> 01:35:34,110
emotionally driven person at his side

2005
01:35:34,235 --> 01:35:37,155
allows him to more completely embrace
being Vulcan,

2006
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,699
and not deny that emotion,
that humanity. I don't know.

2007
01:35:39,824 --> 01:35:41,452
And the same with Kirk.
By holding hands in the centre...

2008
01:35:41,577 --> 01:35:42,953
- I love that, when she steps right in.
- Yeah.

2009
01:35:43,078 --> 01:35:44,246
"My man, my man."

2010
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:48,833
Whoever's idea it was to put that scene
in the transporter room

2011
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:51,295
- where Spock lost Amanda...
- Yeah.

2012
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,880
...again, great.

2013
01:35:53,212 --> 01:35:56,007
What were you saying, Bob?
Same with Kirk?

2014
01:35:56,132 --> 01:35:58,426
That's it's the ying and yang.
By clasping arms in the centre,

2015
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:00,429
they can each lean more
towards their true nature,

2016
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:03,097
knowing that the other one
is providing balance.

2017
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:06,935
By the way, one of my favourite shots
in the movie is coming up,

2018
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:11,148
basically seeing those two guys
in profile for the first time.

2019
01:36:11,273 --> 01:36:14,650
'Cause you're using overs here,
but then, just cinematically,

2020
01:36:14,777 --> 01:36:18,738
you're about to show, okay,
Spock and Kirk just became partners.

2021
01:36:18,863 --> 01:36:22,408
And then that moment is, here it is.
I just love this shot.

2022
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:25,621
- This says everything...
- I love Zachary's look at the end.

2023
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:26,872
- Yeah.
- So good.

2024
01:36:26,997 --> 01:36:28,539
And I said, hit him twice as hard as

2025
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:29,625
you would normally slap someone
on the shoulder.

2026
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:30,876
you would normally slap someone
on the shoulder.

2027
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:33,002
That scene, by the way,
for whatever reason,

2028
01:36:33,127 --> 01:36:35,922
they were all together.
The actors were literally goofing off.

2029
01:36:36,047 --> 01:36:37,800
- It was the only time the entire shoot.
- Was this the day

2030
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:38,926
where you walked off set?

2031
01:36:39,092 --> 01:36:40,511
And literally,
they were just kind of all laughing.

2032
01:36:40,636 --> 01:36:43,262
We're at the end, we had no time.
And I just said to them, I'm like,

2033
01:36:43,387 --> 01:36:45,349
"You tell me when you're ready,"
and I walked off.

2034
01:36:45,474 --> 01:36:46,850
- Wow.
- And I walked out and I thought, as I...

2035
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:48,519
Did you ever think you'd be the teacher?

2036
01:36:48,644 --> 01:36:50,270
Well, as I was walking out,
I thought, "Oh, my God,

2037
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:52,480
"I just walked off the...
Like, what have I..."

2038
01:36:52,605 --> 01:36:54,899
And then, you know,
literally eight seconds later

2039
01:36:55,024 --> 01:36:56,025
they're like, "We're ready to go."

2040
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,237
But they're the greatest group.
They really are.

2041
01:36:58,362 --> 01:37:01,448
This was one of my... It says...

2042
01:37:01,573 --> 01:37:03,408
There was an impact load
on the screen for a flash.

2043
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:05,993
This is my favourite thing,

2044
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:08,204
this thing of the <i>Enterprise</i>
when it rises through the clouds.

2045
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:10,582
- Love it.
- Oh, my God. And the music here.

2046
01:37:10,707 --> 01:37:15,837
Well, what I love is that there's
a hidden Starfleet logo in this shot.

2047
01:37:18,381 --> 01:37:20,426
I also love that, you know,
you see these guys

2048
01:37:20,551 --> 01:37:23,970
pushing these little buttons,
and then you cut to these shots.

2049
01:37:24,095 --> 01:37:26,556
And just, the connection
between the humanity

2050
01:37:26,681 --> 01:37:28,850
- and this crazy epic scale.
- Yep.

2051
01:37:28,975 --> 01:37:32,813
So, if you watch in the negative space
between the rings and the planet,

2052
01:37:32,938 --> 01:37:36,358
you see a sideways version of
the Starfleet logo.

2053
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,444
- No, I don't.
- Right there. See?

2054
01:37:39,278 --> 01:37:40,945
Right there. See? Over there.

2055
01:37:42,155 --> 01:37:43,657
It's the old FedEx trick.

2056
01:37:43,782 --> 01:37:45,658
- It is. The FedEx trick.
- Nice.

2057
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:49,162
Now, this is one shot which we cut
from here to there.

2058
01:37:49,287 --> 01:37:52,166
That's one shot.
But we actually lost a little bit of it.

2059
01:37:52,957 --> 01:37:54,792
And now Scotty is where
we always imagined him.

2060
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,336
This is my favourite scene,
by the way, I think.

2061
01:37:56,462 --> 01:37:58,421
Just the idea that in the background
they're, like, basically,

2062
01:37:58,546 --> 01:38:02,091
- "I love you. I love you." Kissy, kissy.
- Well, I think the fact that you blocked it

2063
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:03,594
as something that you catch on to,

2064
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:06,180
as opposed to sort of
cutting to a moment in there

2065
01:38:06,305 --> 01:38:08,306
- is what makes it great.
- I love the music here, by the way.

2066
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:10,934
This music, I love the heroism
of the music here, you know.

2067
01:38:11,059 --> 01:38:12,394
- Yeah. About what's about to happen.
- Yeah.

2068
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:16,899
- It's just like, he's a total hero.
- But here's the genius. Right.

2069
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:18,859
- They're so funny here.
- Here.

2070
01:38:18,984 --> 01:38:20,652
- This. This shot. It's this shot.
- How great is Chris?

2071
01:38:20,778 --> 01:38:22,488
Look at Chris. He's amazing.

2072
01:38:22,613 --> 01:38:25,032
He's basically like, "Wow. I lost."

2073
01:38:25,573 --> 01:38:27,074
Yeah.

2074
01:38:27,367 --> 01:38:29,286
- And the fact that we get...
- How sweet is she? Look at that.

2075
01:38:29,411 --> 01:38:31,412
And we get her first name here.
That's the best.

2076
01:38:31,537 --> 01:38:32,663
Yeah.

2077
01:38:33,664 --> 01:38:36,210
- There it is. Nyota.
- I just love that they're in love.

2078
01:38:36,335 --> 01:38:39,505
And Nyota, actually,
lots of controversy about that.

2079
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:42,548
Never actually made its way into canon.
Is that correct, Bob?

2080
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:44,635
- It was like in novels.
- There were hints of flirtation

2081
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,595
- in the original series.
- No, but her name.

2082
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,887
- The name Nyota...
- I'm sorry.

2083
01:38:48,012 --> 01:38:51,682
...was never actually uttered
in any actual <i>Trek</i> movie.

2084
01:38:51,809 --> 01:38:53,268
I don't know that it was.

2085
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:58,940
Burky, I still think
your idea was good here

2086
01:38:59,065 --> 01:39:00,818
of what they were gonna hear
over their headsets when...

2087
01:39:00,943 --> 01:39:03,569
- Yeah, that Scotty was going to say...
- "How'd I do?"

2088
01:39:05,905 --> 01:39:07,615
Why don't you just perform it live,
Bryan?

2089
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,909
That's Zachary Quinto's brother, Joe.

2090
01:39:10,034 --> 01:39:12,746
I literally thought it was Zach
the first time I saw it.

2091
01:39:14,706 --> 01:39:17,167
- Wow. He looks exactly like him.
- Yeah.

2092
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:20,796
By the way, the sound effects with
no music here is the best thing ever.

2093
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:24,716
Yeah, this is once again
a lot of what Ben did,

2094
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:28,261
Ben Burtt, along with Mark Stoeckinger,
but having

2095
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:33,516
a tangible, you know, literally
the kind of old-fashioned, you know.

2096
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:36,103
- This is a corridor fight in <i>Star Wars.</i>
- Yeah.

2097
01:39:36,228 --> 01:39:39,814
And hearing the pangs and the pings
of the impacts

2098
01:39:39,939 --> 01:39:42,734
- I thought was fun.
- Yeah. Totally.

2099
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,694
And I love the phaser design.
I mean, the idea...

2100
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:46,195
This voice?

2101
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,198
- That's Wil Wheaton.
- Really?

2102
01:39:48,323 --> 01:39:49,658
- Yeah.
- Nice.

2103
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:51,659
Wesley Crusher. I did not know that.

2104
01:39:51,784 --> 01:39:54,621
It's Wil Wheaton, but... Or modulated?

2105
01:39:55,204 --> 01:39:59,126
It's Wil Wheaton modulated,
and onscreen Joe Quinto.

2106
01:40:00,711 --> 01:40:03,296
This set, by the way,
I want to talk about the <i>Narada</i> set.

2107
01:40:03,421 --> 01:40:07,967
Every <i>Narada</i> scene was shot
on one sound stage.

2108
01:40:08,092 --> 01:40:11,180
And Scott Chambliss designed the set
to be modular,

2109
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:14,390
so that all those pieces were movable
and, you know,

2110
01:40:14,515 --> 01:40:18,060
we could sort of deal with it
like it was a giant Lego set.

2111
01:40:18,186 --> 01:40:22,690
And so whether it was the Bridge
or, you know,

2112
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:26,487
a cargo hold or whatever it is,

2113
01:40:26,612 --> 01:40:29,072
there's a little cut right there,

2114
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:32,201
every day, we sort of would move
these big pieces around.

2115
01:40:32,326 --> 01:40:35,496
And it kept the feeling of the ship
being mysterious and, you know,

2116
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:38,122
- amorphous, and...
- Where was the cut? What cut?

2117
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:40,042
When the guy got shot.
It used to be a longer shot.

2118
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:43,170
We just sped it up there
so he went down faster.

2119
01:40:43,295 --> 01:40:46,798
This is one of my favourite effect shots,
where it looks so tangible and real,

2120
01:40:46,923 --> 01:40:47,966
- and nothing is real.
- Yeah.

2121
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:49,885
- You mean the smoke and...
- Yeah.

2122
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:51,302
Everything.

2123
01:40:51,804 --> 01:40:55,306
Once again, we're at Northridge.
I love this.

2124
01:40:55,431 --> 01:40:57,975
Although there would be a shadow.
If you look the way the sun is going,

2125
01:40:58,101 --> 01:40:59,394
there would be a shadow
of that big pole.

2126
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,521
- I was just thinking that.
- Shut up.

2127
01:41:01,646 --> 01:41:02,814
It's one of those little things.

2128
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:03,981
Seeing them run through the bridges.

2129
01:41:04,108 --> 01:41:05,734
We spend too much time
in the editing room.

2130
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:07,653
Seeing them run through the corridors
is amazing.

2131
01:41:07,778 --> 01:41:10,655
Given what the corridors actually were
and the sense of space that you get.

2132
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:13,574
That was the corridor
where we met with Spielberg.

2133
01:41:16,453 --> 01:41:17,537
This was great 'cause this was all real.

2134
01:41:17,662 --> 01:41:18,831
What you see behind them is all real.

2135
01:41:18,956 --> 01:41:22,251
It's real, real, real.
And it becomes not real right there.

2136
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:24,502
And that's all bluescreen
that they're running towards.

2137
01:41:24,627 --> 01:41:26,838
And it's just an amazing thing
to see what...

2138
01:41:26,963 --> 01:41:30,551
Here's another moment that I love,
just in terms of performance

2139
01:41:30,676 --> 01:41:34,971
for especially Chris when he just
basically, "How about that?"

2140
01:41:35,096 --> 01:41:38,225
- What I love is they are all really funny.
- Yeah.

2141
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:39,685
- All the actors are genuinely funny.
- Everybody.

2142
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:43,771
And so it allowed for a movie
that had this kind of

2143
01:41:43,896 --> 01:41:47,109
effects and schedule to also have levity.

2144
01:41:47,234 --> 01:41:49,862
Speaking of which, I do want to say,
I remember J.J.,

2145
01:41:49,987 --> 01:41:53,489
you and I were IM-ing the night
after you shot this scene,

2146
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:56,618
and you were basically trying
to describe to me,

2147
01:41:56,743 --> 01:42:02,916
this was the one moment where
Chris actually channelled Mr Shatner.

2148
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,085
- You know, it was like...
- Yeah, well, this is the first scene

2149
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:08,630
where he calls him "Jim." That was
the first time Spock calls Kirk "Jim."

2150
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:11,800
And here, where he says, right here.

2151
01:42:14,552 --> 01:42:15,845
It felt even more
when we did it on the set,

2152
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,722
but for some reason it doesn't feel
as much in the movie,

2153
01:42:17,847 --> 01:42:19,725
but I wanted it to be like, "Spock."
I wanted it to feel...

2154
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:21,310
- The cadence of it, though.
- I feel it.

2155
01:42:21,435 --> 01:42:22,519
- Definitely.
- You do.

2156
01:42:22,644 --> 01:42:24,854
And you kind of go, like, "Wow."

2157
01:42:24,979 --> 01:42:27,149
Chris really went his own way
for the entire movie.

2158
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:29,734
- Yeah.
- And I don't think anybody has said,

2159
01:42:29,859 --> 01:42:31,862
- "He did not do the character justice."
- "He is ripping off..."

2160
01:42:31,987 --> 01:42:34,948
But that was the one tip of the cap
of basically saying there is that.

2161
01:42:35,073 --> 01:42:37,868
And in the very end when he walks on
with the yellow shirt,

2162
01:42:37,993 --> 01:42:40,287
and he kind of has
this little bit of, "Bones."

2163
01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:41,872
- You know?
- Yeah, that's right.

2164
01:42:43,414 --> 01:42:45,375
- But this is again, you know...
- Great design.

2165
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:47,961
Again, yeah,
I think this was Bryan Hitch,

2166
01:42:48,087 --> 01:42:52,216
the idea that,
the way that the gyroscope spun.

2167
01:42:52,341 --> 01:42:56,511
But just this whole... You know,
when you look at shots like that,

2168
01:42:56,636 --> 01:43:00,349
and you think, you know,
the location, the vehicle,

2169
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:03,226
the whole thing is done virtually,
it's amazing.

2170
01:43:03,351 --> 01:43:07,480
This shot was originally
for when Kirk went and found Pike,

2171
01:43:07,605 --> 01:43:10,900
and we cut it, and Maryann Brandon
found a way to cut this together

2172
01:43:11,025 --> 01:43:14,154
with this piece,
which was a separate piece all together,

2173
01:43:14,279 --> 01:43:16,364
and it ended up being seamless.

2174
01:43:16,489 --> 01:43:17,573
This was my least favourite shot
in the movie,

2175
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:19,118
- but it ended up working out.
- I love this shot.

2176
01:43:19,243 --> 01:43:20,327
Those things in the foreground...

2177
01:43:20,452 --> 01:43:21,869
It's so funny.
Those things in the foreground were

2178
01:43:21,994 --> 01:43:23,372
actually put in by Stefan Sonnenfeld

2179
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,541
when we were doing
the colour correction.

2180
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:27,376
I was like,
"I wish we had foreground things,"

2181
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:32,672
and he just literally, on the day,
created these black fuzzy pieces

2182
01:43:32,797 --> 01:43:35,175
to look like hanging wires.

2183
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,764
I also say that working on this,
I keep mentioning Maryann Brandon,

2184
01:43:40,889 --> 01:43:44,393
but Mary Jo Markey, our other editor,

2185
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:48,479
just did an insanely brilliant job

2186
01:43:51,733 --> 01:43:53,444
with the film.
They would take, they would share,

2187
01:43:53,569 --> 01:43:54,610
each do separate sequences.

2188
01:43:54,735 --> 01:43:57,448
So they would each
take a reel, essentially.

2189
01:43:57,573 --> 01:43:59,699
And working with Mary Jo is a joy.

2190
01:43:59,824 --> 01:44:01,784
- She also edited the <i>Lost</i> pilot.
- She did.

2191
01:44:01,909 --> 01:44:04,872
Which, you know,
she's incredibly talented.

2192
01:44:04,997 --> 01:44:07,416
She is amazing. She worked on <i>Felicity,</i>

2193
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:08,542
way back in the day.

2194
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:10,586
- And <i>Alias.</i>
- And <i>Alias.</i>

2195
01:44:11,377 --> 01:44:13,796
She also blew open the ship here.

2196
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:15,381
- She did.
- Joking.

2197
01:44:19,636 --> 01:44:23,974
This is one of those things where
I knew the story, I read the script,

2198
01:44:24,099 --> 01:44:25,684
and in the editing room,

2199
01:44:25,809 --> 01:44:27,810
when we watched the early cut
of this sequence,

2200
01:44:27,935 --> 01:44:30,898
it's so effects-dependent.
The idea of sort of really understanding

2201
01:44:31,023 --> 01:44:33,567
what is it that Spock is doing
to the drill or...

2202
01:44:33,692 --> 01:44:34,318
Well, this whole sequence, by the way,

2203
01:44:34,318 --> 01:44:35,152
Well, this whole sequence, by the way,

2204
01:44:35,277 --> 01:44:39,782
of Kirk and Nero meeting, which,
again, was not originally in the script,

2205
01:44:39,907 --> 01:44:41,408
it became really important.

2206
01:44:41,533 --> 01:44:43,284
And I think it was a great thing to do,

2207
01:44:43,409 --> 01:44:47,288
to finally have them
sort of physically face off.

2208
01:44:47,413 --> 01:44:50,333
But the whole idea here
where he just jumps down,

2209
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:54,462
the other thing that wasn't planned
in the design was the multi-layers.

2210
01:44:54,587 --> 01:44:56,090
And when we were there...

2211
01:44:56,215 --> 01:44:58,509
It was funny. When I was scouting
the Budweiser plant,

2212
01:44:58,634 --> 01:45:00,344
there was one moment where
I was up on this one layer

2213
01:45:00,469 --> 01:45:02,554
and I looked and I thought,
"Wow, look how scary it is,

2214
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:03,805
"how high up we are."

2215
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:07,309
So we did this thing
where we had Nero jump,

2216
01:45:07,434 --> 01:45:09,770
and this is all done on one level.

2217
01:45:09,895 --> 01:45:12,773
And so this is all one level of the stage.

2218
01:45:12,898 --> 01:45:16,902
And when he jumps down,
we created this.

2219
01:45:18,403 --> 01:45:19,904
That was just on the stage,

2220
01:45:20,029 --> 01:45:23,324
and that was done on scaffolding,
down to the same level.

2221
01:45:23,449 --> 01:45:25,786
So the whole thing feels like it's

2222
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:28,997
all these multi-levels,
but it was just all on one stage.

2223
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:30,832
I think the idea that
this was a mining ship,

2224
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:32,251
and it was a practical mining ship,

2225
01:45:32,376 --> 01:45:33,752
and that's what this guy did before,

2226
01:45:33,877 --> 01:45:36,421
just really gives
such a sense of character.

2227
01:45:36,546 --> 01:45:37,588
- Yeah.
- You know,

2228
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:40,967
and something that we'd never
really seen before in <i>Trek.</i>

2229
01:45:41,092 --> 01:45:43,177
Well, he's not a king or a conqueror
or anything like that.

2230
01:45:43,302 --> 01:45:45,680
He's like a blue-collar, average worker.

2231
01:45:51,395 --> 01:45:53,354
But he shares something
that most <i>Trek</i> villains do,

2232
01:45:53,479 --> 01:45:56,774
which is a desire to kill
either Kirk or Spock.

2233
01:45:57,484 --> 01:46:01,779
Wouldn't it be great if there was a villain
who was just like, "I want to kill Sulu."

2234
01:46:02,155 --> 01:46:03,782
Should we have our meeting
about the sequel now?

2235
01:46:03,907 --> 01:46:05,826
Yeah, we should start
talking about <i>Trek II</i> now.

2236
01:46:05,951 --> 01:46:09,412
Who should it be? Who should it be?

2237
01:46:09,537 --> 01:46:13,292
This was a late addition, too,
seeing the <i>Narada</i> go to warp.

2238
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:14,835
But they did an amazing job
with that shot, too.

2239
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,421
- Which I love.
- Yeah, that smoke trail is amazing.

2240
01:46:17,546 --> 01:46:21,048
So this is one of my favourite ideas
here, that having...

2241
01:46:21,175 --> 01:46:23,635
This is, again,
the stuntman did this jump.

2242
01:46:23,761 --> 01:46:25,095
That's more slow motion. Sorry.

2243
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,805
- That's three times.
- Yeah, it is more slow motion.

2244
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:28,931
I'd like to reverse my earlier position
and say

2245
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:33,060
you have overused slow motion
in this movie, J.J., and...

2246
01:46:34,938 --> 01:46:39,650
I like how Kirk is hanging
throughout his life.

2247
01:46:39,777 --> 01:46:41,110
- That's true.
- As a child.

2248
01:46:41,235 --> 01:46:43,279
Yeah, it is sort of a motif.

2249
01:46:43,404 --> 01:46:45,532
Yeah, he hangs a couple of times
in the movie.

2250
01:46:45,657 --> 01:46:51,497
This is Clifton Collins Jr. doing
a great henchman, bad guy, Ayel.

2251
01:46:53,457 --> 01:46:55,583
The old "I got your gun" gag.

2252
01:46:57,336 --> 01:46:58,127
- I love the interior, too.
- He actually

2253
01:46:58,127 --> 01:46:58,587
- I love the interior, too.
- He actually

2254
01:46:58,753 --> 01:47:00,671
fell like that. No.

2255
01:47:00,797 --> 01:47:03,591
Have we talked about Russell
and the props in this film?

2256
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,720
Go for it.

2257
01:47:09,014 --> 01:47:12,725
I think it was in general
your desire to make everything

2258
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:16,979
a callback to the original series
but to have it all be fresh and new.

2259
01:47:17,105 --> 01:47:20,484
And if you look at the phasers,
for example,

2260
01:47:20,609 --> 01:47:25,072
they're all the familiar, original phaser,
and yet new and different.

2261
01:47:25,197 --> 01:47:27,824
Yeah, no, he did an amazing job.
I mean, all around.

2262
01:47:29,076 --> 01:47:32,621
It's the one thing that I feel
watching the movie,

2263
01:47:32,746 --> 01:47:34,872
I'm so proud of the work
the entire crew did.

2264
01:47:34,997 --> 01:47:39,002
I just think everyone just was, like,
top of the...

2265
01:47:40,087 --> 01:47:43,256
Top of their game,
best in the business, amazing work.

2266
01:47:43,381 --> 01:47:45,676
That's Neville Page,
who designed the <i>Cloverfield</i> monster

2267
01:47:45,801 --> 01:47:49,095
and also the big red Hengra creature.

2268
01:47:50,471 --> 01:47:54,225
The idea that the <i>Enterprise</i>
swoops in and helps Spock out.

2269
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:56,103
But you've never seen
the <i>Enterprise</i> fire like that,

2270
01:47:56,228 --> 01:47:58,604
which is what makes it so incredible.

2271
01:47:58,729 --> 01:48:02,109
I mean, that moment is just...

2272
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:06,572
We, by the way,
we restructured this whole...

2273
01:48:06,697 --> 01:48:08,489
- Oh, my God, how many times?
- No, but literally,

2274
01:48:08,614 --> 01:48:10,576
in the last day of editing.

2275
01:48:10,701 --> 01:48:12,077
We were gonna...
Bryan, remember this?

2276
01:48:12,202 --> 01:48:14,454
We were gonna leave, and I was like,
"There's one more thing."

2277
01:48:14,579 --> 01:48:19,752
We intercut or changed the intercuts
structure of this whole last sequence.

2278
01:48:19,877 --> 01:48:20,877
It was very... 'Cause it used to be...

2279
01:48:21,002 --> 01:48:23,337
There was a whole big sequence, too,
that you just, kind of...

2280
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:25,423
- Well, we rearranged it because it felt...
- Flipped it around.

2281
01:48:25,548 --> 01:48:28,676
Well, it felt like, you know,
Spock's ship was flying

2282
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:30,887
- inside the <i>Narada</i> for way too long.
- Yeah.

2283
01:48:31,012 --> 01:48:34,224
And we changed it up a little bit,
and it just feels much stronger now.

2284
01:48:34,349 --> 01:48:35,725
There's a little indication
that he's being warped.

2285
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,020
Yeah, you start to see him
getting warped, yeah.

2286
01:48:38,936 --> 01:48:42,274
There is that moment where you think,
"Did he just kill himself?"

2287
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:44,777
Like George Kirk.

2288
01:48:44,902 --> 01:48:46,779
But what a testament
to the geography of,

2289
01:48:46,904 --> 01:48:48,238
just conceptually,
of the whole sequence.

2290
01:48:48,363 --> 01:48:49,739
There are so many things
happening there,

2291
01:48:49,864 --> 01:48:50,990
and not for one second
are you confused.

2292
01:48:51,115 --> 01:48:54,243
And there, of course,
you hear the Courage theme.

2293
01:48:54,368 --> 01:48:57,956
That's right. And the music here
wasn't in until the last day.

2294
01:48:58,082 --> 01:48:59,457
And there's Scotty next to Chris Doohan.

2295
01:48:59,582 --> 01:49:02,043
Yeah, that's right, James Doohan's son.

2296
01:49:02,586 --> 01:49:05,213
I love everyone kind of coming together
for this moment.

2297
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:09,467
And then, to go from this to his smile,

2298
01:49:09,592 --> 01:49:13,514
'cause in the old cut,
it used to go to the <i>Narada.</i>

2299
01:49:15,099 --> 01:49:17,100
Anyway, it was a much, I think,

2300
01:49:17,225 --> 01:49:20,229
stronger structure,
the one we ended up with.

2301
01:49:20,354 --> 01:49:21,479
I love this effect.

2302
01:49:21,604 --> 01:49:24,858
This was something
that Roger Guyett really

2303
01:49:25,818 --> 01:49:27,903
went nuts with, and just led the way,

2304
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:31,405
and I think came up with a really cool
shot. And the sound here is cool, too.

2305
01:49:31,532 --> 01:49:33,867
How just, literally,
it goes silent for a few frames.

2306
01:49:33,992 --> 01:49:35,327
Absolutely silent.

2307
01:49:37,203 --> 01:49:40,039
This is one of my favourite shots,
as well.

2308
01:49:40,164 --> 01:49:42,960
I love how the camera is kind of
bouncing around behind it.

2309
01:49:43,085 --> 01:49:45,671
So here's the $64,000 question.

2310
01:49:46,462 --> 01:49:50,591
And to adjust for inflation,
it's a $6.1 trillion.

2311
01:49:50,716 --> 01:49:52,051
Yeah.

2312
01:49:52,845 --> 01:49:55,346
- Is this gonna kill Nero and his crew?
- Yes.

2313
01:49:55,471 --> 01:49:57,349
- Yes.
- I think it rips the ship apart.

2314
01:49:57,474 --> 01:49:58,975
That's the way that I've always felt.

2315
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,935
Given the point of origin,
the ship is getting...

2316
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,645
- People keep asking.
- By the way, that shot right there,

2317
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:05,189
if you look at that, what the Steadicam
operator, Colin Anderson,

2318
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:09,110
did right there, he swooped around,
made it look like it was a computer.

2319
01:50:09,235 --> 01:50:11,363
- He was so crazy stable.
- Yeah. Amazing.

2320
01:50:11,488 --> 01:50:14,158
This whole shot was just done
with a Steadicam.

2321
01:50:14,283 --> 01:50:15,783
It's an amazing work.

2322
01:50:15,908 --> 01:50:17,743
No, I think his ship gets destroyed.

2323
01:50:17,869 --> 01:50:21,414
I think it's crystal clear that the ship
is getting broken into tiny little pieces

2324
01:50:21,539 --> 01:50:23,207
and he's dead, but people keep saying,

2325
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:25,668
- "Did Nero survive?"
- In our study of black holes... Sorry, go.

2326
01:50:25,793 --> 01:50:26,920
No, go ahead.

2327
01:50:27,045 --> 01:50:32,760
This was one of J.J.'s big final changes
at the end on the mix.

2328
01:50:32,885 --> 01:50:35,386
There were a lot of sound effects here,

2329
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:38,306
and you made the decision
to take out everything

2330
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:39,682
and just have the music play here.

2331
01:50:39,807 --> 01:50:41,018
When you're doing the mix,

2332
01:50:41,143 --> 01:50:44,229
they do these passes that are
only music, only sound, only of dialogue.

2333
01:50:44,354 --> 01:50:47,315
And all of a sudden they did a pass
where they only have music,

2334
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:51,528
and I was like, "Oh, my God,
it's so much better with just music."

2335
01:50:51,653 --> 01:50:53,529
'Cause you just feel it.
And it doesn't feel like

2336
01:50:53,654 --> 01:50:57,033
you're being bombarded with stuff.
And it was just, you know, an accident.

2337
01:50:57,158 --> 01:51:00,078
Especially because of all the choral stuff
that's starting to happen here.

2338
01:51:00,203 --> 01:51:01,997
By the way, when we were there
listening to the choir,

2339
01:51:02,122 --> 01:51:03,957
I said to Michael,
I'm like, "What are they singing?"

2340
01:51:04,082 --> 01:51:07,502
And they were literally, like,
singing his pets' names growing up.

2341
01:51:07,627 --> 01:51:11,090
It was like, you know, "Cinnamon."
Or whatever. That was ridiculous.

2342
01:51:11,215 --> 01:51:12,341
- Cinnamon?
- I don't know.

2343
01:51:12,466 --> 01:51:13,550
- I can't remember...
- Wow.

2344
01:51:13,675 --> 01:51:17,970
...what his dog's name was.
But this moment and that music

2345
01:51:18,096 --> 01:51:19,680
reminds me of a Spielberg moment
like crazy.

2346
01:51:19,806 --> 01:51:22,475
That music for some reason reminds
me of a John Williams-y sort of thing.

2347
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,185
I don't know what Giacchino was
channelling right there,

2348
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:27,105
- but I just love that.
- Same with Scotty's introduction

2349
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:28,314
and walking down the hallway into the...

2350
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:30,274
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's got that sort of, yeah...

2351
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:32,277
- That <i>E. T.</i> thing.
- The <i>E. T.</i> thing, yeah.

2352
01:51:32,402 --> 01:51:33,612
Bob, so, theory?

2353
01:51:33,737 --> 01:51:35,404
Just the black hole is like a whirlpool.

2354
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:37,490
So, you don't drown
if you have a good ship

2355
01:51:37,615 --> 01:51:39,451
that can navigate you through
the singularity at the centre.

2356
01:51:39,576 --> 01:51:40,868
But if your ship's breaking up,

2357
01:51:40,993 --> 01:51:43,079
you're essentially sinking
into the whirlpool and dying.

2358
01:51:43,204 --> 01:51:45,457
That's why he's not
travelling back in time.

2359
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:47,501
Cool.

2360
01:51:48,793 --> 01:51:50,628
- For anybody who cares.
- I do.

2361
01:51:50,753 --> 01:51:53,590
And this just in,
<i>NCC-1701,</i> Matt Jefferies,

2362
01:51:53,715 --> 01:51:56,135
the original production designer,
made it up.

2363
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:59,470
They're aircraft registration codes
of the 20th century.

2364
01:51:59,595 --> 01:52:01,849
"N" equals registered in U.S.,
"C" equals civil aircraft,

2365
01:52:01,974 --> 01:52:04,268
second C equals space.

2366
01:52:04,393 --> 01:52:07,145
And the 1701 is for seventeenth design,
first ship.

2367
01:52:07,354 --> 01:52:08,479
- Wow.
- Wow.

2368
01:52:08,604 --> 01:52:09,648
Thank you.

2369
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:14,069
If you've been watching the whole
commentary for that, thanks for waiting.

2370
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:20,242
Well, the number of the ship on
the <i>Kelvin</i> is my grandfather's birthday.

2371
01:52:22,578 --> 01:52:23,703
And then, once again, the silence.

2372
01:52:23,828 --> 01:52:25,079
The sound.

2373
01:52:27,457 --> 01:52:30,252
My favourite thing here
was the glass breaking.

2374
01:52:30,377 --> 01:52:32,962
That was Mary Jo Markey's idea.

2375
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:36,591
Which happened earlier, you know,
a few seconds ago.

2376
01:52:36,716 --> 01:52:38,010
But when the glass starts to shatter,

2377
01:52:38,135 --> 01:52:41,054
that to me was an editorial decision,

2378
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:45,559
and one of my favourite ideas
I ever heard in my life.

2379
01:52:45,684 --> 01:52:48,436
She had that, I'm like,
"Oh, my God. That's genius."

2380
01:52:49,188 --> 01:52:52,524
By the way, I love the decision that
this is not a "yay" moment,

2381
01:52:52,649 --> 01:52:55,109
where they all throw their arms up
and say, "Yay."

2382
01:52:55,234 --> 01:52:57,237
That you played it as relief.

2383
01:52:57,362 --> 01:53:00,698
Like, "Oh, my God.
I can't believe we just got out of this."

2384
01:53:00,823 --> 01:53:02,743
But this is the money moment
right there, which is the nod.

2385
01:53:02,868 --> 01:53:04,578
- Huge. Huge.
- Yeah.

2386
01:53:07,622 --> 01:53:10,000
To underplay that moment
is what makes it so powerful.

2387
01:53:10,125 --> 01:53:13,337
Now, J.J., I know that
you don't understand sports,

2388
01:53:13,462 --> 01:53:16,422
but there's a thing that happens
in baseball when you get somebody out

2389
01:53:16,547 --> 01:53:19,551
- where you throw the ball around.
- When you throw the what?

2390
01:53:19,676 --> 01:53:21,302
You know, the third baseman
gets an out, he throws...

2391
01:53:21,427 --> 01:53:22,762
I really wish I knew
what you were talking about.

2392
01:53:22,887 --> 01:53:26,432
Well, you just did it there.
In cinema terms, it's basically

2393
01:53:26,557 --> 01:53:27,643
they're throwing the ball
around the horn.

2394
01:53:27,768 --> 01:53:29,228
- It was a triple play?
- Yeah. Well, no.

2395
01:53:29,353 --> 01:53:31,479
I mean, the out has been made.
But... Forget it.

2396
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:34,774
You mean it's like a...
Was it a touchdown?

2397
01:53:35,692 --> 01:53:37,194
Very much like that.

2398
01:53:38,529 --> 01:53:39,988
This is one of the first scenes.

2399
01:53:40,113 --> 01:53:41,782
You shot this very early
in the schedule, right?

2400
01:53:41,907 --> 01:53:43,367
We did.

2401
01:53:43,492 --> 01:53:46,286
You almost cut this scene.
We would have had to kill you.

2402
01:53:46,703 --> 01:53:48,704
Everything was cut at one point. But...

2403
01:53:48,831 --> 01:53:50,623
There was no movie.
It was four minutes long.

2404
01:53:50,748 --> 01:53:53,335
But Nimoy... It was funny.
We were shooting this scene,

2405
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:56,130
and about halfway through the shoot,
I took him aside and I said,

2406
01:53:56,255 --> 01:53:59,048
"Well, you know, how's Zachary doing?
You know Spock.

2407
01:53:59,173 --> 01:54:04,430
"What should..."
And he just said to me, "He's good."

2408
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:07,765
Like, he was very sweet about it.

2409
01:54:09,143 --> 01:54:13,063
This, by the way, was looped because
the sound was really bad in this place.

2410
01:54:13,188 --> 01:54:15,356
And I think they did an amazing job.

2411
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:16,692
Amazing.
Like, kind of shockingly, actually.

2412
01:54:16,817 --> 01:54:18,694
Yeah, yeah. Really amazing.

2413
01:54:22,197 --> 01:54:24,949
In other words, he watched
<i>Back to the Future</i> too many times.

2414
01:54:25,074 --> 01:54:28,912
And by the way, most of the time
in time-travel movies,

2415
01:54:29,037 --> 01:54:31,707
when you are talking
to an older version of yourself,

2416
01:54:31,832 --> 01:54:34,083
the same actor is playing both roles.

2417
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:37,880
The fact that we didn't do that,
and this is Nimoy,

2418
01:54:38,005 --> 01:54:39,131
who used to play Spock, and Quinto,

2419
01:54:39,256 --> 01:54:43,301
who is going to be playing Spock
for the indefinite foreseeable future,

2420
01:54:43,426 --> 01:54:45,636
you know, I think was...
Are we keeping you awake?

2421
01:54:45,762 --> 01:54:46,930
- Who was that?
- What was that?

2422
01:54:47,055 --> 01:54:49,265
- It was me, breathing.
- That was amazing.

2423
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:50,641
I'm so sorry. Was it too loud?

2424
01:54:50,768 --> 01:54:53,895
I thought the airlock just leaked.
Seriously.

2425
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:57,064
Somebody wake Alex. Jeez.
It's unbelievable.

2426
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:58,942
- Sorry. What were you saying?
- I don't remember.

2427
01:54:59,067 --> 01:55:00,444
It was putting me to sleep.

2428
01:55:01,528 --> 01:55:02,988
These are two different actors
playing the same part.

2429
01:55:03,113 --> 01:55:04,405
Yes, exactly.

2430
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:06,949
There's something about
Michael J. Fox playing, you know,

2431
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:08,993
- Marty McFly at 45...
- Yeah.

2432
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:11,371
...where you go, "I don't buy it."

2433
01:55:11,497 --> 01:55:15,583
If you notice, Zachary's right hand
needed to be glued together,

2434
01:55:15,708 --> 01:55:18,045
his fingers, 'cause he couldn't do that
with his right hand.

2435
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:19,296
Wow.

2436
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:22,800
Another one of my favourite lines
in the movie is the,

2437
01:55:22,925 --> 01:55:27,179
"Since my customary farewell
would be..."

2438
01:55:28,346 --> 01:55:31,641
- He still wishes himself luck, though.
- Yes. That's true.

2439
01:55:31,766 --> 01:55:33,101
This was great set extension,
I must say,

2440
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:35,645
just for those who are keeping score.

2441
01:55:36,563 --> 01:55:37,730
There's Ben Binswagner
on the left again.

2442
01:55:37,855 --> 01:55:39,483
And once again, Tyler Perry.

2443
01:55:39,608 --> 01:55:41,400
We were shooting a scene once
and he didn't like his take.

2444
01:55:41,527 --> 01:55:45,447
He said, "Cut." He's like, "Oh, I'm sorry."
He's so used to directing himself.

2445
01:55:46,532 --> 01:55:47,990
Flare. Flare.

2446
01:55:49,408 --> 01:55:53,747
- In that case, flare in both senses.
- And now, here's another thing.

2447
01:55:53,872 --> 01:55:58,252
I remember when I first saw this
in the editing room, you read the script

2448
01:55:58,377 --> 01:56:03,047
when Pike says, "I am relieved,"
you go, "Wow, that is all Greenwood."

2449
01:56:03,172 --> 01:56:05,716
I mean, like, you just never really...

2450
01:56:07,176 --> 01:56:10,180
- Talk about a double entendre.
- He's terrific there.

2451
01:56:11,722 --> 01:56:14,309
And that wheelchair, yes,
ladies and gentlemen, does answer

2452
01:56:14,435 --> 01:56:16,353
yes and no with single beeps.

2453
01:56:18,063 --> 01:56:20,940
And literally, I'm not kidding you,
weighed, like, 4,000 pounds.

2454
01:56:21,065 --> 01:56:23,777
It was the worst wheelchair.

2455
01:56:23,902 --> 01:56:26,863
It was a beautiful look,
but it was ridiculously heavy.

2456
01:56:26,988 --> 01:56:30,533
I think what's so cool about
the way that the movie ends is that

2457
01:56:30,658 --> 01:56:33,369
people are smiling, sort of, wall-to-wall.

2458
01:56:33,494 --> 01:56:35,622
Like, you just get this great, you know,

2459
01:56:35,747 --> 01:56:37,875
when the movie ends,
everybody's so happy.

2460
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,042
That's a very rare feeling
in movies these days.

2461
01:56:40,168 --> 01:56:43,796
This was Nimoy's...
He said, "Can I just say a line here?"

2462
01:56:44,506 --> 01:56:45,966
I said, "Sure."

2463
01:56:47,259 --> 01:56:49,595
And I love the bittersweet nature of that.

2464
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,596
Come on.

2465
01:56:55,016 --> 01:56:57,728
Here it is. Nice.

2466
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:08,697
Whatever. He used to say,
"Same ship, different day."

2467
01:57:11,617 --> 01:57:12,951
That was the name of the file, actually.

2468
01:57:13,076 --> 01:57:15,787
This was a last-minute idea,
to have Keenser back on the thing.

2469
01:57:15,912 --> 01:57:17,206
So did you just call up Deep
and you were like...

2470
01:57:17,331 --> 01:57:19,457
We called Deep and said,
"Could you come today and shoot this?"

2471
01:57:19,582 --> 01:57:21,126
And so, that was a cut, actually.
We shot...

2472
01:57:21,251 --> 01:57:23,628
And he was like, "Fortunately,
I have not taken my makeup off,

2473
01:57:23,753 --> 01:57:25,380
"so I will be there."

2474
01:57:26,715 --> 01:57:29,635
It was funny. Shooting this scene,

2475
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,596
you know, within the first weeks
of shooting,

2476
01:57:33,721 --> 01:57:35,765
- having not shot the whole film.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

2477
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:39,811
And it was like trying to figure out
what should we be feeling here.

2478
01:57:39,936 --> 01:57:44,024
And again, I think that Chris and Zach
and the whole group just killed it.

2479
01:57:44,149 --> 01:57:45,317
They're so good.

2480
01:57:45,442 --> 01:57:47,027
Come on, look at the smile
on Sulu's face.

2481
01:57:47,152 --> 01:57:48,945
- This is my favourite.
- So, this moment...

2482
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:50,655
- Happy that her boyfriend is on the ship.
- Yep.

2483
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,907
It's spectacular.

2484
01:57:53,074 --> 01:57:54,243
She's so good there.

2485
01:57:55,409 --> 01:57:57,829
And there was debate
who to give these lines to.

2486
01:57:57,954 --> 01:57:59,914
Some people thought
we should give it to Shatner.

2487
01:58:00,039 --> 01:58:02,417
Some people thought
we should give it to Pine.

2488
01:58:02,542 --> 01:58:05,671
I just think, you know,
you gotta give it to Nimoy.

2489
01:58:06,255 --> 01:58:08,590
Well, you wanted to do it.

2490
01:58:08,715 --> 01:58:11,635
I did actually record a version. Joking.

2491
01:58:21,019 --> 01:58:23,855
And then these end credits, again,
are by that guy, Andrew Kramer,

2492
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:27,650
who I just think did an amazing job.

2493
01:58:27,775 --> 01:58:29,819
It just, it looks so...

2494
01:58:30,028 --> 01:58:32,905
Yeah, I love the way that the camera
just sort of swoops around and...

2495
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:36,326
This is like a two-minute sequence
of CG.

2496
01:58:36,452 --> 01:58:38,953
But is there a reason
you put our names over Uranus?

2497
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,707
Wait, what'd you call me?

2498
01:58:41,832 --> 01:58:43,958
Well, his is over two big balls
over there, so that's...

2499
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,293
Wait a second.

2500
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:48,588
We made it through this entire
commentary and now we go blue?

2501
01:58:48,713 --> 01:58:50,591
- Now it's getting ugly.
- Wonderful.

2502
01:58:51,675 --> 01:58:54,136
Of course, Jeffrey Chernov, the...

2503
01:58:54,261 --> 01:58:56,054
Such a huge part of this movie,
by the way.

2504
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:57,680
And by the way, there's a name that

2505
01:58:57,805 --> 01:58:59,807
we neglected to mention
during the commentary, but...

2506
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:01,560
It wouldn't have happened without him.

2507
01:59:01,685 --> 01:59:03,270
- Essential member.
- The guy came in

2508
01:59:03,395 --> 01:59:06,856
literally six weeks before shooting
and took control of the production.

2509
01:59:06,981 --> 01:59:10,277
He said, "I need one week
to wrap my head around it,

2510
01:59:10,402 --> 01:59:12,820
"one week to figure it out,"
and then you know,

2511
01:59:12,945 --> 01:59:16,115
we started on schedule,
we finished on schedule.

2512
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:18,118
And almost never said no.

2513
01:59:18,243 --> 01:59:20,871
He's amazing. He really is the greatest.

2514
01:59:20,996 --> 01:59:22,163
We discussed Roger Guyett.

2515
01:59:22,288 --> 01:59:25,792
Shari Hanson,
who also was just invaluable.

2516
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:27,502
David Witz was an amazing producer.

2517
01:59:27,627 --> 01:59:28,796
We should just name
everyone we're seeing.

2518
01:59:28,921 --> 01:59:30,922
Dave Baronoff, you know...

2519
01:59:31,965 --> 01:59:33,341
Come on, April.
Should we talk about April?

2520
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:34,551
No.

2521
01:59:34,676 --> 01:59:38,387
April cast the following people: John
Cho, she cast, Ben Cross, she cast...

2522
01:59:38,514 --> 01:59:41,100
April, who did and does <i>Lost...</i>

2523
01:59:42,141 --> 01:59:43,185
Are you taking your clothes off again?

2524
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:44,560
- What is that sound?
- Seriously.

2525
01:59:44,685 --> 01:59:47,396
Sorry, sorry. I just took them back off.

2526
01:59:47,523 --> 01:59:50,192
- That's obviously the...
- Just as we're winding down.

2527
01:59:50,317 --> 01:59:52,985
- It's ending. Time to put...
- Get comfortable.

2528
01:59:53,112 --> 01:59:56,280
I'm sorry. I was anticipating Chris' nose.

2529
02:00:00,243 --> 02:00:03,122
I keep feeling like we should have done
something at the end of these credits,

2530
02:00:03,247 --> 02:00:05,623
because that's what all the crazy kids
are doing these days.

2531
02:00:05,748 --> 02:00:07,167
- I don't know what it is.
- I don't think so.

2532
02:00:07,292 --> 02:00:08,627
We had actually talked at one point

2533
02:00:08,752 --> 02:00:11,171
about doing something
at the end of the credits, you know...

2534
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:12,338
The sequel.

2535
02:00:12,463 --> 02:00:15,884
...involving the Botany Bay,
but I'm glad we didn't,

2536
02:00:16,009 --> 02:00:19,137
because that would have tied our hands
for the sequel.

2537
02:00:19,262 --> 02:00:20,555
It would have.

2538
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:30,440
Anything else we want to talk about
before we...

2539
02:00:30,565 --> 02:00:33,694
Is Gormley's name about to come out?

2540
02:00:34,153 --> 02:00:35,154
There he is.

2541
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:37,613
I could literally talk about
Tommy Gormley for another two hours.

2542
02:00:37,738 --> 02:00:39,658
- Do your Tommy Gormley impression.
- I can't.

2543
02:00:39,783 --> 02:00:40,783
- Just do it.
- I can't.

2544
02:00:40,908 --> 02:00:46,664
But Tommy Gormley, who's the first AD,
he's Scottish and is just...

2545
02:00:47,832 --> 02:00:50,752
He did <i>Mission: Impossible III</i> with us
and is just the greatest.

2546
02:00:50,877 --> 02:00:54,213
And literally keeps it going,
you know, keeps the production going,

2547
02:00:54,338 --> 02:00:57,009
keeps everyone motivated
and, you know, working with him.

2548
02:00:57,134 --> 02:01:01,054
He's just the greatest.
And he has an amazing, beautiful family.

2549
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:03,390
He's just a spectacular guy.

2550
02:01:05,057 --> 02:01:07,895
See, Gerald W. Abrams,
James McGrath, Jr. There they are.

2551
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:14,818
Come on, someone? Bob?

2552
02:01:17,488 --> 02:01:21,158
I can't believe this worked.
I mean, it's like a time warp.

2553
02:01:21,283 --> 02:01:22,743
I just remember
when we all sat down with Nimoy

2554
02:01:22,868 --> 02:01:24,744
and we were like,
"Hey, how about we blow up Vulcan?

2555
02:01:24,869 --> 02:01:25,953
"How do you like that, my friend?"

2556
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:27,747
- It's crazy that the...
- And now here we are.

2557
02:01:27,872 --> 02:01:31,335
You know, the movie has been out
for a month now

2558
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:33,796
and people are going to see it.

2559
02:01:34,671 --> 02:01:36,840
More than once, which is weird.

2560
02:01:36,965 --> 02:01:38,926
The greatest thing ever is,

2561
02:01:39,051 --> 02:01:42,470
people are saying, "Oh, my God,
I dragged my wife to the movie,

2562
02:01:42,595 --> 02:01:46,809
"and she actually really liked it a lot."
So, again, that was the mission,

2563
02:01:46,934 --> 02:01:50,020
to get our wives to think
that <i>Star Trek</i> was cool.

2564
02:01:50,145 --> 02:01:54,858
Speaking of wives, I just want to say
that Majel Barrett-Roddenberry,

2565
02:01:54,983 --> 02:01:57,985
who we were honoured
to have visit the set

2566
02:01:58,112 --> 02:02:00,572
when we were shooting,
she was so wonderful.

2567
02:02:00,697 --> 02:02:05,661
She showed up and was supportive
and funny and sweet,

2568
02:02:07,121 --> 02:02:12,167
and she literally said, you know,
"Gene would love this."

2569
02:02:12,292 --> 02:02:15,796
Like she was just gracious,
and as supportive

2570
02:02:15,921 --> 02:02:19,591
as Nimoy was to Zach,
she was to me and the production.

2571
02:02:19,716 --> 02:02:23,970
And we all stopped and applauded her,
and it was really wonderful.

2572
02:02:24,095 --> 02:02:27,140
And we were lucky to get her
to do the voice of the computer,

2573
02:02:27,306 --> 02:02:28,975
Starfleet computer again.

2574
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:34,480
And she, of course, sadly passed away
before we finished production. But...

2575
02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:36,692
And a few weeks after that
we had a nice call

2576
02:02:36,817 --> 02:02:39,110
from Eugene Roddenberry, their son,

2577
02:02:39,235 --> 02:02:41,822
who had seen the movie
and who said that

2578
02:02:41,947 --> 02:02:44,574
he felt his father would have absolutely
recognised it as <i>Star Trek,</i>

2579
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:47,161
- and that he just loved it.
- That's awesome.

2580
02:02:47,286 --> 02:02:48,787
It's great to hear things like that.

2581
02:02:48,912 --> 02:02:54,542
Barney Burman, who, again, did a lot
of the makeup for the aliens and stuff,

2582
02:02:55,668 --> 02:03:01,425
his father is a famous
Hollywood makeup artist.

2583
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:05,220
And I used to write letters
to musicians and makeup artists

2584
02:03:05,345 --> 02:03:06,430
and directors and stuff when I was a kid.

2585
02:03:06,555 --> 02:03:11,059
And I actually found, during production,
a letter from his father back to me.

2586
02:03:11,185 --> 02:03:12,895
And I brought it to the set one day

2587
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:14,188
- and I said, "Dude, look at this."
- Oh, my God.

2588
02:03:14,313 --> 02:03:15,396
And he literally almost started crying.

2589
02:03:15,521 --> 02:03:16,648
- Of course he did.
- It was the greatest.

2590
02:03:16,774 --> 02:03:19,150
- I was like, "Can you believe this?"
- You don't pull that on someone...

2591
02:03:19,275 --> 02:03:21,153
- Oh, my God.
- It was some ridiculous thing

2592
02:03:21,278 --> 02:03:24,655
I'd written to him,
and he was so sweet to write me back.

2593
02:03:28,493 --> 02:03:31,872
It's amazing. Later you'll see
when the ILM credits come up

2594
02:03:31,997 --> 02:03:34,957
and you see the number of people
who work just at ILM.

2595
02:03:35,083 --> 02:03:39,046
I mean, obviously,
we had a huge construction crew

2596
02:03:39,171 --> 02:03:41,422
and the crew of the whole film,
hundreds of people.

2597
02:03:41,547 --> 02:03:46,052
But when you look at the ILM list alone,
it's shocking.

2598
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:51,015
And they're just, they are brilliant.
I'm so grateful for the work that they do.

2599
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,975
- It's incredible.
- We're going up there on Thursday.

2600
02:03:53,101 --> 02:03:55,229
- I'm really excited.
- Good.

2601
02:03:55,686 --> 02:03:56,979
- See, Roger Guyett.
- I've never been there.

2602
02:03:57,105 --> 02:03:59,399
- You're gonna lose your mind.
- What are you doing on Thursday, J. J?

2603
02:03:59,524 --> 02:04:02,485
- I'm supposed to go up to ILM. No.
- Nice.

2604
02:04:06,405 --> 02:04:11,537
Roger Guyett also shot
the second unit stuff,

2605
02:04:11,662 --> 02:04:14,288
which is usually right next door
to the main unit,

2606
02:04:14,414 --> 02:04:18,127
and he did so much amazing work.
It was just spectacular.

2607
02:04:21,171 --> 02:04:23,798
- We should make a sequel to this.
- I don't know, man.

2608
02:04:23,923 --> 02:04:27,719
We should do another one.
I think that'd be a lot of fun.

2609
02:04:27,845 --> 02:04:30,889
I had this impromptu meeting
with George Lucas before we shot,

2610
02:04:31,014 --> 02:04:32,432
and I said, you know...

2611
02:04:32,557 --> 02:04:35,435
- You just dropped a name.
- I know. Let me, I'm gonna pick that up.

2612
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:39,273
And I was like, "What do I do?
How do I make this movie work?"

2613
02:04:39,398 --> 02:04:43,318
And he said, "Just put lightsabers in it."
Thank you.

2614
02:04:43,777 --> 02:04:45,069
- Is that what he said, really?
- Yeah.

2615
02:04:45,194 --> 02:04:46,613
- That's awesome.
- Digital artists.

2616
02:04:46,738 --> 02:04:48,532
So you might notice,

2617
02:04:48,657 --> 02:04:51,452
I think there's every name
in the world here. Look at this.

2618
02:04:51,577 --> 02:04:53,828
And each one of those people deserves,
like, a single card.

2619
02:04:53,953 --> 02:04:55,538
They're all amazing.

2620
02:04:55,663 --> 02:04:58,876
Going up there,
you'll see when you meet with them,

2621
02:04:59,001 --> 02:05:02,462
it's like walking past genius wizard
after genius wizard.

2622
02:05:02,587 --> 02:05:05,381
Like, they're just all amazing.
One guy does, like,

2623
02:05:05,506 --> 02:05:09,720
he'll do the, you know,
just the lens artefacts,

2624
02:05:09,845 --> 02:05:11,596
like the dirt on the lens,
and that's his thing.

2625
02:05:11,721 --> 02:05:13,640
- And someone else will do rotoscoping.
- Wow.

2626
02:05:13,765 --> 02:05:17,269
And they're all the best in the world
at what they... It's incredible.

2627
02:05:17,978 --> 02:05:19,061
The effects in this movie are incredible.

2628
02:05:19,188 --> 02:05:20,646
They really do put
everyone else to shame.

2629
02:05:20,773 --> 02:05:22,524
It's very painful not to work with them.

2630
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:24,443
There are lot more names,
I think, coming.

2631
02:05:24,568 --> 02:05:27,069
Yeah, it's an amazing group. It really is.

2632
02:05:30,282 --> 02:05:32,743
Are you really still listening
to our commentary?

2633
02:05:33,368 --> 02:05:36,162
- What's going on?
- Okay, if you are,

2634
02:05:36,662 --> 02:05:39,875
we're gonna say something really,
really important at the end.

2635
02:05:40,417 --> 02:05:43,545
- Bryan?
- The secret word is...

2636
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:44,755
Stefan Sonnenfeld.

2637
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,131
- Pineapple.
- Bryan will take his cloak off

2638
02:05:46,256 --> 02:05:48,759
- one last time.
- My cloak.

2639
02:05:49,301 --> 02:05:52,845
Stefan does the amazing
colour correction work.

2640
02:05:52,970 --> 02:05:58,268
He's a genius. And VarĂ¨se Sarabande,
one of our favourite labels.

2641
02:06:00,104 --> 02:06:02,314
I love that the name of the song
is "Josh Greenstein."

2642
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:06,400
Yeah, that's what I was...
Where did you get that from?

2643
02:06:06,527 --> 02:06:08,904
Well, 'cause it's in the green girl scene.

2644
02:06:09,029 --> 02:06:12,408
- And Josh Greenstein is the...
- Now I get it.

2645
02:06:13,074 --> 02:06:15,243
The guy who does all the...
How do you describe him?

2646
02:06:15,368 --> 02:06:16,828
The promotion stuff at Paramount.
He's amazing.

2647
02:06:16,953 --> 02:06:17,996
- Marketing.
- Marketing.

2648
02:06:18,122 --> 02:06:19,456
- Head of marketing.
- Head of marketing.

2649
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:22,251
We thank him for getting
people to the theatres.

2650
02:06:22,376 --> 02:06:25,671
And we thank Gene Roddenberry
for everything.

2651
02:06:25,962 --> 02:06:30,759
And now that you've made it this far,
the sequel will be called <i>Pineapple.</i>

2652
02:06:32,886 --> 02:06:34,095
- Thanks for listening.
- Thanks for listening.

2653
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:35,805
Thank you for watching.
