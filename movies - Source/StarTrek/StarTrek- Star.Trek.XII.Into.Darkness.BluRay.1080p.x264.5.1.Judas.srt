1
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,179
Damn it, man! That was our
ride! You just stunned our ride!

2
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,265
Oh, great.

3
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:41,558
Run!

4
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,275
What the hell did you take?

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,277
I have no idea,
but they were bowing to it.

6
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,278
Kirk to Shuttle One.

7
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,947
Locals are out of the kill zone.

8
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,323
You are clear. Repeat.

9
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,161
Spock, get in there, neutralize the
volcano and let's get out of here.

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,211
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain

11
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,379
the shuttle wasn't built
for this kind of heat.

12
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,883
Captain, did the indigenous
life forms see you?

13
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,759
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

14
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,093
The Prime Directive clearly states

15
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,387
there can be no interference

16
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,556
with the internal development
of alien civilizations.

17
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,140
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running

18
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,643
through the jungle wearing a disguise!

19
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,396
Now drop off your
super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out!

20
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,816
You're good.

21
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,567
if we're gonna do this,
we've got to do it now!

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,361
This ash is killing our coils.

23
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,905
You sure you don't want me
to go instead?

24
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,074
That would be highly illogical
as I am already outfitted...

25
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,783
Spock, I was kidding.

26
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,871
-You got this.
-Guys! We have to go! Now!

27
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,258
They're trying to kill us!

28
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,718
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

29
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,427
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

30
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,561
Do it, do it!

31
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,287
Prerequisite change, 2-7-3...

32
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,417
I can't hold this position.

33
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,960
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.

34
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,712
Negative. This is our only
chance to save this species.

35
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,548
if this volcano erupts, the planet dies.

36
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,385
Pull him back up. Now!

37
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,944
Spock, are you okay?

38
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,742
I am,

39
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,662
surprisingly, alive. Stand by.

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,872
We have to get him back.
I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,165
We have to abandon the shuttle.

42
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,168
-We can't just leave him, Sulu!
-We don't have a choice!

43
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,669
Uhura, I'm sorry.

44
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,754
Spock, we're going back
to the Enterprise.

45
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,838
We'll get you out of there.

46
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,673
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,468
You've got to make it
to the Enterprise on your own.

48
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,886
Wonderful!

49
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,471
-Uhura! You ready to swim?
-I'm ready.

50
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,725
Jim!

51
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:31,562
Jim! The beach is that way!

52
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,355
I know! We're not going to the beach!

53
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,316
Oh, no, no, no!

54
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,237
I hate this!

55
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,531
I know you do!

56
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,367
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous it is

57
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:28,869
to hide a starship
on the bottom of the ocean?

58
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,370
We've been down here since last night!

59
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:31,747
The salt water's gonna ruin the...

60
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,749
Scotty! Where's Spock?

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,875
Still in the volcano, sir.

62
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,293
Captain on the bridge!

63
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,047
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel to Mr. Spock?

64
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,382
The heat's frying his comms,
but we still have contact.

65
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,718
Spock?

66
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,971
I have activated the device, Captain.

67
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,096
When the countdown is complete,

68
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,639
the reaction should
render the volcano inert.

69
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,100
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!

70
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,476
Do we have use of the transporters?

71
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,228
-Negative, sir.
-Not with these magnetic fields.

72
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,896
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,564
Give me one way to do it.

74
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,858
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.

75
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,026
-if we got closer...
-Hold on, wee man!

76
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,694
You're talking about an active volcano!

77
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,362
Sir, if that thing erupts,

78
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,115
I can't guarantee
we can withstand the heat!

79
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,326
I don't know that we can
maintain that kind of altitude.

80
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,911
Our shuttle was concealed
by the ash cloud,

81
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,329
but the Enterprise is too large.

82
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,456
if utilized in a rescue effort,

83
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,124
it would be revealed
to the indigenous species.

84
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,084
Spock, nobody knows
the rules better than you,

85
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,002
but there has got to be an exception.

86
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,379
None. Such action violates
the Prime Directive.

87
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,341
Shut up, Spock! We're trying
to save you, damn it!

88
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,302
Doctor, the needs of
the many outweigh the needs of the few.

89
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,512
Spock, we're talking about your life!

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,721
The rule cannot be broken...

91
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,266
Spock!

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,643
Try to get him back online.

93
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,771
Ninety seconds to detonations.

94
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,442
if Spock were here
and I were there, what would he do?

95
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,113
He'd let you die.

96
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,299
Spock!

97
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,302
You all right?

98
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,178
Captain, you let them see our ship.

99
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,889
He's fine.

100
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:18,974
-Bridge to Captain Kirk.
-Yes, Lieutenant.

101
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,184
ls Commander Spock on board, sir?

102
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,269
Safely and soundly.

103
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,020
Please notify him that his device

104
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,648
has successfully detonated.

105
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,775
You hear that? Congratulations, Spock.

106
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,153
You just saved the world.

107
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,154
You violated the Prime Directive.

108
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,823
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us. Big deal.

109
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,859
I can save her.

110
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,697
What did you say?

111
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,408
Your daughter.

112
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,370
I can save her.

113
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,831
Who are you?

114
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,809
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

115
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,854
Jim!

116
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,815
You're not actually gonna
answer that, are you?

117
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,153
Spock, I'm telling you,
this is why he called. I can feel it.

118
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,779
Your feeling aside,
I consider it highly unlikely

119
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,032
that we will be selected
for the new program.

120
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,451
Why else would Pike want to see us?

121
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,910
Forget about seniority.

122
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,370
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

123
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,621
I mean, who else
are they gonna send out?

124
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,706
I can think of numerous possibilities.

125
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A five-year mission, Spock!

126
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,461
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

127
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,546
Think how incredible that's gonna be.

128
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,215
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

129
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,302
-"Uneventful."
-Admiral?

130
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,138
it's the way you described the survey of
Nibiru in your captain's log.

131
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,307
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time
going over the details.

132
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,308
Tell me more about this volcano.

133
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,768
Data says it was highly volatile.

134
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,394
if it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

135
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,770
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

136
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,105
Something tells me it won't.

137
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,150
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.

138
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,903
Maybe our data was off.

139
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,278
Or maybe it didn't erupt

140
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,947
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

141
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,326
inside it right after a civilization

142
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,577
that's barely invented the wheel

143
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,623
happened to see a starship
rising out of their ocean!

144
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,875
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

145
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,710
-Admiral...
-You filed a report?

146
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:57,878
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:00,339
I incorrectly assumed that you would be
truthful in your captain's log.

148
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,966
Yeah, I would have been
if I didn't have to save your life.

149
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,217
A fact for which I am
immeasurably grateful

150
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,802
and the very reason I felt it necessary

151
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,095
to take responsibility for the actions...

152
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,679
Take responsibility, yeah.

153
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,764
That'd be so noble, pointy,

154
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,350
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

155
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,434
"Pointy"? ls that
a derogatory reference to...

156
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,769
Gentlemen.

157
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,066
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and
observe, not to interfere.

158
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,025
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

159
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,277
the indigenous species would never

160
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,445
have been aware of our interference.

161
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,863
That's a technicality.

162
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

163
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,491
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?

164
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,451
I'm expressing
multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.

165
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,745
To which are you referring?

166
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:32,955
Out.

167
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,624
You're dismissed, Commander.

168
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,219
You have any idea what
a pain in the ass you are?

169
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,221
I think so, sir.

170
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,556
So tell me what you did wrong.

171
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,557
What's the lesson to be learned here?

172
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,142
Never trust a Vulcan.

173
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,727
Now, see, you can't
even answer the question. You lied.

174
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,730
On an official report, you lied.

175
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,231
You think the rules don't apply to you

176
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,524
'cause you disagree with them.

177
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,485
That's why you talked me
into signing up in the first place.

178
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,778
it's why you gave me your ship.

179
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,030
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

180
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,576
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

181
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,910
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

182
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,162
You're missing the point.

183
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,788
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

184
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,749
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

185
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
in the first place!

186
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,086
You were supposed to survey a planet,

187
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,004
not alter its destiny!

188
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,173
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

189
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,466
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

190
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,010
Except I didn't!

191
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,428
You know how many
crew members I've lost? Not one!

192
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,514
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

193
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,764
You think you can't make a mistake.

194
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,100
it's a pattern with you!

195
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:37,436
-The rules are for other people!
-Some should be.

196
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,187
And what's worse is you using blind luck

197
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,440
to justify your playing God!

198
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,818
Given the circumstances,

199
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,863
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

200
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,698
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

201
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,534
You understand what Starfleet
regulations mandate

202
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,702
be done at this point.

203
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,833
They've taken the Enterprise
away from you.

204
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,046
They're sending you
back to the Academy.

205
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,217
Admiral, listen...

206
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,302
-No, I'm not going to listen.
-l can justify...

207
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:12,386
Why should I listen?
I'm not going to listen.

208
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,804
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!

209
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,640
I understand regulation,
but every decision I've made...

210
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,725
No! I can't listen!

211
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,559
You don't comply with the rules,

212
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,729
you don't take responsibility
for anything,

213
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,898
and you don't respect the chair.

214
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,400
You know why?

215
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,403
Because you're not ready for it.

216
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,161
I'm going to need three titanium...

217
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:44,205
Radiation protection
is required in this area.

218
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,731
How did you find me?

219
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,942
I know you better than you think I do.

220
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,948
The first time I found you
was in a dive like this.

221
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,910
Remember that? You got
your ass handed to you.

222
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,244
No, I didn't.

223
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,204
-You don't?
-No, that's not what happened.

224
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,708
-That was an epic beating.
-No, it wasn't.

225
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,792
You had napkins
hanging out of your nose.

226
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,961
Did you not?

227
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,965
Yeah, that was a good fight.

228
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,509
"A good fight."

229
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,765
I think that's your problem right there.

230
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,439
They gave her back to me.

231
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,607
The Enterprise.

232
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,328
Congratulations.

233
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,666
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

234
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,670
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

235
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,380
He's been transferred.

236
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,965
U.S.S. Bradbury.

237
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,346
You're going to be my First Officer.

238
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,515
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.

239
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,186
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

240
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,982
What did you tell him?

241
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,777
The truth.

242
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,278
That I believe in you.

243
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,367
That if anybody
deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

244
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,711
I don't know what to say.

245
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,214
That is a first.

246
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,884
it's going to be okay, son.

247
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,060
"Emergency session, Daystrom."

248
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,896
That's us.

249
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,523
Yeah.

250
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,817
Suit up.

251
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,289
All Starfleet personnel,
please be advised,

252
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,292
-new security protocols are in effect.
-Captain.

253
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,461
Not anymore, Spock. First Officer.

254
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,258
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

255
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
it is fortunate that the consequences

256
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,260
were not more severe.

257
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,679
You've got to be kidding me.

258
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:28,846
Captain, it was never my intention...

259
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,097
Not Captain.

260
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,516
I saved your life, Spock.

261
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,977
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.

262
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,522
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

263
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,275
to the fact that I submitted the report.

264
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,192
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion

265
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,988
to follow the rules.
But you see, I can't do that.

266
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,699
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

267
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:48,950
you don't stab him in the back.

268
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,785
Vulcans cannot lie.

269
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,537
Then I'm talking
to the half-human part of you.

270
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,204
All right?

271
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,750
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

272
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,295
Commander Spock?
Frank Abbot, U.S.S. Bradbury.

273
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,796
Guess you're with me.

274
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,965
Yes, Captain.

275
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,267
The truth is

276
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,686
I'm going to miss you.

277
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,323
Admiral Marcus, sir.

278
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,493
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

279
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,827
Be seated.

280
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,750
By now, some of you
have heard what happened in London.

281
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,211
The target was a Starfleet data archive.

282
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,461
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,

283
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,338
42 men and women are dead.

284
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,589
One hour ago,

285
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,383
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

286
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,384
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

287
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,180
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

288
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,182
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

289
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,353
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

290
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,105
For reasons unknown,
John Harrison has just declared

291
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,650
a one-man war against Starfleet.

292
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,528
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

293
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,196
to escape Federation space.

294
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,615
You here tonight represent
the senior command

295
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,451
of all the vessels in the region.

296
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:16,162
And in the name of those we lost,

297
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,539
you will run this bastard down.

298
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,876
This is a manhunt,
pure and simple, so let's get to work.

299
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,296
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

300
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,964
any warp signatures leaving the system,

301
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,383
so we know he can't be far.

302
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,719
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

303
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,263
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

304
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,142
to run down every lead.

305
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,018
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

306
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,645
so the rules of engagement are simple.

307
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,773
if you come across this man
and fear for your life

308
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,651
or the lives of those nearby,

309
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,778
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

310
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:51,573
-What's in the bag?
-James, not now.

311
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,825
it doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

312
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,410
it's like bombing a library.

313
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,202
Chris? Everything okay there?

314
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,205
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating

315
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,083
to his new position as First Officer.

316
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,835
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.

317
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,545
Tomorrow's too late.

318
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,714
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.

319
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,718
Spit it out, son. Don't be shy.

320
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,971
Why the archive?

321
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:17,765
All that information is public record.

322
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,893
if he really wanted to damage Starfleet,

323
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,688
this could just be the beginning.

324
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,315
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

325
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,233
Sir, in the event
of an attack, protocol mandates

326
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,195
that senior command gather
captains and first officers

327
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,323
at Starfleet H.Q., right here

328
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,742
-in this room.
-it is curious Harrison

329
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,869
would commandeer a jumpship
without warp capabilities...

330
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,126
Clear the room!

331
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,508
No!

332
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,305
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!

333
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,516
-Let's go!
-Cover me!

334
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:10,692
-Target acquired.
-Take him out!

335
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:11,818
Watch my flank!

336
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,656
-Go, go, go!
-Cover me!

337
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,617
Fire!

338
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:23,820
Yeah?

339
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,449
Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something

340
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,409
in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.

341
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,077
He has asked to see us right away.

342
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,875
Captain!
I found this in the crashed jumpship, sir.

343
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,751
-This is how the bastard got away.
-What do you mean?

344
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,961
it's a portable
transwarp beaming device.

345
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,297
Well, can you figure out where he went?

346
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,299
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

347
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,260
He's gone to the one place we...

348
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,638
We just can't go.

349
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,101
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.

350
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,522
He's on Kronos, sir.

351
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,191
I request my command be reinstated

352
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,151
and your permission to go after him.

353
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,819
Give us a minute.

354
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,405
-Kronos.
-Yes, sir.

355
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,991
So Harrison's gone
to the Klingon homeworld.

356
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,743
-ls he defecting?
-We're not sure, sir.

357
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,246
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

358
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,329
a region uninhabited for decades.

359
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,914
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!

360
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,708
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

361
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,792
it'd be all-out war.

362
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,170
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.

363
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,463
Please, sir.

364
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,260
All-out war with
the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

365
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,720
if you ask me, it's already begun.

366
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,388
Since we first learned of their existence,

367
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,598
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

368
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,849
two planets that we know of

369
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,478
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

370
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:41,147
They are coming our way.

371
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,152
London was not an archive.

372
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,153
it was a top-secret branch of Starfleet

373
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,781
designated Section 31 .

374
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,409
They were developing
defense technology

375
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,411
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

376
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,953
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

377
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,330
who means to do us harm.

378
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,833
Harrison was one of our top agents.

379
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,294
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

380
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,839
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

381
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:08,675
You should have heard him defend you.

382
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,846
He's the one who talked you
into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

383
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,140
Yes, sir.

384
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,892
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

385
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,148
His death is on me.

386
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,817
And yours can't be.

387
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,943
Sir, please. All I...

388
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,528
Mr. Spock, you said the province

389
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,071
where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?

390
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,781
Affirmative, sir.

391
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,662
As part of our defensive strategy,

392
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,039
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

393
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,085
Long-range and untraceable,

394
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,337
it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.

395
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,548
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

396
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:50,509
You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

397
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,470
you lock onto Harrison's position,

398
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,012
you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.

399
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,851
Permission to
reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

400
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,519
Granted.

401
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,237
Jim!

402
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,199
-Where were you?
-For what?

403
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:14,866
Your medical exam.

404
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,911
Ten hours ago, you were
in a damn firefight.

405
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,246
-Now it's my duty as ship's...
-I'm fine, Bones.

406
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:20,914
The hell you are.

407
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,417
I'm fine.

408
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,175
Status report, Mr. Spock.

409
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,594
The Enterprise should be
ready for launch

410
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,096
by the time we arrive.

411
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,472
-Good. Good.
-Captain.

412
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,809
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

413
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:43,770
You're welcome.

414
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,773
As I am again
your First Officer, it is now my duty

415
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,483
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

416
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:49,984
Of course it is.

417
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,528
There is no Starfleet regulation

418
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,197
that condemns a man
to die without a trial,

419
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,990
something you
and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.

420
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,368
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes

421
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,953
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

422
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,788
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

423
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,914
There's only gonna be one casualty.

424
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,500
And in case you weren't listening,

425
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,626
our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

426
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,420
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

427
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,632
Regulations aside,
this action is morally wrong.

428
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:14,385
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

429
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,552
And I didn't win any points for that.

430
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,721
Whoa, Jim, calm down.

431
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,222
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

432
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,056
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

433
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,474
and therefore find my opinion valid.

434
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,726
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

435
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,061
Bones, get that thing off my face.

436
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,856
Captain, our mission
could start a war with the Klingons

437
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:30,025
and it is, by its very definition, immoral.

438
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,693
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

439
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,112
to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.

440
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,364
Captain Kirk.

441
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,159
Science Officer Wallace.

442
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,494
I've been assigned
to the Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.

443
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,496
These are my transfer orders.

444
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,373
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

445
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,583
I wish I had.

446
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,463
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

447
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,922
"Doctorate in applied physics

448
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,925
"specializing in advanced weaponry."

449
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,050
Impressive credentials.

450
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,510
Thank you.

451
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,096
But redundant now that
I am back aboard the Enterprise.

452
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,639
And yet, the more the merrier.

453
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,807
-Have a seat, Doctor.
-Thank you.

454
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,396
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.

455
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,503
No! I'm not signing anything!

456
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,797
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

457
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,048
ls there a problem, Mr. Scott?

458
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,092
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

459
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,719
that I can't authorize any
weapons on board this ship

460
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,929
without knowing what's inside them.

461
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,806
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...

462
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,016
Report to the bridge.

463
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,351
Captain.

464
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:47,393
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns,

465
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,355
but we need these torpedoes on board.

466
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:52,023
Due respect, sir,
but photon torpedoes run on fuel.

467
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,692
Now, I can't detect the type of fuel

468
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,568
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

469
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,695
because it's shielded.

470
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,114
Now, I asked for
the specifications, but he said...

471
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,242
-it's classified.
-it's classified.

472
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,409
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"

473
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,494
Captain.

474
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,871
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

475
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,873
-Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
-Yes, sir.

476
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,001
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

477
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:13,753
Get down!

478
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,422
Jim, your vitals are way off.

479
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,842
Report to the med bay. Scotty!

480
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,510
I need you to approve those weapons.

481
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,594
Do you know what this is, Captain?

482
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,096
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.

483
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:25,014
-Do you know what this is?
-it's a warp core.

484
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,101
it's a radioactive
catastrophe waiting to happen.

485
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,144
A subtle shift in magnetic output

486
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,106
from, say, firing
one or more of six dozen torpedoes

487
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,650
with an unknown payload

488
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,193
could set off a chain reaction
which would kill

489
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,945
every living thing on this ship.

490
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,572
Letting those torpedoes on board the
Enterprise is the last straw!

491
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,490
-What was the first straw?
-What was the...

492
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,409
There are plenty of straws.

493
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,121
How about Starfleet
confiscating my transwarp equation?

494
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,456
And now some madman's
using it to hop across the galaxy!

495
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:50,623
Where do you think he got it from?

496
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,041
We have our orders, Scotty!

497
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,960
That's what scares me.

498
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,713
This is clearly a military operation.

499
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,590
ls that what we are now?

500
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,800
'Cause I thought we were explorers.

501
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,177
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.

502
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,139
Right, well, you leave me no choice

503
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,516
but to resign my duties.

504
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,143
Come on, Scotty.

505
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,853
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

506
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,061
You're not giving me much of a choice.

507
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,438
Will you just
make an exception and sign...

508
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,815
Do you accept my resignation or not?

509
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,190
I do!

510
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:23,824
I do.

511
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,036
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.

512
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,510
Jim, for the love of God,
do not use those torpedoes.

513
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:59,150
Attention. Warp core
anti-matter containment check

514
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,693
in three minutes.

515
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,034
Captain! I'm so sorry
about Admiral Pike.

516
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:08,744
We all are.

517
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,246
-Are you okay?
-Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

518
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,382
Actually, Scotty just quit.

519
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,427
And your boyfriend's second-guessing
me every chance he gets.

520
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,182
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

521
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,936
it's just sometimes
I want to rip the bangs off his head.

522
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,273
-You know, maybe it's me. I...
-it's not you.

523
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,068
it's not?

524
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,864
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?

525
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:46,949
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

526
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,117
Oh, my God! What is that even like?

527
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:56,000
Your ears burning?

528
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,166
Captain on the bridge!

529
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,043
Captain.

530
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:02,755
Mr. Chekov. You've been
shadowing Mr. Scott.

531
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,175
You are familiar with
the engineering systems of this ship?

532
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,260
Affirmative, sir.

533
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,427
Good.

534
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,181
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.

535
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:16,269
Aye, Captain.

536
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:21,900
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

537
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,193
Yes, sir.

538
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,992
Docking clamps one, two,
and three are released.

539
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,077
All moorings retracted.

540
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:44,547
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a shipwide channel.

541
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,632
Yes, sir.

542
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,010
Mr. Chekov,
how we looking down there?

543
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,554
-All systems nominal, Captain.
-Copy that.

544
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:52,139
Warp available at your command.

545
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:53,806
Thank you, Mr. Chekov.

546
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,476
-All right. Let's ride.
-Yes, sir.

547
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,282
Channel open, sir.

548
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,577
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

549
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,871
As most of you know, Christopher Pike,

550
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,875
former captain of this ship
and our friend,

551
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,003
is dead.

552
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,672
The man who killed him
has fled our system

553
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,507
and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,

554
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,219
somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.

555
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,222
We are on our way there now.

556
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,226
Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential
that our presence go undetected.

557
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,936
Tensions between the Federation

558
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,730
and the Klingon Empire have been high.

559
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,148
Any provocation could lead
to an all-out war.

560
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,873
I will personally lead a landing party

561
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,583
to an abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos

562
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,588
where we will capture
the fugitive, John Harrison,

563
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,759
and return him to Earth
so he can face judgment for his actions.

564
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,974
All right. Let's go
get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.

565
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,773
Captain, I believe you have
made the right decision.

566
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:25,858
if I can be of assistance,

567
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,985
I would be happy to accompany
you on the away team.

568
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,737
You? Happy?

569
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:34,574
I was simply attempting to use your
vernacular to convey an idea.

570
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,452
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

571
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:51,215
All personnel, prepare for the
closing of payload bay doors.

572
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,101
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

573
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,603
What are you doing, Doctor?

574
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,606
-Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
-You misunderstand.

575
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,773
What are you doing aboard this ship?

576
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,693
There is no record
of you being assigned to the Enterprise.

577
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,195
Really? That must be
some sort of mistake.

578
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,614
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

579
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,159
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

580
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,746
Wallace is the surname of your mother.

581
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,081
I can only assume
the Admiral is your father.

582
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,793
Mr. Spock.

583
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,880
I'm aware that I have
no right to ask this of you.

584
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,134
But please, he cannot
know that I'm here...

585
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,061
Engineering manually
dropped us out of warp, sir.

586
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,896
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?

587
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,606
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!

588
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,815
The core overheated.

589
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,567
I had to activate the emergency stop.

590
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:52,277
it must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.

591
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,612
-Sorry, Captain.
-Damn it.

592
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,157
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.

593
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,574
Twenty minutes, sir.

594
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,786
That's 20 minutes
in enemy space we weren't counting on.

595
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,536
All right. We better hop to it.

596
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,121
-Where's Spock?
-Here, Captain.

597
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,166
You're coming with me to Kronos.

598
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,251
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

599
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,503
-it's rusty, but it's good.
-Good, you're coming, too.

600
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,130
This isn't going to be a problem, is it,
you two working together?

601
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:14,840
Absolutely not.

602
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:18,552
Unclear.

603
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:20,764
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.

604
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,184
Jim, you're not actually
going down there, are you?

605
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,853
You don't rob a bank
when the getaway car has a flat tire.

606
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,565
I'm sure engineering
will have us all patched up

607
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,692
by the time we get back.

608
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:33,818
Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?

609
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,902
Yes, Captain.

610
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,405
I'll do my best, sir.

611
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,782
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

612
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:42,536
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit

613
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,871
a targeted comm burst
to Harrison's location.

614
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,498
You tell him you have a bunch
of real big torpedoes pointed at his head

615
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,376
and if he doesn't play nice,
you're not afraid to use them.

616
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,295
-ls that a problem?
-No, sir.

617
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,213
I've just never sat in the chair before.

618
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,050
You're gonna do great.

619
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,219
Jim! Wait!

620
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,847
You just sat that man down
at a high-stakes poker game

621
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,057
with no cards and told him to bluff.

622
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,561
Now Sulu's a good man,
but he is no captain.

623
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,853
For the next two hours, he is.

624
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,938
And enough with the metaphors, all
right? That's an order.

625
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,567
Mr. Sulu, make sure
that K'normian ship is ready to fly.

626
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,619
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.

627
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,539
Please have the trade ship
we confiscated

628
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,166
during the Mudd incident last month
fueled and flight ready.

629
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,418
Captain Kirk is en route to you now.

630
00:44:35,797 --> 00:44:37,465
Ready to deploy, Captain.

631
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,259
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.

632
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,219
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.

633
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,262
-Sir?
-Look, if this thing goes south,

634
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,349
there can be nothing
tying us to Starfleet.

635
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,893
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

636
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,353
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

637
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,646
Good. Me, neither.

638
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,250
I am detecting
a single life sign in the Ketha Province.

639
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,418
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

640
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,795
this is most likely John Harrison.

641
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,547
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.

642
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,882
You let him know you mean business.

643
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,132
Aye, Captain.

644
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,012
Attention, John Harrison.

645
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,391
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

646
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,936
A shuttle of highly trained officers
is on its way to your location.

647
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,106
If you do not surrender
to them immediately,

648
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,402
I will unleash the entire payload
of advanced long-range torpedoes

649
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,530
currently locked onto your location.

650
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:45,074
You have two minutes
to confirm your compliance.

651
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,036
Refusal to do so will result
in your obliteration.

652
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,541
If you test me, you will fail.

653
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,380
Mr. Sulu,

654
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,050
remind me never to piss you off.

655
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,764
We will arrive at Harrison's location

656
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,182
in three minutes, Captain.

657
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,934
it is unlikely that he will come willingly.

658
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:15,813
I calculate the odds
of him attempting to kill us at 91 .6%.

659
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,065
Fantastic.

660
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,692
Good thing you don't care about dying.

661
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,570
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear what you said.

662
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,197
I didn't say anything.

663
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,117
Actually, I'd be happy to speak

664
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,201
-if you're willing to listen to me.
-Guys...

665
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,911
Lieutenant, I would prefer
to discuss this in private.

666
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,371
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.

667
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,539
Our current circumstances...

668
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,039
Are you really gonna do this right now?

669
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,625
What never seems to require
your undivided focus...

670
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,210
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.

671
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,628
-Okay.
-...is us.

672
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,963
At that volcano, you didn't
give a thought to us.

673
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,550
What it would do to me
if you died, Spock.

674
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,594
You didn't feel anything.

675
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:48,889
You didn't care.

676
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,807
And I'm not the only one who's upset
with you. The Captain is, too.

677
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,561
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.

678
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,355
She is right.

679
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,525
Your suggestion that
I do not care about dying is incorrect.

680
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,277
A sentient being's optimal chance

681
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,487
at maximizing their utility
is a long and prosperous life.

682
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,572
Great.

683
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,282
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

684
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,449
You misunderstand.

685
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,994
it is true I chose not to feel anything

686
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,956
upon realizing that
my own life was ending.

687
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,333
As Admiral Pike was dying,

688
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,293
I joined with his consciousness

689
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:23,255
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

690
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,467
Anger. Confusion.

691
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,969
Loneliness.

692
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,096
Fear.

693
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,474
I had experienced those feelings before,

694
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,559
multiplied exponentially

695
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,313
on the day my planet was destroyed.

696
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,775
Such a feeling is something I choose

697
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,985
never to experience again.

698
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,990
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel

699
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,827
as a reflection of my not caring.

700
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:57,541
Well, I assure you,
the truth is precisely the opposite.

701
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,838
What the hell was that?

702
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,925
What happened? Where's their signal?

703
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,177
it cut out. I'm working to get them back.

704
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,559
We are being pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

705
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:16,726
I thought this sector was abandoned!

706
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,978
it must be a random patrol.

707
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:19,144
Hold on!

708
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,400
This ship has no offensive capabilities.

709
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,318
It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells.

710
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,403
Aye, Captain.

711
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:42,835
Damn it!

712
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,840
They're closing fast, bearing 285!

713
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,010
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.

714
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,389
If you are suggesting
that we utilize the passage

715
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,556
between the approaching structures,

716
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,516
-this ship will not fit.
-We'll fit.

717
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,644
-Captain, we will not fit.
-We'll fit, we'll fit!

718
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,166
-l told you we'd fit.
-l am not sure that qualifies.

719
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,211
Any sign of them?

720
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,922
-No. Which worries me.
-We lost them!

721
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,215
Or they're jamming our scanners.

722
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:30,382
Or we lost them.

723
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,737
They're ordering us to land.

724
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,490
Captain, they're gonna
want to know why we're here.

725
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,202
And they're gonna torture us.

726
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,911
Question us.

727
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,579
And they're gonna kill us.

728
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,458
So we come out shooting.

729
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,632
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

730
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,927
There's no way we survive
if we attack first.

731
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,806
You brought me here
because I speak Klingon.

732
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,809
Then let me speak Klingon.

733
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:10,567
This isn't going to work.

734
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,652
it is our only logical option.

735
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,780
And if you interrupt her now, you will
not only incur the wrath of the Klingons

736
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,490
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

737
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:52,192
-Lieutenant.
-Thanks, Captain.

738
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,632
-Stand down.
-How many torpedoes?

739
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:03,715
Stand down!

740
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,219
The torpedoes, the weapons you
threatened me with in your message.

741
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,804
How many are there?

742
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,724
Seventy-two.

743
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:20,065
I surrender.

744
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,960
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

745
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:40,585
my friend,

746
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,880
I accept your surrender.

747
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,282
Captain!

748
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:18,958
Captain.

749
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,179
Cuff him.

750
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,327
-Bones, meet me in the brig.
-Be right there.

751
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,869
Lieutenant.

752
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,831
Contact Starfleet, let them know
we have Harrison in custody,

753
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,710
and we'll be on our way once
the warp core is repaired.

754
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:04,086
Yes, sir.

755
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:22,688
-Why the hell did he surrender?
-l don't know.

756
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,648
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

757
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,817
I want to know how.

758
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,277
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

759
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,695
You tell me.

760
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,164
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

761
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,431
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

762
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,811
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

763
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,896
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

764
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,233
-How the hell do you know that?
-Bones.

765
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,403
I think you'd find
my insight valuable, Captain.

766
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,699
-We good?
-Yeah.

767
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,367
Let me know what you find.

768
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:22,414
Ignore me and you
will get everyone on this ship killed.

769
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,507
Captain, I believe
he will only attempt to manipulate you.

770
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,885
I would not recommend
engaging the prisoner further.

771
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,469
Give me a minute.

772
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,193
Let me explain what's happening here.

773
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,320
You are a criminal.

774
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:54,989
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

775
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,657
I was authorized to end you!

776
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,329
And the only reason
why you are still alive

777
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,039
is because I am allowing it.

778
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,041
So shut your mouth.

779
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,960
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

780
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,963
over and over till your arm weakens?

781
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,382
Clearly you want to, so tell me,

782
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,887
why did you allow me to live?

783
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,304
We all make mistakes.

784
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,141
No. I surrendered to you because,

785
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,226
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

786
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,230
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

787
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,900
If you did not,
then it would be impossible for me

788
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:33,068
to convince you of the truth.

789
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,907
23-17-46-11 .

790
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:42,327
Coordinates not far from Earth.

791
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,831
If you want to know why I did what I did,

792
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,250
go and take a look.

793
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,335
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

794
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,505
I can give you 72.

795
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,590
And they're on board your ship, Captain.

796
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:59,219
They have been all along.

797
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,389
I suggest you open one up.

798
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:19,949
Hi!

799
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,333
You know what really
bothers me, though?

800
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,086
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

801
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,172
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

802
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,425
Just for trying to do what's right!

803
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,594
And what did you do anyway?

804
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,762
You just stood there like an oyster,

805
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:43,222
looking at me!

806
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:44,347
What?

807
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,932
Scotty, it's Kirk.

808
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,559
Well now!

809
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,646
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!

810
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,565
Did you hear that?
I called him Perfect Hair.

811
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:54,108
-Where are you?
-Where are you?

812
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,358
Are you drunk?

813
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,528
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

814
01:00:58,612 --> 01:00:59,947
I need you to help me out
with something.

815
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:01,364
Will you take these coordinates down?

816
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,577
23-17-46-11 .

817
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,202
Are you writing?

818
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,331
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?

819
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,543
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?

820
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:14,670
Forty-six.

821
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,630
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

822
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,925
but I have a feeling you'll know it
when you see it.

823
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:23,762
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

824
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,891
I will consider that an apology.

825
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,768
And I will consider that apology.

826
01:01:31,103 --> 01:01:32,396
You are the one who quit.

827
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,231
You made me quit!

828
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,108
Mr. Scott?

829
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,902
Scott.

830
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,945
The nerve of that guy!

831
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,451
I am not doing that man any favors!

832
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,786
No!

833
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:48,954
All right, then!

834
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:51,081
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?

835
01:01:51,248 --> 01:01:52,958
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

836
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,960
He killed Pike, he almost killed you,

837
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,295
and now you think
it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo

838
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,547
because he dared you to.

839
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,465
Why did he save our lives, Bones?

840
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,217
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.

841
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,719
Don't agree with me, Spock.
it makes me very uncomfortable.

842
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,722
Perhaps you, too, should learn
to govern your emotions, Doctor.

843
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,099
In this situation, logic dictates...

844
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,226
Logic? Oh, my God! There's a maniac

845
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,978
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

846
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,813
That's not it.
I don't know why he surrendered,

847
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,315
but that's not it.

848
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,733
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

849
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,402
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board,

850
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,903
who exactly is qualified

851
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:24,197
to just pop open
a four-ton stick of dynamite?

852
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,907
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

853
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,992
in the torpedoes
and she is a weapons specialist.

854
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:30,538
Perhaps she could be of some use.

855
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:32,373
What Admiral's daughter?

856
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,916
Carol Marcus. Your new science officer

857
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,835
concealed her identity to board the ship.

858
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,380
When were you going to tell me that?

859
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,632
When it became relevant. As it just did.

860
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,300
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?

861
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:44,927
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

862
01:02:45,177 --> 01:02:46,512
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

863
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,887
onto your ship to find out why.

864
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,681
I do apologize for that.

865
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,559
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

866
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,061
I'm Carol Marcus.

867
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,230
-James Kirk.
-Torpedoes.

868
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,275
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

869
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,027
then I heard he was
developing these prototype torpedoes.

870
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,697
When I went to confront him about it,
he wouldn't even see me.

871
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,907
That's when I discovered
the torpedoes had disappeared

872
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,119
from all official records.

873
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,121
And then he gave them to me.

874
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,206
You're much cleverer than
your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

875
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,001
I have a reputation?

876
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,210
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

877
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:21,213
Christine, yes. How is she?

878
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,340
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

879
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,467
She's much happier now.

880
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,550
That's good.

881
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,052
You have no idea
who I'm talking about, do you?

882
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:29,972
What are we doing in here?

883
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,056
ls this shuttle prepped to fly?

884
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,474
Of course it is.

885
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,226
-Would you please turn around?
-Why?

886
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,644
Just turn around.

887
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,731
It's too dangerous to try and open

888
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:41,733
one of these torpedoes
on the Enterprise.

889
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,570
But there is a nearby planetoid.

890
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:46,237
I can open one up there.

891
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,282
But I will need some help.

892
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:50,201
Turn around.

893
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,494
Now!

894
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,498
Captain on the bridge!

895
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,208
Mr. Sulu,

896
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,751
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

897
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:02,505
Yes, sir. They're moving the
torpedo into position now.

898
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:04,840
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?

899
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,217
Not yet.

900
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,260
But if we're stuck
here much longer, they will find us.

901
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,971
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

902
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,597
we have Harrison in custody?

903
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,682
Yes, sir. No response yet.

904
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:17,436
Engineering to bridge.

905
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,771
Hello. Captain, can you hear me?

906
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,606
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

907
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,193
We found the leak, sir,
but the damage is substantial.

908
01:04:25,277 --> 01:04:26,277
We're working on it.

909
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,112
Any idea what caused it?

910
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:32,367
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.

911
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:37,706
Something tells me
it wasn't your fault. Stay on it.

912
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,875
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

913
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,335
Bones, thanks for helping out.

914
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,630
Dr. Marcus asked
for the steadiest hands on the ship.

915
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,215
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

916
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:48,342
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

917
01:04:48,425 --> 01:04:49,802
there was no torpedo!

918
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:52,554
Dr. McCoy, may I remind you,
you are not there to flirt.

919
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,181
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

920
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:56,349
Bones!

921
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,309
To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

922
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,478
we need to open the warhead.

923
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,188
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

924
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:02,273
Unfortunately for us,

925
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,942
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

926
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,068
Sweetheart, I once performed

927
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,528
an emergency C-section
on a pregnant Gorn.

928
01:05:08,612 --> 01:05:09,612
Octuplets.

929
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,864
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

930
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:14,659
I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

931
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,621
Dr. McCoy,
there's a bundle of fiber optic cables

932
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,123
against the inner casing.

933
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,166
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.

934
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,960
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

935
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:24,043
Do you understand?

936
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,045
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

937
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,338
Dr. McCoy,

938
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,465
wait for my word.

939
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,467
I'm rerouting the detonation processor.

940
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:33,637
-Are you ready?
-And raring.

941
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:34,722
Good luck.

942
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:37,557
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.

943
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:39,143
The warhead's gonna
detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

944
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,561
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!

945
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,230
Target their signal.
Beam them back right now.

946
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,108
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

947
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,943
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

948
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,653
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?

949
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,989
I'm trying. I'm trying.

950
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,532
Jim, get her the hell out of here!

951
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,284
No! If you beam me back, he dies!

952
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,869
Just let me do it!

953
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,913
Ten. Nine.

954
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,081
Eight.

955
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,751
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

956
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:05,628
Four. Three.

957
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:06,878
shooot!

958
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,969
Deactivation successful, Captain.

959
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,806
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?

960
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,396
Bones!

961
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,648
Jim?

962
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,735
You're going to want to see this.

963
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,637
Delta team, deliver your
thrusters to loading dock 12.

964
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,306
U.S.S. Vengeance, bridge crew

965
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,726
requesting entry to construction hangar.

966
01:07:46,186 --> 01:07:47,438
You are cleared to enter the hangar.

967
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,907
I need a welding team
on the number one nacelle.

968
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,746
Holy...

969
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,750
What have we got?

970
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:08,876
It's quite clever actually.

971
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,085
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

972
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,838
and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.

973
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,301
-ls he alive?
-He's alive.

974
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,552
But if we try to revive him

975
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,055
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

976
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,931
This technology's beyond me.

977
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:25,559
How advanced, Doctor?

978
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,186
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

979
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:31,774
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

980
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:35,194
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

981
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,529
He's 300 years old.

982
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,207
Why is there a man in that torpedo?

983
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,583
There are men and women

984
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:52,461
in all those torpedoes, Captain.

985
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,253
I put them there.

986
01:08:57,382 --> 01:08:58,509
Who the hell are you?

987
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,265
A remnant of a time long past.

988
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,393
Genetically engineered to be superior

989
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,438
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

990
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:17,610
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

991
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,697
For centuries we slept,

992
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,452
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

993
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:28,037
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

994
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:30,457
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

995
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,792
distant quadrants of space.

996
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,627
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

997
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,462
I looked up "John Harrison."

998
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,006
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.

999
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:41,635
John Harrison was a fiction
created the moment I was awoken

1000
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,930
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1001
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,600
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1002
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,854
My name is

1003
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,396
Khan.

1004
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,945
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1005
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,949
ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?

1006
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,743
Because I am better.

1007
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,288
-At what?
-Everything.

1008
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,792
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to

1009
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,961
an uncivilized threat in a civilized time

1010
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,462
and for that he needed a warrior's mind.

1011
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,715
My mind.

1012
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:22,134
To design weapons and warships.

1013
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,219
You are suggesting the Admiral

1014
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,262
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1015
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:28,431
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1016
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,975
He wanted to exploit my savagery.

1017
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,770
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1018
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,605
You... You can't even break a rule.

1019
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:38,483
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1020
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,987
Marcus used me to design weapons.

1021
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,907
To help him realize
his vision of a militarized Starfleet.

1022
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:47,743
He sent you to use those weapons.

1023
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:52,204
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1024
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,583
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1025
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:59,587
in enemy space,
leading to one inevitable outcome.

1026
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,297
The Klingons would come searching

1027
01:11:01,381 --> 01:11:03,216
for whomever was responsible,

1028
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,426
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1029
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:09,972
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1030
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,100
The war he always wanted.

1031
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:13,894
No. No.

1032
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:16,020
I watched you open fire

1033
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,731
in a room full of
unarmed Starfleet officers.

1034
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,734
You killed them in cold blood!

1035
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,319
Marcus took my crew from me.

1036
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,529
You are a murderer!

1037
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:29,201
He used my friends to control me.

1038
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,247
I tried to smuggle them to safety

1039
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,042
by concealing them in the very weapons

1040
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,835
I had designed,

1041
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,588
but I was discovered.

1042
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,594
I had no choice but to escape alone.

1043
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:53,265
And when I did,
I had every reason to suspect

1044
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:57,645
that Marcus had killed every single one

1045
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:01,149
of the people I hold most dear.

1046
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,989
So I responded in kind.

1047
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,119
My crew

1048
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:16,122
is my family, Kirk.

1049
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,335
ls there anything
you would not do for your family?

1050
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,630
Proximity alert, sir!

1051
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:25,465
There's a ship at warp
heading right for us.

1052
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,509
-Klingons?
-At warp?

1053
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:28,969
No, Kirk.

1054
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:31,179
-We both know who it is.
-l don't think so.

1055
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,390
It's not coming at us from Kronos.

1056
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,688
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.

1057
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:41,064
Post six security officers on him.

1058
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,231
Yes, Captain.

1059
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,859
Captain on the bridge!

1060
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,235
ETA of the incoming ship.

1061
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:47,612
Three seconds, sir.

1062
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,574
-Shields.
-Aye, Captain.

1063
01:13:15,932 --> 01:13:16,975
They're hailing us, sir.

1064
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,728
On screen.

1065
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,980
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.

1066
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,403
Captain Kirk.

1067
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,490
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.

1068
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:35,202
That's a hell of a ship you got there.

1069
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,578
And I wasn't expecting to get word

1070
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,287
that you'd taken Harrison into custody

1071
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:40,039
in violation of your orders.

1072
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,542
Well, we...

1073
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:44,586
We had to improvise
when our warp core

1074
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,630
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1075
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:48,672
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1076
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,216
I don't take your meaning.

1077
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,885
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

1078
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,054
To assist with our repairs?

1079
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,389
Why else would the head of Starfleet

1080
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,390
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1081
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,394
Captain, they're scanning our ship.

1082
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,688
ls there something
I can help you find, sir?

1083
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:06,233
Where is your prisoner, Kirk?

1084
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:07,525
Per Starfleet regulation,

1085
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,822
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1086
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,573
Well, shooot.

1087
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,077
You talked to him.

1088
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,831
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1089
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,750
I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard up,

1090
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,211
believing that his superior intelligence

1091
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,213
could help us protect ourselves
from whatever came at us next.

1092
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,384
But I made a mistake.

1093
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,555
And now the blood
of everybody he's killed is on my hands.

1094
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,181
So I'm asking you,

1095
01:14:39,307 --> 01:14:41,059
give him to me

1096
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:44,229
so that I can end what I started.

1097
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,942
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1098
01:14:49,025 --> 01:14:50,902
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1099
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:56,032
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1100
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,658
Start a war in the process?

1101
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,578
He put those people in those torpedoes.

1102
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,288
And I simply didn't want to burden you

1103
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,541
with knowing what was inside of them.

1104
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,542
You saw what this man
can do all by himself.

1105
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,421
Can you imagine what would happen
if we woke up the rest of his crew?

1106
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,550
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1107
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,552
He's playing you, son,
don't you see that?

1108
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:20,265
Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.

1109
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,766
And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence

1110
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,270
before anybody else
dies because of him.

1111
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,192
Now, I'm going to ask you again!

1112
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,278
One last time, son.

1113
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,780
Lower your shields.

1114
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,949
Tell me where he is.

1115
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,787
He's in engineering, sir.

1116
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:46,875
But I'll have him moved

1117
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,960
to the transporter room right away.

1118
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,962
I'll take it from here.

1119
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:52,713
Do not drop those shields,

1120
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:53,797
-Mr. Sulu.
-Aye, Captain.

1121
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:54,882
Captain, given your awareness

1122
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:56,467
of Khan's true location in the med bay,

1123
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,220
may I know the details of your plan?

1124
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:01,180
I told Marcus we were
bringing a fugitive back to Earth.

1125
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,974
That's what we're going to do.

1126
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:04,643
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1127
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,394
Sir, if we go to warp,

1128
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,605
we run the risk of
seriously damaging the core!

1129
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,106
Can we do it?

1130
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:15,612
Technically, yes, but I
would not advise it, Captain.

1131
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,113
Noted.

1132
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:20,033
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.

1133
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,158
Yes, sir.

1134
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,703
Punch it.

1135
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,546
Well, at least we're moving again.

1136
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:39,010
If you think you're safe
at warp, you're wrong.

1137
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,515
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.

1138
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,100
Tell them we were pursued
into the Neutral Zone

1139
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,810
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1140
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:48,979
Comms are down, sir.

1141
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:52,564
Permission to come on the bridge.

1142
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:53,692
Dr. Marcus.

1143
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:55,734
He's gonna catch up with us,
and when he does,

1144
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,194
the only thing
that's gonna stop him destroying

1145
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,697
this ship is me,
so you have to let me talk to him.

1146
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,573
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.

1147
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:01,949
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship

1148
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:03,326
that has advanced warp capabilities...

1149
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,037
Captain! I'm getting
a reading I don't understand.

1150
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:36,984
Where are we?

1151
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,235
We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.

1152
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,320
-Damage report!
-Weapons are way down.

1153
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:40,779
-Shields are dropping.
-We're defenseless, sir.

1154
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:42,114
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1155
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,242
-Where's the damage?
-Major hull damage, Captain.

1156
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,167
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now!

1157
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:55,502
Captain! Stop!
Everybody on this ship is going to die

1158
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,796
if you don't let me speak to him.

1159
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,091
Uhura, hail him.

1160
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,095
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1161
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,399
What are you doing on that ship?

1162
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,275
I heard what you said.

1163
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:21,112
That you made a mistake

1164
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,614
and now you're doing
everything you can to fix it.

1165
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,117
But, Dad,

1166
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:33,207
I don't believe that
the man who raised me

1167
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:37,921
is capable of destroying a ship
full of innocent people.

1168
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,881
And, if I'm wrong about that,

1169
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,385
then you're gonna have to
do it with me on board.

1170
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,139
Actually, Carol, I won't.

1171
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,561
-Jim...
-Can we intercept the transport signal?

1172
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:55,688
No, sir.

1173
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:58,983
Carol!

1174
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,485
Captain Kirk, without authorization

1175
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:03,738
and in league with
the fugitive John Harrison,

1176
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,657
you went rogue in enemy territory,

1177
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:06,824
leaving me no choice

1178
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,827
but to hunt you down and destroy you.

1179
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,412
-Lock phasers.
-Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!

1180
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:12,579
I'll make this quick.

1181
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,957
Target all aft torpedoes
on the Enterprise bridge.

1182
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,502
Sir, my crew
was just following my orders.

1183
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,087
I take full responsibility for my actions.

1184
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:22,256
But they were mine
and they were mine alone.

1185
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,260
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,

1186
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,761
all that I ask is that you spare them.

1187
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,438
Please, sir.

1188
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,442
I'll do anything you want.

1189
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,694
Just let them live.

1190
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,614
That's a hell of an apology.

1191
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,951
But if it's any consolation,

1192
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:52,036
I was never going to spare your crew.

1193
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,457
Fire when...

1194
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:17,060
I'm sorry.

1195
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,569
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1196
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,904
Our shields are down!
We're losing power!

1197
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,239
Someone in engineering
just manually reset our systems!

1198
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:31,743
What do you mean, "someone"? Who?

1199
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:34,496
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.

1200
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,831
Enterprise! Can you hear me?

1201
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,041
Scotty!

1202
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,127
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.

1203
01:20:42,253 --> 01:20:44,130
-You're on that ship!
-l snuck on.

1204
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,672
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1205
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,341
against a Starfleet Admiral, I'd really like

1206
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,594
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1207
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:50,845
You're a miracle worker.

1208
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,764
We're a little low on power right now.

1209
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,890
Just stand by. Stand by.

1210
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,182
What do you mean, "low on power"?

1211
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:56,518
What happened to the Enterprise?

1212
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:58,520
Call you back.

1213
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:01,439
Scotty!

1214
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,109
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1215
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,944
Our options are limited, Captain.

1216
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,029
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.

1217
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,368
There is one option.

1218
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,286
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,

1219
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,204
-patch him through.
-Yes, sir.

1220
01:21:17,413 --> 01:21:18,581
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

1221
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,628
Captain, I strongly object.

1222
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:26,547
To what? I haven't said anything yet.

1223
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:28,216
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1224
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,801
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1225
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,469
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1226
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:32,636
it is optimal for you to take

1227
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,471
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1228
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,015
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1229
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:38,225
with advanced combat abilities

1230
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,144
and innate knowledge of that ship.

1231
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,396
This indicates that
you plan to align with Khan,

1232
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,399
the very man
we were sent here to destroy.

1233
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:46,234
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.

1234
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,319
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

1235
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,404
An Arabic proverb attributed
to a prince who was

1236
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,239
betrayed and decapitated
by his own subjects.

1237
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:54,492
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1238
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:56,828
-l will go with you, Captain.
-No, I need you on the bridge.

1239
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,662
I cannot allow you to do this.

1240
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,497
it is my function aboard
this ship to advise you

1241
01:22:00,623 --> 01:22:02,000
on making the wisest
decisions possible,

1242
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:03,167
something I firmly believe

1243
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,711
you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1244
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,253
You're right!

1245
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,340
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1246
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,010
it's not logical. it is a gut feeling.

1247
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,015
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

1248
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:21,394
I only know what I can do.

1249
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,604
The Enterprise and her crew
need someone

1250
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,481
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1251
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,445
And it's not me.

1252
01:22:34,365 --> 01:22:35,699
It's you, Spock.

1253
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,182
Tell me everything you know
about that ship.

1254
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,351
Dreadnought class.

1255
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:04,103
Two times the size,
three times the speed.

1256
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,023
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.

1257
01:23:07,106 --> 01:23:10,025
Unlike most Federation vessels,
it's built solely for combat.

1258
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:13,445
I will do everything I can

1259
01:23:14,113 --> 01:23:16,407
to make you answer for what you did.

1260
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:24,247
But right now I need your help.

1261
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,292
In exchange for what?

1262
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,962
You said you'd do anything
for your crew.

1263
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:34,257
-l can guarantee their safety.
-Captain.

1264
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:38,805
You can't even guarantee
the safety of your own crew.

1265
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:46,561
Bones, what are you doing
with that tribble?

1266
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:48,730
The tribble's dead.

1267
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:52,275
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into
the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.

1268
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,779
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I've ever seen,

1269
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:57,614
and I want to know why.

1270
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,997
You coming with me or not?

1271
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:09,252
You want to do what?

1272
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,752
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering

1273
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:12,671
the Enterprise
into position as we speak.

1274
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,215
To this ship? How?

1275
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,842
There's a cargo door,
hangar 7, access port 101A.

1276
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,011
You need to find
the manual override to open that airlock.

1277
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:21,972
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.

1278
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:23,975
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.

1279
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:25,518
it is not gonna be all right.

1280
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:27,395
You want me to open
an airlock into space,

1281
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,355
whereupon I will freeze,
die and explode!

1282
01:24:30,606 --> 01:24:32,065
Lieutenant,
from our current position, is it possible

1283
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,109
to establish contact with New Vulcan?

1284
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:37,279
-I'll do my best.
-Thank you.

1285
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,367
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1286
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,034
Their systems are still offline.

1287
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:44,953
I'm aligning our ship now.

1288
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:20,573
Scotty, how we doing over there?

1289
01:25:21,073 --> 01:25:23,074
Captain, I wish I had better news.

1290
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:25,828
They've locked out access
to the ship's computer.

1291
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:27,497
They'll have full weapons in

1292
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,039
three minutes.

1293
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:30,750
That means next time
I won't be able to stop them

1294
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:32,667
destroying the Enterprise. Stand by.

1295
01:25:34,378 --> 01:25:35,421
Commander, our trash exhaust
is aimed at

1296
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:37,756
access port 101A of the other ship.

1297
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,550
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1298
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:40,676
Copy that.

1299
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:43,887
-Scotty!
-I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute.

1300
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,520
I'm running. Stand by.

1301
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:01,863
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.

1302
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,867
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.

1303
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,078
It's four square meters, tops.

1304
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:09,162
It's gonna be like
jumping out of a moving car,

1305
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,164
off a bridge, into your shot glass.

1306
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,125
It's okay. I've done it before.

1307
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,127
Yeah, it was vertical.

1308
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:19,131
We jumped onto a... it was a...

1309
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:20,382
it doesn't matter. Scotty...

1310
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:21,676
Did you find the manual override?

1311
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,051
The manual override, Scotty.

1312
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,929
Not yet, not yet.

1313
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,229
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware there is

1314
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:35,105
a considerable debris field
between our ships.

1315
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,899
-Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
-It's not easy!

1316
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:40,735
Just give me two seconds,
all right, you mad bastard!

1317
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,247
Tell me this is gonna work.

1318
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,498
I have neither
the information

1319
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,417
nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.

1320
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:56,918
Okay, Captain, stand by.

1321
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:58,671
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1322
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,091
Come on, come on, come on.

1323
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:03,259
Yes!

1324
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:04,926
Okay, okay! I'm set to open the door.

1325
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,136
You ready?

1326
01:27:06,345 --> 01:27:07,680
Are you?

1327
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:12,268
Spock, pull the trigger.

1328
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,520
Yes, Captain.

1329
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:21,944
Launching activation sequence on

1330
01:27:22,194 --> 01:27:23,487
three,

1331
01:27:23,654 --> 01:27:24,822
two,

1332
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:26,489
one.

1333
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:39,377
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!

1334
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,463
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.

1335
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:42,547
Copy that.

1336
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:47,970
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!

1337
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:49,180
I know, I know! I can see that.

1338
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:01,359
Don't move.

1339
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,154
Use your display compass, Captain.

1340
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,279
You must correct precisely

1341
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,448
-37.243 degrees.
-Got it.

1342
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:09,699
I'm working my way back.

1343
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:14,454
Scotty, you're gonna be ready
with that door, right?

1344
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,123
What are you doing in here?

1345
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:21,212
Wee bit of maintenance
on the airlock console. You're big.

1346
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,671
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1347
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:24,131
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.

1348
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,132
I'm working on getting
his signal back. Stand by.

1349
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,680
-Damn it.
-Captain, what is it?

1350
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:31,764
My helmet was hit.

1351
01:28:31,847 --> 01:28:33,431
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.

1352
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:35,016
Not yet. I'm still working on a signal.

1353
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,644
His communicator is working.

1354
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,813
-l don't know why he isn't responding.
-What is that?

1355
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,439
Are you Starfleet or private security?

1356
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,481
Show me your other hand.

1357
01:28:41,565 --> 01:28:42,692
Because you look like private security.

1358
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:44,234
Imminent collision detected!

1359
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:45,403
Khan, use evasive action!

1360
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,570
-There is debris directly ahead.
-l see it.

1361
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:55,829
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1362
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,332
I don't know, Commander. I'm having
trouble tracking him in all this debris.

1363
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,417
Was Khan hit?

1364
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:01,793
We are trying to find him now.

1365
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,712
Captain, you need to adjust
your target destination

1366
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:06,131
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1367
01:29:17,476 --> 01:29:19,561
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.

1368
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:21,814
Captain, without your display compass,

1369
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,733
hitting your target destination
is mathematically impossible.

1370
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,234
Spock, if I get back,

1371
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,069
we really need to talk
about your bedside manner.

1372
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,279
Commander, he's not going to make it.

1373
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,494
My display is still functioning.

1374
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:38,247
I see you, Kirk,
you're 200 meters ahead of me

1375
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:39,539
at my one o'clock.

1376
01:29:39,623 --> 01:29:41,667
Come to your left
a few degrees and follow me.

1377
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:55,639
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.

1378
01:29:55,806 --> 01:29:58,266
Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty?

1379
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,685
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1380
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,561
-open the door in ten, nine...
-Scotty!

1381
01:30:01,645 --> 01:30:02,645
That person counting down,

1382
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,730
-what is that?
-...eight...

1383
01:30:03,814 --> 01:30:04,899
I think you're hearing things, mate.

1384
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:06,817
-...seven...
-Mr. Scott, where are you?

1385
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,987
-...six, five...
-1 ,800 meters. 1 ,600 meters.

1386
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:11,447
-Scotty, where are you?
-...three...

1387
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,323
-Do you copy, Scotty? Please!
-...two...

1388
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:14,617
-Sorry about this.
-About what?

1389
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:15,951
-Mr. Scott, open the door!
-Open the door!

1390
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:17,661
Mr. Scott, now!

1391
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:40,518
Welcome aboard.

1392
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:44,438
-It's good to see you, Scotty.
-Who is that?

1393
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:48,567
Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan.

1394
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:49,984
Hello.

1395
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:52,113
They'll know we're here.

1396
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,155
I know the best way to the bridge.

1397
01:30:57,993 --> 01:30:59,662
It's locked to stun.

1398
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:01,247
Theirs won't be.

1399
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:03,164
Try not to get shot.

1400
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:09,087
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1401
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:11,090
On screen, please.

1402
01:31:11,423 --> 01:31:12,591
Stand by.

1403
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:22,935
Mr. Spock.

1404
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:28,690
Admiral.

1405
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:32,778
I'll deal with you in a...

1406
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,783
I am ashamed to be your daughter.

1407
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:44,372
Sir, we just had
a hangar door open on deck 13.

1408
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,958
Khan.

1409
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,461
They're going to have
full power and we're walking?

1410
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:50,712
The turbolifts are easily tracked

1411
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:52,213
and Marcus would have us in a cage.

1412
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,550
This path runs adjacent
to the engine room.

1413
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,301
They know they
won't be able to use their weapons here

1414
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:57,636
without destabilizing the warp core,

1415
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,137
which gives us the advantage.

1416
01:31:59,221 --> 01:32:01,974
-Where'd you find this guy?
-It's a long story.

1417
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,309
I will be brief.

1418
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:07,645
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1419
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:13,319
As you know,

1420
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:15,738
I have made a vow
never to give you information

1421
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:18,740
that could potentially alter your destiny.

1422
01:32:19,658 --> 01:32:24,329
Your path is yours to walk,
and yours alone.

1423
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:30,002
That being said,

1424
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:35,341
Khan Noonien Singh is
the most dangerous adversary

1425
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:37,676
the Enterprise ever faced.

1426
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:41,221
He is brilliant, ruthless,

1427
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,932
and he will not hesitate to kill

1428
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:45,975
every single one of you.

1429
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,481
Did you defeat him?

1430
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:55,694
At great cost. Yes.

1431
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:58,697
How?

1432
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,865
I don't mean to tempt fate here,
but where is everybody?

1433
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:02,659
The ship is designed
to be flown by minimal crew,

1434
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:03,786
one, if necessary.

1435
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:05,119
One? I...

1436
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,726
-You all right?
-Yeah. Where's Khan?

1437
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,568
Lieutenant, I need you to
assemble all senior medical

1438
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,194
and engineering staff
in the weapons bay.

1439
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:40,154
All right.

1440
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:44,827
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently
activated a torpedo.

1441
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,161
Could you replicate the process?

1442
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,662
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1443
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,163
Can you or can you not?

1444
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:52,042
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,
not a torpedo technician!

1445
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:53,377
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1446
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,087
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1447
01:33:56,588 --> 01:33:57,922
Where is he?

1448
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,762
shooot!

1449
01:34:05,097 --> 01:34:07,056
This way.

1450
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,854
The minute we get
to the bridge, drop him.

1451
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:15,399
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.

1452
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,318
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.

1453
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:27,869
Power coming online, sir!

1454
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,163
-Retarget the Enterprise now.
-Aye, sir.

1455
01:34:44,511 --> 01:34:45,845
Make sure he stays down.

1456
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,265
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

1457
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:54,395
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.

1458
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:56,230
You're not actually
going to do this, are you?

1459
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,152
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1460
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:02,820
You better stop
and think about what you're doing, Kirk.

1461
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,989
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1462
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,701
You made an incursion
onto an enemy planet!

1463
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:09,953
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1464
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,332
Even if you got away without
a trace, war is coming.

1465
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:16,918
And who is going to lead us? You?

1466
01:35:17,252 --> 01:35:18,796
If I'm not in charge,

1467
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,590
our entire way of life is decimated!

1468
01:35:22,257 --> 01:35:24,760
So you want me off this ship,

1469
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:27,429
you better kill me.

1470
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:29,347
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1471
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:34,185
But I could stun your ass
and drag you out of that chair.

1472
01:35:34,436 --> 01:35:37,105
I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1473
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:42,860
-You all right?
-Yes, Captain.

1474
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:46,448
Jim!

1475
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,462
Listen! Wait!

1476
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,184
You...

1477
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:18,104
You should have let me sleep.

1478
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:24,403
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1479
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,072
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.

1480
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:30,868
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

1481
01:36:30,993 --> 01:36:33,578
-Captain.
-Your crew for my crew.

1482
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:34,912
You betrayed us.

1483
01:36:35,372 --> 01:36:37,166
You are smart, Mr. Spock.

1484
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,667
Spock don't...

1485
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:44,256
Mr. Spock, give me my crew.

1486
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:46,675
And what will you do
when you get them?

1487
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,261
Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.

1488
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,137
Which, as I understand it,
involves the mass genocide

1489
01:36:51,221 --> 01:36:54,265
of any being you find to be
less than superior.

1490
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,435
Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?

1491
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:59,438
Or will you give me what I want?

1492
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:03,859
We have no transporter capabilities.

1493
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,903
Fortunately mine are
perfectly functional.

1494
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:08,197
Drop your shields.

1495
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:10,239
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1496
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:12,033
that you will not destroy the Enterprise.

1497
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:14,619
Well, let's play this out
logically then, Mr. Spock.

1498
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:16,371
Firstly, I will kill your Captain

1499
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,081
to demonstrate my resolve.

1500
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:21,042
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice

1501
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:23,670
but to kill you and your entire crew.

1502
01:37:23,837 --> 01:37:25,506
If you destroy our ship,

1503
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,591
you will also destroy your own people.

1504
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:30,551
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive, mine does not.

1505
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,261
I will target your life support systems

1506
01:37:32,387 --> 01:37:34,555
located behind the aft nacelle.

1507
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,935
And after every single person
aboard your ship suffocates,

1508
01:37:38,101 --> 01:37:42,605
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1509
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,568
Now,

1510
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:49,320
shall we begin?

1511
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,659
Lower shields.

1512
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,541
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1513
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:11,260
I see your 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1514
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:13,970
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.

1515
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:16,430
Vulcans do not lie.

1516
01:38:17,307 --> 01:38:19,475
The torpedoes are yours.

1517
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,988
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1518
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,490
I have fulfilled your terms.

1519
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,201
Now fulfill mine.

1520
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:39,328
Well, Kirk,

1521
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:41,747
it seems apt to return you to your crew.

1522
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:44,167
After all,

1523
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:50,298
no ship should go down
without her captain.

1524
01:38:52,926 --> 01:38:54,344
He's locking phasers on us, sir!

1525
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,685
Let us out of here now!

1526
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:12,529
Shields at 6%!

1527
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:14,739
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?

1528
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:15,865
Twelve seconds, sir!

1529
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:17,033
Crew of the Enterprise,

1530
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:18,577
prepare for imminent
proximity detonation.

1531
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:20,871
What's he talking about?
What detonation?

1532
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:23,039
The torpedoes.
He armed the damn torpedoes!

1533
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:34,259
No!

1534
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:42,725
Sir, their weapons
have been knocked out.

1535
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,313
-Not bad, Commander.
-Thank you, Lieutenant.

1536
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:48,564
-Bones!
-Bones!

1537
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,775
-Nurse!
-l got you. I got you.

1538
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:52,985
Dr. Marcus.

1539
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:55,655
Good to see you, Jim.

1540
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,323
You helped Spock
detonate those torpedoes?

1541
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:58,408
Damn right I did.

1542
01:39:58,493 --> 01:39:59,993
He killed Khan's crew!

1543
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:01,662
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.

1544
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,081
I've got Khan's crew.

1545
01:40:04,247 --> 01:40:06,416
Seventy-two human popsicles

1546
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:09,086
safe and sound in their cryo tubes.

1547
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,046
Son of a bitch!

1548
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,595
Sir, the central power grid is failing!

1549
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:21,931
-Switch to auxiliary power.
-Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1550
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,440
Commander, our ship's
caught in Earth's gravity!

1551
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,944
-Can we stop?
-l can't do anything.

1552
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:44,954
Sorry! Oh, no.

1553
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,331
Clear the area!

1554
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,960
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.

1555
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,002
-Do you?
-Yeah.

1556
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:53,755
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.

1557
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:54,840
Aye, sir.

1558
01:40:56,007 --> 01:40:59,677
As acting Captain,
I order you to abandon this ship.

1559
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:02,889
I will remain behind and divert all power

1560
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:04,432
to life support
and evacuation shuttle bays.

1561
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:06,184
Evacuation protocols...

1562
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,811
I order you to abandon the ship!

1563
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:12,023
All due respect, Commander,
but we're not going anywhere.

1564
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:19,155
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!

1565
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,453
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!

1566
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:30,792
Attention, all decks.

1567
01:41:30,877 --> 01:41:32,377
Evacuation protocols initiated.

1568
01:41:33,503 --> 01:41:36,297
Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.

1569
01:41:36,506 --> 01:41:37,757
There won't be time for evacuation

1570
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:41,051
if we don't get power
to stabilize the damn ship!

1571
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,721
-Can we restore it?
-Only from engineering.

1572
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:46,349
We have to get back to the warp core.

1573
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:50,561
Jim?

1574
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:53,856
Scotty, we got to get
the power back on! Come on!

1575
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:13,042
-Scotty, we got to jump!
-What?

1576
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:14,543
Jump! Jump!

1577
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:16,337
Oh, God.

1578
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,548
Emergency power at 15% and dropping.

1579
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,051
Attention, all decks.

1580
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,595
Evacuation protocols initiated.

1581
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,181
Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.

1582
01:42:39,694 --> 01:42:41,238
-Jim?
-Hold on!

1583
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:42,780
I can't.

1584
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:02,842
I've got you, Captain!

1585
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,677
-Chekov.
-Don't let go!

1586
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:18,524
Even if we get the warp core online,
we've still got to redirect the power!

1587
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:20,193
-He's right, Captain!
-What are you talking about?

1588
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:22,362
Someone has to hit
the manual override.

1589
01:43:22,445 --> 01:43:23,697
Laddie, there's a switch...

1590
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,032
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!

1591
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:27,533
Let's go!

1592
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:31,496
Oh, no.

1593
01:43:42,841 --> 01:43:45,594
Evacuation protocols initiated.

1594
01:43:45,677 --> 01:43:48,387
Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.

1595
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,141
Mr. Sulu, divert
any remaining power to stabilizers.

1596
01:43:52,225 --> 01:43:54,060
Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can.

1597
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:13,454
Core misaligned. Danger.

1598
01:44:13,538 --> 01:44:15,206
-Oh, no, no, no, no!
-What?

1599
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:16,541
The housings are misaligned!

1600
01:44:16,626 --> 01:44:18,542
There's no way
we can redirect the power!

1601
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:21,630
The ship's dead, sir. She's gone.

1602
01:44:23,048 --> 01:44:24,966
-No, she's not.
-Wait, Jim!

1603
01:44:25,091 --> 01:44:27,594
If we go in there, we'll die!

1604
01:44:27,677 --> 01:44:29,679
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!

1605
01:44:29,971 --> 01:44:32,222
Will you listen to me?
What the hell are you doing?

1606
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:33,475
I'm opening the door. I'm going in.

1607
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:35,769
That door is there to stop us
from getting irradiated!

1608
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,145
We'd be dead
before we made the climb!

1609
01:44:40,565 --> 01:44:41,858
You're not making the climb.

1610
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:48,657
Danger. Core misaligned.

1611
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,759
If we don't get power
or shields back online,

1612
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:52,470
we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!

1613
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:00,287
Warp core is back online!

1614
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:01,997
Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu!

1615
01:47:07,128 --> 01:47:09,380
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!

1616
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:39,034
-Shields restored!
-Commander, power online.

1617
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:41,328
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1618
01:47:41,663 --> 01:47:43,497
It's a miracle.

1619
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:47,252
There are no such things.

1620
01:47:49,671 --> 01:47:51,088
Engineering to bridge.

1621
01:47:51,172 --> 01:47:52,422
-Mr. Spock!
-Mr. Scott.

1622
01:47:52,507 --> 01:47:55,426
Sir, you'd better get down here.

1623
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:56,845
Better hurry.

1624
01:48:19,534 --> 01:48:20,618
Open it.

1625
01:48:20,743 --> 01:48:22,494
The decontamination process
is not complete.

1626
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:23,746
You'd flood the whole compartment.

1627
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:25,914
The door's locked, sir.

1628
01:48:55,404 --> 01:48:56,445
How's our ship?

1629
01:48:58,239 --> 01:48:59,740
Out of danger.

1630
01:49:02,243 --> 01:49:04,453
You saved the crew.

1631
01:49:05,914 --> 01:49:08,750
You used what he wanted against him.

1632
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:14,546
That's a nice move.

1633
01:49:16,257 --> 01:49:18,259
it is what you would have done.

1634
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:21,261
And this,

1635
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:24,932
this is what you would have done.

1636
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:27,435
it was only logical.

1637
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:35,484
I'm scared, Spock.

1638
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:40,948
Help me not be.

1639
01:49:45,371 --> 01:49:47,704
How do you choose not to feel?

1640
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:56,130
I do not know.

1641
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,842
Right now I am failing.

1642
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:10,645
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1643
01:50:14,817 --> 01:50:16,567
Why I went back for you.

1644
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:20,904
Because you are my friend.

1645
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,324
Khan!

1646
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:51,244
God, that was close!

1647
01:51:54,582 --> 01:51:58,795
Set destination, Starfleet Headquarters!

1648
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:00,212
Engines compromised.

1649
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:02,340
Cannot guarantee destination.

1650
01:52:02,423 --> 01:52:03,800
Confirm order.

1651
01:52:04,176 --> 01:52:05,426
Confirm.

1652
01:53:09,824 --> 01:53:12,033
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.

1653
01:53:12,327 --> 01:53:14,203
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.

1654
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:16,663
He could.

1655
01:53:17,373 --> 01:53:18,498
Yes, sir.

1656
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,865
Whoa! He just jumped 30 meters!

1657
01:53:52,033 --> 01:53:53,158
Can we beam him up?

1658
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:54,284
There's too much damage.

1659
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:55,744
I have no incoming signal.

1660
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:58,747
But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1661
01:53:59,248 --> 01:54:00,500
Go get him.

1662
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:08,216
-Stand by for coordinates.
-Yes, sir.

1663
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:11,051
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1664
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:12,970
Coordinates confirmed.

1665
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,944
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1666
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:50,293
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.

1667
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,712
Keep him in an induced coma.

1668
01:56:51,796 --> 01:56:53,255
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1669
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,048
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1670
01:56:55,132 --> 01:56:56,966
How much of Khan's blood is left?

1671
01:56:57,094 --> 01:56:58,094
None.

1672
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:02,014
Enterprise to Spock. Spock!

1673
01:58:02,908 --> 01:58:05,077
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1674
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:08,538
McCoy to bridge.

1675
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:11,583
I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive.

1676
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:14,837
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1677
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:17,338
I think he can save Kirk.

1678
01:58:17,466 --> 01:58:18,673
Can we beam them up to the ship?

1679
01:58:18,759 --> 01:58:21,176
They keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1680
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:22,595
Can you beam someone down?

1681
01:58:57,546 --> 01:59:07,139
Spock!

1682
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,225
Spock, stop! Stop!

1683
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:12,060
He's our only chance to save Kirk!

1684
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:24,113
-What is it?
-It's a boy.

1685
01:59:24,448 --> 01:59:25,448
Let's call him Jim.

1686
01:59:25,574 --> 01:59:27,868
Your father was
captain of a starship for 12 minutes.

1687
01:59:27,953 --> 01:59:31,872
He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.

1688
01:59:41,048 --> 01:59:44,051
Don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1689
01:59:44,135 --> 01:59:46,720
it was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1690
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:47,887
You were out cold for two weeks.

1691
01:59:47,972 --> 01:59:48,972
Transfusion?

1692
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:51,809
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1693
01:59:52,601 --> 01:59:53,810
Khan?

1694
01:59:53,936 --> 01:59:55,104
Once we caught him,

1695
01:59:55,229 --> 01:59:57,856
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1696
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:00,484
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal?

1697
02:00:00,609 --> 02:00:02,110
Power mad? Despotic?

1698
02:00:02,319 --> 02:00:03,988
No more than usual.

1699
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:05,613
How'd you catch him?

1700
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,323
I didn't.

1701
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:17,792
You saved my life.

1702
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:20,462
Uhura and I had
something to do with it, too, you know.

1703
02:00:22,047 --> 02:00:24,300
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1704
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:26,135
Spock, just...

1705
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:29,137
Thank you.

1706
02:00:30,472 --> 02:00:32,640
You are welcome, Jim.

1707
02:00:43,485 --> 02:00:46,863
There will always be
those who mean to do us harm.

1708
02:00:48,824 --> 02:00:50,199
To stop them,

1709
02:00:50,827 --> 02:00:54,704
we risk awakening
the same evil within ourselves.

1710
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:03,296
Our first instinct is to seek revenge

1711
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:05,716
when those we love are taken from us.

1712
02:01:08,802 --> 02:01:10,554
But that's not who we are.

1713
02:01:12,097 --> 02:01:13,724
We are here today

1714
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:16,726
to rechristen the U.S.S. Enterprise,

1715
02:01:16,853 --> 02:01:19,688
and to honor those who lost their lives

1716
02:01:20,689 --> 02:01:22,358
nearly one year ago.

1717
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:24,984
When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship

1718
02:01:25,069 --> 02:01:27,529
he had me recite the Captain's Oath,

1719
02:01:28,405 --> 02:01:31,240
words I didn't appreciate at the time.

1720
02:01:31,909 --> 02:01:34,953
Now I see them as a call
for us to remember

1721
02:01:35,788 --> 02:01:37,622
who we once were,

1722
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:41,918
and who we must be again.

1723
02:01:43,212 --> 02:01:44,712
And those words?

1724
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,425
Space, the final frontier.

1725
02:01:48,885 --> 02:01:52,595
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

1726
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:55,306
Her five-year mission,

1727
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:57,266
to explore strange new worlds,

1728
02:01:57,935 --> 02:02:01,438
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

1729
02:02:02,106 --> 02:02:05,900
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

1730
02:02:08,904 --> 02:02:10,780
Captain on the bridge.

1731
02:02:13,909 --> 02:02:16,244
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1732
02:02:16,328 --> 02:02:17,829
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1733
02:02:17,913 --> 02:02:20,207
"Captain" does have a nice ring to it.

1734
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:21,750
Chair's all yours, sir.

1735
02:02:23,586 --> 02:02:25,087
Mr. Scott.

1736
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:26,212
How's our core?

1737
02:02:26,296 --> 02:02:27,922
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1738
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:30,300
She's ready for a long journey.

1739
02:02:30,385 --> 02:02:31,551
Excellent.

1740
02:02:31,677 --> 02:02:34,179
Come on, Bones! It's gonna be fun.

1741
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:38,684
Five years in space. God help me.

1742
02:02:38,935 --> 02:02:40,351
Dr. Marcus.

1743
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:43,604
I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1744
02:02:44,064 --> 02:02:45,858
It's nice to have a family.

1745
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:49,360
Spock.

1746
02:02:49,487 --> 02:02:50,654
Captain.

1747
02:02:53,615 --> 02:02:55,117
Where shall we go?

1748
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:59,621
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1749
02:03:01,623 --> 02:03:04,126
I defer to your good judgment, Captain.

1750
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:15,679
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1751
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:17,305
Aye, Captain.
