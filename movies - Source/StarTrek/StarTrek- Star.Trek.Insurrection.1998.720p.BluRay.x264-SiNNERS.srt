1
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:07,274
There he is! Let's get him.

2
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:19,352
Area 7 to Command. We could use another survey team out here.

3
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,274
Ensigns McCauley and Gilles,
assist edaphology team in area 7.

4
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,526
Acknowledged.

5
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:51,171
Admiral Dougherty is waiting
for this. Transmit it to the ship.

6
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,550
"Alert!"
Area 12!

7
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:05,769
- "The android is out of control."
- Report.

8
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:10,939
- "He's headed toward the village."
- Over there!

9
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,153
Magnify.

10
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,620
Hold your fire.

11
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,413
What is it?

12
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:35,211
Base to Commander Data.

13
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,091
Re-routing microhydraulic
power distribution.

14
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,303
- "Regulating thermal overload."
- Data, report immediately!

15
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:49,683
Transferring matrix functions.
Engaging secondary protocol.

16
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:52,269
He's trying to remove the headpiece.

17
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,439
All field units,
intercept the android.

18
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,863
Artim, it's all right.

19
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,161
Get inside.

20
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:29,427
Everyone get inside now.
Backto your homes.

21
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:35,141
- Secondary protocol is active.
- Stop him! Now!

22
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:51,197
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order! Stand down!

23
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:28,064
Who are they?.

24
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,045
It's an M-class planet.
Population 300 million.

25
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:57,591
- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-chin chef-faw.

26
00:06:57,798 --> 00:07:01,720
You either need a new uniform
or a new neck.

27
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:06,473
- My collar size hasn't changed.
- Of course not!

28
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:10,435
Our guests
are eating the floral arrangements.

29
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:15,439
- No cocktails before dinner?.
- My God! Are they vegetarian?

30
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,028
Does the chef have a dressing
that goes well with chrysanthemums?

31
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,911
Captain Picard, Command wants
to know our ETA at the Goren system?

32
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,706
- The Goren system?
- Some territorial dispute.

33
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:39,170
If we delay our trip to Hanoran Il,
it'll put us in the monsoon season.

34
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:41,213
Captain ...

35
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:46,884
- The diplomatic corps is busy.
- So we get to put out another fire.

36
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,557
Can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers?

37
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,518
Deck 10.

38
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,396
Remember, they're not
as advanced as we are.

39
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:04,735
- They've just achieved warp drive.
- Nowthey're a protectorate.

40
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:10,699
With the Borg and the Dominon,
we need all the allies we can get.

41
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,910
Captain on deck.

42
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,875
- Regent Cuzar like to dance.
- Can she mambo?

43
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:26,504
- Very funny.
- The Captain cuts quite a rug.

44
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:31,593
La Forge to Picard. I need to talk
to you before the reception.

45
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,471
Mr Worf!
What are you doing here?

46
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,557
Can it wait?

47
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:43,352
- Tell him to come up here.
- The Captain wants you to join us.

48
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:48,357
There's a communiquÃ© from
Admiral Dougherty about Data.

49
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:02,245
Regent Cuzar, welcome aboard.

50
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:08,042
Captain Picard, I welcome you
in the tradition of my people.

51
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:21,513
We are so honoured to be accepted
within the great Federation family.

52
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:25,224
- We have a dance later.
- I look forward to it.

53
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:36,275
- Counsellor ..?
- Nice bead work.

54
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:43,032
Captain, Admiral Dougherty is aboard
a Son'a ship in sector 4-4-1 .

55
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,202
He's requesting Data's schematics.
He doesn't say why.

56
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:51,956
Data was only scheduled to observe
the Ba'ku village for a week.

57
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:56,753
Geordi, set up a secure com-link
to the Admiral.

58
00:09:56,961 --> 00:10:01,798
Hars Adislo. We met at the
Nel Bato conference last year.

59
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:06,427
Did you read my paper
on thermionic transconductance?

60
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:09,264
Would you excuse me?

61
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:18,022
He's not acknowledging
any Starfleet protocol.

62
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,193
- What precipitated this behaviour?.
- "I don't know. Now he has hostages."

63
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,489
We could be there in two days.

64
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:32,451
That's not a good idea. Your ship
hasn't been fitted for this region.

65
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,121
- "There are environmental concerns."
- Such as?

66
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,918
We're studying various anomalies.
They call this area the Briar Patch.

67
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,671
We've had trouble
even getting a signal to you.

68
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,591
Just get me Data's schematics.
I'll keep you informed.

69
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:59,851
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.

70
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,480
Send the Admiral Data's schematics.

71
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,945
Report to the galley and tell
the chef to skip the fish course.

72
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,530
I'd like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows.

73
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,784
I'm going to ask Worf
to delay his return to DS9.

74
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:22,496
Sector 4-4-1 is on our way
to the Goren system.

75
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:27,168
- They are in opposite directions.
- Are they?.

76
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:50,188
I should never have let you
talk me into that duck blind.

77
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:55,025
Federation procedures have made this
more difficult than it needed to be.

78
00:11:55,235 --> 00:12:00,990
We have to protect the planet's
population from unnecessary risk.

79
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:05,326
Planet's population?
600 people!

80
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:11,332
If you want to avoid unnecessary
risks, leave your android at home.

81
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:16,712
- "We are approaching the planet."
- Take us into a high orbit.

82
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:21,509
Lie down, the girls
will take 20 years off your face.

83
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:26,388
- Another time, perhaps.
- Your self-restraint puzzles me.

84
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:31,308
You deny yourself every benefit
this mission has to offer.

85
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:36,563
Such benefits are to be shared with
"all"the people of the Federation.

86
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:46,655
- Report!
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.

87
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:52,870
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes.

88
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:00,085
- The vessel has broken off pursuit.
- Visual contact.

89
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,673
That's our ship.

90
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,403
We're about to lose communications
with Starfleet.

91
00:13:30,654 --> 00:13:34,575
I have all the files on the
duck-blind mission and the Son'a.

92
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:38,912
You have two days to become experts.

93
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:43,790
Mr Worf, we need a plan
to safely capture Data.

94
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,337
La Forge has modified this tricorder
with one of Data's actuation servos.

95
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:53,759
Its range is only four metres,
but it will shut him down.

96
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,971
Good to have you back.

97
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,974
Take us in.

98
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:20,323
Half a century ago,
they conquered two primitive races -

99
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:24,286
- and integrated them into
their culture as a labour class.

100
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:34,003
The Son'a have produced quantities
of the narcotic ketracel-white.

101
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:40,926
Their ships are rumoured to be
equipped with outlawed weapons.

102
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:45,429
- Why are we involved with them?
- Good question.

103
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:50,684
You haven't done that in a while.

104
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:53,562
- What you're doing to my neck.
- What?

105
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:04,030
Bridge to Commander Worf.

106
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:07,325
- "Worf!"
- Captain.

107
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:12,580
How are things on DS9? Don't
officers report for duty on time?

108
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:23,380
- "Sorry, sir. I'm on my way."
- We'll skip the court martial.

109
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:29,302
When was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors?

110
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,932
- Two months ago.
- They don't sound right.

111
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,812
They are out of alignment
by 12 microns. You could hear that?

112
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,232
When I was an ensign, I could
detect a 3-micron misalignment.

113
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:48,153
The Son'a ship with Adm. Dougherty
has entered tracking range.

114
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:53,533
Straighten your baldric.
On screen.

115
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:57,203
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

116
00:15:57,412 --> 00:16:00,831
This is important to the Enterprise.

117
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,211
Data attacked us in the mission
scout ship, yesterday.

118
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,466
Ru'afo and I have decided
to send in an assault team.

119
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:14,427
Worf and I are working out
a tactical plan ...

120
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:21,433
Your android damaged my ship.
He must be destroyed.

121
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:28,440
I know what Data means to Starfleet,
but our crew are in danger.

122
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:34,486
If our attempt to capture Data
fails, I will terminate him.

123
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:39,450
I should be the one to do it.
I'm his captain and his friend.

124
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:47,749
All right, you have 12 hours, then
I want you out of the Briar Patch.

125
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:53,004
We'll head out to the perimeter
to call for Son'a reinforcements.

126
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,088
Understood.

127
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:58,134
Good luck. Dougherty out.

128
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:14,856
- We're not picking up any ships.
- Try a wide-band covariant signal.

129
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,817
The rings are masking his approach.

130
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:23,323
The metaphasic radiation from the
rings is in a state of extreme flux.

131
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:30,413
Come out, come out
wherever you are ...

132
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:34,959
- Sir?.
- That's something my mother ...

133
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,753
Hold on.

134
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:50,472
Open all hailing frequencies.
Data, this is Captain Picard.

135
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,392
Please respond.

136
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:02,442
If we fire tachyon bursts,
he'll have to reset his shields.

137
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,695
- Then we can beam him out.
- Make it so.

138
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,953
- Direct hit. His shields are down.
- Beam him out.

139
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:25,546
- He's using a transport inhibitor.
- Prepare to enter the atmosphere.

140
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,798
That will shake him.

141
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:39,642
- Scanners are off-line.
- Start evasive manoeuvres.

142
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:07,166
He can fly a ship and anticipate our
tactics. His brain is functioning.

143
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:12,462
We know how he responds to threats.
I wonder how he would respond ...

144
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:17,343
Do you know Gilbert & Sullivan?

145
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,346
No, I've not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members.

146
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:29,186
They're composers,
from the 19th century.

147
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:37,736
Data was rehearsing "HMS Pinafore"
just before he left.

148
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:43,950
A Brltish tar is a soaring soul
as free as a mountain bird

149
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,163
his fist should be ready to resist
a dictatorial word

150
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,374
Sing, Worf.

151
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:54,125
- "his nose should pant"
- "and his lips should curl"

152
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:57,628
- "his cheeks should flame"
- "and his brow should furl"

153
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:00,882
- "his bosom should heave"
- "and his hea"rt "should glow"

154
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,885
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

155
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:08,806
his nose should pant
and his lips should curl

156
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:11,182
his cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl

157
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,727
his bosom should heave
"and his heart "should glow"

158
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:17,355
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

159
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,691
Prepare the docking clamps.

160
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,609
his eyes should flash
wlth an inborn fire

161
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:25,695
his brow wlth scorn be wrung

162
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:28,907
he never should bow down
to a domineering frown

163
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:32,243
or the tang of a tyrant tongue

164
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:35,872
- "his hea"rt "should stamp"
- "and his throat should growl"

165
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,041
- "his hair should curl"
- "and his face should scowl"

166
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,461
- "his eyes should flash"
- "and his breast protrude"

167
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,839
and this should be
his customary attltude

168
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:50,676
his foot should stamp
and his voice should drop

169
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,971
his hair should curl
and his face ...

170
00:20:55,973 --> 00:21:00,769
If we do not release him,
he may destroy both vessels.

171
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:03,897
I'm not letting go of him.

172
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:13,114
- We must stabilise.
- All power to inertial dampers.

173
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:17,910
- The auto-sequencer is damaged.
- Transfer control to manual.

174
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,295
Auto-sequencer realigned.
Engaging stabilisers.

175
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:31,673
- Damping field established.
- M"ax"imum power.

176
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:44,433
Now, Mr Worf.

177
00:21:57,695 --> 00:22:01,365
Commander Data is safely in custody.

178
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:40,192
- Captain, Subahdar Gallatin.
- Lt. Curtis, Doughertys attachÃ©.

179
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:45,114
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.

180
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:50,285
They have incredible
mental discipline and perception.

181
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:53,788
- My name is Sojef.
- Jean-Luc Picard.

182
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,583
Dr Crusher and Counsellor Troi.

183
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:02,046
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we're here to rescue them.

184
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:07,968
As you wish. I would ask you
to disarm yourselves.

185
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:11,680
This village is a sanctuary of life.

186
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,268
Prepare the hostages for transport.

187
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:22,772
They should be quarantined before
joining the ship's population.

188
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:28,903
We believed they were being held
against their will.

189
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:33,825
It's not our custom
to hold anyone against their will.

190
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:39,997
The android told us they were our
enemies, and that more would follow.

191
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:42,540
Are you our enemy?.

192
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:48,421
Non-interference in other cultures
is my people's prime directive.

193
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,759
Your directive apparently doesn't
include spying on other cultures.

194
00:23:55,427 --> 00:24:00,097
The android is a member of my crew.
Apparently, he was taken ill.

195
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:05,144
We were unable to repair the phase
variance in his positronic matrix.

196
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:10,732
The captain finds it hard to believe
we possess such technical skills.

197
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:16,279
Not applying our technological
abilities is a matter of choice.

198
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:21,660
Creating a machine to do man's work
takes something away from man.

199
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:25,913
At one time, we explored the galaxy,
just as you do.

200
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:30,417
- You have warp capability?.
- Capability, yes.

201
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:34,462
But where can warp drive take us
except away from here?

202
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:48,057
I apologise for our intrusion.

203
00:24:56,775 --> 00:25:01,487
Because they have warp capability,
the consequences will be minimal.

204
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:06,659
Terrific job. Now pack your bags
and get the hell out of there.

205
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:12,329
- "How's Data?"
- La Forge is doing the diagnostic.

206
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:19,836
Rendezvous wlth us to transfer
crew and equipment on your way out.

207
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:27,134
- You're not finished here?
- "Just a few loose ends to tie up."

208
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:56,578
Come in.

209
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:03,667
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure.

210
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:09,423
- I need a little counselling.
- That's a first.

211
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:12,718
Do I lie down, or what?

212
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:18,640
Whatever makes you comfortable,
but it isn't a therapeutic posture.

213
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:23,060
- But it is comfortable.
- Why don't you try sitting up?

214
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,480
Why don't you try lying down?

215
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:32,318
You're in quite a mood today. Did
you just come down here to play?.

216
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:35,655
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.
- I believe you.

217
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:38,950
- I'm not sleeping well.
- Dr Crusher can help.

218
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,746
What I need
I can't get from Dr Crusher.

219
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:48,666
Can two people go back in time
and fix a mistake they've made?

220
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,378
On this ship, anything's possible.

221
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:57,550
Yuk!

222
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:04,222
- I never kissed you with a beard.
- I kiss you, and you say 'yuk'!

223
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:13,940
I reconstructed Data's neural net
and replaced these memory engrams.

224
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:20,070
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.

225
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:26,993
- He malfunctioned after they fired?
- I believe so.

226
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:35,167
- Why would they fire on him first?
- A shot caused him to malfunction.

227
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:38,587
His ethical subroutines
then took over.

228
00:27:38,796 --> 00:27:42,883
So he still knewthe difference
between right and wrong.

229
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:47,261
The system prevents anyone from
taking advantage of his memory loss.

230
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:51,432
Yet he attacked us
and told the Ba'ku we were a threat.

231
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:56,561
- Are the implants bothering you?
- No, I'm just tired.

232
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:10,407
- Geordi? Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.

233
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:16,204
I seem to be missing
several memory engrams.

234
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:19,040
There they are.

235
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:26,172
What's the last thing you remember?.

236
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:31,594
- "His nose should pant..."
- From the mission.

237
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:36,015
I was gathering
phsyiometric data on the Ba'ku.

238
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:39,101
Some children walked into the hills.

239
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:51,319
Artim, where were you
the day the android appeared to us?

240
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:55,949
- In the hills by the dam.
- Can you show us?

241
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:17,885
There is no reason to fear me. I am
operating within normal parameters.

242
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:21,388
They fixed me.

243
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:28,770
- The boy is afraid of me.
- It's nothing personal.

244
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:35,652
- These people rejected technology.
- I am technology personified.

245
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,948
That young man has never seen
a machine that walks and talks.

246
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,374
Bridge to Riker.

247
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:56,086
- Can I get backto you, Worf?
- "It's Admiral Dougherty."

248
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,589
Patch him through.
Yes, Admiral?

249
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,553
- Why haven't you left orbit?
- "Picard is still on the surface."

250
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,390
He wants an explanation
as to why Data malfunctioned.

251
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,726
His future at Starfleet
depends on it.

252
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,857
Remind the Captain
his 12 hours are up. Dougherty out.

253
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:26,155
Your body is producing
far too many toxins.

254
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:30,492
We've reached the limit
of genetic manipulation.

255
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,663
I won't need any more
genetic manipulation -

256
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:39,875
- if our Federation friends will
allow us to complete this mission.

257
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:52,512
Tricorder functions are limited due
to kelbonite deposits in the area.

258
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:57,142
How about a passive radiation scan?

259
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:04,565
There appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake.

260
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:24,208
Can he breathe underwater?.

261
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,045
Data doesn't breathe.

262
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:33,174
- Won't he rust?
- No.

263
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,698
Captain!

264
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:03,160
I believe I know what is causing
the neutrino emissions.

265
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,448
The vessel
is clearly Federation in origin.

266
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:49,285
"Just a few loose ends
to tie up!"

267
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:54,123
- We're not interested in this.
- I am.

268
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,461
- It would be wiser ...
- I'm going with you.

269
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:53,884
It is a holographic projection.

270
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:59,682
Incomplete, I might add.

271
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:04,644
This is a computer-driven image
created by photons and forcefields.

272
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:08,273
I know what a hologram is.

273
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:12,485
Why would anyone want
to create one of our village?

274
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:17,114
If you were following the children
and discovered this ship ...

275
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,202
I may have been shot to protect
the secret of its existence.

276
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:27,791
Why would they duplicate this
village except to deceive the Ba'ku?

277
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:31,835
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.

278
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:34,922
You'd fall asleep in your village -

279
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,009
- and wake up
on this flying holodeck.

280
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:42,804
Transported en masse,
and in a few days -

281
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:47,641
- relocated on a similar planet
without ever realising it.

282
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:52,480
Why would the Federation
wish to move the Ba'ku?

283
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:56,358
I don't know.

284
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:35,726
Computer, end program.
De-cloakthe vessel.

285
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,731
Help!

286
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:43,443
I can't swim.

287
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:52,367
Don't panic.

288
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:57,038
I've been shot at on a ship
that has come to abduct us.

289
00:35:57,246 --> 00:36:00,750
What's there to panic about?

290
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:06,088
For water landings, I am designed
to serve as a flotation device.

291
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:15,889
Did the hostages mention
anything about a cloaked ship?

292
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:18,932
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.

293
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:24,730
- Have you been in a fight?
- No, it is a gorch.

294
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:29,400
A pimple, sir.

295
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:35,989
Well... it's hardly noticeable.

296
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:54,215
Smooth as an android's bottom.

297
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:58,594
- Dougherty noticed we haven't left.
- We're not going anywhere.

298
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,722
Deck 5.

299
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:08,603
Klingons never do anything small.

300
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:13,940
- Dr Crusher asked to speakto you.
- Picard to Crusher.

301
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:19,362
The Son'a hostages
declined to be examined.

302
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,655
- And our people?
- They're fine.

303
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:28,246
In fact they're better than fine.
Improved muscle tone, high energy.

304
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,081
Very well, Doctor.

305
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:36,420
Don't release the Son'a officers
until I've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.

306
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:40,547
Commander, may I ..?

307
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:49,347
Computer, music.

308
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:53,059
- Not that, something Latin.
- "Specify."

309
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:56,103
The mambo.

310
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:01,733
That's more like it.

311
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:26,172
How old are you?

312
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:31,052
Our solar system was on the verge
of self-annihilation.

313
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,722
Technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life.

314
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:39,851
A small group of us
set off to find a new home.

315
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:45,606
A home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds.

316
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:51,862
- That was 309 years ago.
- And you haven't aged since then.

317
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,742
I was a lot older when we arrived,
in terms of my physical condition.

318
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:01,079
There's a metaphasic radiation
coming from the planet's rings.

319
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,833
It regenerates
our genetic structure.

320
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:10,505
- You must have noticed the effects.
- We've just begun to.

321
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:15,425
- I suppose you're 75.
- No, I'm 12.

322
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:21,264
The radiation won't affect him
until he reaches maturity.

323
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:27,936
What you have here is more valuable
than gold-pressed latinum.

324
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:33,608
That's the reason someone may be
trying to take your world from you.

325
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:36,903
The android was right.

326
00:39:37,112 --> 00:39:42,534
If it wasn't for Data, it's probable
that you would be relocated by now.

327
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:47,371
The moment we pick up a weapon
we become one of them.

328
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,208
- We lose everything we are.
- It may not come to that.

329
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:56,295
The architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret.

330
00:39:56,505 --> 00:40:00,967
Not only from you,
but from my people, as well.

331
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:06,429
I don't intend to let them.

332
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:17,190
We've always known that to survive
we had to remain apart.

333
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:22,445
Many of the young people want
to know more about the offland.

334
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:27,782
They're attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life.

335
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:34,039
Most of my people would
sell their souls to slow life down.

336
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:37,291
But not you?

337
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,878
There are days.

338
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:45,882
You don't live up to your reputation
as an offlander.

339
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:51,471
In defence of offlanders,
there are many more people like me.

340
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:57,393
Who wouldn't be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth?

341
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:05,775
You give me more credit than
I deserve. Of course I'm tempted.

342
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:10,153
But some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world -

343
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:17,452
- involve the forced relocation
of one people to satisfy another.

344
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:22,873
I had hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes, -

345
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:27,836
- but it seems
that some of us haven't.

346
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:41,307
- Extraordinary craftsmanship.
- It's the work of students.

347
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,978
They're almost ready
to become apprentices.

348
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:51,192
In 30 or 40 years
some of them will become artisans.

349
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,945
Apprenticing for 30 years ...

350
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,159
Did your people's mental discipline
develop here?

351
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:05,996
More questions.
Always the explorer.

352
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:12,376
- If you stay, that will change.
- Will it?

353
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:18,882
You stop reviewing the past,
stop planning for tomorrow.

354
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,012
Let me ask you a question:

355
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:29,393
Have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time?

356
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:34,773
When time seemed to stop, and you
could almost live in that moment?

357
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:44,155
Seeing my home planet from space,
for the first time.

358
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:47,534
Yes, exactly.

359
00:42:47,742 --> 00:42:51,371
Nothing more complicated
than perception.

360
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:57,335
You explore the universe.

361
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:04,675
We discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself.

362
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:08,344
Full of powerful forces.

363
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:13,807
Most people aren't aware enough
of the "now"to even notice.

364
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:18,686
I wish I could spare
a few centuries to learn.

365
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:24,108
It took us centuries to learn that
it doesn't have to take that long.

366
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:27,612
There's one thing
I don't understand.

367
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,490
In 300 years,
you never learned to swim?

368
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:36,244
I haven't got around to it yet.

369
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:47,505
I wonder if you're aware
of the trust you engender.

370
00:43:47,713 --> 00:43:51,842
- It's unusual ...
- For an offlander?.

371
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,804
For someone so young.

372
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:34,713
- Geordi?
- Captain.

373
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,717
There wasn't anything wrong
with my implants.

374
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:43,431
There was something right
with my eyes.

375
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:53,315
Dr Crusher found that the cells
around my optic nerve had ...

376
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:58,152
... started to regenerate.

377
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:05,284
It may not last.
And if it doesn't ...

378
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:09,954
... I just wanted, before we go ...

379
00:45:10,163 --> 00:45:13,833
You know, I've never seen a sunrise.

380
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:18,628
At least not the way you see them.

381
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:49,489
Come.

382
00:45:51,784 --> 00:45:56,538
Am I to understand
that you're not releasing my men?

383
00:45:56,746 --> 00:46:00,583
We found the holoship.

384
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:05,420
- Let the captain and me ...
- No!

385
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,766
This entire mission has been one
Federation blunder after another.

386
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:25,398
Return my men, or this alliance will
end with your ship's destruction.

387
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:38,992
You're looking well, Jean-Luc.
Rested.

388
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:43,873
I won't let you move them. I will
take this to the Federation Council.

389
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:47,208
I'm acting on their orders.

390
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:50,336
To abandon our prime directive?

391
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:56,509
These people are not indigenous.
They're not meant to be immortal.

392
00:46:56,717 --> 00:47:00,762
We'll be restoring them
to their natural evolution.

393
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:05,224
Who the hell are we to determine
the course of evolution?

394
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,936
There are 600 people there.

395
00:47:08,144 --> 00:47:13,733
The regenerative properties of
this radiation could help billions.

396
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:19,280
The Son'a can collect metaphasic
particles from the planet's rings.

397
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:25,327
- The planet is in Federation space.
- Our planet, their technology.

398
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:30,914
A technology we can't duplicate.
You know what that makes us?

399
00:47:31,123 --> 00:47:39,088
- Partners.
- Our partners are petty thugs.

400
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:43,719
On Earth, petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders.

401
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:51,476
Warp drive created a Romulan empire.
We can handle the Son'a.

402
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:55,436
We probably said the same
about the Romulans.

403
00:47:55,646 --> 00:48:02,235
Lifespans will be doubled. An entire
new medical science will evolve.

404
00:48:02,443 --> 00:48:06,572
Your chief engineer has the use
of his eyes for the first time.

405
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,824
Will you take that away from him?

406
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:14,163
With the whole Briar Patch, why
does it have to be this one planet?

407
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:18,791
The concentration in the rings
makes it work.

408
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,253
They'll inject something into
the rings and start a reaction.

409
00:48:23,463 --> 00:48:31,010
- The planet will be uninhabitable.
- Delay them, let us study it.

410
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:36,224
Our best scientific minds
can't find any other way to do this.

411
00:48:36,432 --> 00:48:40,478
The Son'a can establish a separate
colony on the planet until we do.

412
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:45,106
It would take ten years' exposure
to reverse their condition.

413
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:48,818
Some of them
won't survive that long.

414
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:53,322
Besides, who would want to live
in the Briar Patch?

415
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:56,867
The Ba'ku.

416
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:05,000
We are betraying the principles upon
which the Federation was founded.

417
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:09,503
It's an attack upon its very soul.

418
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:21,514
And it will destroy the Ba'ku.

419
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:29,856
Cultures have been destroyed in
every forced relocation in history.

420
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:34,735
Jean-Luc,
we're only moving 600 people.

421
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:40,990
How many people does it take
before it becomes wrong?

422
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:45,704
1,000?
50,000?

423
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:50,123
A million?
How many people does it take?

424
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:56,630
You'll proceed to the Goren system,
and release the Son'a officers.

425
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,510
File whatever protests you wish to.

426
00:50:04,012 --> 00:50:08,557
By the time you do,
this will all be done.

427
00:50:57,976 --> 00:51:00,480
Gallatin!

428
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:07,568
The righteous Starfleet captain
finally released you.

429
00:51:07,777 --> 00:51:11,405
- Any problems on the surface?
- No, sir.

430
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:17,244
But it wasn't easy being among them.

431
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:20,998
Just don't forget
what they did to us.

432
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,753
We'll have them rounded up
in a day or two.

433
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:30,632
We needn't bother
with a holoship anymore.

434
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,219
Get the holding cells ready.

435
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:39,849
I'm going to miss these little
flesh-stretching sessions of ours.

436
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,289
Re-routing the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise.

437
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:11,835
However, the transporter
is rarely used after 02:00 hours.

438
00:52:12,043 --> 00:52:16,547
- Going out for a spin?
- Seven tons of explosives.

439
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:20,802
Tetryon pulse launchers
and isomagnetic disintegrators.

440
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:25,597
- A hunting trip?
- Return to your quarters.

441
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:30,728
- That's an order.
- No uniform, no orders.

442
00:52:30,936 --> 00:52:35,815
How can I look at a sunrise, knowing
what my sight cost these people?

443
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:42,947
Exposure could stimulate rebellious
instincts common to youth -

444
00:52:43,155 --> 00:52:47,242
- which would affect everyone's
judgement ... except mine.

445
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:51,246
What do you think we should do?

446
00:52:51,454 --> 00:52:56,333
Saddle up.
Lock and load.

447
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:04,342
They won't begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited.

448
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,469
Our job is to keep
the planet inhabited.

449
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,516
We'll show what's happening here.
Make the Council "see" the Ba'ku.

450
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:19,188
Then it won't be so easy to
turn a blind eye to their suffering.

451
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:25,652
- I'll be back before you know it.
- We'll hold out as long as we can.

452
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:50,507
The injector performs perfectly
in every simulation.

453
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:55,762
The Enterprise left orbit, but a
support craft is on the surface.

454
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:59,557
It's the Captain's yacht.
Five persons on board.

455
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:04,313
We're not waiting. Get everyone
off the surface tonight.

456
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,358
Gallatin.

457
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:14,447
If Picard or any of his people
interfere ... eliminate them.

458
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:24,623
We're leaving the village.
Take only what you need.

459
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:30,001
Bring food.
We may not be back for days.

460
00:54:41,804 --> 00:54:44,389
It's a transport inhibitor.

461
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:49,103
It will prevent anyone
being beamed off the surface.

462
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:54,065
Kelbonite in the hills will
interfere with their transporters.

463
00:54:54,273 --> 00:55:00,362
Where there aren't any deposits
we'll use transport inhibitors.

464
00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:03,449
The mountains are full of kelbonite.

465
00:55:03,657 --> 00:55:07,286
- Transport will be difficult there.
- There are caves in the mountains.

466
00:55:07,494 --> 00:55:13,833
Good, but they're not going
to make it easy for us to get there.

467
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:19,880
Captain, we activated the transport
inhibitors around the village.

468
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:26,137
Move these people out!

469
00:55:31,182 --> 00:55:36,103
- The transporters won't function.
- They're using inhibitors.

470
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:39,523
Locate and destroy them.

471
00:55:50,824 --> 00:55:54,954
You're carrying too much.
We have a long climb ahead of us.

472
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,717
Three transport inhibitors down.
There's a gap in the field.

473
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:49,170
Father!

474
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:03,974
Kelbonite deposits
are blocking our transporters.

475
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:07,436
- Recommendations?
- Let me talkto Picard.

476
00:57:07,644 --> 00:57:11,565
Talk! We should send down
an assault team.

477
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:16,735
If people get hurt, all the support
we have in the Federation ...

478
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:22,367
Federation support, Federation
procedures, Federation rules.

479
00:57:22,574 --> 00:57:26,954
Look in the mirror,
the Federation is old.

480
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:31,666
In the past 24 months, they've been
challenged by every major power.

481
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,753
The Borg, the Cardassians,
the Dominion.

482
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,755
They all smell the scent of death
on the Federation.

483
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:43,885
You embraced our offer
to give the Federation new life.

484
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:49,932
How badly do you want it?
There are hard choices to be made.

485
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:57,315
If news gets through of your
captain's brave struggle, -

486
00:57:57,523 --> 00:58:03,862
- Federation politicians will waver.
There will be a public debate.

487
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:09,492
Federation allies will want
their say ... Need I go on?

488
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:14,746
Isolinear tags would allow
our transporters to lock onto them.

489
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:19,043
We'd have to tag every one of them.
We don't have the time.

490
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:23,588
In 19 hours the Enterprise will
be able to contact the Federation.

491
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:28,467
- I'll order Riker to turn around.
- Picard's first officer.

492
00:58:28,677 --> 00:58:32,304
Do you really believe he'll listen?

493
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:37,601
My ships
could intercept the Enterprise.

494
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,978
I could send them to ...

495
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:44,523
... escort it back.

496
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:49,403
But Commander Riker
might not want to come.

497
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:54,074
Send your ships.

498
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:22,891
- Do you like being a machine?
- I aspire to be more than I am.

499
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:30,606
I know why. So people like us
won't be afraid of you anymore.

500
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:33,860
Don't you ever get tired?

501
00:59:34,068 --> 00:59:38,280
My power cells
continually recharge themselves.

502
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:43,577
I can't imagine
what it's like to be a machine.

503
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:49,333
I have often tried to imagine
what it is like to be a child.

504
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:53,753
Really?. For one thing, your legs
are shorter than everyone else's.

505
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:57,548
But they are in
a constant state of growth.

506
00:59:57,757 --> 01:00:00,760
- Is it difficult to adapt?
- Adapt?

507
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:05,764
A child's specifications change
from one moment to the next.

508
01:00:05,972 --> 01:00:11,353
- Do you trip over your own feet?
- Sometimes.

509
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:16,273
My legs are exactly
87.2 cm in length.

510
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:20,277
They were 87.2 cm
the day I was created.

511
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:24,030
They will be 87.2 cm
the day I go off-line.

512
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,867
I depend on specifications
that do not change.

513
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:34,581
I will never experience growing up
or tripping over my own feet.

514
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:41,463
But you've never had adults
telling you what to do all the time.

515
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:49,012
I'd accept that in exchange for
knowing what childhood is like.

516
01:00:49,219 --> 01:00:53,266
- Do machines ever play?.
- I play the violin.

517
01:00:53,474 --> 01:00:58,853
- My chess is quite advanced.
- No, I mean play for fun.

518
01:01:00,438 --> 01:01:04,233
Androids do not have fun.

519
01:01:04,442 --> 01:01:10,030
If you want to know what it's like
to be a child, learn to play.

520
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:28,005
- Captain.
- Worf, you need a haircut.

521
01:01:28,213 --> 01:01:33,427
Rapid hair growth is experienced
by Klingons during Jaktahla.

522
01:01:33,635 --> 01:01:38,974
Puberty. Although for a Klingon
that scarcely does it justice.

523
01:01:39,181 --> 01:01:44,561
Any mood swings or aggressive
tendencies, you let me know at once.

524
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:48,148
Yes, sir.
The Ba'ku need some rest.

525
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:52,693
According to the geo-scan,
this is a safe area.

526
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:55,947
Very well, break out some rations.

527
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:05,079
The caves are just over that ridge.
We can hide there.

528
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:09,083
The Son'a will knowthat
as well as we do.

529
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:19,217
It's been 300 years
since I've seen a bald man.

530
01:02:22,137 --> 01:02:25,389
Why did you never marry?.

531
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,393
Don't tell me it's because
you haven't got around to it yet.

532
01:02:29,603 --> 01:02:32,521
What's the rush?

533
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:37,318
I should warn you, I've always
been attracted to older women.

534
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:03,215
How are you doing this?

535
01:03:03,425 --> 01:03:06,260
No more questions.

536
01:03:20,815 --> 01:03:24,652
- Two Son'a ships approaching.
- ETA?

537
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:28,405
- 18 minutes.
- We can't transmit for one hour.

538
01:03:28,614 --> 01:03:33,661
- They're hailing us.
- Tell them our receiver is down.

539
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:37,748
- I don't thinkthey believe us.
- Why not?

540
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:43,835
Photon torpedo.
A universal method of communication.

541
01:03:44,045 --> 01:03:47,213
Yes, when you don't like someone.

542
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:51,467
- Full impulse.
- The manifolds can't handle it.

543
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:55,472
If we don't outrun them,
it won't matter.

544
01:03:55,722 --> 01:03:59,559
- I'll be in engineering.
- Battle stations!

545
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:04,105
Have your boobs started
to firm up?

546
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:08,358
Not that we care about such things
in this day and age.

547
01:04:08,567 --> 01:04:11,777
Thank you, Data.

548
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:23,456
I've an odd craving for the blood
of a live Kolar beast.

549
01:04:23,664 --> 01:04:26,958
This environment is affecting me.

550
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:32,213
Have you noticed how your
boobs have started to firm up?

551
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:36,717
Take cover!

552
01:05:22,342 --> 01:05:26,721
Isolinear tags.
Transporters can lock onto them.

553
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:30,641
There's a cavern at the base
of the next hill.

554
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:06,340
- Shields at 60%.
- "Engineering to bridge."

555
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:12,094
We're going to blow ourselves up
without help from the Son'a!

556
01:06:12,304 --> 01:06:17,599
- What's inside that nebula cluster?.
- Cometary debris. Metreon gas.

557
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:22,271
- We don't want go in there.
- Yes, we do.

558
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,650
It's time to use the Briar Patch
the way Brer Rabbit did.

559
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,958
Inside the caves, quickly.

560
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,835
This way.

561
01:06:58,637 --> 01:07:00,639
Aggressive tendencies.

562
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:11,106
They've detonated an isolytic burst.
A subspace tear is forming.

563
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:16,653
Subspace weapons were banned
by the Khitomer accord.

564
01:07:16,862 --> 01:07:21,617
- I'll lodge a protest.
- Our warp core is magnetised.

565
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:25,744
We're pulling the tear
like a zipper across space.

566
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:29,831
- We could eject the core.
- Will that stop the tear?.

567
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:31,751
You got me.

568
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:37,338
- Is that your expert opinion?
- It might neutralise the cascade.

569
01:07:37,547 --> 01:07:41,592
Subspace weapons are unpredictable.
That's why they're banned.

570
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,056
The tear is closing on us.
Impact in 15 seconds.

571
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:49,349
Eject the core.

572
01:07:49,557 --> 01:07:53,896
- I just did.
- lmpact in ten seconds.

573
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:59,150
Detonate!

574
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:15,623
Get me a medic over here.

575
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:28,385
It worked. The tear is sealed.

576
01:08:28,594 --> 01:08:33,097
But there's nothing to stop them
from doing it again.

577
01:08:33,305 --> 01:08:37,976
- Transmission range: 36 minutes.
- We're through running.

578
01:08:57,787 --> 01:09:01,164
Another 43 reported taken.

579
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:15,094
They're trying to drive us out
so their drones can tag us.

580
01:09:15,302 --> 01:09:19,765
The structural integrity of this
cavern won't hold for long.

581
01:09:19,974 --> 01:09:27,604
- Is there another way out of here?
- Let's trackthe water's course.

582
01:09:37,488 --> 01:09:42,159
I'm reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow
behind that calcite formation.

583
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:46,122
Will this structure hold
if we blast through?

584
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:50,126
I believe it is safe.

585
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,420
Fire.

586
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:15,981
Get everybody into those caves.
Set up a forcefield.

587
01:10:23,155 --> 01:10:28,993
- Are those pockets of metreon gas?
- Yes, highly volatile.

588
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:33,497
I want to use the ram-scoop
to collect as much of it as we can.

589
01:10:33,707 --> 01:10:40,380
- The purpose being?
- To shove it down their throats.

590
01:10:40,587 --> 01:10:45,384
- If the gas ignites ...
- It's our only way out of here.

591
01:10:45,592 --> 01:10:49,637
History will remember this
as the Riker manoeuvre.

592
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:56,519
Access manual steering column.

593
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:03,108
- Controls to manual.
- "Storage cells are at maximum."

594
01:11:03,317 --> 01:11:06,319
They're powering forward weapons.

595
01:11:06,694 --> 01:11:09,613
Blow out the ram-scoop.

596
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,117
"Ram"-"scoop released."

597
01:11:29,006 --> 01:11:31,259
Captain.

598
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:35,720
- Keep these people moving.
- Bring them out.

599
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:48,149
It won't be long before
the drones get here.

600
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:52,319
Keep moving!

601
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:58,658
There are caves on higher ground.
We'll be safe there.

602
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:07,125
Take a look at this med-scan.

603
01:12:07,332 --> 01:12:11,002
His DNA profile.

604
01:12:11,212 --> 01:12:16,007
- How can that be possible?
- Maybe we should askthem.

605
01:12:28,853 --> 01:12:33,023
Artim, what are you doing? Come!

606
01:12:40,529 --> 01:12:46,743
Is this the last group?
Get them ready to move out.

607
01:12:46,952 --> 01:12:49,997
Anij went to find Artim.

608
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:19,356
- Go with Tournel!
- No, I want to stay with you!

609
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:36,413
- Worf to Picard!
- Two life-signs, one is faint.

610
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:40,792
There are almost four metric tons
of rock blocking our way.

611
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:45,005
That might cause another cave-in.

612
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:06,690
Anij?

613
01:14:12,154 --> 01:14:16,158
- "Worf to Picard."
- Yes, I can hear you.

614
01:14:16,365 --> 01:14:19,453
We're trying to get to you, sir.

615
01:14:20,203 --> 01:14:23,331
Anij ...

616
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:33,215
Help is on the way.

617
01:14:33,423 --> 01:14:38,177
- Hurry, Anij is hurt.
- "How bad is she?"

618
01:14:40,846 --> 01:14:45,768
- I'm losing her.
- "We're coming as fast as we can."

619
01:14:53,942 --> 01:14:58,488
Anij, stay with me.

620
01:15:01,448 --> 01:15:07,621
Help me find the power
to keep you in this moment.

621
01:15:08,788 --> 01:15:13,335
Don't let go of this moment.

622
01:15:29,265 --> 01:15:33,185
- She's stabilising.
- Is it safe to move her?.

623
01:15:33,394 --> 01:15:36,564
Safer than leaving her here.

624
01:15:40,275 --> 01:15:44,820
And you thought
it would take centuries to learn.

625
01:17:15,987 --> 01:17:20,283
Order them to surrender.
You won't be court-martialled.

626
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:27,372
A court martial will let the people
know what is happening here.

627
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:32,460
The Enterprise has destroyed
one ship, the other is on fire.

628
01:17:32,668 --> 01:17:37,631
The Enterprise was defending itself.
Ru'afo must have attacked.

629
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,427
I can't believe that he didn't
have your consent, Admiral.

630
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:46,722
I wonder which one of us
will be facing that court martial.

631
01:17:47,599 --> 01:17:53,813
- There's nothing to be gained here.
- Right, this is going to end now.

632
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:59,359
- I'm going to launch the injector.
- No, you're not.

633
01:17:59,568 --> 01:18:04,573
In six hours, every living thing
in this system will be dead.

634
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,158
You would kill your own people?

635
01:18:08,368 --> 01:18:13,288
Your own parents?
Brothers, sisters?

636
01:18:13,497 --> 01:18:19,211
Didn't you know?. The Son'a
and the Ba'ku are the same race.

637
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:24,716
Picard just told us.

638
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:29,095
Our DNA is identical.

639
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:35,059
Which one were you?
Gal'na? Ro'tin?

640
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:40,729
- They're gone forever.
- What's he talking about?

641
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:45,777
A century ago, some young people
wanted to live like offlanders.

642
01:18:45,984 --> 01:18:51,739
- They tried to take over.
- And you exiled us to die slowly.

643
01:18:51,948 --> 01:18:55,327
You're Ro'tin, aren't you?

644
01:18:55,534 --> 01:18:58,954
There's something in the voice.

645
01:19:00,122 --> 01:19:03,667
Would you be his friend, Gal'na?

646
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:09,840
I helped your mother bathe you.
She still speaks of you.

647
01:19:10,048 --> 01:19:13,844
You brought the Federation
into the middle of a blood feud.

648
01:19:14,051 --> 01:19:19,097
The children have returned
to expel their elders.

649
01:19:19,306 --> 01:19:24,436
Except Ru'afo's need for revenge
has escalated into parricide.

650
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:31,234
It was for the Federation.

651
01:19:31,443 --> 01:19:35,572
It was all for the Federation.

652
01:19:46,957 --> 01:19:52,127
We're taking this ship out of here.
This mission is over.

653
01:19:52,337 --> 01:19:55,797
- It is not over.
- It is over.

654
01:20:01,845 --> 01:20:04,930
I do not take orders from you!

655
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:22,948
If you launch the injector,
the Federation will pursue you ...

656
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:30,246
The Federation will never know
what happened here.

657
01:20:56,853 --> 01:21:00,856
Admiral Dougherty
won't be joining us.

658
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,359
Deploy the collector.

659
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,658
- Do you have a problem with that?
- May I talkto you alone?

660
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:13,911
- Deploy the collector.
- Yes, sir.

661
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:24,878
- You want to kill them all?
- No one hated them more than you.

662
01:21:25,087 --> 01:21:31,467
We've come a long way. This is the
moment we've planned for so long.

663
01:21:34,429 --> 01:21:38,765
Transfer all Starfleet personnel
to the cargo hold.

664
01:21:38,975 --> 01:21:42,353
See that Picard joins them.

665
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,733
The shields in that section
won't protect them from the heat.

666
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:51,027
Thank you for reminding me.

667
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,820
Jean-Luc.

668
01:22:47,244 --> 01:22:50,747
Come with me.

669
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:08,596
It must have been strange for you
as a hostage, -

670
01:23:08,805 --> 01:23:13,185
- surrounded by all the friends
and family you once knew.

671
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:16,563
All looking
exactly as they did then.

672
01:23:16,771 --> 01:23:21,609
Like looking through
the eyes of childhood again.

673
01:23:21,818 --> 01:23:26,404
And here you are,
closing those eyes.

674
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:30,826
Trying not to see what bitterness
has done to the Son'a.

675
01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:35,538
How it's turned Ru'afo
into a madman. And you ...

676
01:23:35,747 --> 01:23:38,625
It's turned you into a coward.

677
01:23:38,832 --> 01:23:43,128
A man who denies his own conscience.

678
01:23:43,337 --> 01:23:46,840
Get in.

679
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:57,265
A coward without the moral courage
to prevent an atrocity.

680
01:23:57,475 --> 01:24:02,938
- Are you pleading for your life?
- I'm not pleading for my life.

681
01:24:05,231 --> 01:24:08,359
I'm pleading for yours.

682
01:24:08,568 --> 01:24:13,280
You can still go home, Gal'na.

683
01:24:22,497 --> 01:24:27,793
Computer, close turbolift doors.

684
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:32,131
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

685
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,676
- You can disable the injector.
- From the bridge.

686
01:24:36,886 --> 01:24:41,305
- The crew is loyal to Ru'afo.
- Perhaps we can lure him away.

687
01:24:41,515 --> 01:24:47,270
As soon as he realises something is
wrong, he'll override my commands.

688
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:54,068
He may not realise something
is wrong. Get me to a transmitter.

689
01:24:54,275 --> 01:24:58,738
I need to speak with Data and Worf
down on the planet.

690
01:25:04,411 --> 01:25:06,871
Initiate separation.

691
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:10,457
Separation in three minutes.

692
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:15,212
A small craft is approaching.
It's powering up its weapons.

693
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:19,925
- On screen.
- One person aboard, the android.

694
01:25:20,132 --> 01:25:22,719
He's no threat.

695
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:31,310
Data to Picard.
They're ignoring my attack.

696
01:25:31,518 --> 01:25:35,271
Keep firing into the shield.
Is Worf in position?

697
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:40,275
- Yes, he's ready for transport.
- "We're approaching the bridge."

698
01:25:44,947 --> 01:25:49,451
- Separation in one minute.
- He's disrupting our shields.

699
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:54,331
If they go out of phase,
we'll be exposed to the reaction.

700
01:25:54,706 --> 01:26:01,212
Very well, destroy that ship.
Do not delay the countdown.

701
01:26:07,216 --> 01:26:11,179
Data to Picard. They are
rotating their shield harmonics.

702
01:26:11,387 --> 01:26:14,640
I am attempting
to return to the surface.

703
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:19,395
- The Federation ship has been hit.
- Separation in 20 seconds.

704
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,774
- What's that?
- I don't know.

705
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:28,862
- The systems don't seem affected.
- Separation in ten seconds.

706
01:26:31,197 --> 01:26:34,367
Five seconds.

707
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:38,953
The injector assembly has separated.

708
01:26:56,136 --> 01:27:00,390
Exactly
as the simulations predicted.

709
01:27:03,894 --> 01:27:07,771
I'm not showing any change
in metaphasic flux levels.

710
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:14,819
- Your scanners are malfunctioning.
- All ship functions are off-line.

711
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:19,323
How can there be no ship functions
if the view screen is working?

712
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:24,162
Artificial gravity is stable.
Life support is ...

713
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:39,884
A holodeck!

714
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:14,082
We were transported to the holoship
when we reset our shields.

715
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:20,087
Everything we saw was an illusion.
Ru'afo, authorisation Delta 2-1 .

716
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:23,506
Override all commands
to injector assembly one.

717
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:29,136
Unable to comply. Injector
assembly one has been deactivated.

718
01:28:37,728 --> 01:28:42,608
All injector sub-systems
aboard the collector are off-line.

719
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:47,654
De-cloakthe holoship
and engage a tractor beam.

720
01:28:55,036 --> 01:29:00,623
The crew know something is wrong.
I've secured the bridge.

721
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:08,422
We have 14 long-range transporters.
Are they all useless?

722
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:12,676
They were locked
after we were beamed here.

723
01:29:12,842 --> 01:29:16,930
Isolate one and re-route it
through the auxiliary processor.

724
01:29:17,139 --> 01:29:21,350
There's nothing we can do.
They have control of our ship.

725
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,978
I'm not going backto our ship.

726
01:29:26,648 --> 01:29:29,859
- Worf, destroy that thing.
- Aye, sir.

727
01:29:31,402 --> 01:29:36,864
- Weapons systems are off-line.
- They're re-routing controls.

728
01:29:38,742 --> 01:29:44,287
The collector launch sequence
has resumed.

729
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:48,626
Collector shields have been raised.
Someone's on board.

730
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:52,337
- It's Ru'afo.
- Can you override the launch?

731
01:29:52,546 --> 01:29:59,719
Not without access codes. There
is self-destruct on the collector.

732
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:06,600
- Try to beam through those shields.
- It has to be detonated manually.

733
01:30:06,809 --> 01:30:11,229
Transport is possible between the
shield generators within 100 metres.

734
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:15,524
Take us into position.
Remain at your post.

735
01:30:15,734 --> 01:30:20,445
- I need you to beam me back.
- We're approaching the collector.

736
01:30:20,654 --> 01:30:26,243
When the fuel tanks start venting,
weapons fire may ignite the exhaust.

737
01:30:35,126 --> 01:30:39,212
Separation
in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

738
01:30:48,512 --> 01:30:51,181
"Intruder ale"rt.

739
01:31:25,838 --> 01:31:27,881
Captain!

740
01:31:28,091 --> 01:31:30,467
Worf?

741
01:31:37,056 --> 01:31:40,769
Captain Picard
is on board the collector.

742
01:31:40,976 --> 01:31:45,981
Enterprise to Picard!
Do you need assistance?

743
01:31:48,275 --> 01:31:51,654
- I may need a lift in a minute.
- We're on our way.

744
01:31:51,862 --> 01:31:55,448
Separation in one minute.

745
01:32:21,805 --> 01:32:24,516
- Report.
- It's Ru'afo's ship!

746
01:32:24,725 --> 01:32:27,144
On screen.

747
01:32:27,353 --> 01:32:33,108
Sensors are reading over 100 Ba'ku
on board and one Klingon.

748
01:32:33,315 --> 01:32:38,404
Target their ventral engines and
life support. Collision course.

749
01:32:41,239 --> 01:32:43,701
Stop!

750
01:32:47,037 --> 01:32:53,292
- We're getting too old for this.
- Soon that won't be a problem.

751
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,920
Separation in 30 seconds.

752
01:32:56,128 --> 01:33:00,006
You're really going to risk
igniting the exhaust?

753
01:33:00,216 --> 01:33:03,135
All right, I will!

754
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,479
- Shields at 60%.
- Hold your course.

755
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:21,859
- He wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.

756
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:25,904
Now!

757
01:33:36,789 --> 01:33:39,917
Stand by, Captain. We're on our way.

758
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:43,587
Sorry, time's up.

759
01:34:20,204 --> 01:34:23,498
What kept you, Number One?

760
01:34:23,707 --> 01:34:28,503
The Federation Council
has halted the Ba'ku relocation.

761
01:34:28,712 --> 01:34:31,672
There'll be a top-level review.

762
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:35,342
- Ru'afo's ship is hailing us.
- On screen.

763
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:43,100
The Son'a crew want a cease-fire.
We have three minutes of air left.

764
01:34:43,309 --> 01:34:45,978
Prepare to beam aboard.

765
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:57,779
How will we feel when we leave
this metaphasic radiation?

766
01:34:57,988 --> 01:35:01,783
Your feelings about her
haven't changed.

767
01:35:01,992 --> 01:35:06,162
This place just let them out
for a little fresh air.

768
01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:12,961
- How can we bring them back home?
- Askthem.

769
01:35:13,168 --> 01:35:18,506
I'm afraid there's too much
bitterness on both sides.

770
01:35:22,301 --> 01:35:25,596
Mother and son.

771
01:35:25,805 --> 01:35:29,684
- You arranged this?
- To begin the healing process.

772
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,904
What am I going to do without you?

773
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:47,242
I wish I could stay ...

774
01:35:47,449 --> 01:35:51,953
But these are perilous times
for the Federation.

775
01:35:52,162 --> 01:35:56,250
I can't abandon it to people
who would threaten -

776
01:35:56,457 --> 01:36:00,962
- everything I've spent a lifetime
defending. I have to go back ...

777
01:36:01,171 --> 01:36:07,135
If only to slowthings down
at the Federation Council.

778
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:14,349
I have 318 days of shore leave
coming, and ...

779
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:19,645
... I intend to use them.

780
01:36:30,072 --> 01:36:32,114
Data?

781
01:36:32,323 --> 01:36:35,159
It's time to go.

782
01:36:35,368 --> 01:36:38,537
I have to go home now.

783
01:36:38,746 --> 01:36:41,666
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
01:36:55,427 --> 01:36:59,222
Mr Data,
I hope we'll see you again.

785
01:37:05,604 --> 01:37:12,234
Data! Don't forget, you have
to have a little fun every day.

786
01:37:12,902 --> 01:37:16,113
Good advice.

787
01:37:26,747 --> 01:37:31,793
Picard to Enterprise.
Seven to beam up.

788
01:37:35,797 --> 01:37:38,216
Energize.
