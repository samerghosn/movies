1
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,862
l thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

2
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,329
Besides,

3
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,666
l can't believe you'd kill me

4
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,544
for a field of empty holes.

5
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,548
All l have.

6
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,825
Your pain runs deep.

7
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,205
-What do you know of my pain?
-Let us explore it together.

8
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,125
Each man hides a secret pain.

9
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,171
lt must be exposed and reckoned with.

10
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,385
lt must be dragged from the darkness
and forced into the light.

11
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,889
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me.

12
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,226
And gain strength from the sharing.

13
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,290
Where did you get this power?

14
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,796
The power was within you.

15
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,721
l feel as if a weight has been lifted
from my heart.

16
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,350
How can l repay you for this miracle?

17
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,562
-Join my quest.
-What is it you seek?

18
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,316
What you seek.

19
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,989
What all men have sought
since time began.

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,660
The ultimate knowledge.

21
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,582
To find it, we'll need a starship.

22
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,544
A starship?
There are no starships on Nimbus lll.

23
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,756
Perhaps l have a way to bring one here.

24
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,799
But how?

25
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,807
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

26
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,518
You're a Vulcan.

27
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,001
"You'll have a great time, Bones.
You'll enjoy your shore leave.

28
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,086
"You'll be able to relax."

29
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,716
You call this relaxing?
l'm a nervous wreck.

30
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,721
lf l'm not careful, l'll end up talking
to myself.

31
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,072
Greetings, Captain.

32
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,993
Spock! What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

33
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,830
-l have been monitoring your progress.
-l'm flattered.

34
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,584
Twelve hundred points of interest
in Yosemite and you pick me.

35
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,213
l regret to inform you that the record
for free-climbing El Capitan

36
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,590
is in no danger of being broken.

37
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,552
l'm not trying to break any records.
l'm doing this 'cause l enjoy it.

38
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,265
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain.

39
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,683
And that is?

40
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,851
Because it's there.

41
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,353
Captain?

42
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,399
l do not think you realise the gravity
of your situation.

43
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,739
On the contrary.
Gravity is foremost on my mind.

44
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,534
Look, l'm trying to make an ascent here.

45
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,703
Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy
for a while?

46
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:26,000
l believe that Dr McCoy
is not in the best of moods.

47
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,378
Goddamn irresponsible...

48
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,966
Playing games with life.

49
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,178
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

50
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,806
Spock, l appreciate your concern,
but if you don't stop distracting me,

51
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,224
l'm liable to be one to

52
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,935
fall!

53
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,733
Oh, my God.

54
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,959
Perhaps "because it is there"

55
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,961
is not sufficient reason
for climbing the mountain.

56
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,630
l'm hardly in a position to disagree.

57
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,719
Hi, Bones. Mind if we drop in for dinner?

58
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,857
<i>Your dream can become a reality.</i>
<i>The Paradise Inn.</i>

59
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>We have spared no expense</i>
<i>to create the closest thing to paradise</i>

60
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,654
<i>in paradise... City, that is.</i>

61
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,036
Gentlemen, l'm Caithlin Dar.

62
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,538
Oh, yeah.

63
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,834
Our new Romulan representative.

64
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,920
Welcome to Paradise City, my dear,

65
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,298
capital of the so-called
planet of galactic peace.

66
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,718
l'm St John Talbot,
the Federation representative

67
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,512
here on Nimbus lll.

68
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,850
My charming companion here is
the Klingon consul, Korrd.

69
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,314
l expect that's Klingon for "Hello."

70
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,567
Won't you come in, my dear?

71
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,378
Twenty years ago,
our three governments agreed

72
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,797
to develop this planet together.

73
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,344
-A new age was born.
-Our new age died a quick death.

74
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,097
And the settlers we conned
into coming here,

75
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,932
they were the dregs of the galaxy.

76
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,059
lmmediately took
to fighting amongst themselves.

77
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,936
We forbad them weapons,

78
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,481
and they soon began to fashion
their own.

79
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,650
Well, then it appears l've arrived
just in time.

80
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,246
<i>We have spared no expense</i>
<i>to create the closest thing to...</i>

81
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,295
Get away from that transmitter!

82
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,304
Romulan.

83
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,808
Terran.

84
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,894
Klingon.

85
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,772
Consider yourselves my prisoners.

86
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:04,611
Prisoners? We're already prisoners
here on this worthless lump of rock.

87
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,323
What possible value
could we be to you?

88
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,742
Nimbus lll may be a worthless
lump of rock,

89
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,953
but it does have one unique treasure.

90
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,999
lt's the only place in the entire galaxy
that has the three of you.

91
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,586
l don't know who you are,
or what you want, but l can tell you this.

92
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,589
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

93
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,174
That's exactly what l'm counting on.

94
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,772
U.S.S. Enterprise,
<i>shakedown cruise report.</i>

95
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,942
<i>I think this new ship was put together</i>
<i>by monkeys.</i>

96
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,904
<i>Oh, she's got a fine engine,</i>
<i>but half the doors won't open.</i>

97
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,866
<i>And guess whose job it is</i>
<i>to make it right?</i>

98
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,702
Borgus Frat.

99
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,457
"Let's see what she's got,"
said the Captain.

100
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,250
And then we found out, didn't we?

101
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,878
l know you'll whip her into shape,
Scotty. You always do.

102
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,921
Uhura, l thought you were on leave.

103
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,382
And l thought we were supposed to be
going together.

104
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,053
Oh, l cannot leave her now
when she needs me the most.

105
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,058
l had a feeling
you would say something like that.

106
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,560
So l brought us dinner.

107
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:24,149
Oh, lassie, you're the most
understanding woman l know.

108
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,236
<i>Red... Red... Red aIert.</i>

109
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,948
<i>-Red aIert.</i>
-l just fixed that damn thing.

110
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,577
<i>-Red... Red... Red aIert.</i>
-Turn it off, will you?

111
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:42,417
<i>Red aIert. Red aIert. This is a red aIert.</i>
Enterprise acknowledge.

112
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,007
This is Enterprise. ldentify yourself.

113
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,051
Enterprise, this is Starfleet.

114
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,513
<i>We have a priority seven situation</i>
<i>in the NeutraI Zone.</i>

115
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,889
Stand by, Starfleet.

116
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,101
-Scotty, this is for real.
-They can't be serious.

117
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,480
The ship's in pieces and we've got less
than a skeleton crew aboard.

118
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,360
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

119
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,112
<i>Current status understood.</i>

120
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,032
<i>Stand by to copy operational orders</i>
<i>and recall key personnel.</i>

121
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,327
Admit it. We're lost.

122
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,622
All right, we're lost.
But we're making good time.

123
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,418
<i>-Commander Sulu, come in, please.</i>
-l don't believe this.

124
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,211
Commander Sulu here.

125
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,547
Bad news, gentlemen.
Shore leave's been cancelled.

126
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,340
Rescued at last!

127
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,343
<i>Return to prearranged coordinates</i>
<i>for pickup.</i>

128
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,013
Don't tell them you're lost.
You'll never live it down.

129
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,683
ls there a problem, gentlemen?

130
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,562
Yes, we've been caught in a...

131
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,481
We've been caught in a blizzard.

132
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,944
And we can't see a thing.

133
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,780
Request you direct us
to the coordinates.

134
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,741
<i>My visual says</i>

135
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,994
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

136
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,208
Sulu, look. The sun's come out.
lt's a miracle.

137
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,754
<i>Don't worry, fellas.</i>
<i>Your secret's safe with me.</i>

138
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,630
<i>I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.</i>

139
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,508
Uhura, l owe you one. Sulu out.

140
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,013
Come and get it! Come and get it!

141
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,267
Knock it... Bones! Bones,
knock it off! We're right here.

142
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,352
And we're starving.

143
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,771
Bipodal seeds, Doctor?

144
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,065
Beans, Spock. But no ordinary beans.

145
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,445
These are from an old Southern recipe
handed down to me by my father.

146
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,740
And if you stick your Vulcan nose up
at these,

147
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:41,119
you're not only insulting me,
but generations of McCoys.

148
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,665
ln that case, l have little choice
but to sample your beans.

149
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,926
Surprisingly good.

150
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,886
lt does have flavouring
l'm not familiar with.

151
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,889
That's the secret ingredient.

152
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,184
You got any more
of that secret ingredient, Bones?

153
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,687
-Be my guest.
-Thank you.

154
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,191
Am l to understand
that your secret ingredient is alcohol?

155
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,028
Whisky. Tennessee whisky, Spock.
You care for a little snort?

156
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,322
Bourbon and beans,
an explosive combination.

157
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,407
Think Spock can handle it?

158
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,410
Are you kidding?
With that Vulcan metabolism,

159
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,206
he could eat a bowl of termites
and it wouldn't bother him.

160
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,335
As you are so fond of pointing out,
Doctor, l'm half human.

161
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,754
Well, it certainly doesn't show.

162
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,631
Thank you.

163
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,675
How do you like that?
This guy never changes.

164
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,052
l insult him, and he takes it
as a compliment.

165
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,101
You know, you two
could drive a man to drink.

166
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,686
Me? What did l do?

167
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,145
What did you do?

168
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,022
You really piss me off, Jim.

169
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,443
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

170
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,864
Maybe it didn't cross
that macho mind of yours,

171
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,950
but you should've been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

172
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,036
-lt crossed my mind.
-And?

173
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,789
And, even as l fell, l knew l wouldn't die.

174
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,710
l thought he was the only one
who's immortal.

175
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,879
Oh, no. lt isn't that.

176
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,965
l knew l wouldn't die because
the two of you were with me.

177
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,136
l do not understand.

178
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,016
l've always known l'll die alone.

179
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,901
Well, l'll call Valhalla
and have them reserve a room for you.

180
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,824
lt's a mystery to me
what draws us together.

181
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,245
All that time in space,
and we getting on each others' nerves,

182
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,415
and what do we do when shore leave
comes along?

183
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,918
We spend it together.

184
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,670
Other people have families.

185
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,423
Other people, Bones. Not us.

186
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,474
What are you doing?

187
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,686
l am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

188
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,857
Well, l'll be damned. A marsh melon.

189
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,444
Where'd you learn to do that?

190
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,780
Before leaving the ship,
l consulted the computer library

191
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,575
to familiarise myself with the customs
associated with camping out.

192
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,578
Well, tell me, Spock.

193
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,207
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

194
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,293
We consume them.

195
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,380
l know we consume them.
l mean after that.

196
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:44,678
l believe we are required to engage
in a ritual known as the sing-along.

197
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:49,224
That's great. l haven't sung around
a campfire since l was a boy in lowa.

198
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,850
What are we going to sing? What...

199
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,310
Bones, what are we going to sing?

200
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,312
How about Camptown Races?

201
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,730
<i>Pack Up Your Troubles.</i>

202
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,065
Are we leaving, Captain?

203
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,817
lt's a song title, Spock.

204
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,568
<i>Moon over Rigel VII.</i>

205
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,821
<i>Row, Row, Row Your Boat.</i>

206
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,698
Row, Row, Row YourBoat. l love Row...

207
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,950
Do you know Row, Row, Row,
<i>Row, Row Your Boat?</i>

208
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,160
That song did not come up
in my research, Captain.

209
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,746
The lyrics are very simple. lt's,

210
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,166
"Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

211
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,421
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream"

212
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840
The Doctor and l will start it off,

213
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,551
and then when we give you a signal,
you jump in.

214
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,511
Doctor, if you please.

215
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,141
Don't say l didn't warn you.

216
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:37,147
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

217
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,691
<i>-Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
<i>-Row, row, row your boat</i>

218
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,277
<i>-Life is but a dream</i>
<i>-Gently down the stream</i>

219
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,821
<i>-Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
<i>-Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>

220
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,239
<i>Life...</i>

221
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,323
Come on, Spock.

222
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,034
Why didn't you jump in?

223
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,454
l was trying to comprehend
the meaning of the words.

224
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,041
lt's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.

225
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,501
You sing it. The words aren't important.

226
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,921
What's important
is that you have a good time singing it.

227
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,632
l am sorry, Doctor.

228
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,135
Were we having a good time?

229
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,054
God, l liked him better before he died.

230
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,597
All right, all right, let's call it a night.

231
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,515
-He just keeps after it.
-Let's... Let's go to bed,

232
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,476
and just let's get some sleep.

233
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,072
-Captain?
-Spock, we're on leave.

234
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,364
You can call me Jim.

235
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,283
-Jim?
-Yes, Spock?

236
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,952
Life is not a dream.

237
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,498
Go to sleep, Spock.

238
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,833
Yes, Captain.

239
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,088
-Good night, Bones.
-Good night, Jim.

240
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,218
-Good night, Spock.
-Good night, Doctor.

241
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,388
-Good night, Spock.
-Good night, Jim.

242
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,353
l don't know. l just don't know.

243
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,962
Captain Klaa, we have a target in sight.
A probe of ancient origin.

244
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,713
Difficult to hit?

245
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,298
Most difficult.

246
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,424
Good.

247
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,802
All weapons to my control.

248
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,428
Scope!

249
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,252
Shooting space garbage
is no test of a warrior's mettle.

250
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,755
l need a target that fights back.

251
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,260
Captain, new data,
hostages on Nimbus lll.

252
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,267
One of the hostages is a Klingon.

253
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,227
And the others?

254
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,606
A Terran and a Romulan.

255
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:30,278
That means the Federation
will be sending a rescue ship of its own.

256
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,699
Plot course for Nimbus lll.

257
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,663
l've always wanted to engage
a Federation ship.

258
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,755
Get that damn light out of my face!

259
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,811
Mr Scott apologises
for having to send the shuttlecraft.

260
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,606
The transporter beam
is non-operational.

261
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,360
Captain, we've received important
orders from Starfleet command.

262
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,528
Why didn't you beep my communicator?

263
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,031
You forgot to take it with you.

264
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,866
Wonder why l did that.

265
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,495
Well, gentlemen, it appears
shore leave has been cancelled.

266
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,330
Pack out your trash.

267
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,617
"All l ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by"

268
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,661
-Melville.
-John Masefield.

269
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,123
Are you sure about that?

270
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,875
l am well versed in the classics, Doctor.

271
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,380
Then how come you don't know
<i>Row, Row, Row Your Boat?</i>

272
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,559
<i>Ready for landing manoeuvre.</i>
Enterprise, you have control.

273
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,228
You're doing just fine.

274
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,667
<i>Landing bay oxygen to pressure.</i>

275
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:57,759
<i>Landing bay is secure.</i>

276
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,390
Attention!

277
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,934
All l can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

278
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,687
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

279
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,022
l gave you three. What happened?

280
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,066
l think you gave me
too much time, Captain.

281
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,525
-Very well, Mr Scott. Carry on.
-Aye, sir.

282
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,946
How many times do l have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job!

283
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,200
l don't think l've ever seen him happier.

284
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,451
<i>LeveI?</i>

285
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,078
Bridge.

286
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,413
l hope.

287
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,963
l could use a shower.

288
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,424
Yes.

289
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,472
Doesn't anything work on this ship?

290
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,225
Starfleet's got some nerve
sending us out in this condition

291
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,143
with this handful of people.

292
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,062
Captain on the Bridge.

293
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,564
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.

294
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,983
Put it on the viewscreen,
will you, please?

295
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:01,197
Can we have a little quiet, please?

296
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,579
-Can you...
<i>-Am I on?</i>

297
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,665
Can you clear that up?

298
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,584
Can we have a little quiet?

299
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,962
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations.
<i>Come in.</i>

300
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,839
-Bob?
<i>-Jim!</i>

301
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,676
<i>Well! We're dressing informally,</i>
<i>aren't we?</i>

302
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,595
You caught me on the way
to the shower.

303
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,597
<i>I apologise for cancelling shore leave,</i>

304
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:31,352
<i>but look, we have a dangerous situation</i>
<i>out on Nimbus III.</i>

305
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,273
-On the planet of galactic peace?
<i>-The same.</i>

306
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,691
<i>From what we can make out,</i>

307
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,986
<i>a terrorist force</i>
<i>has captured the only settlement.</i>

308
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,114
<i>And they've taken hostages.</i>
<i>The Klingon, the Romulan,</i>

309
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,699
<i>the Federation consuIs.</i>

310
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,202
<i>Now, I know Enterprise is not exactly</i>
<i>up to specs...</i>

311
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,331
With all due respect,
the Enterprise is a disaster.

312
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,791
There must be other ships
in the quadrant.

313
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:57,128
<i>Other ships, yes.</i>
<i>But no experienced commanders.</i>

314
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,797
<i>Captain, I need Jim Kirk.</i>

315
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,466
-Oh, please.
<i>-Your orders are</i>

316
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,385
<i>to proceed to Nimbus III,</i>
<i>assess the situation,</i>

317
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,638
<i>and avoid a confrontation if possible.</i>

318
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:11,142
<i>Above aII, however,</i>
<i>get those hostages back safely.</i>

319
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,394
Have the Klingons responded?

320
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,979
<i>No, but you can bet they will.</i>

321
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,772
Understood. Kirk out.

322
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,150
Plot course for Nimbus lll, Mr Sulu.

323
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,526
Aye, sir.

324
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,279
Course plotted.

325
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,949
l'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

326
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,369
Since we're undermanned, l'm counting
on each one of you to give his best.

327
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,455
End of speech. Let's go to work.

328
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,834
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't,

329
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,047
l think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons,

330
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,508
and they don't exactly like you.

331
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,426
The feeling's mutual.

332
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,179
-Engine Room.
<i>-Scotty here.</i>

333
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,389
We'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

334
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,684
Don't you worry, Captain.
We'll beat those Klingon devils

335
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,311
even if l have to get out and push.

336
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,272
l hope it won't come to that, Mr Scott.

337
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,149
All possible speed, Mr Sulu.

338
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,442
Aye, sir.

339
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,326
What's the matter, Jim?

340
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,161
l miss my old chair.

341
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:24,131
The starship Enterprise
has been dispatched to Nimbus lll.

342
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,342
Enterprise?

343
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,971
That's Kirk's ship!

344
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,936
lf l could defeat Kirk...

345
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:43,109
You would be the greatest warrior
in the galaxy.

346
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,945
Maximum speed.

347
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,906
Success!

348
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,286
Captain's Log, Stardate 845...

349
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,835
Captain's Log, Stardate 84...

350
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,216
<i>-Good morning, Captain.</i>
-That's... Forget it.

351
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,178
Captain, we're receiving the hostage
information you requested.

352
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,514
Put it on the screen.

353
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:18,728
<i>This is an authorised transmission</i>
<i>from Starfleet Galactic Memory Bank.</i>

354
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,691
-Not General Korrd.
-The same.

355
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,445
He's apparently fallen out of favour
with the Klingon High Command.

356
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,114
General Korrd's military strategies
were required learning

357
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,408
when l was a cadet at the Academy.

358
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,455
When they put me out to pasture,
l hope l fare better than Korrd.

359
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,251
This must be the hostage tape.

360
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,464
<i>A short time ago,</i>
<i>we willingly surrendered ourselves</i>

361
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,425
<i>to the forces</i>
<i>of the Galactic Army of Light.</i>

362
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,970
<i>At this moment,</i>
<i>we're in their protective custody.</i>

363
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,264
<i>Their Ieader assures us</i>
<i>that we will be treated humanely</i>

364
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,017
<i>so long as you cooperate</i>
<i>with his demands.</i>

365
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:02,438
<i>I believe his sincerity. He requests</i>
<i>that you send a Federation starship</i>

366
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,940
<i>to parley for our release at once.</i>

367
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,401
<i>Be assured that we are in good health,</i>

368
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,987
<i>and would appreciate</i>
<i>your immediate response.</i>

369
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,203
<i>I deeply regret this desperate act,</i>
<i>but these are desperate times.</i>

370
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,996
<i>I have no desire</i>
<i>to harm these innocents,</i>

371
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,916
<i>but do not put me to the test.</i>
<i>I implore you...</i>

372
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,545
<i>I implore you to respond immediately.</i>

373
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,103
What is it?

374
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,483
-You look like you've just seen a ghost.
-Perhaps l have, Captain.

375
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,151
Perhaps l have.

376
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,929
Spock, what is it?

377
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,183
-Do you know this Vulcan?
-l cannot be certain.

378
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,310
But he does seem familiar.

379
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,564
He reminds me of someone
l knew in my youth.

380
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,316
Why, Spock, l didn't know you had one.

381
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,360
l do not often think of the past.

382
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,280
Who is it he reminds you of?

383
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:38,200
There was a young student,
exceptionally gifted,

384
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,621
possessing a great intelligence.

385
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,168
lt was assumed that one day
he would take his place

386
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,962
amongst the great scholars of Vulcan.

387
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:53,507
-But he was a revolutionary.
-What do you mean?

388
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,051
The knowledge and experience
he sought

389
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,763
were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

390
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:03,017
-Forbidden?
-He rejected his logical upbringing

391
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,979
and embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

392
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,147
Why?

393
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:15,112
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion, not logic.

394
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,657
lmagine that. A passionate Vulcan.

395
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,660
When he encouraged others
to follow him,

396
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,705
he was banished from Vulcan,
never to return.

397
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,001
-Fascinating.
<i>-Captain to the Bridge.</i>

398
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,295
On my way.

399
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,386
-Spock?
-Coming, Captain.

400
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,394
Approaching Nimbus lll.

401
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,563
Hailing frequency open.

402
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,023
Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

403
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,946
Captain, we're receiving transmission
from Paradise City.

404
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,323
They're demanding to know
our intentions.

405
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,784
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

406
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,285
Which wouldn't be far from the truth.

407
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,622
Paradise City,
can you boost your power?

408
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,749
We're barely receiving transmission.

409
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,543
Transporter Room. Status.

410
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,378
Scotty here, Captain.

411
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,381
Transporter is still inoperative.

412
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,716
Even if we could lock on
to the hostages,

413
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,052
we could not beam them up.

414
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,516
We're gonna have to get them out
the old-fashioned way.

415
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,351
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant.

416
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,063
Bird-of-prey. Estimating 1 .9 hours
until her weapons come to bear.

417
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,275
Damn. Let's go.

418
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,548
Their scanning equipment is primitive
but effective.

419
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,342
l recommend we land
at coordinates 8-5-6-3.

420
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,720
That puts us pretty far away
from Paradise City.

421
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,306
To land any closer
would be to risk detection.

422
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,850
-Mr Sulu. Execute.
-Aye, sir.

423
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,067
<i>Paradise City.</i>
This is Starship Enterprise.

424
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,194
A Federation starship.

425
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,743
<i>This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking.</i>

426
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,996
<i>You are in vioIation</i>
<i>of Neutral Zone Treaty.</i>

427
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,582
<i>I advise you</i>
<i>to release your hostages at once,</i>

428
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,833
<i>or suffer the consequences.</i>

429
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,668
Your threats amuse me,
Captain Chekov.

430
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,503
What consequences
did you have in mind?

431
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,234
Go! Go! Go!

432
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,863
Even as we speak,
a Klingon warship is on its way.

433
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,990
We estimate arrival within the hour.

434
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,451
l imagine the Klingons
will be quite angry.

435
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,871
<i>You are a master of understatement.</i>
<i>They are likely to destroy the planet.</i>

436
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:15,125
Then it's fortunate that l have you
and your starship to protect me.

437
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,671
ln the meantime, Captain Chekov,
l instruct you and your first officer

438
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,048
to beam down to my coordinates.

439
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,551
<i>We will be happy to beam down.</i>

440
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,429
<i>But first we must have</i>
<i>certain assurances.</i>

441
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,520
At foot speed, l estimate the journey
to Paradise City at 1 .2 hours.

442
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,563
We don't have 1 .2 hours.

443
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,110
Wait a minute. Perfect!

444
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,862
But we'll have to get their attention.

445
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,623
What?

446
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,880
What's that?

447
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,466
Damn!

448
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,802
ls she naked?

449
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,055
-What?
-ls she naked?

450
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,728
What is that?

451
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,264
Hello, boys.

452
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,603
l've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

453
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,314
Oh, damn.

454
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,945
-Spock.
-Yes, Captain?

455
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,990
-Be one with the horse.
-Yes, Captain.

456
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,581
Open the gate. lt's our lookout party.

457
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,670
Federation soldiers right behind us.
Close the gate!

458
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,015
Where are they going?

459
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,560
-Spock.
-Hold your horse, Captain. l'm scanning.

460
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,029
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

461
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,575
Galileo, this is Strike Team.
Start your run.

462
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,623
-Who are you?
-Phasers on stun. Get rid of the mounts.

463
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,792
-Sulu, take out that light.
-Yes, Captain.

464
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,057
What's going on?

465
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,767
<i>I instruct you to surrender at once.</i>

466
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:21,353
<i>You are under attack</i>
<i>by superior Federation forces.</i>

467
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,523
Do you realise what you've done?
lt wasn't bloodshed l wanted!

468
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,732
<i>Wait! Come back!</i>

469
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,197
Uhura, come on down.

470
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,948
Roger. Coming in.

471
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:03,247
<i>Recreational opportunities are limitless.</i>
<i>The vicinity is famous for its plentiful</i>

472
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,500
<i>local wildlife. And the fishing? Terrific.</i>

473
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,919
<i>Easy financing</i>
<i>through Federation Federal</i>

474
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,421
<i>can put you in your own home...</i>

475
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,839
Thank God.

476
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,342
Please cooperate.

477
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,594
Would you mind handing over
your weapons?

478
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,514
<i>So, what are you waiting for?</i>
<i>Beam on down!</i>

479
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,017
Well done, my friends.

480
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,561
Spock!

481
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,363
Spock.

482
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,783
lt's me. lt's Sybok.

483
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,704
After all these years,
you've finally caught up with me.

484
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,584
Don't you have anything to say to me?

485
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,049
You are under arrest

486
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,177
for seventeen violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

487
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,691
Spock, you've developed
a sense of humour after all.

488
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:59,946
lt was not my intention to amuse you.
These are serious charges.

489
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,827
-However, if you surrender now...
-l'm sorry, Spock. l can't surrender now.

490
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,789
l'm not through violating
Neutral Zone Treaty.

491
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,794
ln fact, l'm just getting started.

492
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:18,757
And for my next violation,
l intend to steal something.

493
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,635
Something very big.

494
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,808
l must have your starship.

495
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,895
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

496
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,482
-Who are you?
-James T. Kirk,

497
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,611
-Captain of the Enterprise.
-But l thought Captain Chekov...

498
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,947
l see!

499
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,741
Very clever, Captain.

500
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:50,038
Spock, it would appear that you've been
given a second chance to join me.

501
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,082
What do you say?

502
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:57,003
-l am a Starfleet officer.
-Of course.

503
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,298
Of course.

504
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,136
Then l'll take the ship without your help.

505
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,241
Shuttle en route.

506
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,160
Position, bird-of-prey?

507
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,873
Closing.

508
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:43,049
Estimating attack range
in 8,000 kellicams.

509
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:48,221
Stealth approach,
slow to one quarter impulse power.

510
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,182
Prepare to cloak.

511
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,226
Engage cloaking device.

512
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,695
Mr Chekov.

513
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:07,282
l've lost the bird-of-prey.
She must have cloaked.

514
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,451
-Raise shields.
-But the shuttle...

515
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,620
Do it. Go to red alert.

516
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,844
Once we've taken control of your vessel,
we'll bring up the rest of our followers.

517
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,846
The Klingons are out there.

518
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,890
We'll be lucky to get back
to the ship ourselves.

519
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,768
Galileo, this is Enterprise.
<i>Condition red aIert.</i>

520
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,855
<i>Bird-of-prey approaching.</i>
<i>She is cloaked. Raising shields.</i>

521
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,816
Recommend Galileo find safe harbour
until situation secure.

522
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,985
<i>-Acknowledge.</i>
-No!

523
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,950
No reply. Remain on course.

524
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:55,455
Sybok, listen to me. ln order
for this craft to enter the landing bay,

525
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,626
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

526
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,964
To get us inside
and re-raise the shields will take...

527
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,715
Exactly 1 5.5 seconds.

528
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,302
An eternity, during which we'll be
vulnerable to Klingon attack.

529
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,721
-Korrd, you tell him.
-He speaks the truth.

530
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:15,642
lf my people are cloaked,
then they intend to strike.

531
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,521
We cannot turn back.

532
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:23,024
-You must allow us to act.
-Let me do something.

533
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,445
Very well. Do what you must.
But no more.

534
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,497
Enterprise. This is Kirk.

535
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,332
Kirk.

536
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,418
He's on the shuttlecraft!

537
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,545
Alter the attack course!

538
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,674
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

539
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:54,598
Stand by to execute
Emergency Landing Plan B.

540
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:02,606
-What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
-l don't have a clue.

541
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,234
<i>-B, as in "barricade."</i>
-He can't be serious.

542
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,365
What are you doing?

543
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,411
ln order to lower and raise the shields
as quickly as possible,

544
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:20,206
we're going to forego the tractor beam
and fly her in manually.

545
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,084
-Manually?
-How often have you done this?

546
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,588
Actually, it's my first attempt.

547
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:31,635
He's good.

548
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,928
Really.

549
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,352
Scotty, on my mark, open bay doors.

550
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:51,488
Stand by to de-cloak for firing.

551
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,907
Kirk to Scotty. Lower shields.

552
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,742
Lowering shields, sir.

553
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,004
Bird-of-prey bearing 1 -0-5 mark 2.

554
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,422
Go, Sulu!

555
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,066
They're in!

556
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,860
Bear on Enterprise.

557
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,363
Enterprise targeted!

558
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,365
Warp speed now.

559
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,825
Firing!

560
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,625
Track her course!

561
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,629
He's good.

562
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,673
We must change course at once.

563
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,848
l'll take you to the Bridge.

564
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,220
Pick it up.

565
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,353
Sybok.

566
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,066
You must surrender.

567
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,404
No.

568
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,869
-You must kill me.
-Shoot him!

569
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:01,094
For a moment,
l thought you might actually do it.

570
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,019
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

571
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:15,942
Spock.

572
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,072
You will accompany me to the Bridge?

573
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,116
No.

574
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,786
l will not.

575
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,332
You know l'm right.

576
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,507
Then you must join them.

577
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,694
Move. Move!

578
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,699
-These two will be useful.
-Give us a moment alone.

579
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,452
Don't be afraid.

580
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,473
-Damn it, Spock. God damn it!
-Captain, what l have done...

581
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,266
What you have done
is betray every man on this ship.

582
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,603
Worse. l have betrayed you.
l do not expect you to forgive me.

583
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,939
Forgive you? l ought to knock you
on your goddamn ass.

584
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,440
lf you think it would help.

585
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,151
-You want me to hold him, Jim?
-You stay out of this.

586
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,030
Why, Spock? Why?
All you had to do was pull the trigger.

587
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,449
lf l had pulled the trigger,
Sybok would be dead.

588
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,078
-l ordered you to defend your ship.
-You ordered me to kill my brother.

589
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,038
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan,
but that doesn't...

590
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,165
No, no, no, Captain.
You do not understand.

591
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,418
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

592
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,129
You mean he's your "brother" brother?

593
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,299
-You made that up.
-l did not.

594
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,301
You did, too.
Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother

595
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,637
because l happen to know for a fact
you don't have a brother.

596
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,556
Technically you are correct.
l do not have a brother.

597
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,476
-There, you see? See?
-l have a half-brother.

598
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,230
l gotta sit down.

599
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,109
Let me get this straight.

600
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,945
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers.

601
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,991
Exactly. That is correct.
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess.

602
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,411
Upon her death,
Sybok and l were raised as brothers.

603
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,247
Why didn't you tell us this before?

604
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,126
l was not disposed to discuss matters
of a personal nature.

605
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,086
For that, l am sorry.

606
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,505
He's sorry. See? He's sorry.
That makes everything all right.

607
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,757
-He's sorry. Everything...
-Stop it, Jim!

608
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,677
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

609
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,012
lf you want to punish him
for what he's done,

610
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,888
why don't you throw him in the brig?

611
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,683
Besides, we've got
bigger problems to deal with.

612
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,227
Like how the hell to get out of here.

613
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,521
l'll say one thing, Spock.

614
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,816
-You never cease to amaze me.
-Nor l myself.

615
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,951
l was beginning to worry.
Where is the captain?

616
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,413
lt's all right, Pavel.
Sybok will explain everything.

617
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,376
-Sulu, what are you doing?
-Plotting our new course.

618
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,754
New course? You have no authority.

619
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,134
What's going on here?

620
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,385
-Pavel...
-l won't force you.

621
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,597
-...you've got to listen to this man.
-The decision must be yours.

622
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,975
-l don't understand.
-Each of us hides a secret pain.

623
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:41,481
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

624
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,166
Useless.

625
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,716
Unwise.

626
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,019
-You could've warned me.
-He did, Jim.

627
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:21,771
There's got to be a way
out of this place.

628
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,524
This is a new brig, Captain.
lt is escape-proof.

629
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,194
-How do you know?
-The designers tested it

630
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,365
using the most intelligent
and resourceful person they could find.

631
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,283
He failed to escape.

632
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,620
This person didn't by any chance
have pointed ears

633
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:42,250
and an unerring capacity for getting
his shipmates into trouble, did he?

634
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,588
He did have pointed ears.

635
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,595
Following new course. Warp 7.

636
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,057
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours,
present speed.

637
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,103
Now that we're under way,

638
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,398
it's time l announced my intentions
to the rest of the ship.

639
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,110
Brave crew ofthe Starship Enterprise,

640
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,738
<i>consider the questions of existence.</i>

641
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,491
These are the questions
which man has asked

642
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:19,704
ever since he first gazed at the stars
and dreamed.

643
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:24,333
<i>My Vulcan ancestors were ruled</i>
<i>by their emotions.</i>

644
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:29,589
<i>They felt with their hearts.</i>
<i>They made love with their hearts.</i>

645
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,800
<i>They believed with their hearts.</i>

646
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,678
But above all else,
they believed in a place

647
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,473
in which these questions of existence
would be answered.

648
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,895
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth,

649
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:48,524
a fantasy concocted by pagans.

650
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,111
<i>It is no fantasy, I tell you.</i>

651
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,989
<i>I tell you</i>

652
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:57,992
<i>it exists.</i>

653
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,537
My brothers, we have been chosen

654
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:06,792
to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

655
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:11,422
The discovery of Sha'Ka'Ree.

656
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,884
-ls it possible?
-ls what possible?

657
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:19,388
That he's found Sha'Ka'Ree.
The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

658
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,059
Our destination
is the planet Sha'Ka'Ree,

659
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,563
which lies beyond the Great Barrier

660
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,982
<i>at the centre of the galaxy.</i>

661
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,987
-The centre of the galaxy?
-Where Sha'Ka'Ree is fabled to exist.

662
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,990
But the centre of the galaxy
can't be reached.

663
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,742
No ship has ever gone
into the Great Barrier.

664
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,327
No probe has ever returned.

665
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,789
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
l have ever known.

666
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,333
Spock, my only concern
is getting the ship back.

667
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,293
When that's done and Sybok is in here,

668
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:53,172
then you can debate Sha'Ka'Ree
until you're green in the face.

669
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,260
Until then, you're either with me
or you're not.

670
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,846
-l am here, Captain.
-That's a little vague, Spock.

671
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:06,060
What's that noise?

672
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:12,441
l believe it is a primitive form
of communication

673
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,402
-known as Morse code.
-You're right.

674
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:17,697
l'm a little out of practise. That's an "S."

675
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:24,287
-"T."
-"A," "N," "D," end of word.

676
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:29,709
-"Stand."
-New word. "B," "A"...

677
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,170
"C," "K."

678
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,548
"Back." "Stand back."

679
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,966
-Stand back?
-Stand back?

680
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,639
What are you standing around for?

681
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,850
Do you not know a jail break
when you see one?

682
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,895
The bond between these three
is strong, difficult to penetrate.

683
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,064
This will be quite a challenge.

684
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,776
We've got to find them.

685
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:59,530
-Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
-lf we could send a distress signal...

686
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,157
There is an emergency
sending apparatus

687
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,199
in the forward observation room.

688
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,660
The only trouble is, it's up there.
We're down here.

689
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:07,747
You might be able to reach it by means
of turbo shaft number three,

690
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,709
which is closed for repairs.
lt's a long and dangerous climb.

691
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,337
Some of us get off
on long and dangerous climbs.

692
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,255
Mr Scott, get the transporter working.

693
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,341
lf we can contact a rescue ship,
we'll need it.

694
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,675
Which way to the turbo shaft?

695
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,303
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent
and turn right.

696
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,472
Then left at the blowscreen.
You can't miss it.

697
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,224
-Mr Scott, you're amazing.
-There's nothing amazing about it.

698
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:30,436
l know this ship
like the back of my hand.

699
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,115
All right. Look at it this way,
we'll get a good workout.

700
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,618
Yeah, or a heart attack.

701
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,183
Get Mr Scott to sickbay.

702
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,255
Jim, this is going to take me forever.

703
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,263
Where's Spock?

704
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,686
l believe l have found a faster way.

705
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,783
Bones?

706
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:10,744
You two go ahead.
l'll wait for the next car.

707
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,496
We're not splitting up.

708
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,922
-lt appears we're too heavy.
-Must be all those marsh melons.

709
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:25,968
Spock, the booster rockets.

710
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,429
lf l activate them now, Captain,
we'll be propelled upward

711
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,264
at an unbelievable rate.

712
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,640
Fire the rockets!

713
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:35,060
Captain, please come back down...

714
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,234
Hit the brakes!

715
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,368
l'm afraid l overshot the mark
by one level.

716
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,078
Nobody's perfect.

717
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,758
Spock.

718
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,554
Emergency channel open.

719
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,431
To anyone within the sound of my voice,

720
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:15,768
this is Captain James T. Kirk
of the Federation Starship Enterprise.

721
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,020
lf you read me, acknowledge.

722
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,606
Acknowledge.

723
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:25,986
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Command.
<i>We read you. Over.</i>

724
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,199
A hostile force has taken control
of our vessel

725
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,952
and put us on a direct course
with the Great Barrier.

726
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,454
Our coordinates are 0-0-0...

727
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,456
-Mark 2.
-...mark 2.

728
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,251
Request emergency assistance.
Acknowledge.

729
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:45,297
Understood, Enterprise. We are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

730
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,423
<i>Roger, Starfleet.</i>

731
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:49,176
Plot course zero-zero-zero, mark two.

732
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:55,057
But Captain, that course will take us
into the Barrier as well.

733
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,893
Where Kirk goes, we follow.

734
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,482
l trust your message was received.

735
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,069
You can't expect us to stand by while
you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

736
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,322
What you fear is the unknown.

737
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:16,537
The people of your planet
once believed their world was flat.

738
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,249
Columbus proved it was round.

739
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:25,337
They said the sound barrier could never
be broken. lt was broken.

740
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,425
They said warp speed
could not be achieved.

741
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:36,307
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

742
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:40,603
lt's an extension of personal fear.

743
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,772
Captain Kirk, l so much want
your understanding.

744
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:48,694
l want your respect.
Are you afraid to hear me out?

745
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,989
l'm afraid of nothing.

746
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,283
Wait outside.

747
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,002
l'm sure you have many questions.

748
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:09,757
Here, amidst the stars
of our own galaxy,

749
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,968
we shall seek the answers together.

750
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:26,482
Easy. Easy. Easy, Scotty. Easy.
You're back with us.

751
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,234
Uhura, l had the strangest dream.

752
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,278
l dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

753
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,947
Scotty, dear, he's not a madman.

754
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,616
-He's not?
-No.

755
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,702
Sybok has simply put us in touch

756
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:42,331
with feelings that we've always been
afraid to express.

757
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:47,002
-l have to get back to the transporter.
-No, no, no. Scotty! Scotty.

758
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,171
There's so much l want to tell you.

759
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:53,092
Maybe you could wait
till l'm a wee bit stronger.

760
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:57,221
l don't think l could take it
in my present condition.

761
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,850
Or yours.

762
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,894
Sha'Ka'Ree.

763
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,397
"The Source."

764
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,066
"Heaven."

765
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:11,860
"Eden."

766
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:16,031
Call it what you will.
The Klingons call it "Qui'Tu."

767
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,703
For the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor."
The Andorian word is...

768
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,080
ls unpronounceable.

769
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,958
Still, every culture in existence
shares this common dream

770
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:31,630
of a place from which creation sprang.
For us, that place will soon be reality.

771
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,801
The only reality l see is
that l'm a prisoner on my own ship.

772
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,972
What is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew?

773
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,309
l don't control minds. l free them.

774
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,273
How?

775
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,070
By making you face your pain,
and draw strength from it.

776
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:59,533
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

777
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:10,544
Sounds like brainwashing to me.

778
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,380
-Your pain is the deepest of all.
-What?

779
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,675
l can feel it. Can't you?

780
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,470
<i>Leonard.</i>

781
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,814
lt's some kind of trick.

782
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,194
<i>Leonard.</i>

783
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,157
Father?

784
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:44,244
-Oh, my God, don't do this to me.
-Leonard.

785
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:00,385
l'm here. l'm with you, Dad.

786
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:02,971
The pain.

787
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:05,974
Stop the pain.

788
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,894
l've done everything l can do.

789
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,939
You've got to hang on.

790
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,483
l can't stand the pain.

791
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,194
Help me.

792
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,241
All my knowledge, and l can't save him.

793
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:27,329
You've done all you can.
The support system will keep him alive.

794
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,460
You call this alive?

795
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,546
Son,

796
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:41,802
-release me.
-l can't do that, Dad.

797
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,516
But how?
How can l watch him suffer like this?

798
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,602
You're a doctor.

799
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,529
l'm his son.

800
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,637
Why did you do it?

801
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:15,562
To preserve his dignity.

802
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,277
That wasn't the worst of it.

803
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:23,362
-No.
-Was it?

804
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,863
-No!
-Share it.

805
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:30,619
Not long after, they found a cure.
A goddamn cure!

806
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,245
So if you hadn't killed him,
he might have lived.

807
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,123
No! l loved my father. l released him!

808
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,750
Then you did
what you thought was right.

809
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,794
Yes. No! Yes!

810
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,171
Release this pain. Release it!

811
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:45,926
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

812
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,306
Now you've taken the first step.

813
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,560
The other steps we'll take together.

814
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,987
Each man's pain is unique.

815
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,948
l hide no pain.

816
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,872
-l know you better than that.
-Do you?

817
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:18,667
-Spock, don't.
-lt's all right, Captain.

818
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,087
Proceed.

819
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:31,596
-What is this?
-l believe we are witnessing my birth.

820
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,011
Sarek, your son.

821
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,807
So human.

822
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:23,732
Spock?

823
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,796
-What have you done to my friends?
-l've done nothing.

824
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,840
This is who they are.
Didn't you know that?

825
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,511
No, l didn't.

826
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:56,181
-Now learn something about yourself.
-No. l refuse.

827
01:13:56,641 --> 01:14:00,435
-Jim, try to be open about this.
-About what?

828
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,940
That l've made
the wrong choices in my life?

829
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,234
That l turned left
when l should have turned right?

830
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,568
l know what my weaknesses are.

831
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,445
l don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of them.

832
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,280
lf you'd just unbend and allow yourself...

833
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,117
-And be brainwashed by this con man?
-l was wrong.

834
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:19,204
-This con man took away my pain.
-Damn it, Bones, you're a doctor.

835
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,831
You know that pain and guilt
can't be taken away

836
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:22,624
with the wave of a magic wand.

837
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:26,461
They're the things we carry with us,
the things that make us who we are.

838
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:29,131
lf we lose them, we lose ourselves.

839
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,342
l don't want my pain taken away.
l need my pain!

840
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:36,513
<i>Sybok, this is the Bridge.</i>
<i>We're in approach of the Great Barrier.</i>

841
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,142
Captain, l'm afraid
you'll have to remain here.

842
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,727
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

843
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:48,191
-Spock?
-l cannot go with you.

844
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:52,112
-Why not?
-l belong here.

845
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,739
l don't understand.

846
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:59,077
Sybok, you are my brother,
but you do not know me.

847
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:03,915
l am not the outcast boy
you left behind those many years ago.

848
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:08,795
Since that time, l have found myself,
and my place.

849
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,924
l know who l am.
And l cannot go with you.

850
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,267
l guess you'd better count me out, too.

851
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:27,981
-Then l'll see you on the other side.
-Wait!

852
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,362
You know we'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

853
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:38,366
But if we do, will that convince you
that my vision was true?

854
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,287
-Your vision?
-Given to me by God.

855
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,916
He waits for us on the other side.

856
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,377
You are mad.

857
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,466
Am l?

858
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,303
We'll see.

859
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,666
They say no ship can survive this.

860
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,460
l say they're wrong.
l say that danger is an illusion.

861
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,545
We have no instrument readings.

862
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:36,049
-ls it there or isn't it?
-Mr Sulu, full ahead.

863
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,593
Full ahead. Aye.

864
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,361
ls it possible?

865
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,196
Fascinating.

866
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,743
Are we dreaming?

867
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:50,874
lf we are, then life is a dream.

868
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:21,112
lnstruments back online.

869
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:27,952
lncredible. There is a power source
emanating from the planet

870
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,789
like nothing l have ever seen.

871
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:36,878
Sha'Ka'Ree.

872
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,630
Qui'Tu.

873
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,423
Vorta Vor.

874
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,635
Eden.

875
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,483
About the ship...

876
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,778
-The ship needs its captain.
-No special conditions?

877
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:03,988
No conditions.

878
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:08,785
What makes you think
l won't turn us around?

879
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,663
Because you, too, must know.

880
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:19,754
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

881
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,674
Mr Chekov, you take the conn.
Mr Sulu, standard orbital approach.

882
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,636
Uhura, alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

883
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,847
Sybok, Spock, Dr McCoy,
come with me.

884
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,849
The rest of you remain onboard

885
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,519
until l've determined
what it is we're dealing with.

886
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,898
Well, don't just stand there.
God's a busy man.

887
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,451
l am no longer in control of the craft.

888
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,282
All right. We'll play it your way.

889
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,400
Amazing.

890
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,652
The land. The sky.

891
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,989
Just as l knew it would be.

892
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,495
Scotty, you gotta see this.

893
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,289
l don't have the time.

894
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,791
The Captain told me
to get this transporter working,

895
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,044
and l'm not about to let him down.

896
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,764
We have travelled far

897
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:28,521
by starship.

898
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,824
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

899
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:43,786
We have a...

900
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:56,257
Sybok.

901
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,846
Perhaps...

902
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:23,112
<i>Brave souIs, weIcome.</i>

903
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,121
ls this the voice of God?

904
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:37,251
<i>One voice, many faces.</i>

905
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:53,184
<i>Does this better suit your expectations?</i>

906
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,911
<i>It is I.</i>

907
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:17,041
<i>The journey you undertook to reach me</i>
<i>could not have been an easy one.</i>

908
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,544
lt was not. The Barrier stood
between us, but we breached it.

909
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,339
<i>Magnificent.</i>

910
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,009
<i>You are the first to find me.</i>

911
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,554
We sought only your infinite wisdom.

912
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:33,766
<i>And how did you breach the Barrier?</i>

913
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:35,559
With a starship.

914
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,353
<i>This starship,</i>

915
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:43,734
<i>could it carry my wisdom</i>
<i>beyond the Barrier?</i>

916
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,320
lt could. Yes.

917
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:49,073
<i>Then I shall make use of this starship.</i>

918
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,117
lt will be your chariot!

919
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,077
Excuse me.

920
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,998
<i>It will carry my power</i>
<i>to every corner of creation.</i>

921
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:00,167
Excuse me.
l'd just like to ask a question.

922
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,171
What does God need with a starship?

923
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,091
<i>Bring the ship closer.</i>

924
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:11,804
l said, what does God need
with a starship?

925
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,850
-Jim, what are you doing?
-l'm asking a question.

926
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,687
<i>-Who is this creature?</i>
-Who am l?

927
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:25,151
-Don't you know? Aren't you God?
-He has his doubts.

928
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,611
<i>You doubt me?</i>

929
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,697
l seek proof.

930
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,743
Jim, you don't ask the Almighty
for his lD.

931
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,829
<i>Then here is the proof you seek.</i>

932
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:51,844
-Why is God angry?
-Why?

933
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:56,015
-Why have you done this to my friend?
<i>-He doubts me.</i>

934
01:29:56,558 --> 01:30:00,144
You have not answered his question.
What does God need with a starship?

935
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:11,989
<i>Do you doubt me?</i>

936
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:24,251
l doubt any God
who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.

937
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:28,506
Stop! The God of Sha'Ka'Ree
would not do this.

938
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,467
<i>Sha'Ka'Ree?</i>

939
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:34,720
<i>A vision you created.</i>

940
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:42,812
<i>An eternity I've been imprisoned</i>
<i>in this place.</i>

941
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,106
<i>The ship.</i>

942
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:48,526
<i>I must have the ship.</i>

943
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:54,365
<i>Now, give me what I want.</i>

944
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:58,536
Sybok, this is not
the God of Sha'Ka'Ree,

945
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:01,247
or any other God.

946
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:05,084
l don't understand.
Reveal yourself to me.

947
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:19,181
<i>What's wrong? Don't you like this face?</i>
<i>I have so many.</i>

948
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:21,809
<i>But this one suits you best.</i>

949
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:25,271
No, no, it's not possible.

950
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,524
<i>Bring me the ship, or I will destroy you.</i>

951
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,737
-The ship.
<i>-Bring it closer,</i>

952
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:38,784
<i>so that I mightjoin with it.</i>

953
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,412
<i>Do it,</i>

954
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:49,420
<i>or watch these puny things die horribly.</i>

955
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,970
-What have l done?
-Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully.

956
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,763
-Spock.
-Sybok.

957
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:03,184
This is my doing.
This is my arrogance, my vanity.

958
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:06,687
-Sybok, we must find a way...
-No! You must save yourselves.

959
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,273
Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

960
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,032
-l couldn't help but notice your pain.
<i>-My pain?</i>

961
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:20,451
lt runs deep. Share it with me.

962
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:26,624
Enterprise, are you ready?

963
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,460
ln firing position. Torpedo armed.

964
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,129
But, Captain,
we're firing directly on your position.

965
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:33,923
Send it down, Mr Chekov. Now!

966
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,516
Run! Go!

967
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,244
Sybok.

968
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:11,502
Let's get out of here.

969
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:16,715
Sulu, l've lost them.

970
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,203
Spock, get us out of here.

971
01:33:57,841 --> 01:33:59,925
Thrusters are inoperative.

972
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:17,818
-Mr Scott.
<i>-Scotty here, sir.</i>

973
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,195
Please tell me
the transporter is working.

974
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,282
She's got partial power, sir.
l might be able to take two of you.

975
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,743
Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy. Now.

976
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:27,703
Now, just a damn minute.

977
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,335
Thank you, Mr Scott.
Bring up the Captain.

978
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,419
All right.

979
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,155
What about Jim?
We can't just leave him down there.

980
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:06,033
Please get a grip on yourself, Doctor.
Status report.

981
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:08,702
Klingon captain wishes
to name his terms, Mr Spock.

982
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:10,371
On screen.

983
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:14,249
<i>This is Captain Klaa</i>
<i>of the Klingon Empire.</i>

984
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:17,628
<i>Attempt to raise shields</i>
<i>or arm weapons,</i>

985
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,089
<i>and I will destroy you.</i>

986
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,633
<i>You are alive for a single reason.</i>

987
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,677
<i>The renegade James T. Kirk.</i>

988
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:29,556
<i>Hand him over,</i>
<i>and I will spare your lives.</i>

989
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,435
<i>My transporter stands ready</i>
<i>to beam him aboard.</i>

990
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,147
-Captain Kirk is not among us.
<i>-You Iie.</i>

991
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:43,070
l'm a Vulcan. l'm incapable of lying.
Captain Kirk is on the planet below.

992
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:44,863
<i>Then give me his coordinates!</i>

993
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:53,664
General, l am in need
of your assistance.

994
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:55,416
My assistance?

995
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,835
You are his superior officer.

996
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:03,465
-l am a foolish old man.
-Damn you, sir. You will try.

997
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,309
<i>Klingon Commander,</i>
<i>someone wishes to speak with you.</i>

998
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,528
So it's me you want,
you Klingon bastards.

999
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,573
What are you waiting for?

1000
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:36,642
Release him!

1001
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:40,604
Kirk, my junior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

1002
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:50,656
l apologise.

1003
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:02,125
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

1004
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:07,214
Kirk, and now,

1005
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,134
may l present our new gunner?

1006
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:21,645
Spock?

1007
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,358
Welcome aboard, Captain.

1008
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:38,078
-l thought l was going to die.
-Not possible.

1009
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,581
You were never alone.

1010
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:49,214
Please, Captain,
not in front of the Klingons.

1011
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,363
Would you care for a wee nip
of Scotch whisky?

1012
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:19,286
l never thought l'd ever be drinking
with a Klingon.

1013
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,747
What are you two conspiring about?

1014
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:25,667
We were just saying how far we've
come in such a short space of time.

1015
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:27,210
We certainly have.

1016
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:33,675
She has wonderful muscles.

1017
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:56,531
-Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?
-We were speculating.

1018
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:59,326
ls God really out there?

1019
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,915
Maybe he's not out there, Bones.

1020
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,669
Maybe he's right here.
Human heart.

1021
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:18,011
-Spock?
-l was thinking of Sybok.

1022
01:40:19,097 --> 01:40:22,265
-l've lost a brother.
