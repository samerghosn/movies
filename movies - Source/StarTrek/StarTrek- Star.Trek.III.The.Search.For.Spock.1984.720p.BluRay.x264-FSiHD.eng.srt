2
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,483
Don't grieve, Admiral.

3
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,778
It is logical.

4
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,576
The needs of the many outweigh...

5
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,832
The needs of the few.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,542
Or the one.

7
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:50,466
And I have been,
and always shall be, your friend.

8
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,557
Live long and prosper.

9
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,814
<i>We are assembled here today</i>

10
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,067
<i>to pay final respects
to our honoured dead.</i>

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,489
<i>This death takes place
in the shadow of new life,</i>

12
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,867
<i>the sunrise of a new world,</i>

13
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>a world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect and nourish.</i>

14
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,001
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one.

15
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,841
Of my friend, I can only say this.

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,348
Of all the souls
I have encountered in my travels,

17
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,186
his was the most

18
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,024
human.

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,444
Honours.

20
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,760
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,683
<i>These are the continuing voyages
ofthe Starship Enterprise.</i>

22
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:29,564
<i>Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,</i>

23
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,194
<i>to seek out new Iife forms
and new civiIisations,</i>

24
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:41,701
<i>to boldly go
where no man has gone before.</i>

25
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,413
<i>U.S.S. Enterprise,
Captain's personal log.</i>

26
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,418
<i>With most of our battle damage
repaired, we're almost home,</i>

27
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,090
<i>yet I feel uneasy,</i>

28
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,466
<i>and I wonder why.</i>

29
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,433
<i>Perhaps it is the emptiness
of this vessel.</i>

30
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,439
<i>Most of our trainee crew
have been reassigned.</i>

31
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,067
<i>Lieutenant Saavik and my son David
are exploring the Genesis planet,</i>

32
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,819
<i>which he helped create,</i>

33
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:06,740
<i>and Enterprise feels like a house
with all the children gone.</i>

34
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,702
<i>No. More empty even than that.</i>

35
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,958
<i>The death of Spock
is like an open wound.</i>

36
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,879
<i>It seems that I have left
the noblest part of myself back there</i>

37
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,716
<i>on that newborn planet.</i>

38
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,261
Status, Mr Sulu.

39
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,139
On course, Admiral.
Estimating spacedock in 2.1 hours.

40
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:34,185
Very well. Mr Chekov,
I'll need a pre-approach scan.

41
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,687
Take the science station, please.

42
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,814
-Yes, sir.
-Uhura.

43
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,569
Any response from Starfleet
on our Project Genesis inquiries?

44
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,653
No, sir. There is no response.

45
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,947
That's very odd.

46
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,411
Scotty, progress report.

47
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,120
It's almost done, sir.

48
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,749
You'll be fully automated
by the time we dock.

49
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,834
Your timing is excellent, Mr Scott.

50
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,379
You fixed the barn door
after the horse has come home.

51
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,382
How much refit time
till we can take her out again?

52
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,591
<i>Eight weeks, sir,</i>

53
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:09,136
but you don't have eight weeks,
so I'll do it for you in two.

54
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,307
Mr Scott, have you always
multiplied your repair estimates

55
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,682
by a factor of four?

56
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,730
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep
my reputation as a miracle-worker?

57
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,940
<i>Your reputation is secure, Scotty.</i>

58
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,569
Mr Sulu, take the conn.
I'll be in my quarters.

59
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,029
Aye, sir.

60
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,406
Sir?

61
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,745
I was wondering, are they planning
a ceremony when we get in?

62
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,622
I mean a reception?

63
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,834
A hero's welcome, son,
is that what you'd like?

64
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,877
Well, God knows there should be.

65
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,007
This time we've paid for the party
with our dearest blood.

66
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,668
Steady. Steady, boys.

67
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,004
Keep scanning.

68
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,677
I thought you people were reliable.
Where the hell is he?

69
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:36,056
He's been here for some time.
Put me on hailing frequency.

70
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,437
Commander Kruge, this is Valkris.

71
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,940
I have purchased the Genesis data.

72
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,567
Ready to transmit.

73
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,363
<i>Well done, Valkris. Well done.</i>

74
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,282
What the hell is...

75
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,075
Disengage cloaking device!

76
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,885
Transmit data.

77
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:15,678
Now!

78
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,195
Transmission completed.

79
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,783
You will find it useful.

80
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,828
Then you have seen it?

81
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,331
I have, my lord.

82
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,125
Unfortunate.

83
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,711
Understood.

84
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,929
Thrusters.

85
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,902
What the hell's going on?
When do I get paid off?

86
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,697
Soon, Captain. Quite soon.

87
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,330
Success my lord.

88
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,666
and my love.

89
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,129
You will be remembered with honour.

90
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,174
Fire!

91
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,400
New course, Federation neutral zone.

92
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,865
Feed him!

93
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,533
Yes, my lord.

94
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:34,067
Approach control, this is Enterprise.
Ready for docking manoeuvre.

95
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,903
Enterprise is cleared to dock.

96
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,279
Lock on.

97
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,494
Systems locked.

98
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,581
Spacedock, you have control.

99
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:51,501
<i>Affirmative, Enterprise.
Enjoy the ride, and welcome home.</i>

100
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,379
Enterprise confirms.

101
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>Moving in.</i>

102
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,198
<i>Acknowledged. Doors closing.</i>

103
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,582
Would you look at that.

104
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:36,129
My friends, the great experiment,

105
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,048
<i>the Excelsior,</i>

106
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,677
ready for trial runs.

107
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,557
She's supposed to have
transwarp drive.

108
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:52,145
Aye, and if my grandmother had wheels,
she'd be a wagon.

109
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,732
Come, come, Mr Scott.
Young minds, fresh ideas. Be tolerant.

110
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,779
<i>-Acknowledged. Doors are closing.
-Updating.</i>

111
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,597
Stand by umbilical and gravitational
support systems.

112
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:31,058
Aye, sir. Moorings activated.
All systems standing by.

113
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,312
Admiral, this is not possible.

114
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,855
Mr Chekov?

115
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,110
An energy reading from C-deck,
from inside Mr Spock's quarters.

116
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,654
I ordered Spock's quarters sealed.

117
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,908
Yes, sir. I sealed the room myself.

118
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,911
Nevertheless, I am reading
a life form there.

119
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,663
This entire crew seems
on the edge of obsessive behaviour

120
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,373
concerning Mr Spock.

121
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,423
Sir, security reports the door
to Spock's quarters has been forced.

122
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,217
I'm on my way.
Mr Sulu, continue docking procedure.

123
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,594
Aye, sir.

124
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,643
Jim, help me.

125
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,317
You left me on Genesis.

126
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,528
Why did you do that?

127
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,489
Help me.

128
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,120
Bones.

129
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,667
What the hell are you doing?

130
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,336
Have you lost your mind?

131
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,215
Help me, Jim. Take me home.

132
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,052
Bones, we are. We are home.

133
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,350
Then perhaps it's not too late.
Climb the steps, Jim.

134
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,980
Climb the steps of Mount Seleya.

135
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,649
Mount Seleya?

136
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:50,157
Bones, Mount Seleya is on Vulcan.
We're home, on Earth.

137
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,411
Remember.

138
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,456
<i>Admiral, docking is completed.</i>

139
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,960
<i>Starfleet Commander Morrow
is on his way for inspection.</i>

140
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,546
Uhura, get the medics down here!

141
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,423
Get them now!

142
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,600
You've all done remarkable service
under the most difficult conditions.

143
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,811
You'll be receiving
Starfleet's highest commendation,

144
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,105
and more importantly,
extended shore leave.

145
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,485
That is, all but you, Mr Scott.

146
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,071
They need your wisdom
on the new Excelsior.

147
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,240
Report there tomorrow
as captain of engineering.

148
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,326
With all appreciation, sir,

149
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,495
I'd prefer to supervise
the refit of Enterprise.

150
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,623
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.

151
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,500
But, sir...

152
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,504
I'm sorry, Mr Scott,
but there will be no refit.

153
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,924
Admiral, I don't understand.

154
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,303
-The Enterprise is not...
-Jim, the Enterprise is 20 years old.

155
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,764
We feel her day is over.

156
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,475
But we had requested...

157
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,021
We'd hoped to take her back
to Genesis.

158
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,816
That is out of the question.

159
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,401
May I ask why?

160
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,153
ln your absence, Genesis has become
a galactic controversy.

161
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:17,827
Until the Federation Council
makes policy,

162
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:23,541
you are all under orders not to discuss
with anyone your knowledge of Genesis.

163
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:29,256
Consider it a quarantined planet
and a forbidden subject.

164
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,559
<i>To fully understand
the events on which I report,</i>

165
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,854
<i>it is necessary to review
the theoretical data</i>

166
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,521
<i>on the Genesis device,</i>

167
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:48,482
<i>as developed
by Doctors Carol and David Marcus.</i>

168
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,570
<i>Genesis, simply put,
is life from lifelessness.</i>

169
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:55,365
<i>It was the intention to introduce
the Genesis device</i>

170
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,910
<i>into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body,</i>

171
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,078
<i>a moon or other dead form.</i>

172
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,248
<i>The device, when delivered,</i>

173
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,375
<i>would instantaneously cause
the Genesis effect.</i>

174
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,088
<i>Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet now exists,</i>

175
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:16,219
<i>capable of sustaining whatever
life forms we see fit to deposit on it.</i>

176
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,152
So?

177
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,113
Speak.

178
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:41,452
Great power to control, dominate.

179
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,455
Speak.

180
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,250
Impressive. They can make planets.

181
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,422
Oh, yes.
New cities, homes in the country,

182
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,674
your woman at your side,
children playing at your feet,

183
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,221
and overhead, fluttering in the breeze,
the flag of the Federation.

184
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,932
Charming.

185
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,808
Station.

186
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,352
Yes, my lord.

187
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,233
-Share this with no one.
-Understood, my lord.

188
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,612
We are going to this planet.

189
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,991
Even as our emissaries negotiate
for peace with the Federation,

190
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,037
we will act
for the preservation of our race.

191
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,915
We will seize the secret of this weapon,

192
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,126
the secret of ultimate power.

193
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,922
Success, my lord.

194
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,948
We have reached destination planet
at .035.

195
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,116
Very well, Lieutenant.

196
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,953
Helm, execute standard
orbital approach.

197
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,038
Standard orbit. Aye, sir.

198
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,790
Communications,

199
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,670
send a coded message
for Starfleet Commander, priority one.

200
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,923
Federation science vessel Grissom
arriving Genesis planet,

201
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,092
Mutara Sector to begin research.

202
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,969
J.T. Esteban, commanding.

203
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,887
Aye, sir. Coding now.

204
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,891
Dr Marcus, it's your planet.

205
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,476
Begin scanning, please.

206
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,480
This is where the fun begins, Saavik.

207
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,859
Just like your father, so human.

208
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,364
All units functional. Recorders are on.
Scanning Sector 1 .

209
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,326
Foliage in fully-developed
state of growth.

210
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,038
Temperature, 22.2 Celsius.

211
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,542
Sector 2 indicating desert terrain.
Minimal vegetation.

212
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,005
Temperature, 39.4.

213
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,008
Sector 3, subtropical vegetation.

214
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,179
Temperature decreasing rapidly.

215
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:11,185
It's snow.
Snow in the same sector. Fantastic.

216
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:13,145
Fascinating.

217
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,067
All the varieties of land and weather
known to Earth within a few hours' walk.

218
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,818
Metallic mass.

219
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:21,528
Close-range scan.

220
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:28,369
A photon tube.
Gravitational fields were in flux.

221
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,622
lt must have soft-landed.

222
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:32,499
ln code to Starfleet.

223
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,710
Captain Spock's tube located
on Genesis' surface.

224
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,046
Yes, sir. Coding your message.

225
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,719
I don't believe it.

226
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,305
What is it?

227
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:53,228
If equipment is functioning properly,
indications are an animal life form.

228
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,148
-You said there wouldn't be any.
-There shouldn't be any.

229
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,737
Cross-referenced and verified.
An unidentifiable life-form reading.

230
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,324
-Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
-Wait a minute.

231
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,035
We don't know
what we're talking about here.

232
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,413
-Why don't we beam it up?
-Oh, no, you don't.

233
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,790
Regulations specifically state,
"Nothing shall be beamed aboard

234
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,585
"until danger of contamination
has been eliminated."

235
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,587
Captain, the logical alternative
is obvious.

236
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,257
Beaming down
to the surface is permitted.

237
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,509
lf the Captain decides
that the mission is vital

238
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,303
and reasonably free of danger.

239
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,890
Captain, please, we'll take the risk,
but we've got to find out what it is.

240
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,974
Or who.

241
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,772
Absent friends.

242
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,112
Admiral, what's gonna happen
to the Enterprise?

243
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,865
-She's to be decommissioned.
-Will we get another ship?

244
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,784
I can't get an answer.

245
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,621
Starfleet is up to its brass
in a galactic conference.

246
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,041
No one has time
for those who only stand and wait.

247
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,377
Sir, about Dr McCoy, how is he?

248
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,213
Well, that's the good news.
He's home, resting comfortably,

249
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,299
pumped full of tranquilisers.

250
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,760
They say it's exhaustion.

251
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,430
He promised me he'd stay put.
Well, we'll see.

252
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:11,890
Mr Scott.

253
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,308
Come.

254
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,945
Sarek!

255
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,118
Ambassador, I had no idea
you were here.

256
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,329
I believe you know my crew.

257
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,665
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

258
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,796
Please excuse us.

259
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,594
Ambassador,
I would have come to Vulcan

260
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,179
to express my deepest sympathies...

261
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:54,766
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk.
I have been to your government.

262
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:58,394
I have seen the Genesis information
and your own report.

263
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,564
Then you know how bravely
your son met his death.

264
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,025
Why did you leave him on Genesis?

265
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,113
Spock trusted you,
and you denied him his future.

266
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:14,368
-I saw no future.
-Only his body was in death, Kirk,

267
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,288
and you were the last one
to be with him.

268
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,373
Yes, I was.

269
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,416
And you must know that you should
have come with him to Vulcan.

270
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,378
-But why?
-Because he asked you to.

271
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,132
He entrusted you

272
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,054
with his very essence,
with everything that was not of the body.

273
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,223
He asked you to bring him to us

274
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:42,230
and to bring that which he gave you,
his katra, his living spirit.

275
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,816
Sir.

276
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,738
Your son meant more to me
than you can know.

277
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,367
I'd have given my life
if it would have saved his.

278
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:58,954
Believe me when I tell you,
he made no request of me.

279
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,040
He would not have spoken of it openly.

280
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,378
-Then how...
-Kirk, I must have your thoughts.

281
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,382
May I join your mind?

282
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:13,928
Certainly.

283
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,782
He spoke of your friendship.

284
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,869
Yes.

285
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,958
He asked you not to grieve.

286
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,753
Yes.

287
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,798
The needs of the many

288
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,677
outweigh...

289
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,891
The needs of the few.

290
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,434
Or the one.

291
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,897
Spock.

292
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,526
I have been,

293
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,154
and always shall be,

294
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,740
your friend.

295
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:22,329
Live long and prosper.

296
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
No.

297
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,057
Forgive me.

298
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,685
lt is not here.

299
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,023
I had assumed
he mind-melded with you.

300
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,444
lt is the Vulcan way
when the body's end is near.

301
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,531
We were separate.

302
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,118
He couldn't touch me.

303
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,037
I see.

304
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,585
Then everything that he was,

305
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,588
everything he knew,

306
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,093
is lost.

307
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,895
Please wait.

308
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,319
He would have found a way.
lf there was that much at stake,

309
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,739
Spock would have found a way.

310
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,075
Yes. But how?

311
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,954
What if he joined with someone else?

312
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,837
<i>Engine room, flight recorder visual.
Stardate 8128.78.</i>

313
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,963
Go.

314
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,009
<i>The ship.</i>

315
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,595
<i>Out of danger?</i>

316
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,056
Yes.

317
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,932
Back .77.

318
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,480
<i>Flight recorder visual 28.77.</i>

319
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,855
Go.

320
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,192
<i>No! You'll flood the whole compartment.</i>

321
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,319
<i>-He'll die.
-Kirk! He's dead already.</i>

322
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,989
Back .76.

323
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,538
<i>Flight recorder visual 28.76.</i>

324
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,789
Go.

325
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,958
<i>You're not going in there.</i>

326
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,462
<i>Perhaps you're right.
What is Mr Scott's condition?</i>

327
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,382
<i>Well, I don't think that he...</i>

328
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,968
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor.
I have no time to discuss this logically.</i>

329
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,763
Freeze.

330
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,809
Repeat and augment.

331
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,522
<i>Remember.</i>

332
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:02,740
-McCoy!
-One alive, one not, yet both in pain.

333
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,159
What must I do?

334
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,038
You must bring them to Mount Seleya
on Vulcan.

335
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,290
Only there can both find peace.

336
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:18,005
What you ask is difficult.

337
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,843
You will find a way, Kirk.

338
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:28,598
lf you honour them both, you must.

339
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,810
I will.

340
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,021
I swear.

341
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,322
Transporter Room,
stand by to energise.

342
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,907
Aye, sir. Energising now.

343
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,594
Grissom to Saavik.

344
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,012
We're picking up radiation
from the life form.

345
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,932
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings
are well below danger level.

346
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,394
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant.

347
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,440
This landing is Captain's discretion,
and I'm the one who's out on a limb.

348
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,233
I'll try to remember that, Captain.

349
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,044
There are your life forms.

350
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,462
These were microbes
on the tube's surface.

351
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,964
We shot them here from Enterprise.

352
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,927
They were fruitful and multiplied.

353
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,846
But how could they have
evolved so quickly?

354
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,944
Saavik.

355
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,123
What is it?

356
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,792
Spock's burial robe.

357
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,813
No. Absolutely not, Jim.
You're my best officer,

358
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,066
but I am Commander, Starfleet,
so I don't break rules.

359
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,194
Don't quote rules to me.
I'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice.

360
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,865
One man who's died for us,
another with deep emotional problems.

361
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,494
Now wait a minute.
This business about Spock and McCoy,

362
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,583
honestly, I never understood
Vulcan mysticism.

363
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:03,170
You don't have to believe.
I'm not even sure that I believe,

364
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,549
but if there's even a chance
that Spock has an eternal soul,

365
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,679
-then it's my responsibility.
-Yours?

366
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,182
As surely as if it were my very own.

367
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,480
Give me back the Enterprise.
With Scotty's help I could...

368
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,151
No, Jim. The Enterprise would never
stand the pounding, and you know it.

369
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,444
Then I'll find a ship. I'll hire a ship.

370
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,864
Out of the question, my friend.

371
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,492
The council has ordered that no one
but the science team goes to Genesis.

372
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:39,332
Jim, your life and your career
stand for rationality,

373
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,125
not for intellectual chaos.

374
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,836
Keep up this emotional behaviour
and you'll lose everything.

375
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,758
You'll destroy yourself.
Do you understand me, Jim?

376
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,385
I hear you.

377
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,266
-I had to try.
-Of course.

378
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,728
-Thanks for the drink.
-Anytime.

379
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:11,154
-The word, sir?
-The word is no.

380
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,906
I am therefore going anyway.

381
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,992
-You can count on our help, sir.
-Thank you, Mr Sulu. I'll need it.

382
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,369
Shall I alert Dr McCoy?

383
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,288
Please. He has a long journey
ahead of him.

384
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,730
Long time, Doc.

385
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,609
Yeah. Anybody been looking for me?

386
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,697
I have, but what's the use?
What'll it be?

387
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,365
Altair water.

388
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,659
That's not your usual poison.

389
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,374
To expect one to order poison in a bar
is not logical.

390
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,250
Got it.

391
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,304
To your planet, welcome.

392
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,061
I think that's my line, stranger.

393
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,606
Forgive. I here am new,

394
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:32,737
but you are known,
being McCoy from Enterprise.

395
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:41,036
-You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
-I name not important. You seek l.

396
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:46,500
Message received.
Available ship stands by.

397
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,800
-How much and how soon?
-How soon is now. How much is where.

398
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,804
Somewhere in the Mutara Sector.

399
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:05,728
Mutara restricted.
Take permits many. Money more.

400
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,190
There aren't going to be
any damn permits.

401
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:12,985
How can you get a permit
to do a damn illegal thing?

402
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:17,030
Look, price you name, money I got.

403
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,161
Place you name. Money I name.
Otherwise, bargain no.

404
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,123
All right, damn it. It's Genesis.

405
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,833
The name of the place we're going
is Genesis!

406
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,961
-Genesis?
-Yes, Genesis!

407
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,132
How can you be deaf
with ears like that?

408
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:39,010
Genesis allowed is not.
ls planet forbidden!

409
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,472
Look, my backwards friend,

410
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,974
Genesis may be planet forbidden,
but I'm damn well...

411
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,896
Sir, I'm sorry, but your voice is carrying.

412
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,817
I don't think you want to be discussing
this subject in public.

413
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,152
I'll discuss what I like,
and who in the hell are you?

414
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,322
Could I offer you a ride home,
Dr McCoy?

415
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:01,282
Where's the logic in offering me
a ride home, you idiot?

416
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,492
lf I wanted a ride home,

417
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,829
would I be trying
to charter a space flight?

418
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,751
-How in the hell do you know who I am?
-Federation security, sir.

419
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,137
You're gonna get a nice long rest,
Doctor.

420
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,536
Saavik to Grissom.

421
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,581
We are definitely reading
a second life form.

422
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,293
<i>We concur.
Proceed with caution, Saavik.</i>

423
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,965
What the hell is going on down there?

424
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,675
Make it quick, Admiral.

425
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,596
They're moving him
to the Federation funny farm.

426
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,891
Yes, poor friend.
I hear he's fruity as a nut cake.

427
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,434
Two minutes.

428
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,692
Jim.

429
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,237
-How many fingers do I have up?
-That's not very damn funny.

430
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,909
-Your sense of humour's returned.
-The hell it has. What's that?

431
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:28,661
-Lexorin.
-Lexorin? What for?

432
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,583
You're suffering from
a Vulcan mind-meld, Doctor.

433
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,376
That green-blooded son of a bitch.

434
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,632
It's his revenge
for all those arguments he lost.

435
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,009
Let me see your hand.

436
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,846
This will make you
well enough to travel.

437
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,474
Where's Admiral Kirk?

438
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,434
-He's with the prisoner.
-Get him quickly.

439
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,271
Commander, Starfleet wants him
right away.

440
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:01,445
Keeping you busy?

441
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,244
Don't get smart, Tiny.

442
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:14,708
-Admiral, Starfleet...
-This man's sick. Here, take a look.

443
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,547
Side elevator. Agents on their way up.

444
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,141
Don't call me Tiny.

445
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,148
Unit two, this is unit one.

446
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,858
The Kobayashi Maru has set sail
for the promised land.

447
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,027
<i>-Acknowledge.
-Message acknowledged.</i>

448
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,239
<i>All units will be informed.</i>

449
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:50,159
-You're taking me to the promised land?
-What are friends for?

450
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,880
-Mr Scott, calling it a night?
-Yes, sir.

451
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,548
Turning in myself.
Looking forward to breaking

452
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,800
some of the Enterprise's
speed records tomorrow.

453
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,429
Yes, sir. Good night.

454
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,141
<i>-Level, please.
-Transporter Room.</i>

455
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,851
<i>-Thank you.
-Up your shaft.</i>

456
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,940
Roger. Old City Station at 2200 hours.
All is well.

457
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,193
<i>Understood. All stations clear.</i>

458
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,862
-You amaze me, Commander.
-How is that?

459
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,697
A 20-year space veteran,

460
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,284
yet you choose
the worst duty station in town.

461
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:34,788
I mean, look at this place.
This is the hind end of space.

462
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,250
Peace and quiet
appeals to me, Lieutenant.

463
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,753
Yeah, well, maybe that's okay
for someone like you,

464
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,172
whose career is winding down,

465
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,259
but me, I need some challenge
in my life, some adventure,

466
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,012
maybe even just a surprise or two.

467
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,556
Well, you know what they say,
Lieutenant.

468
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,684
Be careful what you wish for.
You may get it.

469
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,523
Good evening, Commander.
ls everything ready?

470
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,942
Step into my parlour, gentlemen.

471
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,320
That's Admiral Kirk. My God!

472
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,237
Very good for you, Lieutenant.

473
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,659
But it's damn irregular.
No destination orders, no encoded lDs.

474
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,244
-All true.
-Well, what are we gonna do about it?

475
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm not gonna do anything about it,
but you're gonna sit in the closet.

476
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:23,503
The closet? What, have you lost
all your sense of reality?

477
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,130
This isn't reality.

478
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,469
This is fantasy.
You wanted adventure, how's this?

479
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,389
The old adrenaline going? Good boy.
Now get in the closet.

480
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,682
Okay.

481
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,603
Go on. Go on.

482
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,856
I'll just get in the closet.

483
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,398
Okay!

484
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,322
-I'm glad you're on our side.
-Can you handle that?

485
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:53,492
I'll have "Mr. Adventure"
eating out of my hand, sir,

486
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,036
and I'll see all of you at the rendezvous.

487
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,204
And, Admiral,

488
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:00,748
all my hopes.

489
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:23,813
As promised, she's all yours, sir.
All systems automated and ready.

490
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,067
A chimpanzee and two trainees
could run her.

491
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,237
Thank you, Mr Scott,
I'll try not to take that personally.

492
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:37,577
My friends,
I can't ask you to go any further.

493
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,956
Dr McCoy and I have to do this.
The rest of you do not.

494
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,583
Admiral, we're losing precious time.

495
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,420
What course, please, Admiral?

496
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,755
Mr Scott?

497
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,050
I'd be grateful, Admiral,
if you'd give the word.

498
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,179
Gentlemen,

499
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:00,766
may the wind be at our backs.
Stations, please.

500
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,898
-Engage all the systems.
-Aye, engaged!

501
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,525
-Clear all moorings.
-Cleared, sir.

502
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,777
One-quarter impulse power.

503
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,322
One-quarter impulse.

504
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,755
Sir, Commander, Starfleet
on emergency channel.

505
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,090
He orders you to surrender this vessel.

506
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,135
-No reply, Chekov.
-Aye, sir.

507
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,969
Steady as she goes, Sulu.

508
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,811
<i>Yellow alert. Captain to the Bridge.
Yellow alert.</i>

509
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,815
Bridge, this is the Captain.

510
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,235
How can you have
a yellow alert in spacedock?

511
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,070
Sir, someone is stealing the Enterprise.

512
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,157
I'm on my way.

513
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:06,666
<i>Alert. Yellow alert.
All stations, yellow alert.</i>

514
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,172
One minute to spacedoors.

515
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,425
Are you just gonna walk through them?

516
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,510
Calm yourself, Doctor.

517
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,480
Sir, Excelsior powering up
with orders to pursue.

518
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,356
<i>Yellow alert.</i>

519
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,025
<i>-Status?
-Yellow alert.</i>

520
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,905
All automates ready and functioning.
Automatic moorings retracted.

521
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,949
All speeds available
through transwarp drive.

522
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,742
lncredible machine.

523
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,204
Helm.

524
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,208
One-quarter impulse power.

525
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,590
Thirty seconds to spacedoors.

526
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:02,681
<i>Warning. Secure spacedoors.</i>

527
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,516
<i>-Warning. Secure spacedoors.
-And...</i>

528
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,476
-Now, Mr Scott.
-Sir?

529
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,315
-The doors, Mr Scott.
-Aye, sir. I'm working on it.

530
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:18,322
<i>Danger. Spacedoors are closed.
Danger.</i>

531
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,409
<i>Danger. Spacedoors are closed.</i>

532
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,976
We have cleared spacedoors.

533
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,284
-Full impulse power.
-Aye, sir.

534
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,795
Stand by tractor beam.

535
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,545
Tractor beam, aye.

536
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:21,425
lf he tries to get away with warp drive,
he's really in for a shock.

537
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,943
Excelsiorclosing to 4,000 metres, sir.

538
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,570
Scotty, we'll need everything you have.

539
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,072
Aye, sir. Warp drive standing by.

540
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,409
Kirk.

541
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,789
<i>If you do this, you'll never sit
in the captain's chair again.</i>

542
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,958
-Warp speed.
-Aye, sir.

543
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,168
Warp speed.

544
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,510
Prepare for warp speed.
Stand by transwarp drive.

545
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,099
Transwarp at your command, sir.

546
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:10,474
<i>Full power available.</i>

547
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,809
Execute.

548
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,818
<i>Full power available...</i>

549
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,157
<i>Engine room reports
full power available.</i>

550
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:42,590
<i>Transwarp drive, maximum velocity
in five, four, three, two, one.</i>

551
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,976
Scotty, as good as your word.

552
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:55,603
Aye, sir.
The more they overthink the plumbing,

553
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,273
the easier it is to stop up the drain.

554
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:02,860
Here, Doctor,
souvenirs from one surgeon to another.

555
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,322
I took them out
of her main transwarp computer drive.

556
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,074
Nice of you to tell me in advance.

557
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:11,619
That's what you get
for missing staff meetings, Doctor.

558
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,914
Gentlemen, your work today
has been outstanding.

559
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,500
I intend to recommend
you all for promotion

560
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,670
in whatever fleet we end up serving.
Best speed to Genesis.

561
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,492
I am Saavik... Can you speak?

562
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,418
The Genesis wave.
His cells could have been regenerated.

563
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,592
Captain, this is Saavik.
Come in, please.

564
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,219
Yes, Saavik. Go ahead.

565
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,972
We have found the life sign.

566
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,143
lt is a Vulcan child,
perhaps 8 to 1 0 Earth years of age.

567
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,103
A child? How did he get there?

568
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,481
lt is Dr Marcus' opinion that this is...

569
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,695
That the Genesis effect
has in some way regenerated

570
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,364
Captain Spock.

571
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,206
Saavik, that's extraordinary.

572
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,418
What would you like to do next?

573
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:26,378
Request permission
to beam aboard immediately.

574
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,548
Saavik, does Dr Marcus think
there could be any chance

575
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,635
of radioactive contamination?

576
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,096
-No.
-None that he can detect, sir.

577
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,557
All the same, I'm going to advise
Starfleet and get instructions.

578
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,103
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.

579
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,271
<i>Probably true,
but let's do it by the book.</i>

580
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,940
Stand by on this channel. Go.

581
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,902
Starfleet Command,
this is U.S.S. Grissom

582
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,405
on subspace coded channel 98.8.
Come in, please.

583
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,416
Sir, something is jamming
our transmission, an energy surge.

584
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,918
Locate.

585
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,590
Surge from astern, Captain.

586
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,221
Oh, my God.

587
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,521
Gunner: target engine only.

588
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:29,025
Captain, what is happening?

589
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,110
<i>We're under attack!</i>

590
00:50:30,568 --> 00:50:31,695
Stand by for evasive.

591
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,954
I wanted prisoners!

592
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,289
A lucky shot sir...

593
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,800
Animal!

594
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,510
Sir, may I suggest...

595
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,302
Say the wrong thing, Torg.

596
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,222
lf it's prisoners you want,
there are life signs on the planet.

597
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,141
Perhaps the very scientists you seek.

598
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,436
<i>Saavik calling Grissom.
Come in, please.</i>

599
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,853
Very good.

600
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,273
Grissom, this is Saavik
on emergency frequency.

601
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,983
Come in, please.

602
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,239
Saavik, what happened to them?

603
00:51:16,322 --> 00:51:20,076
lt would seem that Grissom
was destroyed by an enemy attack.

604
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,164
We must go.
They will soon come after us.

605
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,672
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours,
present speed.

606
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,635
-Can we hold speed, Scotty?
-Aye, she's got her second wind now.

607
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,972
Scan for vessels in pursuit.

608
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,974
Scanning.
lndications negative at this time.

609
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,900
Did I get it right?

610
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,862
Great, Bones. Just great.

611
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,771
It's time for total truth between us.

612
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:34,233
This planet is not what you intended
or hoped for, is it?

613
00:52:35,693 --> 00:52:37,070
Not exactly.

614
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:39,197
Why?

615
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,992
I used protomatter
in the Genesis matrix.

616
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,911
Protomatter,

617
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:50,083
an unstable substance which every
ethical scientist in the galaxy

618
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,001
has denounced
as dangerously unpredictable.

619
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,922
But it was the only way
to solve certain problems.

620
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:59,925
So, like your father,
you changed the rules.

621
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:05,264
lf I hadn't,
it might have been years or never.

622
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,268
How many have paid the price
for your impatience?

623
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,106
How many have died?
How much damage have you done?

624
00:53:14,148 --> 00:53:16,067
And what is yet to come?

625
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,820
Bridge, nothing happening here.

626
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,766
This planet's ageing in surges.

627
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:15,143
And Spock with it.
lt seems they're joined together.

628
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:16,938
They are.

629
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,775
-How long?
-Days,

630
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,820
maybe hours.

631
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:27,782
I'm sorry.

632
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,579
It will be hardest on Spock.

633
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:38,793
Soon he will feel the burning
of his Vulcan blood.

634
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,670
I don't understand.

635
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,635
Vulcan males must endure it
every seventh year of their adult life.

636
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,353
Whoever they are,
they're getting closer.

637
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,938
-I'll go.
-No.

638
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,943
I'll do it. Give me your phaser.

639
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,956
Sir, Starfleet calling U.S.S. Grissom.
A warning about us.

640
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,958
Response?

641
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,128
Nothing, as before.

642
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,800
What's the Grissom up to?
Will she join us or will she fire on us?

643
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:33,347
Chekov, break silence.
Send Captain Esteban my compliments.

644
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:34,891
Aye, sir.

645
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:42,315
How are we doing?

646
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,193
It's funny you should put it
quite that way, Jim.

647
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,945
We are doing fine,

648
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,282
but I'd feel safer
giving him one of my kidneys

649
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:53,451
than what's scrambled in my brain.

650
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:57,538
Admiral, there is no response
from Grissom on any channel.

651
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,168
Keep trying, Chekov,
at regular intervals.

652
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,733
So it has come.

653
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,829
lt is called Pon farr.

654
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,090
Will you trust me?

655
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:04,831
We are secured from warp speed.
Now entering Genesis Sector.

656
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,835
Proceed at impulse power.

657
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:25,644
-Vessel entering sector.
-Yes. Federation battle cruiser.

658
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,065
-Have they scanned us?
-Not yet.

659
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,818
Engage cloaking device.

660
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,262
I'd swear
there was something there, sir.

661
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,097
What did you see?

662
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,184
For an instant, a scout-class vessel.

663
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,190
Could be Grissom.
Patch in a hailing frequency.

664
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:18,364
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Please come in.

665
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,833
<i>Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Do you read?</i>

666
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:32,335
Spock!

667
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,601
I've come a long way
for the power of Genesis

668
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,978
and what do I find?

669
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:52,940
A weakling human,

670
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,152
a Vulcan boy, and a woman.

671
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:59,405
My lord, we are survivors
of a doomed expedition.

672
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:04,242
This planet will destroy itself in hours.
The Genesis experiment is a failure.

673
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,911
A failure.

674
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,373
The most powerful,
destructive force ever created.

675
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:20,925
You will tell me the secret
of the Genesis torpedo.

676
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,971
I have no knowledge.

677
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,849
Then I hope
pain is something you enjoy.

678
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,648
I ordered no interruptions!

679
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,400
But, sir,
Federation starship approaching.

680
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,110
Bring me up.

681
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:41,237
<i>Grissom,</i>

682
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,617
this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?

683
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,623
<i>Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Please come in.</i>

684
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,503
Battle Alert!

685
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,047
Grissom. This is Enterprise.

686
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:03,302
<i>Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban
or Lieutenant Saavik. Please come in.</i>

687
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,137
-Report status.
-We are cloaked.

688
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:10,141
Enemy closing on impulse power.
Range, 5,000 kellicams.

689
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:11,976
Good.

690
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,981
This is just the turn of luck
I have been waiting for.

691
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,532
Nothing on my scanner, sir.

692
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,952
Short-range scan, Mr Chekov.

693
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,371
Put it on visual, Mr Sulu.

694
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,795
Range, 3,000 kellicams.

695
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,338
Steady.

696
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:43,509
Continue on impulse power.

697
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,514
Range, 2,000 kellicams.

698
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,853
Stand by to transfer energy to weapons.

699
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,606
At my command.

700
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:08,074
There.

701
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,952
That distortion. See it?

702
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:13,621
Yes, sir.
It's getting larger as we close in.

703
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,000
Firing range, sir.

704
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:19,711
Gunner:

705
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,717
Target engine only - Understood?

706
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,387
Understood clearly, sir.

707
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,896
-Opinion, Mr Sulu.
-I think it's an energy surge.

708
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,646
Enough energy to hide a ship,
would you say?

709
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,398
A cloaking device.

710
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,027
-Red alert, Mr Scott.
-Aye, sir.

711
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,239
1,000 kellicams, closing.

712
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,909
-All power to the weapons systems.
-Aye, sir.

713
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,871
No shields?

714
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,210
If my guess is right, they'll have to
decloak before they can fire.

715
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,461
May all your guesses be right.

716
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:15,976
Klingon bird-of-prey, sir.

717
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,894
-She's arming torpedoes.
-Fire, Mr Scott.

718
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,280
Good shooting, Mr Scott.

719
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,664
-Precautionary, Mr Chekov. Shields up.
-Aye, sir.

720
01:04:42,836 --> 01:04:45,130
Emergency power

721
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,800
to the thrusters!

722
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,762
Sir, the shield's nonresponsive.

723
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,266
-Scotty?
-The automation system's overloaded.

724
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,561
I didn't expect to take us into combat,
you know.

725
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:15,744
Emergency power.

726
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,289
Prepare to return fire.

727
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,250
Mr Scott, can you transfer power
to the phaser banks?

728
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:25,128
-I don't think so, sir.
-What happened?

729
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,005
Well, they've knocked out
the automation centre,

730
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,840
and I've got no control over anything.

731
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,217
Mr Sulu?

732
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,219
Nothing, sir.

733
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:40,184
So, we're a sitting duck.

734
01:05:45,317 --> 01:05:47,443
Ready to fire emergency tube.

735
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:54,032
Why haven't they finished us?

736
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,784
-They outgun me 1 0 to one.
-My lord.

737
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,829
The enemy commander
wishes a truce to confer.

738
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,914
Put him onscreen.

739
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:08,505
<i>This is Admiral James T. Kirk
ofFederation Starship Enterprise.</i>

740
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,217
So, the Genesis commander himself.

741
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,721
<i>A violation of treaty between
the Federation and the Klingon Empire.</i>

742
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:18,349
<i>Your presence here is an act of war.</i>

743
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,561
<i>You have two minutes to surrender
your crew and your vessel,</i>

744
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,230
<i>or we will destroy you.</i>

745
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,190
He's hiding something.

746
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,902
We may have dealt him
a more serious blow than I thought.

747
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,989
-How can you tell that?
-I trust my instincts.

748
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:38,202
Admiral Kirk,
this is your opponent speaking.

749
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,121
<i>Do not lecture me
about treaty violations.</i>

750
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,500
<i>The Federation,
in creating an ultimate weapon,</i>

751
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,543
<i>has become a gang
of intergalactic criminals.</i>

752
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:50,547
It is not I who will surrender.
It is you!

753
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,684
On the planet below,

754
01:07:02,726 --> 01:07:04,603
I have three prisoners

755
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,773
from the team who developed
your doomsday weapon.

756
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,112
If you do not surrender immediately,
I will execute them one at a time

757
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,114
as enemies of galactic peace!

758
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,284
Who is this?
How dare you take prisoners.

759
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:24,039
Who I am is not important.
That I have them is.

760
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,543
I will allow you to speak to them.

761
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:36,300
<i>-Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
-Saavik.</i>

762
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,637
Is David with you?

763
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,514
Yes, he is, and someone else,

764
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,474
a Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.

765
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,186
This

766
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:49,981
Vulcan,

767
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,777
is he alive?

768
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,655
He is not himself, but he lives.

769
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,490
<i>He is subject to rapid ageing,
like this unstable planet.</i>

770
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,119
Hello, sir. It's David.

771
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,663
I'm sorry I'm late.

772
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:09,543
It's okay. I should've known you'd come.
Saavik's right. This planet is unstable.

773
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:11,295
It's gonna destroy itself
in a matter of hours.

774
01:08:12,045 --> 01:08:13,338
David, what went wrong?

775
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,216
I went wrong.

776
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,842
I don't understand.

777
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:22,680
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender.
Genesis doesn't work.

778
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,184
I can't believe they'd kill us for it.

779
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:28,979
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken.
I meant what I said.

780
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,608
And now to show
that my intentions are sincere,

781
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,525
I shall kill one of the prisoners.

782
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,862
Wait a minute!
Give me a chance to talk...

783
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,363
Kill one of them.

784
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,865
I don't care which.

785
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,949
Saavik?

786
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,912
David?

787
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,502
Admiral, David is dead.

788
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:48,809
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.

789
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,777
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son!

790
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,289
You Klingon bastard.

791
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,627
There are two more prisoners, Admiral.

792
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:18,838
Do you want them killed, too?

793
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,716
Surrender your vessel.

794
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,265
All right. All right, damn you.

795
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:31,976
All right.

796
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,859
Give me a minute to inform my crew.

797
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,197
I give two minutes
for you and your gallant crew.

798
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,002
Take every last man.
Form a boarding party, armed heavily.

799
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,963
-They outnumber us, my lord.
-We are Klingons!

800
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:04,801
Once you control the ship,
we will transfer our flag there

801
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,845
and take Genesis from their
own memory banks.

802
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,109
Mr Sulu, what is the crew complement
of a bird-of-prey?

803
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:24,529
About a dozen officers and men.

804
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,824
With some of them on the planet.

805
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,706
I swear to you, we're not finished yet.

806
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,208
Bones, you and Sulu
to the Transporter Room.

807
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:40,212
The rest of you with me.
We have a job to do.

808
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:44,675
Commander, Klingon vessel.

809
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,886
Prepare to board this ship
on my next signal.

810
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,221
No tricks, Kirk.

811
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,515
You have one minute.

812
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:55,018
No tricks.

813
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,563
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

814
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,734
To the transport room.

815
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,487
Success!

816
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,666
Computer,
this is Admiral James T. Kirk.

817
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,751
Request security access.

818
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:25,923
Computer, destruct sequence one,

819
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,260
code one, one, A.

820
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,726
Computer,
Commander Montgomery Scott,

821
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,563
chief engineering officer.

822
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:45,359
Destruct sequence two,
code one, one, A, two, B.

823
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,036
Computer,
this is Commander Pavel Chekov,

824
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,037
acting science officer.

825
01:12:56,456 --> 01:13:03,336
Destruct sequence three,
code one, B, two, B, three.

826
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,173
<i>Destruct sequence
completed and engaged.</i>

827
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,676
<i>Awaiting final code
for one-minute countdown.</i>

828
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:14,597
Code zero, zero, zero,

829
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,850
destruct,

830
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,685
zero.

831
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,190
<i>Destruct sequence is activated.</i>

832
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:35,868
Kirk, your time runs out.

833
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,081
-All set?
-Aye, sir.

834
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,292
Commander, Klingon vessel.

835
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:46,003
We are energising
transporter beam now.

836
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,006
Transporter, stand by.

837
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,390
My lord,
the ship appears to be deserted.

838
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,685
How can that be? They're hiding.

839
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:45,479
Yes, sir, but the Bridge
seems to be run by computer.

840
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,106
lt is the only thing speaking.

841
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,484
Speaking? Let me hear.

842
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:55,323
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

843
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,158
<i>five...</i>

844
01:14:57,284 --> 01:15:00,119
<i>-Get out! Get out of there!
-...three, two...</i>

845
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,412
<i>-Get out!
-...one.</i>

846
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:00,639
My God, Bones, what have I done?

847
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,643
What you had to do.
What you always do.

848
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,520
Turn death into a fighting chance to live.

849
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:16,154
Planet core readings.
Unstable, changing rapidly.

850
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,574
What about surface life signs?

851
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:22,661
There.

852
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,711
No, don't touch him.

853
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,514
Bones.

854
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,639
-What happened?
-He gave his life to save us.

855
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:57,148
Rapid ageing.
All genetic functions highly accelerated.

856
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:00,484
-What about his mind?
-His mind's a void.

857
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:04,154
It seems, Admiral,
that I've got all his marbles.

858
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,740
ls there anything we can do?

859
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:09,618
Only one thing, sir.
Get him off this planet.

860
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,454
His ageing is part
of what's going on around us.

861
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,859
Klingon Commander,
this is Admiral James T. Kirk.

862
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,487
I'm alive and well on the planet surface.

863
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,282
<i>I know this will come
as a pleasant surprise to you,</i>

864
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:50,033
but our ship was a victim
of an unfortunate accident.

865
01:19:51,494 --> 01:19:55,539
Sorry about your crew,
but as we say on Earth, c'est la vie.

866
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,878
I have what you want.

867
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,841
I have the secret of Genesis.

868
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:09,761
You're gonna have to bring
us up there to get it.

869
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,390
You hear me?

870
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,854
I'm waiting for you.

871
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:21,608
What is your answer?

872
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:39,082
Drop all weapons!

873
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,090
Over there. All but Kirk.

874
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,351
Maltz,

875
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,311
prisoners are at beam coordinates.

876
01:20:59,395 --> 01:21:02,105
-You should take the Vulcan, too.
-No!

877
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:05,275
-But why?
-Because you wish it.

878
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:11,490
Maltz - activate beam!

879
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,751
Genesis. I want it!

880
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:27,006
Beam the Vulcan up and we'll talk.

881
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:31,010
Give me what I want and I'll consider it.

882
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:34,889
You fool, look around you!
The planet's destroying itself!

883
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,350
Yes, exhilarating, isn't it?

884
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,311
If we don't help each other,
we'll die here.

885
01:21:41,604 --> 01:21:44,606
Perfect. Then that's the way it shall be.

886
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,292
Give me Genesis.

887
01:23:05,521 --> 01:23:07,189
Give me your hand.

888
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:21,412
I have had enough of you!

889
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,029
Maltz!

890
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:04,681
Don't. How many more?

891
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,184
Just him, sir.

892
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,935
Bones, help Spock.

893
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,854
We've got to break out of orbit.

894
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:16,152
-You, help us or die.
-I do not deserve to live.

895
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,195
Fine. I'll kill you later.

896
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,030
Let's get out of here.

897
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,627
Where's the damn antimatter inducer?

898
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:36,421
This? No, this.

899
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:39,926
That or nothing.

900
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:49,226
If I read this right, sir,
we have full power.

901
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,853
Go, Sulu.

902
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,911
Goodbye, David.

903
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:10,872
We are clear and free to navigate.

904
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:14,167
Best speed to Vulcan.
Mr Chekov, take the prisoner below.

905
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:17,380
-Aye, sir.
-Wait. You said you would kill me.

906
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,256
I lied.

907
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:27,849
Spock,

908
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,394
for God sakes, talk to me.

909
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:36,649
You stuck this damn thing
in my head, remember?

910
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:39,694
Remember?

911
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,448
Now tell me what to do with it.

912
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,077
Help me.

913
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:09,724
I'm gonna tell you something that I

914
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,769
never thought I'd ever hear myself say.

915
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,733
But it seems I've missed you,

916
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,908
and I don't know if I could stand
to lose you again.

917
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,180
Ambassador, they are on approach.
They're requesting permission to land.

918
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:57,229
Permission granted. Tell them...
Tell Kirk we'll be ready.

919
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:07,073
Mr Sulu, you're on manual.

920
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,327
It's been a while, sir. Here we go.

921
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:25,548
Retrothrusters.

922
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:13,346
Sarek is waiting above, sir.

923
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:17,828
Sarek,

924
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,664
child of Skon,

925
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,126
child of Solkar,

926
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,172
the body of your son breathes still.

927
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,426
What is your wish?

928
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,514
I ask for fal-tor-pan,

929
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:39,182
the refusion.

930
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:43,895
What you seek has not
been done since ages past,

931
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:46,815
and then, only in legend.

932
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:52,279
-Your request is not logical.
-Forgive me, T'Lar.

933
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:57,534
My logic is uncertain

934
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,662
where my son is concerned.

935
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:04,582
Who is the keeper of the katra?

936
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,295
I am.

937
01:31:08,921 --> 01:31:12,716
McCoy, Leonard H., son of David.

938
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,344
McCoy, son of David,

939
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:18,221
since thou art human,

940
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:22,475
we cannot expect thee to understand
fully what Sarek has requested.

941
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,229
Spock's body lives.

942
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:29,233
With your approval,
we shall use all our powers

943
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,194
to return to his body
that which you possess.

944
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,908
But, McCoy, you must now be warned.

945
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:45,248
The danger to thyself is as grave
as the danger to Spock.

946
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,505
You must make the choice.

947
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,676
I choose the danger.

948
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,265
Hell of a time to ask.

949
01:35:13,123 --> 01:35:14,875
I'm all right, Jim.

950
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,962
What about Spock?

951
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:22,298
Only time will answer.

952
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,136
Kirk,

953
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,139
I thank you.

954
01:35:29,431 --> 01:35:32,141
-What you have done is...
-What I have done,

955
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,976
I had to do.

956
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,815
But at what cost? Your ship, your son.

957
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:44,822
lf I hadn't tried,
the cost would've been my soul.

958
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:26,215
My father says
that you have been my friend.

959
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:29,176
You came back for me.

960
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:33,221
You would have done the same for me.

961
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:38,018
Why would you do this?

962
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:44,106
Because the needs of the one

963
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,610
outweigh the needs of the many.

964
01:38:09,466 --> 01:38:10,801
I have been,

965
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:13,470
and ever shall be,

966
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,305
your friend.

967
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:17,765
Yes.

968
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:20,476
Yes, Spock.

969
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:23,646
The ship.

970
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:27,149
-Out of danger?
-You saved the ship.

971
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:31,488
You saved us all. Don't you remember?

972
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,336
Jim.

973
01:38:49,172 --> 01:38:51,216
Your name is Jim.
