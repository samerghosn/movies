1
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,272
How does it feel to be back
on the Enterprise Bridge?

2
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,857
Captain Kirk?

3
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,442
-Can I ask you a few questions?
-Did you participate in the redesign?

4
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,820
We'd like to know how you feel
about being on...

5
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,824
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

6
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,410
There will be plenty of time
for questions later.

7
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,621
I'm Captain John Harriman,
and I'd like to welcome you all aboard.

8
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,832
-It's our pleasure.
-I just want you to know

9
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,542
how excited we all are

10
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,713
to have a group of living legends
with us on our maiden voyage.

11
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,383
I remember reading about your missions
when I was in grade school.

12
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,593
Really?

13
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:45,600
-Well, may we have a look around?
-Please, please.

14
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,977
Yes, sir,
it's very nice to finally meet you.

15
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,981
-Demora!
-Excuse me. Captain?

16
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,483
This is the first Starship Enterprise
in 30 years

17
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,528
without James T. Kirk in command.
How do you feel about that, sir?

18
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,822
Just fine. I'm glad to be here
to send her on her way.

19
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,658
And what have you been doing
since you retired?

20
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,201
Keeping busy.

21
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,037
Captain Kirk,
just a few more questions, sir.

22
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,498
Why don't we give the Captain
a chance to look around first?

23
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,593
Captain. Excuse me.

24
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,724
I'd like you to meet the helmsman
of the Enterprise-B. Demora.

25
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,560
Ensign Demora Sulu.

26
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,523
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

27
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,027
My father's told me
some interesting stories about you.

28
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,155
-Your father is Hikaru Sulu?
-Yes, sir.

29
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,325
-You've met her before, but she was...
-It wasn't that long ago.

30
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,078
-It couldn't have been more than...
-Twelve years, sir.

31
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,288
-Twelve years?
-Absolutely.

32
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,874
Incredible.

33
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,709
Congratulations, Ensign.

34
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,963
It wouldn't be the Enterprise
without a Sulu at the helm.

35
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,047
Thank you, sir.

36
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,466
I'm sure Hikaru must be
very proud of you.

37
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,051
I hope so.

38
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,223
I was never that young.

39
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,560
No, you were younger.

40
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,860
-Damn fine ship if you ask me.
-Scotty, it absolutely amazes me.

41
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,238
And what would that be, sir?

42
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,534
Sulu, when did he find time for a family?

43
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,827
Well, like you always say,

44
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,204
if something's important,
you make the time.

45
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,083
So that's why you seem so restless.

46
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,502
Finding retirement a little lonely,
are we?

47
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,171
You know, I'm glad you're an engineer.

48
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,508
With tact like that,
you'd make a lousy psychiatrist.

49
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,847
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if you'll take your seats.

50
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,350
Yes, of course.

51
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,019
Prepare to leave spacedock.

52
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:57,023
Aft thrusters ahead one-quarter,
port and starboard at station keeping.

53
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,858
-Captain Kirk.
-Yes?

54
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,694
I'd be honored if you'd give the order
to get underway.

55
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,365
-Thank you very much, I...
-Please, sir.

56
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,285
-No, no, no, no.
-Please, I insist.

57
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,254
Take us out.

58
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,223
-Very good, sir.
-Brought a tear to me eye.

59
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,641
Be quiet.

60
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,579
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

61
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,873
Now that you've seen
the rest of the ship,

62
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,750
how does it feel to be back?

63
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,169
-Well, we... Fine.
-Fine, fine.

64
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,505
-Fine, fine.
-Well, ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,673
we've just cleared the asteroid belt.

66
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,259
Our course today will take us out
beyond Pluto

67
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,596
and then back to spacedock.
Just a quick run around the block.

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,641
Captain, will there be time to conduct
any tests on the warp drive system?

69
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,895
We're picking up a distress call,
Captain.

70
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,484
On speakers.

71
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,612
This is the transport ship Lakul.

72
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,448
We're caught
in some kind of energy distortion.

73
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:34,120
Two ships in our convoy...trapped
in a severe gravimetric distortion.

74
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,081
We can't break free.
We need immediate help.

75
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,876
It's tearing us apart.
This is the transport...

76
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,087
The Lakul is one of two ships

77
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,922
transporting El-Aurian refugees
to Earth.

78
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,550
Ensign Sulu, can you locate them?

79
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,554
The ships are bearing
at 3-1 -0 mark 2-1 -5.

80
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,014
Distance, three light-years.

81
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,563
Signal the closest starship.

82
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,399
We're in no condition
to mount a rescue.

83
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,614
-We don't even have a full crew aboard.
-We're the only one in range, sir.

84
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,876
Well, then, I guess it's up to us.

85
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:27,047
Helm, lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp.

86
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,716
Aye, sir.

87
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,310
Captain, is there something wrong
with your chair?

88
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,362
We're within visual range
of the energy distortion, Captain.

89
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,782
On screen.

90
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,955
What the hell is that?

91
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,001
I've located the transport ships.

92
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,797
Their hulls are starting to buckle
under the stress.

93
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,467
They won't survive much longer.

94
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,806
We're encountering severe
gravimetric distortions

95
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,142
from the energy ribbon, Captain.

96
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,897
We'll have to keep our distance.
We don't wanna get pulled in, too.

97
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,317
-Tractor beam. Tractor beam.
-We don't have a tractor beam.

98
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,611
You left spacedock
without a tractor beam?

99
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,155
It won't be installed until Tuesday.

100
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,908
Ensign Sulu,

101
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,664
try generating a subspace field
around the ships.

102
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,457
That might break them free.

103
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,668
There's too much quantum interference,
Captain.

104
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,089
What about... What about
venting plasma from the warp nacelles?

105
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,007
That might disrupt the ribbon's hold
on the ships.

106
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,052
Aye, sir. Releasing drive plasma.

107
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,180
It's not having any effect, sir.
I think the ribbon's hold...

108
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,850
Sir, the starboard vessel's hull
is collapsing!

109
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,444
-How many people were on that ship?
-Two hundred and sixty-five.

110
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,746
Sir, the Lakul's hull integrity
is down to 12%.

111
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:35,384
Captain Kirk, I would appreciate
any suggestions you might have.

112
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,929
First, move us within transporter range.

113
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,514
Beam those people
aboard the Enterprise.

114
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,434
What about the gravimetric distortions?
They'll tear us apart.

115
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,562
Risk is part of the game
if you wanna sit in that chair.

116
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,564
Helm, close to within transporter range.

117
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,733
Second, turn that damn thing off!

118
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,992
-We're within range, sir.
-Beam them directly to Sickbay.

119
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,078
-Aye, sir.
-How big is your medical staff?

120
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,749
The medical staff?
It doesn't arrive till Tuesday.

121
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,502
You and you,
you've just become nurses. Let's go.

122
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,340
Main Engineering reports fluctuations
in the warp plasma relays.

123
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,051
Sir, I'm having trouble
locking on to them.

124
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,262
They appear to be
in some sort of temporal flux.

125
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,430
Scotty!

126
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,684
What the hell?

127
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,897
Their life signs are phasing in and out
of our space-time continuum.

128
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,607
Phasing? To where?

129
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,611
-Sir, their hull's collapsing!
-Beam them out of there, Scotty!

130
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,286
Transport complete.

131
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,294
I got 47

132
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,964
out of 150.

133
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,106
-Report!
-We're caught in a gravimetric field

134
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,274
emanating from the trailing edge
of the ribbon.

135
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,735
All engines, full reverse!

136
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,244
It's going to be all right.
We're going to help you.

137
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,745
We are going to help you.

138
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,540
-It's okay. Everything is fine.
-My wife...

139
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,500
Why? Why?

140
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,920
It's all right. You're safe.
You're on the Enterprise.

141
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,924
-No, no, I have to go. I have to go back.
-You need to stay right here.

142
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,051
-No. You don't understand.
-It's okay.

143
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,762
Let me go back. Let me go back!

144
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:48,267
Let me go back.
Let me go back. Please!

145
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,939
-What was he talking about?
-I have no idea.

146
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,858
Excuse me.

147
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,280
Can I help you?

148
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:09,746
It's going to be okay. You'll be all right.
You just need to rest. Come over here.

149
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:19,006
There's just no way to disrupt
a gravimetric field of this magnitude.

150
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,301
-Hull integrity at 82%.
-But I do have a theory.

151
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,886
I thought you might.

152
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,889
An antimatter discharge directly ahead

153
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,559
might disrupt the field long enough
for us to break away.

154
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,227
-Photon torpedoes.
-Aye.

155
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,395
We're losing main power.

156
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,647
Load torpedo bays.
Prepare to fire at my command.

157
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:40,569
-Captain, we don't have any torpedoes.
-Don't tell me, Tuesday.

158
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,157
-Hull integrity at 40%.
-Captain, it may be possible

159
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,950
to simulate a torpedo blast

160
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,329
using a resonance burst
from the main deflector dish.

161
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,625
-Where are the deflector relays?
-Deck 15, Section 21-Alpha.

162
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,169
I'll go. You have the Bridge.

163
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,425
Wait.

164
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,846
Your place is on the bridge of your ship.

165
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,183
I'll take care of it.

166
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,814
Scotty, keep things together
until I get back.

167
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,608
I always do.

168
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,885
Forty-five seconds to structural collapse.

169
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,388
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

170
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,932
Kirk here.

171
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,269
I don't know how much longer
I can hold her together.

172
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,697
That's it. Let's go!

173
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,949
Activate main deflector.

174
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,958
We're breaking free.

175
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,730
It's all right.
I'm increasing power to compensate.

176
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,942
-We're clear.
-You did it, Kirk!

177
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,819
Damage report, Ensign.

178
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,447
There's some buckling
on the starboard nacelle.

179
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,991
We've also got a hull breach
in Engineering section.

180
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,452
Emergency force fields in place
and holding.

181
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,995
Where?

182
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:42,250
Sections 20 through 28 on Decks 13, 14

183
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,254
and 15.

184
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:53,261
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Captain Kirk, please respond.

185
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,936
Have Chekov meet me on Deck 15.

186
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,717
My God! Was anyone in here?

187
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,221
Aye.

188
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,793
Bring out the prisoner.

189
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,141
Mr. Worf,
I always knew this day would come.

190
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,437
-Are you prepared to face the charges?
-Answer him.

191
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,608
I am prepared.

192
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,573
"We, the officers and crew
of the U.S.S. Enterprise,

193
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,742
"being of sound mind and judgment,

194
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,412
"hereby make the following charges
against Lieutenant Worf.

195
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,750
"One, that he did knowingly and willfully

196
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,505
"perform above and beyond
the call of duty on countless occasions.

197
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,507
"Two, most seriously,

198
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:40,512
"that he has earned the admiration
and respect of the entire crew."

199
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,183
Mr. Worf, I hereby promote you
to the rank of Lieutenant Commander,

200
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,687
with all the rights and privileges thereto.

201
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,690
And may God have mercy on your soul.

202
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,947
-Hip, hip...
-Hooray!

203
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,240
-Hip, hip...
-Hooray!

204
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,616
-Hip, hip...
-Hooray!

205
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,494
-Congratulations, Mr. Worf.
-Thank you, sir.

206
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,663
Extend the plank.

207
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,214
Lower the badge of office.

208
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,844
-Be careful.
-You go get that hat.

209
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,805
He'll never make it. No one ever has.

210
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,187
Jump!

211
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,247
Yes! Yes, Worf!

212
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,666
If there's one thing I've learned
over the years,

213
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,002
it's never to underestimate a Klingon.

214
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,717
Computer, remove the plank.

215
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,596
Oh, no!

216
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,524
Number One, that's "retract" plank,
not "remove" plank.

217
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,109
Of course, sir.

218
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,947
Sorry.

219
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:32,874
Doctor, I must confess,
I am uncertain as to why

220
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,419
someone falling into freezing water
is amusing.

221
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,463
It's all in good fun, Data.

222
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,215
-Fun?
-Fun.

223
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,301
I do not understand.

224
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,137
You've got to get into the spirit of things.

225
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,307
Learn to be spontaneous,
live in the moment.

226
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,644
-Do something unexpected. Get it?
-Got it.

227
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,129
-Data.
-That was...

228
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,755
Not funny.

229
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,928
All hands, make sail.
T'gansuls and courses.

230
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,597
-Stand by the braces.
-Will.

231
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:39,482
Just imagine what it was like.
No engines, no computers,

232
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:44,446
just the wind and the sea
and the stars to guide you.

233
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,615
Bad food, brutal discipline.

234
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:49,909
No women.

235
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,537
-Bridge to Captain Picard.
-Picard here.

236
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,124
There's a personal message for you
from Earth.

237
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,293
Put it through down here.

238
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,838
The best thing about life at sea, Will,
was that no one could reach you.

239
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,383
This was freedom, Will.

240
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,970
Computer, arch.

241
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,060
Look alive there.

242
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,825
Here, take the wheel.

243
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,767
Captain, are you all right?

244
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,397
Yes, I'm fine. Excuse me.

245
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,443
Computer, exit.

246
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,788
-Mr. La Forge, set royals and studsail.
-What's a studsail, sir?

247
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,833
You see that last yardarm?
Just above that...

248
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,627
-Bridge to Holodeck 3.
-Riker here.

249
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,755
We're picking up a distress call
from the Amargosa Observatory, sir.

250
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,049
They say they're under attack.

251
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:32,262
Red alert! All hands to battle stations.
Captain Picard to the Bridge.

252
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,404
-It looks like we're too late.
-There are no other ships in the system.

253
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,574
Captain, we're approaching Amargosa.

254
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,451
Looks like the observatory
took quite a beating.

255
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,744
Survivors?

256
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,455
Sensors show five life signs
aboard the station, Captain.

257
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,833
The station's complement was 19.

258
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,671
Stand down from red alert.

259
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,176
Number One,

260
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,682
will you begin an investigation?
I'll be in my Ready Room.

261
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,602
-Sir? I thought you wanted...
-Make it so. Just do it!

262
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,606
-Mr. Worf.
-Aye, sir.

263
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,124
Mr. Worf, you're with me.

264
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,711
These blast patterns are consistent
with a type-3 disruptor.

265
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:51,216
Great. That narrows it down
to Romulan, Breen and Klingon.

266
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,177
Over here!

267
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,891
It's all right. Do not struggle.

268
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,736
It's okay. We're right here. Got you.

269
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,039
I'm Commander William Riker
from the Starship Enterprise.

270
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,545
Soran. Dr. Tolian Soran.

271
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:17,302
-Who attacked you, Doctor?
-I don't know. It all happened so fast.

272
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,972
Commander,
you better take a look at this.

273
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,077
Romulans.

274
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:49,751
Data, whatever possessed you to push
her in the water in the first place?

275
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,796
I was attempting
to get into the spirit of things.

276
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,508
I thought it would be amusing. Spot.

277
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,511
Is she still angry?

278
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,349
I'd stay out of Sickbay
for a couple of days if I were you.

279
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:20,573
Data, you're not actually thinking
about using that thing, are you?

280
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,284
I have considered it for many months.

281
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,871
And in light of my recent episode
with Dr. Crusher,

282
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,582
now may be the appropriate time.

283
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,835
I thought you were worried
about it overloading your neural net.

284
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,213
That is true.

285
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:40,176
However, I believe my growth
as an artificial life-form

286
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,303
has reached an impasse.

287
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,849
For 34 years, I have endeavored
to become more human,

288
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,186
to grow beyond
my original programming.

289
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,192
Still, I am unable to grasp
such a basic concept as humor.

290
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,864
This emotion chip
may be the only answer.

291
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,213
Geordi.

292
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,717
All right.

293
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:41,237
Listen, at the first sign of trouble,
I'm gonna deactivate it. Agreed?

294
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,198
Agreed.

295
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,123
We found two dead Romulans
on the station.

296
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,584
We're analyzing their equipment
to see if we can determine

297
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,294
what ship they came from.

298
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,715
And there's still no indication
of why they attacked the station?

299
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:05,386
They practically tore the place apart.
Accessed the central computer,

300
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,096
turned the cargo bay inside out.

301
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,807
Obviously,
they were looking for something.

302
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,895
This could signify
a new Romulan threat in this sector.

303
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,736
-Inform Starfleet Command.
-You want me to contact Starfleet?

304
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,905
-Is there a problem?
-No, sir.

305
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,743
There was something else, Captain.

306
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,747
One of the scientists, a Dr. Soran,
insisted on speaking with you.

307
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,582
I told him you were very busy.

308
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,085
He said it was absolutely imperative
that he speak with you right away.

309
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,129
Understood. That will be all.

310
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,099
-Sir, is there anything more...
-No, thank you.

311
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,788
Gentlemen,
something new from Forcas III?

312
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,463
What?

313
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,467
I believe this beverage has produced
an emotional response.

314
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,553
Really? What are you feeling?

315
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,682
I am uncertain.

316
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,809
Because I have had little experience
with emotion,

317
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,979
I am unable to articulate the sensation.

318
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,067
-Emotion?
-I'll explain later.

319
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:51,659
-Well, it looks like he hates it.
-Yes, that is it.

320
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,831
-I hate this.
-Data, I think the chip is working.

321
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,964
Yes, I hate this. It is revolting.

322
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,008
-More?
-Please.

323
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,894
I'm looking for a Dr. Soran
from the observatory.

324
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,780
-Dr. Soran?
-Yes.

325
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,366
Yes, Captain, thank you for coming.
Thank you.

326
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,161
I understand there's something urgent
you wish to discuss with me.

327
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,623
Yes. I must return
to the observatory immediately.

328
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,752
I must continue a critical experiment
I've been running on the Amargosa star.

329
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,212
We're still conducting our investigation
into the attack.

330
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,922
-Yes, I...
-As soon as that is complete,

331
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,674
then I will allow you
and your colleagues to return.

332
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,426
But until then, there's nothing I can do.

333
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:54,305
Timing is very important
in my experiments.

334
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,144
If it's not completed in the next 12 hours,
years of research will be lost.

335
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,439
We're doing the best we can.
If you'll excuse me.

336
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:10,154
They say time is the fire
in which we burn.

337
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:17,244
Right now, Captain,
my time is running out.

338
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,417
We leave so many things
unfinished in our lives.

339
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,254
I know you understand.

340
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,593
I'll see what I can do.

341
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,180
We have analyzed
the Romulans' tricorder.

342
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,182
They were scanning
for signature particles

343
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,561
-of a compound called trilithium.
-Trilithium?

344
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,731
Yes, an experimental compound
the Romulans have been working on.

345
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,024
Trilithium is a nuclear inhibitor.

346
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,403
In theory,
it could stop all fusion within a star.

347
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,698
However, the Romulans never found
a way to stabilize it.

348
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,575
Why would they look for it
on a Federation observatory?

349
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,201
That doesn't make any sense.

350
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,579
I do not know.

351
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,914
Have Geordi and Data go over
with the next away team.

352
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,624
Tell them to scan the observatory
for trilithium.

353
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,251
Aye, sir.

354
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:56,177
Well, there's no sign
of any trilithium over here.

355
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:08,439
-I get it! I get it!
-You get what?

356
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:13,819
When you said to Commander Riker,
"The clown can stay,

357
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:17,072
"but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit
has to go."

358
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,617
What are you talking about?

359
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,744
During the Farpoint mission.

360
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,290
We were on the Bridge. You told a joke.
That was the punch line.

361
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,377
Farpoint...
Data, that was seven years ago.

362
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,047
I know. I just got it!

363
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,925
Very funny.

364
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,323
Wait a minute.
There's a door hidden right behind you.

365
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,909
I can see the separation with my visor.

366
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,662
There appears to be a dampening field
in operation.

367
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,331
I cannot scan beyond the bulkhead.

368
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,794
There doesn't seem to be
a control panel or an access port.

369
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,089
It appears to be magnetically sealed.

370
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:20,511
I believe I can reverse the polarity
by attenuating my axial servo.

371
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,270
Open sesame.

372
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,822
You could say
I have a magnetic personality.

373
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,326
Humor, I love it!

374
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,850
Data, come take a look at this, will you?

375
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,982
Have you ever seen a solar probe
with this kind of configuration?

376
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,028
No, Geordi, I have not. Have you?

377
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,406
No, I have not. It is most unusual.

378
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,910
Mr. Tricorder.

379
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,497
Just see if you can help me
get these panels open, will you?

380
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,416
Make it so.

381
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,052
My visor's picking up something
in the theta band.

382
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,429
It could be a trilithium signature.

383
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,518
-Data, we don't have time for this.
-I cannot help myself.

384
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,688
I think something is wrong.

385
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,947
Data?

386
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,249
Data. Data, are you all right?

387
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:23,384
I believe the emotion chip
has overloaded my positronic relay.

388
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,720
We'd better get you back to the ship.
La Forge to Enterprise.

389
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,144
-La Forge to Enterprise.
-Gentlemen, is there a problem?

390
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,397
Dr. Soran.

391
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,984
Yeah. There seems to be
some sort of dampening field in here.

392
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,987
It's blocking our comm signal.
Can you shut it off for us?

393
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,281
Of course, I'd be only too happy to.

394
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,004
Please. Please. No.

395
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:05,759
Do not... Do not hurt me.
Please, please.

396
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,866
Yes, come.

397
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,954
Yes, Counselor?
Is there something I can do for you?

398
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,958
Actually I'm here to see
if there's anything I can do for you.

399
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,377
It's just family matters.

400
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,633
You never met my brother and his wife,
did you?

401
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,720
-No.
-Robert.

402
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,478
So opinionated.
So pompous and arrogant.

403
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,397
He always had to have the last word.

404
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:05,319
But he mellowed a little bit
in the last few years.

405
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,241
I was going to get together with them all
next month on Earth.

406
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,660
I thought we'd go to San Francisco.

407
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,538
René's always wanted
to see Starfleet Academy.

408
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,416
René? Your nephew.

409
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,253
Yes. He's so unlike his father.

410
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,675
He's a dreamer, imaginative.

411
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,015
He's so very gentle.

412
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,774
What's happened?

413
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,028
Robert and René, they're...

414
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,534
Burned to death in a fire.

415
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,789
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right. It's all right.

416
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,166
These things happen.

417
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:05,379
Captain, it's not all right.

418
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,757
I can't help thinking about

419
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:14,054
all the experiences
that René's not gonna have,

420
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,976
about going to the Academy,
reading books and listening to music

421
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,728
and falling in love,

422
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,983
building a life.

423
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:33,740
Well, that's not going to happen now.

424
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,581
I didn't realize he meant so much to you.

425
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,043
I'd come to feel that René was as close
as I would get

426
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,254
to having a child of my own.

427
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,645
Your family history is very important
to you, isn't it?

428
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,855
What?

429
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,030
From being a small child,

430
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:16,450
I can remember being told
about the family line.

431
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,119
The Picard who fought at Trafalgar.

432
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,539
The Picard who won
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

433
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,376
The Picards who settled
the first Martian colonies.

434
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:34,509
And when Robert married
and he had a son, I...

435
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,348
You felt it was no longer
your responsibility

436
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,558
to carry on the family line.

437
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,688
Right. Yes. That's it exactly.

438
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,988
You know, Counselor,
recently I've become very much aware

439
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,659
that there were fewer days ahead
than there are behind,

440
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:04,831
but I took some comfort from the fact
that the family would go on.

441
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,172
But now there'll be no more Picards.

442
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,771
Report.

443
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,524
A quantum implosion has occurred
within the Amargosa star.

444
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:35,904
-All nuclear fusion is breaking down.
-How is that possible?

445
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,823
Sensor records show
the observatory launched

446
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,575
a solar probe into the sun
a few moments ago.

447
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,953
The star is going to collapse
in a matter of minutes.

448
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,957
Sir, the implosion has produced
a level-12 shock wave.

449
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,084
That'll destroy everything in this system.

450
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,544
Transporter Room to Bridge.

451
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,547
I can't locate Commander La Forge
or Mr. Data, sir.

452
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,634
-Have they come back to the ship?
-No, sir. They are not on board.

453
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,804
How long before the shock wave
hits the observatory?

454
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,639
Four minutes, 40 seconds.

455
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,974
Number One.

456
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,059
-Mr. Worf!
-Aye, sir.

457
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,158
Soran, transmit your coordinates.

458
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,300
What the hell's he doing?

459
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,387
Enterprise to Commander Riker.
You have two minutes left.

460
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:44,264
You hear that, Soran?

461
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:48,518
We've got a level-12 shock wave
coming in. We gotta get out of here!

462
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,650
Sir, a Klingon bird-of-prey
is decloaking off the port bow.

463
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,612
What?

464
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:18,548
-Data, see if you can get to Geordi.
-I cannot, sir.

465
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,386
Prepare for transport.

466
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:42,072
-Commander Riker's team is aboard, sir.
-Helm, warp 1, engage!

467
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,838
You've done it, Soran.

468
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,555
Wait!

469
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:26,950
I hope for your sake
you were initiating a mating ritual.

470
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,369
You got careless.

471
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,706
The Romulans came looking
for their missing trilithium.

472
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:38,086
Impossible.
We left no survivors on their outpost.

473
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,799
They knew it was on the observatory.
If the Enterprise hadn't intervened,

474
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,551
they would have found it.

475
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:49,639
They didn't find it! And now
we have a weapon of unlimited power.

476
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:55,979
No, Lursa, I have the weapon,
and if you ever want me to give it to you,

477
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:00,233
I would advise you to be
a little more careful in the future.

478
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,445
Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

479
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,117
Without my research,
the trilithium is worthless,

480
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,789
as are your plans
to re-conquer the Klingon Empire.

481
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:25,926
Set course for the Veridian system.
Maximum warp.

482
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:35,435
He's an El-Aurian, over 300 years old.

483
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,272
He lost his entire family
when the Borg destroyed his planet.

484
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,816
Soran escaped
with a handful of other refugees

485
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,444
aboard a ship called the Lakul.

486
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:48,281
That ship was later destroyed
by some kind of energy ribbon.

487
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:52,619
But Soran and 46 others
were rescued by the Enterprise-B.

488
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,746
That was the mission
where James Kirk was killed.

489
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,374
I checked the passenger manifest
of the Lakul.

490
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,126
Guess who else was on board.

491
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,925
Soran is a name I haven't heard
for a long time.

492
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,553
-You remember him?
-Yes.

493
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:16,393
Guinan, it is very important that
you tell me everything that you know.

494
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:22,399
We think that Soran has developed
a weapon, a terrible weapon,

495
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,694
one that might even give him
enough power to destroy an entire...

496
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,822
Soran doesn't care about weapons
or power.

497
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,617
He just cares about getting
back to the Nexus.

498
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,327
What is the Nexus?

499
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,707
The energy ribbon
that destroyed that ship

500
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,044
was not just some random phenomena
traveling through the universe.

501
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,507
It's a doorway to another place
that we call the Nexus,

502
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:51,177
and it's a place I've tried very,
very hard to forget.

503
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,437
What happened to you?

504
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:08,028
It was like being inside joy.

505
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,323
As if joy was something tangible

506
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,701
and you could wrap yourself up in it
like a blanket,

507
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,790
and never in my entire life
have I ever been as content.

508
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,294
And then you were beamed
away from there.

509
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,631
Pulled. Ripped away.

510
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,550
None of us wanted to go,

511
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,263
and I would have done anything,
anything to get back there.

512
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,186
And once I realized that wasn't
possible,

513
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,063
I learned to live with that.

514
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,397
What about Soran?

515
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,151
If he's still obsessed,
he could be a very, very dangerous man.

516
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,947
Why would he destroy a star?

517
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,497
Thank you, Guinan.

518
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,919
If you go,

519
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,423
you're not gonna care about anything.

520
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:15,261
Not this ship, not Soran, not me.
Nothing.

521
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,599
All you'll want is to stay in the Nexus,

522
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,020
and you're not gonna want
to come back.

523
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,830
Marvelous technology.

524
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,126
This is a remarkable
piece of equipment.

525
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:51,965
-Glad you approve.
-It's not very stylish, though, is it?

526
00:50:55,136 --> 00:51:00,306
Have you ever considered a prosthesis
that would make you look a little more...

527
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,144
How can I say? More normal?

528
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,480
-What's normal?
-What's normal?

529
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,150
Well, that's a good question.

530
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:14,821
Normal is what everyone else is
and you are not.

531
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,203
Can we just get down to it, please?
What do you want?

532
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:27,751
As you may or may not be aware,
I am an El-Aurian.

533
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:31,838
Some people call us a race of listeners.
We listen.

534
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,261
Right now, Mr. La Forge,
you have my complete attention.

535
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:43,183
I want to listen to everything
you know about trilithium.

536
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:52,650
Captain's Log, Stardate 48632.4.
Dr. Crusher has informed me

537
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,820
that Data's emotion chip has been fused
into his neural net

538
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,447
and cannot be removed.

539
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,365
However, she believes he is fit for duty,

540
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,786
so I've asked him to join me
in Stellar Cartography.

541
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:08,041
According to our information, the ribbon
is a conflux of temporal energy

542
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,878
which travels through this galaxy
every 39.1 years.

543
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:16,216
It will pass through this sector
in approximately 42 hours.

544
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,301
Yes. Guinan was right.

545
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,720
She said that Soran was trying
to get back to the ribbon.

546
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,472
Now, if that's true,

547
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,725
there has to be some connection
with the Amargosa star.

548
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,395
Data, give me a list of anything that
was affected by the star's destruction,

549
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,105
no matter how insignificant.

550
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,068
-Data?
-Sorry, sir.

551
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:42,408
It will take the computer a few moments
to compile the information.

552
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,749
Data, are you all right?

553
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:57,340
No, sir.
I am finding it difficult to concentrate.

554
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:04,097
I believe I am overwhelmed
with feelings of remorse

555
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,351
and regret concerning my actions
on the observatory.

556
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,936
What do you mean?

557
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,273
I wanted to save Geordi,

558
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,986
but I experienced
something I did not expect.

559
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,198
Fear.

560
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,118
I was afraid.

561
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,750
According to our current information,
the destruction of the Amargosa star

562
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,587
has had the following effects
in this sector.

563
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:39,799
Gamma emissions
have increased by .05%.

564
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:43,803
The Starship Bozeman was forced
to make a course correction.

565
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,263
Ambient magnetic fields...

566
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:49,309
Wait. The Bozeman,
why would it make a course correction?

567
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,102
The destruction of the Amargosa star

568
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,439
has altered the gravitational forces
throughout this sector.

569
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,733
As a result,
any ship passing through this region

570
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,360
would have to make
a minor course correction.

571
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,489
A minor course correction.
Where's the ribbon now?

572
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,337
-This is its current position.
-Can you project its course?

573
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,010
Captain.

574
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:32,644
I cannot continue with this investigation.
I wish to be deactivated

575
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,647
until Dr. Crusher can remove
the emotion chip.

576
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,649
Are you having some kind
of malfunction?

577
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:42,445
No, sir. I simply do not have the ability
to control these emotions.

578
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:46,532
Data, I have nothing but sympathy
for what you are feeling,

579
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,785
but right now, I need you to...

580
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,704
Sir, I no longer want these emotions!

581
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,375
Deactivating me
is the only viable solution.

582
00:54:55,459 --> 00:55:00,380
Part of having feelings is learning
to integrate them into your life, Data,

583
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,881
learning to live with them

584
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,716
-no matter what the circumstances.
-Sir, I cannot!

585
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,760
You will not be deactivated.

586
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,804
You're an officer on board this ship,

587
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:11,975
and I require you to perform your duty.
That is an order, Commander.

588
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,309
Yes, sir.

589
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,898
I will try, sir.

590
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,406
Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data,

591
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,909
and courage can be an emotion, too.

592
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,913
Now, can you project the course
of the ribbon?

593
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,249
I believe so.

594
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,922
Enhance grid 9-A.

595
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,678
Where was the Amargosa star?

596
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,726
Now, you said that when
the Amargosa star was destroyed,

597
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,061
it affected the gravitational forces
in this sector.

598
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,313
Now, did the computer
take that into account

599
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,274
when it projected
the course of the ribbon?

600
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,318
No, sir.
I will make the appropriate adjustments.

601
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,451
That's what Soran's doing.
He's changing the course of the ribbon.

602
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:17,290
But why?
Why would he try to change its path?

603
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,460
Why doesn't he just fly into it
with a ship?

604
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,087
Our records show that every ship
which has approached the ribbon

605
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:26,507
has either been destroyed
or severely damaged.

606
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:33,139
He can't get to the ribbon, so he's trying
to make the ribbon come to him.

607
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:37,685
Data, does it pass near
to any M-Class planets?

608
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,647
Yes, sir.
There are two in the Veridian system.

609
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,527
Well, it gets close to Veridian III,
but not close enough.

610
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,657
Data, what would happen
to the ribbon's course

611
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,911
if Soran destroyed
the Veridian star itself?

612
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,501
That's where he's going.

613
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,504
It should be noted, sir,

614
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,840
that the collapse of the Veridian star
would produce a shock wave

615
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,676
similar to the one we observed
at Amargosa.

616
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,596
Destroying all the planets in this system.

617
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,518
Veridian III is uninhabited.

618
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:23,856
However, Veridian IV supports
a pre-industrial humanoid society.

619
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,608
Population?

620
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,571
Two hundred thirty million, sir.

621
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,118
-Picard to Bridge.
-Worf here, sir.

622
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,204
Set a course for the Veridian system,
maximum warp.

623
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,233
Did you get anything from the human?

624
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,653
No. His heart just wasn't in it.

625
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,241
We have entered orbit of Veridian III.

626
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:24,083
-Prepare to transport me to the surface.
-Wait. When do we get our payment?

627
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:37,096
This contains all the information
you'll need to make a trilithium weapon.

628
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,933
It's been coded.

629
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,728
Once I'm safely to the surface,

630
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,898
I'll transmit
the decryption sequence to you.

631
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,525
-Not before.
-Mistress!

632
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,694
A Federation starship
is entering the system.

633
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,113
What? On viewer.

634
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,824
They're hailing us.

635
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,161
We're still cloaked. They can't see us.

636
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:03,581
Klingon vessel,
we know what you are doing,

637
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,460
and we will destroy any probe
launched toward the Veridian star.

638
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,712
We demand that you return
our chief engineer

639
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,964
and leave this system immediately.

640
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,635
There's no time for this. Eliminate them.

641
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:20,056
That is a Galaxy-class starship.
We're no match for them.

642
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,312
I think it's time we gave Mr. La Forge
his sight back.

643
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,782
Maybe they're not out there.

644
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:41,202
They're just trying to decide
if a 20-year-old Klingon bird-of-prey

645
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,704
can be a match
for the Federation flagship.

646
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:48,584
-Perhaps they're on the surface.
-Sir, according to my calculations,

647
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:51,879
a solar probe launched from either
the Klingon ship or the planet surface

648
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,714
will take 11 seconds to reach the sun.

649
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,926
However, since we do not have
an exact point of origin,

650
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,514
it will take us between 8 and 15 seconds
to lock our weapons onto it.

651
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,183
-That's a pretty big margin of error.
-Much too big.

652
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,394
Mr. Data,
how long before the ribbon arrives?

653
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,521
Approximately 47 minutes, sir.

654
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:12,483
We have got to find some way
to get to Soran.

655
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,695
Klingon vessel decloaking
directly ahead, sir.

656
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,118
-They are hailing.
-On screen.

657
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,163
Captain. What an unexpected pleasure.

658
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:29,542
Lursa, it is very important
that I speak with Soran.

659
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,878
I'm afraid the doctor
is no longer aboard our ship.

660
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:38,551
-Then I will beam to his location.
-The doctor values his privacy.

661
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:43,139
He would be quite upset
if an armed away team interrupted him.

662
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:46,142
Then I will beam to your ship
and you can transport me to Soran.

663
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,144
We can't trust them.
For all we know, they killed Geordi.

664
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,520
They might kill you, too.

665
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:54,817
We did not harm your engineer.
He's been our guest.

666
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,985
Then return him!

667
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:00,281
-In exchange for what?
-Me, sir.

668
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,618
Me. I will be your prisoner.

669
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,370
But first,
you must beam me to the surface

670
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:08,247
so that I can speak with Soran.

671
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:13,669
The Captain would make
a much more valuable hostage.

672
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,675
-We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
-Agreed.

673
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,264
Have Dr. Crusher meet me
in Transporter Room 3.

674
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,016
You have the Bridge, Number One.

675
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:35,316
-Receiving the coordinates, Captain.
-Energize.

676
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,646
Welcome, Captain.

677
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:28,369
-You must think I'm quite the madman.
-The thought had crossed my mind.

678
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,663
I know why you're here.

679
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,084
You're not entirely confident
you can shoot down my probe,

680
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:41,340
so you've come to dissuade me
from my horrific plan. Good luck.

681
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,554
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,
I'm rather busy.

682
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,181
Soran.

683
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:00,359
Do be careful, Captain.
That's a 50-gigawatt force field.

684
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,278
I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

685
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,030
I have established the link.

686
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,076
Put it on viewer.

687
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:13,873
It's working. The visor's transmitting.

688
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,250
Where is he?

689
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,221
Human females are so repulsive.

690
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,058
...and some myocardial degeneration.

691
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,729
I've removed the nanoprobe,
and I think you're going to be fine.

692
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,148
I'll need to run some more tests.
I'll let you know.

693
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,733
Thanks, Doc.

694
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,114
-Geordi...
-Data, it's okay.

695
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,284
I am sorry I let you down.

696
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,913
I have not been behaving
like myself lately.

697
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:58,667
No, Data, you haven't.
You've been behaving like a human.

698
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,356
You don't have to do this, Soran.

699
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:24,610
I'm sure we can find another way
of getting you into this Nexus.

700
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,697
I've spent 80 years
looking for another way.

701
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,618
Believe me, this is the only one.

702
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,627
What you're about to do, Soran,
is no different

703
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,547
from when the Borg destroyed
your world.

704
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,049
They killed millions, too,

705
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:51,387
including your wife, children.

706
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,312
Nice try.

707
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,572
You know, there was a time
when I wouldn't hurt a fly.

708
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,074
Then the Borg came,

709
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:18,747
and they showed me that if there
is one constant in this whole universe,

710
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,541
it's death.

711
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,628
Afterwards, I began to realize
it didn't really matter.

712
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:28,841
We're all gonna die sometime.
It's just a question of how and when.

713
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,176
You will, too, Captain.

714
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:35,681
Aren't you beginning to feel
time gaining on you?

715
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,730
It's like a predator. It's stalking you.

716
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:50,529
You can try and outrun it with doctors,
medicines, new technologies,

717
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:55,868
but in the end, time is going
to hunt you down and make the kill.

718
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:01,373
It's our mortality that defines us, Soran.
It's part of the truth of our existence.

719
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,965
-What if I told you I found a new truth?
-The Nexus?

720
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:15,971
Time has no meaning there.
The predator has no teeth.

721
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,809
-Where is he now?
-I don't know.

722
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:24,063
He bathed. Now he's roaming the ship.

723
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,399
He must be the only engineer
in Starfleet

724
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,735
who doesn't go to Engineering.

725
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:34,490
-Any luck, Mr. Worf?
-No, sir. I still cannot locate the Captain.

726
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,620
Data, the sensors can't penetrate
the planet's ionosphere.

727
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:40,829
There's too much interference.

728
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,790
Can you find a way
to scan for life-forms?

729
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,667
I would be happy to, sir.

730
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:49,338
I just love scanning for life-forms.

731
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,425
Life-forms

732
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:57,012
You tiny little life-forms

733
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,183
You precious little life-forms

734
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,977
Where are you?

735
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,028
Finally.

736
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:18,158
Commander, I'd like to run a level 3
diagnostic on the port plasma relays.

737
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,910
I think one of the generators
is fluctuating.

738
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,453
Fine. Let's do that.

739
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:37,219
That's it! Replay from time index 924.

740
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,853
Magnify this section and enhance.

741
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:55,028
Their shields are operating
on a modulation of 257.4.

742
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:58,240
Adjust our torpedo frequency to match.
257.4.

743
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:12,337
They have found a way
to penetrate our shields.

744
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,047
Lock phasers and return fire!

745
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,558
Deanna, take the helm.
Get us out of orbit!

746
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,436
Hull breach on Decks 31 through 35.

747
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,361
Mr. Worf, what do we know about
that old Klingon ship?

748
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,782
-Any weaknesses?
-It's a Class-D12 bird-of-prey.

749
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:42,659
They were retired from service
because of defective plasma coils.

750
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,162
Plasma coils? Is there any way
we can use that to our advantage?

751
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:49,374
I do not see how. The plasma coil
is part of their cloaking device.

752
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,758
Let's get a stabilizer on that conduit.

753
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,720
Reinforce that starboard interlock.

754
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,097
We need to re-route main power
through the secondary coupling.

755
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:09,895
Data, would a defective plasma coil be
susceptible to some sort of ionic pulse?

756
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,816
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
If we sent a low-level ionic pulse,

757
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,151
it might reset the coil
and trigger their cloaking device.

758
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,320
Excellent idea, sir!

759
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,281
As their cloak begins to engage,
their shields will drop.

760
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,784
They'll have two seconds
of vulnerability. Mr. Data,

761
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,411
-lock on to plasma coil.
-No problem.

762
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,752
-Our shields are holding.
-Fire at will.

763
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,756
Mr. Worf,
prepare a spread of photon torpedoes.

764
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,591
We have to hit them
the instant they begin to cloak.

765
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,844
-Aye, sir.
-We get one shot at this.

766
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,595
Target their primary reactor.

767
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:52,604
I have accessed their core frequency.
Initiating ionic pulse.

768
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,273
Make it quick!

769
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,576
-Target their bridge.
-Full disruptors.

770
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,077
-We are cloaking.
-What?

771
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,787
Our shields are down!

772
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,459
Fire.

773
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,243
Yes!

774
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,790
Haven't you got anything better to do?

775
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,544
Must have been that last torpedo.
La Forge to Bridge.

776
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:21,962
I've got a problem down here.

777
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,589
The magnetic interlocks
have been ruptured. I...

778
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:30,178
Coolant leak!
We have a coolant leak, everybody.

779
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,346
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

780
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:35,267
Everybody out. Let's move!
Let's move! We've gotta go!

781
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,768
-Quick!
-Evacuate! Evacuate!

782
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,353
Bridge, we have a new problem.

783
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,188
We're five minutes
from a warp core breach.

784
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,690
There's nothing I can do.

785
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,778
Deanna, evacuate everyone
to the saucer section.

786
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,531
Mr. Data, prepare to separate the ship.

787
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,329
Starship separation in five minutes.

788
01:12:56,456 --> 01:13:00,292
-We're going straight down.
-Everyone move. Take Corridor A.

789
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:09,634
Starship separation
in four minutes, 45 seconds.

790
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:17,142
All right, let's move him out. Let's go.
Take him out, quick.

791
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:23,815
Starship separation
in four minutes, 30 seconds.

792
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,402
-Keep moving, everyone. Keep going.
-Here we go, Rose, this way.

793
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,658
Starship separation
in four minutes, 15 seconds.

794
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,035
-Hurry!
-Keep moving.

795
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:38,163
-Farrell!
-Yes?

796
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,917
There's no one here with these kids.
Let's get them to the Jefferies tube.

797
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,252
-Come on, sweetie.
-We'll find their parents later.

798
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,006
Starship separation in four minutes.

799
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,622
Now you'll have to excuse me, Captain.

800
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:25,877
I have an appointment with eternity,
and I don't want to be late.

801
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:46,106
The core breach is accelerating, Geordi.
We've gotta get out of here.

802
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:50,986
-That's it, Bridge. We're all out.
-One minute to warp core breach.

803
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,322
Begin separation sequence.
Full impulse power once we're clear.

804
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,782
Warp core is going critical.

805
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,967
-Separation complete.
-Engaging impulse engines.

806
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,428
Core breach in progress.

807
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:27,522
Primary stabilizers off-line.
Engaging secondary systems.

808
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:35,614
-Report!
-Helm controls are off-line!

809
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,331
Oh, shooot!

810
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,339
Here we go. Right around this corner!

811
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,176
Come and help me. Help me.

812
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:40,887
Just keep moving.

813
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,348
-On the ground.
-Everybody on the bed!

814
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:52,774
I have re-routed auxiliary power
to the lateral thrusters.

815
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,026
Attempting to level our descent.

816
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,279
All hands, brace for impact!

817
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,869
-Hold on, everybody. Hold on tight.
-Hold their heads.

818
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,065
I'm okay.

819
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,697
What... What is this? Where am I?

820
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,884
-Surprise!
-We love you, Father.

821
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,386
-Were you scared?
-Look at the tree.

822
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:58,473
-I helped decorate it.
-It took all day.

823
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,017
-Say, "Merry Christmas," Papa.
-See the presents?

824
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,478
-I love you, Father.
-I love you, too.

825
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:07,899
Come on, children. Let's move back
and give your father some room.

826
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,415
-Cup of Earl Grey?
-That would be perfect.

827
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,136
-This one's for you.
-Thank you very much, René.

828
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,848
-Merry Christmas, Uncle.
-And Merry Christmas to you, too.

829
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,351
René, can you help me with the table?

830
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,604
René!

831
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,191
Come here.

832
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:08,793
Go help your aunt.

833
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,560
Did you get anything else?

834
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,230
This isn't right.

835
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:57,819
-This can't be real.
-It's as real as you want it to be.

836
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:02,824
Guinan, what's going on?

837
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:07,578
-Why am I here?
-You're in the Nexus.

838
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:14,418
-This is the Nexus?
-For you. This is what you wanted.

839
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:20,633
But I never had a home like this.

840
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,432
Nor a wife and children,
but these are all mine.

841
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:34,689
Guinan, what are you doing here?

842
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,400
I thought you were on board
the Enterprise.

843
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:40,278
I am. I'm also here.

844
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:45,449
Think of me as an echo
of the person you know,

845
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,661
a part of herself she left behind.

846
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,789
When the Enterprise-B
beamed you up from the Lakul.

847
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:57,003
-Papa, help me build my castle.
-Yes, I will in a few minutes.

848
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:04,719
Papa, thank you for the dolly.
She's very beautiful.

849
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:13,561
These are my children.
These are my children.

850
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:17,231
Of course. Time has no meaning here,

851
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:20,151
so you can go back and see them born

852
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:23,863
or go forward
and see your grandchildren.

853
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,033
Dinner's ready, everyone.

854
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,367
-Yay!
-Yay!

855
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,370
Mama, can I...

856
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:35,333
-Dinner's ready, Papa.
-Yes, of course. Come on, Thomas.

857
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,043
It's your favorite.

858
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:08,407
Go on. Go on without me.

859
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:33,099
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?

860
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,727
-Where would you go?
-I don't understand.

861
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:39,605
Well, as I said,
time has no meaning here.

862
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:43,567
So, if you leave,
you can go anywhere, any time.

863
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,112
All right,
I know exactly where I want to go.

864
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:50,116
To the mountaintop on Veridian III
just before Soran destroyed the star.

865
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,911
I have to stop him, but I need help.

866
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,997
Now, if you were
to come back with me, together...

867
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:59,834
I can't leave.
I'm there already, remember?

868
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,587
But I bet I know someone who can.

869
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:08,259
And from his point of view,
he just got here, too.

870
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,644
Kirk.

871
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,690
James T. Kirk.

872
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,488
Beautiful day.

873
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,785
Yes, it certainly is.

874
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,170
Would you mind?

875
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:59,143
Captain, I'm wondering, do you realize...

876
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:02,354
Hold on a minute.
Do you smell something burning?

877
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:18,412
Looks like somebody was trying
to cook some eggs. Come on in.

878
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,875
It's all right. It's my house.

879
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,339
At least it used to be.

880
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,842
I sold it years ago.

881
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:39,183
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Starship Enterprise.

882
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,063
The clock.

883
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,528
I gave this clock to Bones.

884
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:56,283
I'm from what you would consider
the future, the 24th century.

885
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,747
Butler!

886
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:07,753
Butler.

887
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,549
How can you be here?

888
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,094
He's been dead seven years.

889
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,888
Come on, Jim. I'm starving.

890
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,559
How long are you gonna
be rattling around in that kitchen?

891
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,227
Antonia.

892
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:30,985
What are you talking about? The future?

893
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,405
This is the past.

894
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,576
This is nine years ago.

895
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:58,262
The day I told her
I was going back to Starfleet.

896
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:12,359
And these are Ktarian eggs,
her favorite.

897
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,987
I was preparing them to soften the blow.

898
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:20,826
I know how real this must seem to you,
but it's not.

899
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,996
This isn't really your house.

900
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:27,791
We are both of us caught up
in some kind of temporal nexus.

901
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,463
-Dill.
-I beg your pardon?

902
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:35,633
Dill weed.
In the cabinet, second shelf to the left.

903
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,303
Behind the oregano.

904
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:50,022
-How long have you been here?
-I don't know.

905
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:56,111
I was aboard the Enterprise-B
in the Deflector Control Room and...

906
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:57,988
Stir these, will you?

907
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:59,990
The bulkhead
in front of me disappeared,

908
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,868
and then I found myself out there,
just now, chopping wood

909
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,162
right before you walked up.

910
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,498
Thanks.

911
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:12,378
Look, history records

912
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:18,217
that you died saving the Enterprise-B
from an energy ribbon 80 years ago.

913
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,596
You say this is the 24th century?

914
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,559
-And I'm dead?
-Not exactly. As I said,

915
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:31,188
-this is some kind of temporal nexus.
-Temporal nexus, yes, I heard you.

916
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:35,067
-I...
-Something is missing.

917
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:45,411
Captain, look, I need your help.
I want you to leave the Nexus with me.

918
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:50,165
We have to go back to a planet,
Veridian III.

919
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:53,085
We have to stop a man called Soran
from destroying a star.

920
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,422
Millions of lives are at stake.

921
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:01,593
You say history considers me dead.
Who am I to argue with history?

922
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,138
You're a Starfleet officer!
You have a duty.

923
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:06,015
I don't need to be lectured by you.

924
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:09,977
I was out saving the galaxy
when your grandfather was in diapers.

925
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,813
Besides which,
I think the galaxy owes me one.

926
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:18,444
Oh, yeah.

927
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,325
I was like you once,

928
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:28,787
so worried about duty and obligation
I couldn't see past my own uniform.

929
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:35,753
And what did it get me?
An empty house.

930
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,011
Not this time.

931
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:50,267
This time I'm gonna walk up
these stairs, march into that bedroom

932
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:53,562
and tell Antonia I want to marry her.

933
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,440
This time it's gonna be different.

934
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:29,515
-This is not your bedroom.
-No, it's not. It's better.

935
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:34,561
-Better?
-This is my uncle's barn in Idaho.

936
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:39,983
I took this horse out for a ride
11 years ago on a spring day.

937
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:50,411
Like this one.
If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia.

938
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,747
This Nexus of yours, very clever.

939
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:58,168
I can start all over again
and do things right from day one.

940
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:39,102
I must have jumped that 50 times.
Scared the hell out of me each time.

941
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:41,605
Except this time.

942
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,317
Because it isn't real.

943
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:51,114
Antonia.

944
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,992
She isn't real either, is she?

945
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:58,455
Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

946
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,126
You know,
maybe this isn't about an empty house.

947
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:07,130
Maybe it's about that empty chair
on the Bridge of the Enterprise.

948
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:13,470
Ever since I left Starfleet,
I haven't made a difference.

949
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,359
-Captain of the Enterprise?
-That's right.

950
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:30,320
Close to retirement?

951
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:33,699
-I'm not planning on it.
-Let me tell you something. Don't.

952
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:37,202
Don't let them promote you.
Don't let them transfer you.

953
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:41,081
Don't let them do anything that takes you
off the Bridge of that ship,

954
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,876
because while you're there
you can make a difference.

955
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:49,631
Come back with me.
Help me stop Soran.

956
01:38:49,716 --> 01:38:51,842
Make a difference again.

957
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:07,316
Who am I to argue
with the captain of the Enterprise?

958
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,442
What's the name of that planet?

959
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,694
-Veridian III?
-Yes.

960
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:13,989
I take it the odds are against us
and the situation is grim.

961
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:15,741
You could say that.

962
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:18,785
You know, if Spock were here,

963
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:23,206
he'd say that I was an irrational,
illogical human being

964
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,709
for taking on a mission like that.

965
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,047
Sounds like fun.

966
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:48,023
I have re-routed auxiliary power
to the lateral thrusters.

967
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:50,233
Attempting to level our descent.

968
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:52,569
All hands, brace for impact!

969
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:39,866
-Just who the hell are you?
-He's James T. Kirk.

970
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:43,286
Don't you read history?

971
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:50,794
I've gotta get to the launcher.

972
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:55,674
-The ribbon will be here in a minute.
-I'll take care of Soran.

973
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:35,338
Actually, I am familiar with history,
Captain,

974
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:38,550
and if I'm not too much mistaken,
you're dead.

975
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,303
I thought you were heading
for the launcher.

976
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,389
I changed my mind.
Captain's prerogative.

977
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:52,666
We need that control pad.

978
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,632
Captain, look.

979
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:04,845
Where's Soran?

980
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,494
We're running out of time.

981
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:15,248
Look, the control pad,
it's still on the other side.

982
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,125
I'll get it. You go for the launcher.

983
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:20,003
No, you'll never make that by yourself.
We have to work together.

984
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:23,173
We are working together. Trust me. Go.

985
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:25,675
-Good luck, Captain.
-Call me Jim.

986
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,105
Picard!

987
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:06,026
Get away from that launcher.

988
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,197
Now!

989
01:47:48,838 --> 01:47:53,550
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?

990
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:59,305
Yes. We made a difference. Thank you.

991
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:10,400
The least I could do
for the captain of the Enterprise.

992
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:23,163
It was fun.

993
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:36,009
Oh, my.

994
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:02,971
Captain's Log, Stardate 48650.1.

995
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:05,515
Three Starfleet vessels
have arrived in orbit

996
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,309
and have begun to beam up
the Enterprise survivors.

997
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,852
Our casualties were light,

998
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:14,190
but unfortunately, the Enterprise herself
cannot be salvaged.

999
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:17,235
It has been extremely difficult,
Counselor.

1000
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:21,197
Well, then, why did you decide
not to remove the emotion chip?

1001
01:50:21,282 --> 01:50:25,952
At first, I was unprepared for
the unpredictable nature of emotions.

1002
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:31,457
However, having experienced
261 distinct emotional states,

1003
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:34,794
I believe I have learned
to control my feelings.

1004
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:37,255
They will no longer control me.

1005
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:39,757
Well, I hope you're successful, Data.

1006
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,012
Data, over here. I found something.

1007
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:47,765
One life sign, very faint.

1008
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:03,114
Spot!

1009
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:09,329
I'm very happy to see you, Spot.

1010
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,916
Another family reunited.

1011
01:51:17,963 --> 01:51:20,673
Data, are you all right?

1012
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:25,803
I am uncertain, Counselor.

1013
01:51:25,888 --> 01:51:30,475
I am happy to see Spot, yet I am crying.

1014
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:35,980
Perhaps the chip is malfunctioning.

1015
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:40,068
I think it's working perfectly.

1016
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:49,035
Hello, Spot.

1017
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:57,043
Is this it?

1018
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:03,049
Yes. Yes, that's it, Number One.
Thank you.

1019
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:13,434
I'm gonna miss this ship.
She went before her time.

1020
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:22,652
Someone once told me that time was
a predator that stalked us all our lives,

1021
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:25,571
but I rather believe
that time is a companion

1022
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:27,865
who goes with us on the journey,

1023
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:34,038
reminds us to cherish every moment
because they'll never come again.

1024
01:52:37,334 --> 01:52:41,129
What we leave behind is not
as important as how we've lived.

1025
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,633
After all, Number One,
we're only mortal.

1026
01:52:47,052 --> 01:52:50,304
Speak for yourself, sir.
I plan to live forever.

1027
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:58,980
I always thought
I'd get a shot at this chair one day.

1028
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:02,608
Perhaps you still will.

1029
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:05,987
Somehow, I doubt that
this will be the last ship

1030
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:08,322
to carry the name Enterprise.

1031
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,792
Picard to Farragut. Two to beam up.
