2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,159
Okay. That's more like it.

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,279
Hey. Hey. Hey.

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,519
She's a shy type.

5
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,119
Shy type ass. She's afraid of you.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,279
Hey, look. She's calling her hubby.

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,879
Hey, you bitch.

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,800
- Dumbass, where are you going? Turn left here.
- Man.

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,639
Turn left.

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,399
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Nothing to see here. Make way, please.

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,119
- Out of the way please.
I have studied very hard this semester. I deserve an A.

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,239
Of course, I'm scared.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,319
I just took off to read some books.

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,959
Hey, these are books you love to read.

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,319
Hey, excuse me.

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
- Oh, wait. Hold on.
- Excuse me.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,759
Yes?

18
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,919
We're here to work. Not to chit-chat.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,039
Oh, right. Right.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,679
Come on.

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,400
OK. I've got to go. They're calling for me.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,199
Hurry up.

23
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,319
Okay.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,279
Come give me a hand.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,159
Okay.

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,879
Here.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,919
Okay.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,959
Okay?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,119
See you.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,999
You got it.

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,079
You make no sense.

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,161
- Are you drunk?
- I'm okay.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,439
She's got a boyfriend, you know. Hey.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,319
You're kidding me. She's in a school uniform.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,839
- He's coming.
- You're available, aren't you?

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,959
Hey, here comes her man.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,159
Your boyfriend?

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,479
- Am I? Asshole.
- Not my dad.

39
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,239
Sorry, sorry.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,959
Who's that?

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,279
No one. Relax.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,399
Have a seat. Let's have some fun.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,239
- Come on. Let's drink to us. Come on.
- Your glass.

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,359
- Come on.
- Let's drink.

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
Damn, I always sit next to the ice bucket.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,719
Stop. Stop. Stop.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,679
Excellent.

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,359
Bottoms up, guys.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,559
Beautiful.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,639
Cherd.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,839
I've been looking for you.

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,439
You want trouble?

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,519
What are you doing?

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,119
Let me go, bastard.

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,599
Hey, Cherd. Please. She's my girl.

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,640
- Let me go.
- Your girl?

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,839
What are you doing?

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,119
What are you going to do?

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,479
Son of a bitch.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,359
Enough.

61
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,759
Don't you dare.

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,639
That's enough.

63
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,959
You're a drug dealer?

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,639
Just ice.

65
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,479
You're lucky my boss didn't want you dead.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,759
Or you would've been six feet under.

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,920
You've got some guts stealing from us.

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,239
Making money to get married?

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,159
I didn't steal.

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,439
I just couldn't deal them. Cops have been on me.

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,159
Just shut up. You take us to get the dope.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
And pay the boss two hundred grands, that's it.

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,719
Two hundred grands?

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,839
- Where would we get it from?
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,879
What is it?

76
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,879
Any problem here?

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,479
No problem.

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,399
Hey, is that you, Cherd?

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,359
Nothing, man. He's with me.

80
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,359
You sure?

81
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,119
Who's that?

82
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,679
Just stay away from him.

83
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,159
This bastard's scarier than ghosts.

84
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,839
Shit. It's real quiet in here.

85
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,799
Where are all the people?

86
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
You such a dumbass, huh?

87
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,279
Hiding the dope in your school.

88
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,119
It's a university.

89
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,799
It's the same.

90
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,679
Go.

91
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,119
Quickly.

92
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,719
Hurry up.

93
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,639
Here it is.

94
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,199
- What's wrong with you, Jimmy?
- Don't hurt him.

95
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,239
Nothing.

96
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,559
It's good. Go.

97
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,841
Is there something upstairs?

98
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,559
No. No. Nothing.

99
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,919
Nothing. Nothing there.

100
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,759
Jimmy.

101
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,479
- Please.
- Please, I'll tell you.

102
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,319
There's a ghost upstairs.

103
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,599
Really,

104
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,599
in the ladies' room, fifth floor.

105
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,519
A female student hung herself during school break.

106
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,479
Or it could be a nymph in Thai dress.

107
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,079
The lights must not be turned off.

108
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
It's true. There's a shrine inside the ladies' room.

109
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,880
A shrine inside the ladies' room. Don't bullshit me.

110
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,119
Really. No one dares to enter even during daytime.

111
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,879
I want to see it.

112
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,039
Please.

113
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,599
Go.

114
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
Let's get out of here.

115
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,719
Go.

116
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,759
Push the button.

117
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,599
Go inside.

118
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,039
Go.

119
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,239
Why did she hang herself in the toilet?

120
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,439
Got dumped, obviously.

121
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,039
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

122
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,201
If I don't see a ghost, I'll piss all over the shrine.

123
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,959
Shit. Got me spooked.

124
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,399
Please.

125
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,399
- Please, let us go.
- Please, let me go home.

126
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,119
- I can't take it anymore. I want to go home.
- Enough, please.

127
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,879
Please. I beg you.

128
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,239
Hey.

129
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,679
It won't close.

130
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,679
Pia, close the door.

131
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,039
Come on.

132
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,999
I told you not to come here.

133
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,359
Shit. Let's get out of here.

134
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,919
Do you believe me now?

135
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,559
Get out.

136
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,479
Shit.

137
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,679
Are you happy now, asshole?

138
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,439
Shut the door.

139
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,079
Shit. It's broken.

140
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,060
I did push the button.

141
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,919
Quickly.

142
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,319
Please. No.

143
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,640
Where's the way down?

144
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,439
Exit.

145
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,639
Take me there.

146
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,799
Oh, shit.

147
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,159
Please.

148
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,039
Hey. Don't close yet.

149
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,679
Hey, wait. Open up. Open up.

150
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,959
Ladies' room.

151
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,119
Hey Cherd, open the door.

152
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,719
Cherd, open the door.

153
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,199
Cherd, please.

154
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
Please open the door.

155
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,199
Cherd, open the door for me.

156
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,399
Cherd.

157
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Son of a bitch.

158
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,079
I'm scared now. I'm scared now. I'm sorry.

159
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,599
Nakorn 64, dispatcher 2. Over.

160
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,439
Nakorn 64, dispatcher 2.

161
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,319
Dispatcher 15. Three falls from height.
One seriously injured. One unconscious.

162
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,119
The other one is talking gibberish.
Some kind of mental problem.

163
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,719
One dead in the ladies' room.

164
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,279
Cause of death? Over.

165
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,319
Hey, how did he die?

166
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,959
He shot himself. Shot himself in the head.

167
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
Really. Oh, died from gunshot wound.

168
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,039
- We're on the way.
- Your boyfriend?

169
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,639
My friend. Close friend.

170
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,519
Close friend? Well, are you scared of the dead?

171
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,639
I'll get used to it.

172
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,599
Did you mean the corpses or your face?

173
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,119
Smartass, You're asking for my foot.

174
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,879
What was he thinking shooting himself like this?

175
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,479
Look at his face. Does he look
like he wants to kill himself?

176
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,119
Oh, really? Did you see his face? I only see a big hole.

177
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,519
- Hey, oh man.
- What?

178
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,079
Damn. Let me sit.

179
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,119
Shit. Have some respect to an old man.

180
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,879
- Long night, hum?
- Hmm.

181
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,559
Hey, where's my girl, Muay?

182
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,879
How would I know?

183
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,759
- You dare said that.
- Why?

184
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,519
Your girl is over there in the
mortuary. I think she gave you a wink.

185
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,519
Look who's talking. You were
pissing your pants up there.

186
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,599
You think it's funny? I hope you see
one for real. I'll laugh my ass off.

187
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,479
So, have you seen Muay?

188
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,959
I haven't. I only saw her talking on the phone over there.

189
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,359
So do you know or not know?

190
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,599
What are you doing? It's kind of weird tonight.

191
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,879
Scary both cases. Oh, they went to deliver the corpses.

192
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,199
Got it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Bye.

193
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,639
Can you help me, please?

194
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:47,959
Fired chicken. Fried chicken.
Put a stick in their asses. Left and right.

195
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,799
Is it her?

196
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,839
Yeah, that one.

197
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
Let's give her a history lesson.

198
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,679
Enough. Go back to your seat.

199
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,279
You're having so much fun, huh?

200
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,239
Do you realize that you're sitting on a hallow ground?

201
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,399
What the hell is wrong with him?

202
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,959
That girl is the niece of the general
who ordered the killing of the students here in 1976.

203
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,879
I heard Meng and Kiak talking about her last name.

204
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,319
What did they do for you?

205
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,119
They fought for democracy.

206
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,159
Who sacrificed themselves for our democracy?

207
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,839
The students.

208
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,119
Louder.

209
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,239
The students.

210
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,519
Who killed those brave students?

211
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,919
Who? I said, who?

212
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,559
- The conflict of political ideologies.
- Wrong.

213
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,679
It's the tyrannical dictators.

214
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,279
Everything is cool, guys. Kiak is a little emotional today.

215
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,839
Let's move to the next activities.

216
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,159
Get up and follow me.

217
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,040
What the hell is wrong with you?

218
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,119
You shut up.

219
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,959
This is not something you take lightly.

220
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,679
Even though it happened a long time ago,
and it won't revive any victims

221
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,319
from their deaths. But you should
know that giving the order to kill

222
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,719
is the same as killing. What a surprise
the murderer's niece dares to come here.

223
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,959
Calm down. My friend is a little too emotional.
Don't make it an issue.

224
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,439
I'm sorry. What would you do if
someone berated your ancestor?

225
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,919
What did I do to you? Can't you think logically?
Was I born yet when it happened?

226
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,999
Your mom and dad probably hadn't
met. I come here to study,

227
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,479
not to argue with someone about the past.

228
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,359
Moreover, maybe the students were not totally right.

229
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,639
Then follow me.

230
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:56,599
The students were brutally shot inside this elevator.
The bloodstained can't be cleaned.

231
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,439
Try going inside. Are you afraid?

232
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:35,039
Nok Noi? Hey, Nok Noi? Are you okay?

233
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,919
You guys will take responsibilities for this.

234
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,359
Come on, just a brief stop. Be considerate.

235
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,439
What a gentleman, asshole.

236
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,639
It's me. Every time.

237
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,039
Sorry.

238
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,679
Who are you running from? Listen,
Kiak wants to say something to you.

239
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,279
Well, I'm sorry. Are you still mad at me.

240
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,319
I've been thinking. We shouldn't talk about our fathers.

241
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,320
You were not involved in the incident.

242
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,559
But you still think my grandfather is guilty.

243
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,839
Yes. He ordered the killing of the
students. And you're his niece.

244
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,119
Are you still scared of the Red
Elevator? You can relax now.

245
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,679
It will be removed tomorrow. And
what your grandfather has done

246
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,839
will be removed from everyone's memory. I have to go.

247
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,161
Hey, wait for me.

248
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,399
He's been following you everywhere?

249
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,079
Nok Noi. Aren't you coming with us?

250
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,599
That's fine. I'll take the stairs.

251
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,959
Wait. I'm coming. Hold on.

252
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,759
Hey, forgot my bag.

253
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,319
- Wait for me.
- Hey, wait.

254
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,119
Where's Panu? Where's Panu? Where's Panu?

255
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,679
Where's Panu?

256
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,559
- Am I telling you the truth?
- Yes.

257
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,399
Thai people must stand up and fight.

258
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,559
Thank you very much.

259
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,959
Hey, who did I bring here?

260
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,319
Come on. It's her last night with us.

261
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,959
What if you can't help them?

262
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,319
I must. The elevator is still in use until tomorrow.

263
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,639
I must bring them together.

264
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,359
This girl is strange.

265
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,479
Why? Was she flirting with you?

266
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,279
Dickhead. I mean this girl

267
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,319
can see something we can't.

268
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,039
What do you mean? Ghosts?

269
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,839
I'm sorry.

270
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,639
Are you still scared of the Red
Elevator? You can relax now.

271
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,921
It will be removed tomorrow.

272
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,599
Where's Panu? Where's Panu?

273
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,519
Have you seen Sajee? Have you seen Sajee?

274
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:47,959
I must bring them together.

275
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,121
General's niece killed in car
accident on Rajdamnern road.

276
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,119
October 6th, 1996.

277
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,199
Spirits of the dead like to stay at the same place,
doing the same thing

278
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,319
over and over again, until their needs are fulfilled.

279
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,879
Really? When are they going to stop?

280
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,399
You said like you've seen one.

281
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,679
It's not for everyone to see.

282
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,239
Depends on the time and chance.

283
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,399
Your first time?

284
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,199
Yes.

285
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,639
It'll hurt a little.

286
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,439
Ah huh.

287
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,919
Open your mouth.

288
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,719
A little more. Good. Relax.

289
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,839
Almost done. Almost. Good.

290
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,879
Doctor Prasert, the director
wants to see you immediately.

291
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,801
What does he want me to do?

292
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,799
Pulling out teeth from the corpses.

293
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,519
Explosion at an ice factory. We can't identify the corpses.

294
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,399
You take care of it.

295
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,559
Sir, why me?

296
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,759
You're a dentist. You want an OB/GYN to pull out teeth?

297
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,639
Do you have any problem? Don't tell me you're scared.

298
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,239
No, sir.

299
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,559
Good. Just take care of this.

300
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Are you scared? Are you scared?

301
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,319
Hey. Daydreaming about ghosts?

302
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,719
There, there.

303
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,079
- I told you to study engineering, but you didn't listen.
- Keep it down.

304
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,559
This is a classroom. You're having too much fun.

305
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,919
I have said that the deadline for
the report was seven o'clock.

306
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,839
But these four reports were submitted at nine.

307
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:57,679
Paweena. Pramuan. Parinya.

308
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,239
And Prasert.

309
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,359
See me in my office after class. All of you.

310
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,639
Okay, let's continue from last week. Where were we?

311
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,679
Hey Sert, where are you running to?

312
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,359
- I'll tell the professor.
- About what?

313
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,999
About how you borrowed my
report, and submitted it late.

314
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,399
That's it? Hey, Sert?

315
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,719
Hey, Sert. I heard you're scared of ghosts?

316
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,199
Hey, you're insulting him. You know that he's actually

317
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,359
terrified to death.

318
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,439
Hey, Mr. Prasert, don't you know that

319
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,919
to become a dentist, you must study a corpse.

320
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,719
Mr. Stupid wants to be a dentist, huh?

321
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,719
Hey, Sert. Remember when I stuck
with you in anatomy class.

322
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,239
I didn't complain once.

323
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,479
Sert.

324
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,199
Sorry, where's the professor?

325
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,839
She has left for the hospital.

326
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,479
Hey, why are you being upset?

327
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,679
Let's go inside. I have sweets for you inside.

328
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,039
Don't worry. I'll take care of you. Nothing to worry.

329
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,559
- Prepare the EKG monitor, and some oxygen.
- Yes doctor.

330
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,439
- Good. Take care of him.
- Go. Go.

331
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,319
Good evening, professor.

332
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,639
- Good evening, professor.
- Good evening.

333
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,879
We're here to see you about the late report.

334
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,879
We're not in school, are we?

335
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,119
I'm really sorry professor.

336
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,719
I won't let it happen again.

337
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,159
- Professor, please help me. Professor.
- Have to go. This is not fair.

338
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,199
What's going on?

339
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,799
Well, I'm taking a leave to get
married. I've submitted my request.

340
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,039
But she said I can't go. What's the problem?

341
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,399
Well, no one else will take the shift on the new year's eve.

342
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,359
Everyone in the department already took leave.

343
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,359
Hold on. Please let me go home. I've got to get married.

344
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,039
Just one night, one shift. Please.

345
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,919
Oh, professor. I'll take his shift.

346
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,479
Hey, on new year's eve?

347
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,039
You heard him? It's settled then.

348
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,199
Don't you let me down.

349
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,199
Yes, professor.

350
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,599
So, what's your duty? Transportation or drug room?

351
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,519
Mortuary.

352
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:35,399
Prasert, it's the same as the anatomy classroom.
No need to be scared.

353
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,439
No, it's not the same.

354
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:47,359
There, people are willing to enter. Here, they're not.

355
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,839
Go away.

356
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:12,279
I can't come home this year,
mom. Well, I have reports to do.

357
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,119
Right. Happy new year, mom.

358
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,599
Oh, my amulet.

359
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,679
Damn you, Joke.

360
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,879
Hey, you go ahead. I'll be a little late.

361
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,839
Oh, why?

362
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,439
It's New Year's Eve. I'm going out with Nan. Come on.

363
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,199
Okay. Just hurry up.

364
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,519
Got it, boss.

365
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,919
Oh, when you are at the mortuary, be careful.

366
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,719
Why?

367
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,719
They say you can't turn back.

368
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,719
Sert, do you remember that story?

369
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,599
The corpses in the mortuary.
Sometimes their hands are closed,

370
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,759
but when we look away

371
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,839
and turn back, they might be open.

372
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,119
You're late.

373
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,239
Hey, it's time.

374
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,759
You arrived for a long while and haven't done anything.

375
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,079
Go take a routine check.

376
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,599
Here you are. I'm going to the toilet.

377
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,679
Hey.

378
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,399
Joke.

379
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,439
Sert, check the file.

380
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,719
There're five beds.

381
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,879
You must understand. A corpse is a corpse.

382
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,079
It's a dead body. It contain no energy.

383
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,439
It can't move.

384
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,599
But ghosts, they're damn spooky.

385
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:29,359
They're full of hatred. They would haunt you to death.

386
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,159
Hey, Joke. Wait for me.

387
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,039
- I really can't go. I know it's New Year's Eve.
- Joke.

388
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,719
- What's the big deal?
- Hey, Joke.

389
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,719
Joke. Is that you?

390
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,639
- Give me a hand. Come on.
- Nakorn. From Nakorn 64 Dispatcher 2. Over.

391
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,879
- A drown woman is found. No identification. Over.
- Place her here.

392
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,039
Dispatcher 25 is taking the victim for forensic ID.

393
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,239
Nakorn. Dispatcher 2.

394
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,159
Come on. Up. Up. Got it? I'm leaving.

395
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,719
Hey, close it. Close it, you morons.

396
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,839
Hey. Sign here. Hurry up.

397
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,479
Right here.

398
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,399
Let's go.

399
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,479
Joke. Hello?

400
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,359
I'm colonel Tuanton Tuptim.

401
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,399
Hey, are the ambulance guys still around?

402
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,679
No, they're gone.

403
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,479
They're gone? The people who brought
you a drown woman. They've left?

404
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,759
Well, yes, sir.

405
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,679
Hmm, what's your name then?

406
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,199
My name is Prasert, sir.

407
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,039
Okay, let's do this, Prasert.

408
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,719
Can you go check on her back if she has a tattoo?

409
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,839
Prasert. Prasert. Prasert. Prasert.

410
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,639
- Yes' sir.
- I'll call you back in five minutes.

411
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:22,079
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

412
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,799
There's one missing.

413
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,319
Hey, Prasert? So, did you find it?

414
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,279
I asked you to look for a tattoo, remember?
Jeez. Damn it. You're wasting my time.

415
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,559
Prasert, this is an important case.

416
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,359
I'll call you back in three minutes.

417
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,159
Just take care of it. If not, don't say I didn't warn you.

418
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,119
Listen, the police just called me, complaining that

419
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,399
the mortuary officer didn't
cooperate with the investigation.

420
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,799
Is that true?

421
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,959
Professor, I...

422
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,999
I've heard some stories about you.

423
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,799
If what your friends had told me is true, it means

424
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,479
you are not qualified to be a doctor.

425
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,959
Do you understand?

426
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,079
I understand, professor. Everything will be taken care of.

427
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:18,999
Good.

428
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,879
I'll take you to Pai after this New Year holiday.

429
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,119
Okay, see you. Bye.

430
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:08,799
A corpse is a corpse. It's a dead
body. It contains no energy.

431
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,279
It can't move.

432
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,119
Prasert, this is an important case.

433
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,079
Mr. Stupid wants to be a dentist, huh?

434
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,679
He's terrified to death.

435
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,079
You are not qualified to be a doctor.

436
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,839
Almost got him.

437
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,399
I don't know.

438
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,079
But I bet it's about girls.

439
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,320
- How do you know?
- What?

440
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,039
- Bullshit.
- I confirm.

441
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,319
Bullshit is all you got.

442
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,519
Hey, Muay, are you going back to Chiang Mai?

443
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,399
Yeah.

444
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,319
It's a long way to go.

445
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,679
Why? Why? Are you going with her?

446
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,680
- Hey, what if I wanted to go with her?
- Have you ever talked to a ghost?

447
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,759
Talk to a ghost? I've never even seen one.

448
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,319
I mean communicating with a spirit.

449
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,119
Oh, well. I think we're living in a different world.

450
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,279
No. We're in the same world with them.

451
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,919
Shit. I can't drink now.

452
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,919
- Wanna see you for real.
- I'm sexier in person.

453
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,279
- Really.
- Have to prove, ha.

454
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,719
- How to prove?
- How do you want to prove?

455
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,439
Quit chatting. Lots of perverts in there.

456
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,879
It's fun. Just a little flirt and the boys are going crazy.

457
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,999
I'm melting now, Miss Berry.

458
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,159
Berry? Rotten Berry.

459
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,879
That's you.

460
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,199
Your friend? She's hot.

461
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,999
More than friend.

462
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,199
Muay, come here.

463
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,759
No. Stop that.

464
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,239
Come on, just a little flirt.

465
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,639
Lesbian?

466
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,759
Only when I'm bored.

467
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,000
- Stop that.
- Come on.

468
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,399
Slutty whore.

469
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,279
Hey, asshole.

470
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,159
That's your mom.

471
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:18,999
Sick freak.

472
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,839
You bitch. I'm gonna kill you.

473
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,439
What?

474
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,799
What a psycho.

475
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,719
Shit, that's scary. Just stop it.

476
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,199
He doesn't know us. What are you afraid of?

477
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,799
But he's seen your face.

478
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,279
He might not even be in Thailand.

479
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,679
Screw him.

480
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,039
I'm starving. Let's find something to eat.

481
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,559
I'm having a headache. I'll wait here.

482
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,959
Have you taken the medicine? Huh?

483
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,119
Let me cure you. Come here.

484
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,239
Abracadabra.

485
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,519
What's wrong?

486
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,239
Are you mad at me? Okay, I'll stop.

487
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,039
Get some sleep.

488
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,239
Oh, I'll go with Pui. She's got a car.

489
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,319
I don't think she's here.

490
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:48,799
Jeez. The holiday is only four
days. Everybody's gone already.

491
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,439
What do you want?

492
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,079
Pad Thai?

493
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,799
Okay. Just come back soon.

494
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,199
Who's that? Sa?

495
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,799
Don't you have the key?

496
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:22,719
Hold on.

497
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,439
Pretty. Pretty.

498
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,639
Smashing.

499
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,199
I'm in need for a wife.

500
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,679
International wife.

501
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,319
What a bunch of jerks.

502
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,839
How much is it?

503
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,919
Twenty baht.

504
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,239
Hey girl, wanna come with me?

505
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,039
No, thanks. I have to bring dinner to my friend.

506
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,759
I'll take you home.

507
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,719
That's OK. I have someone to pick me up.

508
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,279
Don't lie to me.

509
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,559
Hey, I said no. Didn't you hear?

510
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,279
Hey, that's not so nice.

511
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,519
Hey, who's that?

512
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,799
Any problem here?

513
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,239
You don't have to bring your dad.

514
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,999
Hey, watch your mouth.

515
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,639
Let's go.

516
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,479
I'll wait for Sa here.

517
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,119
Don't you remember me?

518
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,959
Of... of course, I do. You're the guy next door.

519
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,439
I'm melting now, Miss Berry.

520
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,759
Beckham.

521
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,399
Thank you so much for taking me home.

522
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,199
Are you a cop?

523
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,119
Not really. I usually do cases related to ICT.

524
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,719
ICT? Like Internet crimes?

525
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,279
Why do you ask?

526
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,559
I happened to come across an online psychopath.

527
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,919
Hmm. Must be scary. Do you know who he is?

528
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,519
I don't know. Just like many others.

529
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,280
I don't know any of them in the real world.

530
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,359
That's the danger of cyber world.

531
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,479
Are you okay?

532
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,559
Hey, don't you live next door to me?

533
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,999
- Hello, Muay.
- Sa, do you remember the reclusive guy next door?

534
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:28,439
- Yeah, I do. He's actually...
- That's Beckham. He came in to apologize to you.

535
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,199
Huh?

536
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,079
There. He's the psychopath I told you.

537
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,599
I'm so sorry.

538
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,079
Canto?

539
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,319
Who has killed someone?

540
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,319
Who has killed someone for real?

541
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,119
Hello. Are you a psycho?

542
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,199
Yeah.

543
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,359
Really?

544
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,759
Yeah.

545
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,439
So. Do you want?

546
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,599
Yes.

547
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,599
You got it.

548
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,119
No. Help.

549
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,959
Calm down. Don't get excited. Just go get her.

550
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:07,679
Bastard. Go away. Let me go. Help.

551
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,639
Where has she gone?

552
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,439
Go ahead.

553
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,260
Don't be scared.

554
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,439
You said you wanted to kill.

555
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,559
Let's start with the hammer.

556
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,799
Wait.

557
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,959
We're friends, aren't we?

558
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,839
What's my name?

559
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:11,799
Beck... Beckham. Beckham. Beckham.

560
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,199
Beckham.

561
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,079
Bastard. You sick freak.

562
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:34,119
Hey. Hey, Beckham. Slow down.
Don't let her die too soon. Slow down.

563
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,399
Beckham.

564
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,559
How was I?

565
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,399
Keano and Fergie were even sicker.

566
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:42,759
How do you know that I'm here?

567
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,799
Not too hard to find out.

568
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:49,959
Let's go to Bangkok.

569
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,519
I'll introduce you to our gang.

570
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:58,919
Thank you for finding me. I almost
went back to who I was before.

571
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:44,839
Hello. Sa. Sa. Can you hear me, Sa? Where are you?

572
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:58,159
I've been worrying about you.
Okay. Just hurry back home.

573
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:21,919
Beckham. Does anyone else know about this?

574
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,399
You sound like you can talk to a ghost.

575
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:03,199
Beckham. Get out. Get out of here now.

576
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:16,039
So, where are you going?

577
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,319
You're going to leave me now, right?

578
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:34,159
Yeah, I can take of myself.

579
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,839
Where is your friend going?

580
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,439
She's found someone she's been looking for.

581
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:03,319
It's dangerous to walk around
here alone. Let us take you home.

582
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,199
Thank you.
