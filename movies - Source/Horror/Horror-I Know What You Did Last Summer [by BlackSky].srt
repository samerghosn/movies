1
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:22,828
I LOVE YOU

2
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,007
4th OF JULY CROAKER FESTIVAL

3
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:32,356
Let's welcome back our six finalists to the stage.

4
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,611
They're pretty as can be,aren't they?

5
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:42,783
You worked hard. Your parents worked hard. We're proud of you.

6
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,004
She was born for this.

7
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:02,761
- Her breasts are so... ample.
- She does exercises to pump 'em up.

8
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:08,851
Guys, I'm on sexist overload as it is. Kill the commentary.

9
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,438
"In the spirit of Mother Teresa,what will be your contribution -

10
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:18,068
- to your community and the world at large?"

11
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:25,534
At summer's end, I plan to become a serious actress in New York City.

12
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:32,833
By entertaining the world through art, I shall serve my country.

13
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:40,048
Did you feed her this shit?

14
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:45,554
Work it. Babe!
They're eating it up.

15
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:57,900
And this year's Croaker Queen is:
Miss Helen Shivers.

16
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,576
That's my girl!

17
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,708
That's my girlfriend!

18
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:54,206
- How's my hair?
- Hurricane-proof.

19
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:58,919
It's all about hair. Don't forget it when you become a big lawyer.

20
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:04,049
Professional women think it's all about brains, and ignore the "do".

21
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,636
The "do" is vital. Got it.

22
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,600
- Are you riding with me?
- No. Tell Mom I'll be home late.

23
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:20,399
- Is Miss Croaker gonna get sautéed?
- A twit with a wit.

24
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:30,409
- Julie. A shooter on the house.
- I can't get past the slime.

25
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:34,997
How about I take you out before you leave town?

26
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,671
I don't think so. Max.

27
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:47,259
We've been friends since forever.
You can't leave without a farewell.

28
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,264
A toast... to us.

29
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:58,478
To our last summer of immature.
Adolescent decadence.

30
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:05,235
- Somebody's buzzed.
- Chum bait. Take a hike.

31
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,575
- Easy, easy!
- Barry, they're just friends.

32
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,121
Come on. This is tired.

33
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:23,337
- I'm just taking care of your girl.
- Thanks, buddy. Let's blow.

34
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:28,675
Let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
A little joyride.

35
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,850
Bye.

36
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:53,033
They're making out when they hear over the radio -

37
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,248
- that a killer with a hook for a hand escaped from the insane asylum.

38
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:06,255
- You're telling it wrong.
- Shut up. The girl gets all scared.

39
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:11,176
She wants to go home.
The boy gets pissed and peels out.

40
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:16,056
No, the boy goes for help and the girl stays in the car.

41
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:23,063
- She hears a scratching sound...
- It's not a scratch, it's a drip.

42
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,569
No, the guy's been hung from a tree.
His feet are scratching the roof.

43
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:34,908
No, he's been decapitated,
and the blood's dripping on the car.

44
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,746
No, he wasn't decapitated,
he was gutted with a hook.

45
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,920
- That's the way I heard it.
- You're all wrong.

46
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:53,385
They get to the girl's house and
find a bloody hook in the car door.

47
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:58,140
That's the original story.
That's the way it really happened.

48
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:02,144
None of it really happened.
It's a bullshit story.

49
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:08,609
- No. It's not. It's true.
- I don't think so, Ray.

50
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:13,238
It's a fictional story to warn girls
of the dangers of premarital sex.

51
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:21,747
You know how terrified I am of
your I.Q., but it's an urban legend.

52
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:27,753
And they all originate from
some sort of real-life incident.

53
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:47,940
By that time I'll be finishing my
two-year deal on "Guiding Light", -

54
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:54,613
- coinciding with your first year
as quarterback for the Steelers.

55
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,702
Then we can elope to Europe
or the Caymans, -

56
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:05,290
- where I'll let you impregnate me
with the first of three children. -

57
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:09,628
- before you head off to rehab.

58
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:14,591
Then we can live happily...
blah. Blah. Blah.

59
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,806
Ray? Where did you go?

60
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:25,227
I'm gonna hook you!

61
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:30,274
- Do you really believe that crap?
- It's true.

62
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,404
The hook is really a phallic symbol.
Ultimately castrated.

63
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,741
I'm gonna miss you.

64
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:44,538
You can always ditch Boston
and come to New York with me.

65
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:49,918
We can't all sit in coffee-houses
and ramble on our laptops.

66
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:55,757
- Nobody gets me the way you do.
- I understand your pain.

67
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,886
I hate this.

68
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:05,100
You're gonna fall for a head-shaven,
body-piercing philosophy student.

69
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:11,440
- That sounds attractive.
- I'll never see you again.

70
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:18,280
High-school relationships are more
successful than any other kind.

71
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,868
Cite your source.

72
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,883
Are you sure?

73
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:06,620
- Give me the keys.
- Nobody drives my car but me.

74
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:11,625
I know, baby, but the Croaker Queen
has to get home now.

75
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,088
- Hey, you two.
- Give me my fucking keys.

76
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:21,093
Come ride in the back with me.
I'll let you do things to me.

77
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,973
- Nobody drives my car but me.
- Get in the car.

78
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,448
You can't drive for shit.

79
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,162
Can you say "alcoholic"?

80
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,254
What the hell is this crap?

81
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,481
What's wrong with you?

82
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,194
Watch out!

83
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,163
- What was that?
- Is everybody okay?

84
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,168
- I think it was an animal.
- You're bleeding.

85
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:41,673
- It's not mine.
- It must have been a dog.

86
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,594
Jesus Christ, my fucking car!

87
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:54,686
- Can't you see where you're going?
- It came out of nowhere.

88
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:59,024
- A dog couldn't have done that.
- A deer could.

89
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:03,779
- My dad's gonna freak on my ass.
- It was an accident.

90
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:08,909
- If it was a deer. Where is it?
- Maybe it ran off.

91
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:13,789
- I hope we didn't kill it.
- Oh, my God...

92
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,800
- No way.
- I thought...

93
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:29,221
- I didn't see it.
- There's no way.

94
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,391
This isn't happening.

95
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,398
Check that side.

96
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:53,620
I couldn't see it.
I swear!

97
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:59,751
<i>- Is he dead?
- Check his pulse. You</i> rammed him!</i>

98
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,068
I think he's dead.

99
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:33,994
- Who is he?
- His face is all messed up.

100
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:39,500
- What was he doing out here?
- What was he doing out here?

101
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,586
What's your hurry?

102
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:47,132
- The guy's dead.
- You're not a doctor.

103
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:51,470
Use your brain, Julie.
If we call the police, we're fucked.

104
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:55,349
- It was an accident.
- Let's think about this.

105
00:16:55,516 --> 00:17:01,313
Think about what? He crossed
the road in the middle of the night.

106
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,027
- You weren't drinking or speeding.
- They won't believe I was driving.

107
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:12,616
- It's my car. They'll nail my ass.
- That's not true.

108
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,411
I'm drunk as shit. I'm fucked!

109
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,915
We'll call the police
and tell the truth.

110
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,253
It's manslaughter.

111
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:29,633
- We're gonna fry no matter what.
- Then we leave now.

112
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,469
Are you crazy?

113
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,974
- The grille's busted and bloody.
- We can clean it up.

114
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:43,730
- We're going to the police!
- We don't have time for your shit!

115
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:48,819
Let's try to stay calm.

116
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:55,659
<i>If there's some of the car on him</i>.
You're looking at a hit-and-run!</i>

117
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:00,747
- Then we dump the body.
- You've lost it.

118
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:05,335
- Let's pretend we were never here.
- We'll dump him in the water.

119
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,757
When they find him,
the evidence will be washed away.

120
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,720
If they found him at all.

121
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,393
Maybe the undertow could carry him
out to sea.

122
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,813
I won't be any part of it.

123
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,275
I'm scared. Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.

124
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:34,781
I don't have the family or money
to get me out of this. Please.

125
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:42,956
This is your future, Julie. Think
about college. Your scholarship.

126
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:49,254
The guy's already dead. If we go
to the police, we're dead too.

127
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:01,391
- What do we do?
- Help me.

128
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,400
They're slowing down.

129
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,487
- Who is it?
- It's Max.

130
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:17,616
Get rid of him.

131
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,334
- Have you got car trouble?
- Actually...

132
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:33,173
Barry had too much to drink. We
don't want upchuck in the new car.

133
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,886
- It doesn't look so new anymore.
- Yeah. Don't drink and drive.

134
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,722
Daddy's gonna be mad.

135
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:49,147
- What can i do for you, Max?
- Wipe that grin off your face.

136
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:58,282
Ok, Max, will do.
Have a good night.

137
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:04,788
- You got that rich boy act down.
- We'll be seeing you.

138
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,712
Take care. Julie.

139
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:03,055
Even if his body washes ashore, -

140
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:07,643
- he'll be eaten by crabs
and small fish.

141
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,522
Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark.

142
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:16,109
Take him to the side.

143
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,699
Put him down.

144
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,417
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

145
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:37,214
- Should we found out who he is?
- Why?

146
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:41,677
- Just to know.
- I don't want to know.

147
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:46,723
Let's just pretend he's an escaped
lunatic with a hook. Ray, help me.

148
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:56,817
- I don't think I can.
- Barry, it's not too late.

149
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:02,823
- You, just shut up!
- Christ. I'll do it.

150
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,121
Get him off me!

151
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:14,459
My crown!
He's got my crown!

152
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,200
Over there!

153
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,760
- Let's get out of here.
- We're going home now.

154
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:13,060
Never, under any circumstances,
speak about this again.

155
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:18,732
It's now merely
a future therapy bill. Agreed?

156
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:26,573
- I'll never mention it again.
- We'll make a pact.

157
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,702
We take this to our grave.

158
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,331
Julie?

159
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:40,504
- Don't nod! You fucking say it!
- Yeah, ok.

160
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,384
- "We take this to our grave. "
- Let her go.

161
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:51,723
- You fucking say it!
- We take this to the grave.

162
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,777
It will be okay.

163
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,430
ONE YEAR LATER.

164
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:50,199
It's time to go.

165
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,998
Move your tired, ugly ass.
We're late.

166
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:01,084
I changed my mind.

167
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:06,298
Get your white-as-death corpse
in the car.

168
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:13,222
Come on!

169
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:18,310
You're going home for the summer
to get a tan on your pale tail.

170
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,689
Let's go.

171
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:50,843
Remember, sun and fun.

172
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:00,519
Julie? Welcome home, dear.

173
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,277
I missed you.

174
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,283
How's the snapper?

175
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:20,497
I really wanted monkfish,
but it's been a bad season.

176
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,713
- Are you on drugs?
- What?

177
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,133
I just wanted an honest reaction.

178
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:37,264
No, mom. No drugs.

179
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:43,228
Then, what is wrong?
You look like death.

180
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,065
I've had a rough year.

181
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,089
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT

182
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:18,764
You got some mail.
Your report card came last week.

183
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:22,935
I know it looks bad.
But the summer session went well.

184
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:29,107
- It's also your last chance.
- It's not that serious.

185
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,236
What happened to my daughter?

186
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:37,699
You went away
and you don't call or visit.

187
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:41,954
Your father must be turning over
in his grave.

188
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,806
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!

189
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:15,696
Who sent this? There's no postmark or return address.

190
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:20,367
- why? what does it say?
- Nothing.

191
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:53,752
Guys, easy ...
It's called glass. It breaks.

192
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,633
Good morning.

193
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:10,978
Well, look what the cat drug in.

194
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:17,067
Elsa. Hi. I need to talk to Helen.
Can you give me her New York number?

195
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:21,530
- Her New York number?
- Yeah, I need to talk to her.

196
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:28,412
Helen doesn't have a New York
number. Try Women's Fragrances.

197
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,669
Frightening, isn't it?

198
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:39,423
Julie.

199
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:45,721
- When did you get home?
- Yesterday.

200
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:51,268
- It's good to see you.
- What happened in New York?

201
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:55,856
I went for a while.
It didn't really work out.

202
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:04,781
Somebody sent this to me.

203
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:09,203
- Somebody knows.
- How?

204
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:14,333
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.

205
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,296
What if someody else
was there that night?

206
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:23,550
- Who? It's been a year.
- I don't know.

207
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,597
Has Barry seen this?

208
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,937
<i>- Do you ever see Barry at school?
- It's a big campus. He is</i> back?</i>

209
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:41,235
- I saw his car at the gym.
- Did you guys break up?

210
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,825
What are you two doing here?

211
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,665
Hi, Barry.

212
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:06,385
"I know what you did last summer. "
What  a crock of shit.

213
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:13,225
- We need help.
- I'll say, you two look like shit.

214
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,811
You're a prick.

215
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:21,859
- We can't just ignore it.
- How do you know it's related?

216
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:25,904
- You did a lot last summer.
- Only one murder comes to mind.

217
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,949
You shut the hell up!

218
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:37,374
- We didn't murder anyone.
- He was still alive.

219
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,878
He was in the middle of the road.

220
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:44,840
- His name was David Egan.
- Who?

221
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:51,430
David Egan. He was found three weeks after we ...

222
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:58,437
His body was caught in a shrimp net.
It was in the paper.

223
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:03,192
I think the police called it an accidental drowning.

224
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:07,696
But he died because of us,
That's certain.

225
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:17,122
What about Ray? Have you shown
the letter to him? What does he say?

226
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:22,336
We broke up last summer. Last
I heard, he was working up north.

227
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:32,262
Let's suppose someone was there.
Why send a letter one year later?

228
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,517
It's probably some crack
fucking around.

229
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,731
Max.

230
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,818
- Max, you think?
- Who else? He was there.

231
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:57,037
You two wait here.
I know what I'm doing.

232
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:09,007
Go figure. I was wondering
what happened to that Barry Cox.

233
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:16,306
Hei, Max. Can we talk a second,
in private?

234
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:20,519
This isn't private enough for you?

235
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,443
What?

236
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:32,698
We got your letter.

237
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:36,869
- Don't fuck with me. You saw us.
- What the fuck are you on?

238
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:43,083
I'll say this once. I'll kill you.
I have no problem with that.

239
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,503
- Get off of me!
- Understand?

240
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,396
Motherfucker.
Don't you test me.

241
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:07,649
I'll call the cops on your ass.

242
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:14,198
- Did he admit to the letter?
- He wont't bother you anymore.

243
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,619
I scared the shit out of him.

244
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,956
Well, it'll be damned.

245
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,257
So Ray's a fisherman.

246
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:37,763
Yeah, almost a year now.
I work on that one over there.

247
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,140
That's nice.

248
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:45,103
Have a nice life, guys.
I'm out of here.

249
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,776
Have you got a minute?

250
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:57,950
I've got to get back to work.
Call me, we can get together.

251
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,002
We need to talk.

252
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,216
- And you think Max sent it?
- Barry does.

253
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:21,723
He's probably just screwing around.
He doesn't have much else to do.

254
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:29,857
- So... how's school?
- So, you're a fisherman.

255
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:34,319
Prophecy fulfilled.
I've become my father.

256
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:39,950
- I didn't think you knew your dad.
- All I know is he worked the boats.

257
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:47,040
I know you hold me responsible
for what happened last summer.

258
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:54,590
No, I'm responsible for
my own actions. I don't blame you.

259
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,346
But I don't want to know you either.

260
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:07,723
Hello?

261
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,880
Hello?

262
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,934
I KNOW

263
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,723
My fucking jacket!

264
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,896
Hank, is anybody else there?

265
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:41,483
Just you and me.

266
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:49,032
You fucker!

267
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,085
Max, you're fucking dead.

268
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,420
Max, you're fucking dead.

269
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,102
Help me!

270
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:04,274
Help me! Somebody!

271
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:14,117
What do you want?

272
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:27,089
I'm sorry.
I swear. We didn't mean it.

273
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:33,929
One moment please, Officer.

274
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:46,900
- Julie ...
- What happened?

275
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:51,989
No. For the fortieth time.
I didn't see his face.

276
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:56,160
Somebody tried to kill you.
We have to go to the police.

277
00:42:56,326 --> 00:43:01,623
If he wanted me dead. He could
have done it. He's fucking with us.

278
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,960
- Who is?
- Some guy in a slicker.

279
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:08,589
That narrows it down.
This being a fishing village.

280
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:14,261
Since you bringing it up ...
You have a slicker.

281
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:21,268
- You're not gonna throw this on me.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.

282
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,692
Maybe we should come clean.

283
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:33,322
No. We made a pact,
and we're gonna keep it.

284
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,910
That's insane. Look at us.
The secret's killing us.

285
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,829
We're not going to the police.

286
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:45,834
We can put an end to it, and
salvage a small fraction of a life.

287
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:53,592
It was murder. Julie.
Your words. Remember? Murder.

288
00:43:55,385 --> 00:44:00,474
- We find this guy and fix him up.
- Like last night?

289
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:06,230
He's right. This guy won't go to the
police. We'll find him, talk to him.

290
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,235
How do we find him?

291
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:16,532
It has to be a friend or family
member of... What was his name?

292
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:25,874
- David Egan.
- Right. David Egan.

293
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:31,255
It could still be Max.

294
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:36,552
- Then find him. Prove Barry wrong.
- I just want for you and me ...

295
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:41,807
Listen to me. Get something.
There is no "you and me".

296
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:57,948
I can access the local library
and pull up all we need to know.

297
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,742
Egan ... David.

298
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:08,542
- All these articles are about him?
- Yeah. Or at least mention him.

299
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:13,964
Wait. July 5th, two years ago.
What's this?

300
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:20,512
"Susie Willis drowned, trapped in
a car near Dawson's Beach. "

301
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:24,933
- "The driver, Egan, was unharmed. "
- I remember that wreck.

302
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,688
Susie was enganged to David.

303
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:33,984
Her name was tattooed on his arm.
I saw it.

304
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:40,324
"Survived by his mother, Claire, and sister, Melissa, of Maribel County. "

305
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:44,578
They live in the sticks.
What do you think?

306
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,372
What have we got to lose?

307
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:55,964
Turn right...
Back there.

308
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:14,024
Do we just say, "We killed your son
and we were nearby, so... "

309
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,318
We play it by ear.

310
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:21,198
Angela Lansbury always had a plan.

311
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:34,711
What if they recognize us??
They could shoot us.

312
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:38,382
They could've done that already.

313
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,010
Jodie Foster tried this.
A serial killer opened the door.

314
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:59,736
Well, it was a good try.

315
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:14,376
Adding "breaking and entering"
to our crime?

316
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:18,463
Can I help you?

317
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:26,138
Hi. Our car stalled down the road.
Can we use your phone?

318
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:40,235
- The phone's over there
- Thanks.

319
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:45,365
Jodie.
Will you call Triple-A?

320
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:50,537
You got it ... AngeIa.

321
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:11,183
My name is Missy Egan.
Are you girls from Maribel?

322
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,937
- No, Southport.
- I went to Southport High.

323
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:20,275
- You looked familiar. What year?
- Class of '88.

324
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:26,949
Your name, "Egan", sounds familiar.
Did you have a brother?

325
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:30,494
I did, but he was younger than me.
David.

326
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:34,748
- What class was he?
- '92. But he died last July.

327
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:39,503
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

328
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,174
D0 you live alone?

329
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:47,886
Yeah, I do.

330
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:53,225
My daddy died a long time ago
and my mother's in a home.

331
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:57,688
She didn't take too well
to what happened to David.

332
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:02,401
Things haven't been the same
since he died.

333
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:09,283
They're on their way.

334
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:13,912
I could make you guys a cup of tea
while you are waiting.

335
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,125
- Thanks.
- That's nice of you.

336
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:38,395
I think I remember David David.
He had a friend, what was his name?

337
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:42,983
Didn't he hang out with this guy...?
What was his name?

338
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:48,030
I didn't know too many
of David's friend.

339
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:53,619
There was one guy ...

340
00:49:53,785 --> 00:50:01,835
He stopped by not too long after
David's death, to pay his respects.

341
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:07,841
He was a really nice guy.
He was cute and smart and...

342
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:14,890
We were sweet on each other for
a minute or so. But it didn't work.

343
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:20,020
He never said it. But I think
it hurt him to be around me.

344
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:27,194
- Where is this old friend now?
- Oh, I don't know.

345
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,739
- Do you remember his name?
- Billy.

346
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:35,160
- Did he have a last name?
- Blue. Billy Blue.

347
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:42,668
- We should wait back at the car.
- Don't be ridiculous. Stay.

348
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:47,506
- I don't want to miss Triple-A.
- We appreciate the phone.

349
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:51,927
Any time. I don't get
too many knocks on my door nowadays.

350
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:56,640
- Are you okay?
- I wigged out. I'm sorry.

351
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:03,522
Being in his house
and seeing his sister...

352
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:10,195
- God, do you see what we've done?
- It was an accident.

353
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:16,702
We killed a man. Then ruined
the lives of everyone he knew.

354
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:22,249
We're not that powerful.
You're giving us too much credit.

355
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:31,216
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Thank you.

356
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:39,474
- I see you got the car started.
- Yeah, it started right up.

357
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:43,228
Funny how that happens.

358
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:06,877
- So what now?
- Now we try and find Billy Blue.

359
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:15,886
Maybe he wanted to die.

360
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:19,723
- What?
- David Egan.

361
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:24,728
His girlfriend died on the same
road, July 4th, one year earlier.

362
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:29,983
Maybe he was sitting in the road,
waiting for us to hit him.

363
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,655
Yeah, if that will help you
sleep at night.

364
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:40,911
What happened between us?
We used to be best friends.

365
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,123
We used to be a lot of things.

366
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,294
I miss you.

367
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,504
Hei, dad.

368
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:51,351
Is the washed-up has-been
having a moment?

369
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:55,856
What do you want?

370
00:55:56,023 --> 00:56:00,360
We're doing inventory tomorrow.
I need you there by 10.

371
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:05,782
I can't. I'm in the parade tomorrow.

372
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:11,872
Dad put me in charge of the store,
and I want you there by 10.

373
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,460
The outgoing queen
has to ride in the parade.

374
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:20,339
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.

375
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:26,678
You and your hair ...
It's so pathetic.

376
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:32,267
- You can leave now.
- So very pathetic.

377
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,057
SOON

378
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:07,738
What?
Oh, my God...

379
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,357
Max...

380
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:52,467
- Are you sure he was dead?
- I saw him... with these crabs.

381
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:56,847
You do it.

382
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:13,489
He was there. And he was
wearing your jacket, Barry.

383
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:19,203
- Did the crabs carry him away?
- I believe you, Julie.

384
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:23,499
- He took the body.
- Why would he do that?

385
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:29,546
Why did he try to run you over,
and make coleslaw on Helen's head?

386
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:34,551
- Let's go back to the house.
- Where's your jacket, Barry?

387
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:41,892
Don't you see? He's got us.
We can't go to the police now.

388
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:47,105
He's watching us and waiting.
What are you waiting for?

389
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:51,985
What are you waiting for?

390
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:58,992
What are you doing here?

391
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:02,663
- I've been looking for you guys.
- You're gonna die.

392
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:07,709
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

393
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,797
- You're fucking lying!
- Leave him alone. Get a grip.

394
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:17,970
- Wake up, Julie. He's behind this.
- He's after me. Too.

395
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:23,016
I got a letter.

396
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:27,729
A letter? I got run over,
Helen gets her hair chopped off, -

397
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:33,777
- Julie gets a body in a trunk, and
you get a letter. That's balanced.

398
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:38,991
- You killed Max and took my jacket.
- Max is dead?

399
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:45,664
You always wanted to be our friend,
but were too jealous to handle it.

400
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:49,001
Fuck you.

401
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:53,672
We have to stick together.
Help each other.

402
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,808
So if it's not fisherboy here,
Who is it?

403
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:10,481
- We think his name is Billy Blue.
- How do you know that?

404
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:14,985
- David had a friend by that name.
- He's probably a school friend.

405
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:19,281
According to his sister,
that would make him class of '92.

406
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:23,827
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe
there's something in her yearbook.

407
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:28,290
It's hard to believe that's the guy.

408
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:31,126
His face isn't splattered
on the road.

409
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:40,177
- Maybe Blue's not his real name.
- He could have lied to Missy.

410
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:44,389
- If we bring the book to Missy...
- She could point him out.

411
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:48,227
I'm not going anywhere.

412
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,148
High school mugshots...

413
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:59,029
- I'll go. You've got that parade.
- Forget it.

414
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:02,908
- You have to, in case he shows up.
- I don't want him to!

415
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:07,204
This could be our chance.
We could catch him.

416
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:13,210
I'll go to Missy's. Barry, you go
with Helen. If he shows up ...

417
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:15,879
I'll pound his ass.

418
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:19,842
- You sound like vigilantes.
- It's July 4th, Ray.

419
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:24,888
Whatever he has planned is gonna
happen today, unless we stop him.

420
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:31,145
Don't you see? It's that moment
where we have to make a decision.

421
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:37,484
- Let's make the right one.
- I'll do what's smart, not right.

422
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:41,280
Then let's go.
Leave town. Dissappear.

423
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:45,075
<i>I have</i> disappeared.
Now I want my life back.</i>

424
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,833
We have to face this.
What's it gonna be, Ray?

425
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:03,904
Barry.

426
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:08,200
Over there!

427
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:38,438
Where the hell is he?

428
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:10,637
Missy?

429
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:14,827
Please.
Missy ...

430
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:20,791
Do you remember me
from the other day? The car trouble?

431
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,085
What are you doing here?

432
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:06,336
Please, we need to talk.

433
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:10,716
I need to find
your brother's friend. Billy Blue.

434
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:16,013
- Can you look through the yearbook?
- What's this all about?

435
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:22,436
It has to do with your brother
and last July 4th.

436
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:28,233
- What about it?
- What happened wasn't an accident.

437
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,529
- I know.
- You know what?

438
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:35,532
He killed himself.

439
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:41,497
He went up there to die
where Susie died.

440
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:46,126
The whole town blamed him
for her death.

441
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:51,924
- So he blamed himself.
- How do you know it was suicide?

442
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,676
He left a note.

443
01:08:55,886 --> 01:09:02,059
I hid it from the insurance company.
They don't pay if it's suicide.

444
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:11,109
That don't much matter anymore,
because the money's been spent.

445
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:13,403
I WILL NEVER FORGET
LAST SUMMER

446
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:19,409
This isn't a suicide note.
It's a death threat.

447
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,915
- What are you talking about?
- Your brother didn't kill himself.

448
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:29,962
I saw him. I was there. And
whoever sent this was there too.

449
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:34,508
- Where did you see him?
- We hit him. It was an accident.

450
01:09:35,217 --> 01:09:39,680
- My brother drowned.
- "Susie" was tattooed on his arm.

451
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:44,434
He doesn't have a tattoo.
You didn't see anything. Get out!

452
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:51,108
Get out of my house.

453
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:01,285
Oh, my God...

454
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:05,205
It wasn't your brother.

455
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:33,609
- I'll be up in the balcony.
- He had a big, huge hook.

456
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:41,283
Everything's going to be all right.
I won't let anything happen to you.

457
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:46,330
Nicely done, ladies.

458
01:10:46,497 --> 01:10:51,210
Now, let's meet last year's winner:
Miss Helen Shivers.

459
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:12,564
As we continue our pageant, we move into the talent competition.
Oh. Jesus.

460
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,826
Barry!

461
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,126
Somebody help him!

462
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:30,851
Excuse me.

463
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:35,898
- What's the problem?
- He's gonna kill him!

464
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:39,651
- Up in the balcony..
- Everybody stay calm.

465
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:43,280
Get off of me!

466
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,332
Stay behind me.

467
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:07,805
Nobody's up here. This is not
my idea of a funny joke.

468
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:12,726
The fisherman was here.
He killed Barry.

469
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:17,815
There's nobody up here.
Let's go back downstairs.

470
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,697
Watch your step.

471
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:30,869
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, false alarm. </i>
We'll resume in a few minutes. </i></i>

472
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:41,171
I'm gonna take you home.
Your parents are worried about you.

473
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:45,050
You have to believe me.

474
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:49,429
Let me take you home.

475
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:58,480
Excuse me.
We'll be needing this.

476
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,990
Come on.

477
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:12,703
So then he killed him
with a fish-hook.

478
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,748
Did he use the same hook
to cut your hair off?

479
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:21,587
No. He used a scissors. Asshole.

480
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:25,465
I know I sound delusional.
But it's true.

481
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:32,097
I heard the version with a mental
patient with a hook for a hand.

482
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:42,316
We'll have to take the valley.

483
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:58,207
Look.
You little shit-stick reject...

484
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:02,753
There's been a murder. And
you'll fry in hell if you ignore it.

485
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,925
I'll contact Barry's parents,
and we'll put out a search for him.

486
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:12,805
He was probably
just playing a prank on you.

487
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:21,855
Oh, Jesus. I'm just gonna see
if this fella needs help.

488
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:36,703
It's him...

489
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,790
What's the trouble?

490
01:15:39,957 --> 01:15:43,836
That's him! Behind you!

491
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:46,380
Behind you!

492
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:37,055
"Susie Willis killed.
Trapped in a car."

493
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:42,019
"Survived by her father Benjamin,
a local fisherman."

494
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:05,918
Elsa ...

495
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:11,006
Elsa!
Open the door!

496
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:19,223
Elsa, open the door!
Jesus Christ, hurry!

497
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:27,481
What are you doing? Elsa!

498
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:32,402
Jesus Christ, hurry!
Open the door!

499
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:37,199
I'm coming.

500
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:44,915
- The Broad Street entrance is open.
- I'm being attacked.

501
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:47,626
You're what?

502
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:53,674
Lock the other door.
I'll call the police. Do what I say!

503
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:47,811
Elsa ...

504
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:00,866
Elsa?

505
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,830
Elsa, where are you?

506
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:04,401
Ray.

507
01:23:08,447 --> 01:23:11,033
Ray!

508
01:23:15,078 --> 01:23:20,667
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't David Egan we killed.

509
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:23,003
It was Susie's father. Ben Willis.

510
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:28,592
- But they found David's body.
- I think Willis killed David.

511
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:35,557
- Then we killed Willis?
- But what if he didn't die?

512
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:40,187
This is crazy.

513
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:43,148
Come aboard.

514
01:23:43,315 --> 01:23:47,486
- We have to find Helen and Barry.
- We will.

515
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,418
You...

516
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,839
It's you.

517
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:10,551
Billy Blue.
You went to Missy's.

518
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:16,140
- You're the friend. The fisherman.
- I can explain. Julie, wait!

519
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:27,359
- Wait.
- Stop it!

520
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:35,701
- Please, help me.
- Easy, child.

521
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:39,580
I need to call the police.

522
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:43,542
On the boat! Hurry!

523
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:34,802
Are you in some kind of trouble?

524
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:40,098
Yes. I'm in a lot of trouble.

525
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:49,024
That's a shame.
Being it's the 4th of July and all.

526
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:54,696
Kids like you should be out
having fun. Drinking, partying, -

527
01:25:54,863 --> 01:26:00,202
- running people over, getting away
with murder, things like that.

528
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:05,749
You ...

529
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:11,296
- Ben Willis.
- Good. You did your homework, too.

530
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,440
Welcome aboard, Ray.

531
01:29:51,975 --> 01:29:56,104
Open the door, Julie.
You've got no place to hide.

532
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:11,782
Come on, Julie.

533
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:29,341
- Happy 4th of July, Julie.
- Please, it was accident.

534
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:34,471
When you leave a man for dead,
make sure he's really dead.

535
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:31,028
We never killed anyone.
This whole year was for...

536
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:36,408
The guilt was killing me.
I had to know who he was.

537
01:33:36,575 --> 01:33:39,286
That's why I went to see Missy.

538
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:44,833
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but i wanted you back.

539
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,296
I couldn't lose you again.

540
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:55,385
I love you, Julie.
No one gets me the way you do.

541
01:33:56,428 --> 01:34:00,265
I understand your pain.

542
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:12,861
Do you have any idea
why this man would want you dead?

543
01:34:13,654 --> 01:34:15,989
None.

544
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:19,368
Here it comes.

545
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:35,384
Well, don't worry.

546
01:34:35,551 --> 01:34:40,848
The body will turn up.
They usually do.

547
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:51,150
ONE YEAR LATER.

548
01:34:51,316 --> 01:34:55,779
I made the dean's list.
 Thank you very much.

549
01:34:55,946 --> 01:35:00,784
I miss you too, but I'll see you in
a couple of weeks. I love New York.

550
01:35:01,702 --> 01:35:06,623
Of course I love you more.
You know that.

551
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:09,543
But I've got to take a shower.

552
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:13,797
- Julie, you got some mail.
- Thanks Deb.

553
01:35:16,675 --> 01:35:19,052
A towel.

554
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:25,267
Don't start with me
You can ravage me in 2 weeks.

555
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:29,146
I love you too. Bye.

556
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:01,011
POOL PARTY THIS SATURDAY AT NOON
