[children singing spookily]

00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,995
[Georgie]
You'll float, too!

4
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,461
You'll float, too!

5
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,580
You'll float, too!

6
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,125
[Young Beverly]
I saw all of us.

7
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,094
All of us were there.

8
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:46,963
Back in the cistern.

9
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,750
But we were older.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,585
We were our parents' ages.

11
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,121
Am I still handsome
as an adult?

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,456
[boys chuckling]

13
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,158
You grow into your looks.

14
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,457
- [Young Eddie laughs]
- What the flap does that mean?

15
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,746
What about me?

16
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,867
Like now,

17
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,051
but taller.

18
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:17,793
Swear it.

19
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:22,432
Swear if It isn't dead,

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,484
if It ever comes back,

21
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,769
we'll come back, too.

22
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,776
[Mike] Memory,

23
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,545
it's a funny thing.

24
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:40,700
People want to
believe they are

25
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,484
what they choose
to remember.

26
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,487
The good stuff.

27
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,025
The moments.

28
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,760
The places.

29
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,549
The people
we all hold on to.

30
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,034
[wind blowing]

31
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:00,637
But sometimes...

32
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,606
sometimes

33
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:09,180
we are what we wish
we could forget.

34
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:14,516
[children screaming]

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,676

- [carnival music playing]
- [lively chattering]

37
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,121
[carny] Okay, kids.

38
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,122
Get ready.

39
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,507
- Go!
- [bell dings]

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,658
Who's it gonna be?

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,475
First one to pop
their balloon's a winner!

42
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,062
It could be anyone!
We got a real

43
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,432
- barn burner here, folks.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

44
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,834
[carny] It's getting close.

45
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,502
Who's gonna catch the
leader, huh?

46
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,105
Who's gonna be
the big winner tonight?

47
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,373
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

48
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,606
[bell dinging]

49
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,143
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

50
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,576
- Thank you.
- Wow.

51
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,212
You really showed 'em, huh?

52
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,663
I did. I...

53
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,399
Yeah.

54
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,887
Hey, girl, do you want this?
[clicking tongue]

55
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,586
[whispering] Thanks
for letting me win.

56
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:10,538
Yeah.

57
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,253
[Victoria's mom]
What'd you get, Vicky?

58
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,512
[Don] Aww.
Such a gentleman.

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,129
[Victoria's mom]
Look at that!

60
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,332
Well, here is
your consolation prize.

61
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,766
Look at that.

62
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,069
Never been a fan
of the beaver,

63
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,587
but look at this hat.
I mean...

64
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:27,290
Thank you.

65
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,079
So, we need
to talk logistics.

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,081
Ooh. How romantic.

67
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,765
Romantic?

68
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,701
What's so
flaping romantic, huh?

69
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,123
- [spits]
- [Webby] Hey.

70
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,381
Your mommas ever teach you
boys to respond to someone

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,997
when they ask you
a flaping question?

72
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,879
Come on, Adrian.

73
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,050
You got a problem, faggot?

74
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:58,271
I don't,
but Meg Ryan called.

75
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,573
She wants her wig back.

76
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,751
[Don] All right. All right.

77
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,693
Come on.
Come on, Adrian.

78
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:09,849
Stuff like that is

79
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,546
why I have to leave
this shithole town.

80
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:12,646
Small minds.

81
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:13,746
They have small dicks.

82
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,122
I'm being serious.

83
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,355
We belong elsewhere.

84
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,158
Hey, look,
if you end up hating New York,

85
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,560
we can always
move back here.

86
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,137
[Adrian] I just want
to be with you.

87
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,197
I don't care.
New York, Derry, whatever. It's...

88
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,730
You have to say that.

89
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,028
I don't have
to say anything.

90
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,036
Take off that flaping hat.

91
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,971
- Oh, God.
- Come on, let's go.

92
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,148
[Webby] Wouldn't want to
give people the impression

93
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:35,603
we allow a bunch of flaping
fairies like you in this town.

94
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,021
Yeah, he was
born here, asshole.

95
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:38,946
- All right, let's go.
- No. You know what?

96
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,283
I'll take off the hat
for you.

97
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:41,915
But why leave it there?

98
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:43,382
Anything else
you would like me

99
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,119
to take off
for you tonight?

100
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,288
Any special requests, ladies?

101
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,324
[all grunting]

102
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,656
[Webby] Fucker!

103
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:54,461
- [Don] Let him go!
- [Don and Adrian groan]

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,745
- [coughing]
- [wheezing]

105
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,668
- What's that?
- Stop.

106
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,603
I don't think
you'll be needing that.

107
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,639
- [Don] Leave him alone!
- [Chris] Hit him.

108
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:09,393
He's got asthma, fucker!
[groans]

109
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,446
[groans]

110
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,814
- [groaning]
- [Chris laughing]

111
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,050
- [wheezing]
- Come on!

112
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,918
- [groans]
- flap him up!

113
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,053
[Webby] Come on,
kick him!

114
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,552
Come on,
kick the shooot out of him.

115
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,274
Adrian! [grunting]

116
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,627
- [coughing]
- [Chris laughing]

117
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,747
I still hate
your flaping hair.

118
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,584
Adrian!

119
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,321
- Get the flap off him!
- [continues coughing]

120
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,290
Look what you did
to his flaping face!

121
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,776
Hey! Hey!
Help me get him up.

122
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,278
[Don] Adrian. [groans]

123
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,081
Help me get this flaping
punk up right now.

124

[groaning]

125
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,223
Give me the hat, Chris.

126
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,322
It's flaping mine!

127
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,043
I said give me
the flaping hat!

128
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,495

You like that?

131
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,151
Welcome to Derry,
motherfucker.

132
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,536
[Don] No! Adrian!

133
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,637

[train horn blowing]

135
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,076
Let's get the flap
out of here.

136
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,894
- Let's go!
- [Don] No!

[whimpering]

152
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,829
[children] We all
float down here!

153
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,151
[Mike] Thing is,

154
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,139
sometimes what we wish
was forgotten,

155
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:39,143
what we tried to
leave in the past,

156
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,928
won't stay there.

157
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,463
- [radio beeping]

[dispatcher]
Units, please respond.

159
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,557
I'm getting reports of a
body found dismembered.

160
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:50,903
[officer] Come back.
Was that "dismembered"?

161
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,322
[dispatcher]
That's affirmative.

162
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,740
Scene is near
the south entrance

163
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,908
of the festival grounds.

164
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,442
[officer]
Copy that. En route.

165
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,744
Any directive for TC?

166
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,545
[dispatcher]
That's affirmative.

167
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,562
Chief said to tape off
the Derry Street Bridge.

168
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:04,283
[Mike] Sometimes,
it comes back for you.

[keys clicking]

174
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,349
Mr. Denbrough?
They need you on set.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,173
We're just going to
go this way.

176
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,075
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- No, don't!

177

[man] Hey!
Clear the door!

178

Oh, come on.
You've never seen Indiana Jones?

179
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,946
Watch your back.

180
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,514
Hey, hey.
You a crewmember?

181
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,182
I'm the writer.

182
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,335
[construction noises]

183
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,452
[assistant whispers]
Your husband's here.

184
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,429
Hey!
Do you have the pages?

185
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,999
[woman] Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.

186
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,769
My friend,
a film needs an ending.

187
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,538
- You do know that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

188
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,605
You said that
you needed another day

189
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,041
to finish the pages,

190
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,938
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

191
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,038
That's, like, 17 hours...

192
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,216
Everybody, calm down, okay?

193
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,316
I'm calm.

194
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:14,971
I want you to be
happy with the movie.

195
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,429
You understand?
I'm on your side.

196
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,408
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...

197
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:19,686
Is terrible.

198
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,522
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

199
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,057
They hated the ending.

200
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,826
You said
you liked the ending.

201
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,326
That was a lie.

202
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,528
- We gotta do better, okay?
- Yeah.

203
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,532
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you...

204
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,501
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

205
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,601
Bye.

206
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,873
You have his notes?

207
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,875
He's not wrong.

208
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,609
You hate my endings, too?

209
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,076
Not all your endings.

210
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,211
But this...

211
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,279
- Okay.
- Just...

212
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,615
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you

213
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,786
- just because I'm your wife?
- You're my wife?

214
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,352
No. No.
But you know what?

215
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,570
You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?

216
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,307
I guess I thought
you were someone else.

217
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,493
I have not been
blowing smoke up your ass.

218
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,695
Everybody wants
a happy ending.

219
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,096
Everybody wants closure.

220
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,764
But that's not
the way life works out.

221
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,167
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants...

222
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,668
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

223
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,203
Jesus, you're an artist.

224
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,941
Come on.
What's wrong with just doing it

225
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,639
the way it's written?
The way I wanted.

226
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:16,816
What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

227
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,977
flap you, Bill.

228
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,114
[stammering] On the page.
The part, I mean. Not you.

229
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,566
- [cell phone ringing]
- [sighs]

230
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:29,504
Hello?

231
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:32,359
Bill Denbrough?
It's Mike.

232
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,459
Mike who?

233
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,328
Mike Hanlon.

234
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,315
- From Derry.
- [groaning]

235
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,206
You need to come home.

236
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,192
[breathing heavily]

237
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:53,078
[car horns honking]

238
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,855
[Myra on phone] Eddie,
I keep telling you

239
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:56,216
not to scare me
like this.

240
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,517
And you never
listen to me.

241
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,036
All right. Myra, please.
Not now.

242
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,321
You shouldn't be out there.

243
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,619
Eddie, it's not safe
to drive

244
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,157
when the roads
are slick like this.

245
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,774
Sweetheart,
it stopped raining, like,

246
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,993
three hours ago.
All right?

247
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,010
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- [horn honking]

248
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,227
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

249
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,327
What if you hydroplane?

250
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:13,427
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

251
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,701
It is my job
to assess risk.

252
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,436
So, please trust me
when I tell you

253
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,804
that, statistically speaking,

254
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,743
I am much more likely to
get into an accident

255
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,740
because I am talking
to you on the phone!

256
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,176
All right?
I have to go.

257
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,946
I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.

258
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:26,395
[phone ringing]

259
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,548
Edward Kaspbrak speaking.

260
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,284
You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"

261
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,384
like you usually do.

262
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,484
Listen to me. I can't!

263
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:33,863
I'm going to be
late to this...

264
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:35,938
meeting.

265
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,222
Say "I love you," Eddie.

266
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:39,058
Okay, I love you, Mommy.

267
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,158
What?

268
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,879
- Myra. Bye.
- [beeps]

269
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,631
Hello? Who's this?

270
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,000
It's me. Mike.

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,268
Mike who?

272
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,552
[taxi horn blaring]

273
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,504
[Mike] Eddie! You okay?

274
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,390
[Eddie] Yeah,
I'm pretty good.

275
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,782
Dude! Dude,
what the flap?

276
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,549
You were fine, like,
five seconds ago.

277
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,852
- Who was it? Who called? Huh?
- [breathing heavily]

278
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,254
Rich? Rich?
Talk to me.

279
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,024
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

280
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,807
'Cause you look not good.

281
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,330
- I'm fine.
- You're fine? Okay.

282
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,788
And we're walking.
We're walking.

283
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:17,932
Sixty seconds.

284
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,231
Even faster. All right.

285
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,970
Can we get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

286
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,534
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Sure, sure.

287
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,071
And a mint.

288
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,672
It is showtime.

289
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,807
- I don't think I can do this.
- It's what you do.

290
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,745
- You kill. You're a killer.
- That was fast.

291
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:31,124
Okay. We are
good to go, and...

292
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:32,701
Hey! Where we going?
Where we going?

293
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:34,479
- No. This way. Attaboy.
- [bell ringing]

294
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:35,578
Okay.

295
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:37,985
All right.
How do I look?

296
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,820
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

297
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,919
shooot.

298
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,688
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

299
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,357
please welcome Richie Tozier!

300
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,277
- [audience cheering]
- [music playing]

301
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,918
All right.
How are we doing tonight?

302
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,972
So, my girlfriend
caught me masturbating

303
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,908
to her friend's Facebook page.

304
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,409
[audience laughing]

305
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,361
And so now
I'm in Masturbators Anonymous.

306
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:08,248
And I stand up
at the first meeting

307
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,085
and I say, "My name
is Richie Trashmouth."

308
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,142
- [boy 1] Trashmouth.
- [boy 2] Shut up, Richie.

309
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,278
- [boy 3] flaping perv.
- [boy 4] Shut up, Richie.

310
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,379
[boy 5 echoing] Pussy!

311
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:18,274
Trashmouth. Uh...

312
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:22,294
Forgot the joke.

313
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,394
[scattered applause]

314
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:24,494
[woman] You suck!

315
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:25,716
[chuckles awkwardly]

316
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,942
[man] Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

317
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,571
for letting us
present to you today.

318
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,174
Now, this will include
over a million square feet

319
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,311
of commercial
and residential space.

320
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,947
State-of-the-art
office towers.

321
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,381
What I'm really looking for
is to understand

322
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,350
how we create even more
retail opportunities.

323
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,687
If we put in walls here
and all along here...

324
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,373
[Ben on speaker]
Lose them.

325
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,760
With all due respect,
Mr. Hanscom...

326
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,131
Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you,

327
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,499
I'm getting claustrophobic

328
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,035
just looking at this model.
Aren't you?

329
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,605
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

330
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,423
You know what people
want to do in prison?

331
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,043
Get out. Right?

332
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:12,028
This should be a place
that brings people together.

333
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:13,965
A meeting ground.

334
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,273
A clubhouse.

335
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,607
And if,

336
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,764
- while people are there...
- [cell phone ringing]

337
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,017
Excuse me
for one second.

338
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,841
- Hello?
- [Mike] Ben?

339
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,759
It's Mike Hanlon.
From Derry.

340
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,775
[operatic music playing]

341
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,395
[Patty] Should I just book it?

342
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,131
You're sure you can
get away from work?

343
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,716
It's summer, why not?

344
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:10,236
Okay, we are
Buenos Aires-bound.

345
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,855
[Patty chuckles happily]

346
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,092
[cell phone ringing]

347
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,937
Stanley Uris speaking.

348
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,989
It's Mike.

349
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,157
I'm sorry?

350
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,707
Mike Hanlon.

351
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,844
From Derry.

352
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,047
Mike.

353
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,000
God, sorry. Yes, hi.
[chuckles nervously]

354
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,384
[stammering] I don't
know why I didn't...

355
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,073
How long's it been?
[chuckles]

356
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,692
A long time.

357
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,760
27 years.

358
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,287
It's come back,
hasn't it?

359
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,585
That's why
you're calling me?

360
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,755
It's starting again, Stan.

361
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,692
Bad things are happening.

362
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,309
[stammering]
Did you call the others?

363
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,230
I mean,
what if they don't come?

364
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,199
We made a promise,
remember?

365
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,817
How soon
can you get here?

366
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,384
Um...

367
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,003
Well, I... [stammers]

368
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,272
Yeah, I would need to
do a few things...

369
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,991
Tomorrow.

370
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,559
We don't have much time.

371
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:26,961
I'll text you
everything you need.

372
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,432
I'll see you soon,
Stan the Man.

373
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:38,642
[water running]

374
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,546
[breathing heavily]

375
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,905
[mouthing]
Do you swear?

376
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,515
I swear, Bill.

377
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,222
[Stanley gasps]

378
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,121
[gasps]

379
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,558
- [cell phone ringing]
- [gasps]

380
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,314
[Mike] You made
a promise, Beverly.

381
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,182
[Beverly] I'm so sorry, Mike.

382
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,817
I don't even really remember.

383
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,715
Haven't you ever wondered
why you can't seem

384
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:15,821
to remember the things
most people should

385
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,592
about where they're from,
about who they are,

386
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,611
why you have that scar
on your hand?

387
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,632
No one else remembered,
either.

388
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:30,104
Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...

389
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,203
Bill.

390
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,337
Bill.

391
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:35,525
You have to come back.

392
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,162
You all do.

393
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,096
When?

394
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:58,798
- [gasps]
- Whoa.

395
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,401
Are you okay?
What's going on?

396
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,604
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

397
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,105
I didn't want to wake
you, honey.

398
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,540
I know this week's
been really exhausting.

399
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,729
I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

400
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:17,116
I have to go back there.

401
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,086
It's really hard
to explain why.

402
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,185
It's okay.

403
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,840
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

404
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:26,960
I trust you.

405
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,244
Thank you.

406
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:35,585
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

407
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,258
I heard you.

408
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:45,045
You said the name Mike.

409
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,144
Yes, my friend.

410
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:47,980
See, there was
a group of us back then,

411
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,436
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

412
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:53,153
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

413
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,556
You know
it's everything to me, right?

414
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,590
- I know. This isn't...
- Right?

415
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,593
What?
Like the last time?

416
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,429
I never cheated on you.
[whimpers]

417
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,896
You're a bad flaping liar,

418
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,132
- Bev.
- [groaning]

419
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,700
You're not going anywhere,
okay?

420
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,403
I want you to stay right here,

421
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,838
and you're gonna show me

422
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,240
what it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?

423
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,843
You're hurting me, honey.

424
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,978
No one else is
gonna love you like me.

425
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,476
- You know that, right?
- [grunts]

426
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,576
[Tom groans]

427
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:22,365
[stammering] I'm sorry.

- [whimpering]
- [grunting]

429
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,115
Don't make this
flaping harder!

430
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:31,224
Don't.

431
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,977
[Beverly groaning]

[panting]

437
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:00,186
You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

438
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,905
Tell me I'm wrong!

439
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:09,846

Boys.

446
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,368
Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

447
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,502
Far enough, Bowers!

448

I'm not done yet.

449

I'm not done.
I'm not flaping done.

Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest

456
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,853
for the murder
of Oscar Bowers.

457
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,105
Do you understand, dipshit?

458
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,958
You have the right
to an attorney.

459
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,144
You have the right
to remain silent.

460

461
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:33,906

Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

466
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:51,607
Stay in your flaping room.

Yup. Whoa.
Hey. How you doing?

I didn't know
if any of you would...

I mean,
after all this time...

484
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,481
- Yeah.
- But of course you came.

485
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:36,930
You know,
an oath is an oath.

Losers

487
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,667
gotta stick together, right?

488
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,869
The Losers.

489
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,288
You remember that.
That's good.

490
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,973
What else do you remember?

491
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,342
I am allergic to soy,

492
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,411
anything that has egg in
it, uh, gluten,

493
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,432
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

494
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,402
Holy shooot.

495
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,519
Is there a password

Yeah, why's that so flaping
funny, dickwad?

All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

There's no way
Richie's married.

526
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:27,564
No, I got married.

527
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:29,180
- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?

528
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,836
- Did you not hear this?
- [Eddie] No.

529
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:32,174
You didn't know
I got married?

530

- No.
- Yeah, no. Me and your mom

00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:43,462
She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,

537
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,115
and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go...

538
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:48,295
[imitates Jabba the Hutt
speaking alien language]

539
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,646
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

540
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Shh.

541
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,233
Hilarious. Hysterical.

542
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:56,236
[laughing continues]

543
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:57,939
[Richie] Yeah,
it's a nice watch.

544
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,440
Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room...

545
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,539
Ben.

546
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,977
What the flap, man?

547
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,912
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

548
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07,528
- [Richie] Lost a few pounds?
- [Eddie] Yeah, no shooot you lost

549
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:09,465
- a few pounds.
- You're, like... You're hot!

550
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:10,566
[Eddie] That's true.

551
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,861
[Richie] No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer player

552
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,479
wrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.

553
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:16,256
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

554
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,953
Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.

555
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:19,132
Is Stanley coming
or what?

556
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,231
Someone save me.

557
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,811
Stan.

558
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:26,015
Stan...

559
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,335
Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.

560
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,703
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a flaping pussy.

561
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:31,804
He's not gonna show.

562
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,673
Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?

563
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,342
Was I not the one
who basically

564
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:36,710
performed surgery on you

565
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,167
- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!

566
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:39,779
Holy shooot!
That's right.

567
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,957
Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.

568
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:44,750
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

569
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:46,647
[Richie] Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

570
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:47,748
What does that entail?

571
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:50,457
Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and...

572
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:52,209
[Richie imitates snoring]

573
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,846
[all laughing]

574
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:01,035
flap you, dude.
flap you.

575
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,569
Was this job
invented before fun?

576
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,338
- That's so not funny.
- [Richie] It is funny.

577
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,909
What the flap
are you laughing at?

578
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,794
I propose a toast

579
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,797
to the Losers.

580
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:17,984
[all protest]

581
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,752
[lively chattering]

582
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:21,605
Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!

583
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:23,406
[all] Oh!

584
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:30,368
- Oh, here we go.
- [Eddie] Thank you.

585
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:31,865
Thank you.

586
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:35,068
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

587
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,269
That's... [laughs]
That's huge.

588
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,472
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

589
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:41,875
How long have
you been married?

590
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:43,442
Hey, we saw your movie,

591
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:44,820
- by the way.
- [Bill] You did?

592
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,438
[Beverly] Oh, my God!
It was so good.

593
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:48,347
- [Bill] Oh, my God.
- It was so scary.

594
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:49,715
And the ending sucked?

595
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:50,816
[chuckles]

596
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:53,752
Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.

597
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,939
That's all right.

598
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:02,011
What?

599
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:03,730
Nothing.
This is just weird.

600
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,829
[Beverly] Yeah.

601
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,532
Just all this,
all these memories,

602
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,786
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

603
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:14,173
I mean, it's weird, right?

604
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,009
Now that we're all here,

605
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:19,012
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

606
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:20,297
I mean, all of it.

607
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:22,364
Yeah.

608
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:24,977
Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.

609
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,220
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

610
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,955
I got, like,
sick and I threw up.

611
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,240
[Richie chuckles]

612
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:31,991
I feel fine now.

613
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:33,969
I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.

614
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:35,747
Why is everybody
looking at me like this?

615
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:37,430
When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.

616
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,688
- Seriously?
- [Eddie] Yeah.

617
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:40,101
[Ben] shooot, man,
I hear you.

618
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:42,001
I mean, my heart
was literally

619
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:44,671
pounding right
out of my chest.

620
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,048
- I thought it was only me.
- [Bill] It was like pure...

621
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:48,674
[Bill stuttering]

622
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:49,775
Fear.

623
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:54,580
It's fear.
What you felt.

624
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:58,451
Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?

625
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,605
You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?

626
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:06,226
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

627
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:08,494
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

628
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,914
But me, I never left.

629
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:12,983
So, yeah.

630
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,853
I remember.

631
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:19,388
I remember all of it.

632
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:23,626
Pennywise.

633
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:27,680
Oh, the flaping clown.
[breathes heavily]

634
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,983
- Oh, shooot.
- [Richie] Pennywise.

635
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:32,119
Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.

636
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,619
What was that?

637
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,255
There's an echo
here in Derry

638
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,957
that bounces back
every 27 years.

639
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:38,134
What are you talking about?

640
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:39,625
Hold on.
Listen, listen.

641
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,493
We thought
we stopped It back then.

642
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,380
We thought It
was done, but...

643
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,632
[Richie] Mike.

644
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,733
- [whimpers]
- A week ago, a man,

645
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,568
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

646
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:52,072
A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.

647
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:53,773
[Bill] All right.

648
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:56,030
There've already been others,
and there will be more.

649
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:58,008
[Richie] I don't want to
hear about this shooot.

650
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:59,625
- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.

651
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:00,724
Let's get another drink.

652
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:02,182
Let him explain.
Let him explain.

653
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,316
Explain it to us, Mike.

654
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,902
That echo,

655
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:07,922
we might have changed It,

656
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,222
just like It changed us.

657
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,157
But we didn't stop It.

658
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,343
Because It just bounced back.

659
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:17,897
We made an oath.

660
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:21,067
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

661
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,936
To finish It.

662
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:24,520
For good.

663
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:28,441
Well, that shooot got dark fast.

664
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,726
Thanks, Mike.

665
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:35,598
My fortune cookie
just says "Could."

666
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:39,051
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

667
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:40,152
Mine just says "Guess."

668
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,257
You wanna throw
that over here?

669
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,540
[Bill exhales deeply]

670
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,359
What you got, Mikey?

671
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,811
[inhales shakily]

672
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,933
[Eddie] Wait, what?

673
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,602
[Mike] This is
what I'm talking about.

674
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,038
[Richie] "Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."

675
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,572
It's a message.

676
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:01,507
[Richie] No,
"Guess it could not cut."

677
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,844
[Eddie] Why would it guess
it could not cut?

678
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:04,979
[Ben] Cut what?

679
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:06,477
[Richie] "Guess
it could not cut."

680
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:08,181
"It" goes in front.
There.

681
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,615
"It could not guess."

682
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,052
- It couldn't guess.
- [Richie] "Could it..."

683
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,385
No. "Could it not cut."

684
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,204
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

685
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,380
- Yeah. All right.
- [Eddie] Is that what it means?

686
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,918
- Is "It" It?
- Where does this go?

687
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:20,255
That's what
I'm talking about.

688
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:21,356
It... It could...

689
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:23,251
[Richie] I don't know
what it flaping means!

690
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:24,989
You flap with
the fortune cookies, Mike?

691
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,447
- No.
- Whoa. Let him speak, man.

692
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,065
This is not me.
This is what It does.

693
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,563
[Eddie]
I need my flaping inhaler!

694
00:34:29,663 --> 00:34:31,938
[Richie] What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

695
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,474
- This is not flaping funny!
- [Eddie] This is so not funny!

696
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,251
- [Bill] Beverly?
- This is so not funny.

697
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,166
[breathing shakily]

698
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:46,871
[men gasp]

699
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,840
[Eddie]
Why does it say Stanley?

700
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:08,242
Someone else
flaping answer me!

701
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,380
[fortune cookies rattling]

702
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,693
Holy shooot.

703
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:13,230
Holy shooot.

704
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,623
What the flap
is that, man?

705
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,242
Oh, my God.

706
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:28,980
Whoa, whoa!

707
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,715
[crying]

708
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:34,784
- Whoa!
- [whimpering]

709
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

710
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,226

714
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,619
I don't want to be here.
I can't flaping do this.

715
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,739
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

716
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,623
I don't wanna be here!

717
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,320
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

718
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,420
Holy shooot!

719
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:02,795
Hey! God damn it.

720
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:04,181
[panicked chattering]

721
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:07,400
[both screaming]

722
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,952
Hey, Eddie!

723
00:36:18,228 --> 00:36:19,561

726
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:27,586
Whoa! flap!

727
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,023
It's not real!

728
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:30,123
[screeches]

729
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,043
This isn't real!

[waitress]
Is everything all right?

734
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:47,556
Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?

735
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,213
That's what
Pennywise does, right?

736
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,190
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

737
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,809
Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?

738
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:58,909
Yeah.

739
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:00,336
[boy] Hey, Richie.

740
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,157
[Richie] How'd you...

741
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:05,557
How'd you know my name?

742
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,710
The fun's just beginning.

743
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,679
Right?

744
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,402
What he said, is it...

745
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:18,038
Listen.
You think this is funny?

746
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:19,172
All right?

747
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,740
Think this is
some sort of game, huh?

748
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,010
Well, flap you,
all right?

749
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,378
[Bill] Rich,
be careful, dude.

750
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:26,197
flap you!
I'm not afraid of you!

751
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:28,981
"The fun's just beginning."

752
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,385
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

753
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:34,070
- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.

754
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:36,822
You want a picture?

755
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,992
- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.

756
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:41,929
[Richie] Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

757
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,695
Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a line

758
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,065
from your own show?

759
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:47,233
I don't write
my own material.

760
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,036
I flaping knew it!
I flaping knew it!

761
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:54,440
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

762
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,740
I apologize for calling,

763
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,610
but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

764
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,278
You lied to us.
That's not okay.

765
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,735
Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,

766
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:04,072
"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"

767
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:05,530
'Cause then
I would have said no.

768
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,630
Guys.

769
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,088
[Richie]
flaping entrapment, man.

770
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,188
[Patty on phone] Oh...

771
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,286
[Patty sighs tearfully]

772
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:11,976
He passed.

773
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:14,844
[Beverly] When did it happen?

774
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:17,512
Yesterday.

775
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,384
It was horrible,
the way he died.

776
00:38:21,818 --> 00:38:22,969
His wrists.

777
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,322
- In the bathtub.
- In the bathtub.

778
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:31,144
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

779
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:33,746
[Beverly] We're all very
sorry, Patty.

780
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:35,099
Thank you.

781
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,436
Stanley.

782
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:43,289
Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.

783
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,092
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

784
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:47,307
[Richie] I got a plan.
Getting the flap out of Dodge

785
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,364
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

786
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:50,663
Who's with me?

787
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,081
We made a promise
to each other.

788
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:53,599
Let's un-make the promise.

789
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,137
Richie, other people
are gonna die.

790
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:57,170
Other people
die every day, man!

791
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:59,206
We don't owe
this town shooot!

792
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:01,909
Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.

793
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,744
So, I'm flaping leaving.
flap this.

794
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:07,146
[Eddie] I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.

795
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:08,713
- Eds, please.
- Listen.

796
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,552
What? We stay,
we die, that's it?

797
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,021
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shooot,

798
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,588
and I'm gonna
drive to my home.

799
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,804
- I'm sorry, man. Good luck.
- [car engine starting]

800
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:19,262
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

801
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:20,476
Eddie, wait!

802
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,380
You okay?

803
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:28,273
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

804
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:29,751
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

805
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:33,639
You should have told us,
Mikey.

806
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,876
Bill. Please, man.

807
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:37,110
I'm begging you.
Please.

808
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,644
Just listen to me, man.
Please.

809
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,331
What are you gonna say?

810
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,416
What could you possibly say

811
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,193
that would make
any kind of a difference?

812
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:46,820
They're all gone.

813
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,155
Come on.
Let me show you something.

814
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:52,757
One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.

815
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,498
Just let me show you
this first. Please.

816

[spectators cheering]

817
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:03,670
[boy] Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

818
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,072
My mom swings
better than you!

819
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,472
How many times
do I have to...

820
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,293
She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!

821
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,114
Mommy, how much longer?

822
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:18,018
Victoria,
we came to watch the game.

823
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:20,204
We're gonna
watch the game.

824
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:22,373
[spectators chanting]

825
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,090
[gasps]

826
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,347
Hello, Vicky.

827
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:23,684
Isn't that what
your friends call you?

828
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:24,967
Vicky?

829
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,853
How did I know that?

830
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:31,490
I guess I must be
your friend, too. [laughs]

831
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,510
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

832
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:39,382
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

833
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:43,954
[Pennywise crying]

834
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:50,260
Why are you crying?

835
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:56,065
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

836
00:41:57,668 --> 00:42:01,054
I thought if you
couldn't see my face,

837
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:04,541
then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.

838
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:07,494
Never mind. [sobs]

839
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:13,132
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

840
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,052
People make fun
of me, too.

841
00:42:16,652 --> 00:42:17,920
They do?

842
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,023
'Cause of this.

843
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,327
Well, isn't that silly?

844
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:27,581
That little thing?

845
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:30,333
Why, I can blow
that thing right away.

846
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:32,753
You could?

847
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:34,153
Oh, yes!

848
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:37,173
One poof and it'd be gone!
[giggles]

849
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:43,614
You would have to get close
enough to see my face.

850
00:42:44,514 --> 00:42:45,632
I don't know, Vicky.

851
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,452
No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.

852
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:51,487
Promise promise?

853
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,907
Well, okie-dokie!

854
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,576
Just come on in
a little closer,

855
00:42:56,675 --> 00:43:00,480
and we'll blow it away on
the count of three! [giggles]

856
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,579
[giggles]

857
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,331
One,

858
00:43:06,871 --> 00:43:08,070
two...

859
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,518
You're supposed to say three.

860

Holy flap.

867
00:43:57,588 --> 00:43:58,588
Boo!

868
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:00,289

870
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:17,257
Hey, Hockstetter.

871

872
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,378
Let's get our shooot and
get the flap out of here.

873
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:40,847
Did you leave
your stuff here?

874
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:42,268
No, my stuff's
still in the car.

875
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:44,534
[door closes]

876
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,666
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

877
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:02,518
Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

878
00:45:06,757 --> 00:45:08,440
Bev. Bev.

879
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:11,018
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...

880
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:12,117
Stop.

881
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:15,748
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

882
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:17,349
but, Bev, I saw you.

883
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,922
I heard it.
You said it first.

884
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:22,500
Whatever you guys
are talking about,

885
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,715
let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.

886
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:26,458
Eduardo, andale!
Let's go!

887
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,228
There's something
you're not telling us.

888
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,514
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

889
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:33,851
Wait, what?

890
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:37,269
I can't do this.

891
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:38,927
She knew how Stanley
was going to die,

892
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,172
is that what
she just said?

893
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,375
You can't just
walk away from this.

894
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:43,913
- [bell dinging]
- How did you know

895
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:45,012
where he killed himself?

896
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,112
Bev.

897
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:48,315
Talk to me.

898
00:45:48,414 --> 00:45:50,250
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

899
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,235
Come on,
how did you know?

900
00:45:52,903 --> 00:45:54,338
Because I saw it.

901
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:58,291
I've seen all of us die.

902
00:45:58,391 --> 00:45:59,693
[bags thumping]

903
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:01,471
Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,

904
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,570
and then we can go.

905
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,670
[bags thud]

906
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,581
What'd I miss?

907
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:21,313
[Bill] The library?

908
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:22,766
- [Mike] Mmm-hmm.
- [Bill gasps]

909
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:26,036
Wow.

910
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,206
Didn't this place
used to be bigger?

911
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:43,619
Yo! [stutters]
Mike, where are you going?

912
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:11,231
Mike, you live here?

913
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,298
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.

914
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:14,701
[fridge door opens]

915
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,561
- You want some water?
- [Bill] Yeah, sure.

916
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:18,454
[water pouring]

917
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:32,385
You see, memory's the thing.

918
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:33,987
It's the key.

919
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:35,554
It's the key
to everything.

920
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:39,391
If It really does want
us [stutters] back here,

921
00:47:39,492 --> 00:47:41,289
don't you think the
smartest thing we can do

922
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:42,786
is just get the hell
out of Derry?

923
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:44,764
No, no, no.
It does want us back.

924
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:45,932
Of course It does!

925
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,630
But It doesn't know
I know what I know.

926
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,730
What do you know?

927
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:50,108
How to kill the shooot
out of It!

928
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:52,873
I've read every book.

929
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:55,474
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

930
00:47:55,574 --> 00:47:57,211
everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,

931
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:59,344
and that's not a long list.

932
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:00,646
But it wasn't enough.

933
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:02,949
I had to know
how this all started.

934
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,735
How It started.

935
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:11,976
And It started

936
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,097
- here.
- Whoa.

937
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:20,300
- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.

938
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,702
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

939
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:25,172
Shoko...
How'd you get it?

940
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:26,739
I found it, in the...

941
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,208
No, no,
they gave it to me.

942
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,342
I stole it.

943
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:32,378
You stole it?

944
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:34,681
- From Native Americans?
- Uh...

945
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,052
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

946
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,452
They helped me
on my journey.

947
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:41,286
So beautiful.

948
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:44,523
They showed me things.
A vision.

949
00:48:44,623 --> 00:48:45,623
Ow.

950
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,594
Holy flap.

951
00:48:47,693 --> 00:48:49,695
I feel kind of funky.

952
00:48:49,795 --> 00:48:50,795
Hot.

953
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:51,998
Am I sweating?

954
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,201
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

955
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,619
[echoing] Bill.

956
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,373
They live outside of Derry.

957
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,510
Beyond It's reach.

958
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,795
They moved there
many years ago.

959
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:08,447
Their holy man,

960
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:10,867
their holy of holies,

961
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,219
he took me in.

962
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,454
[speaking native language]

963
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:17,434
[Mike in English]
Fed me their sacred Maturin.

964
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,960
I started to...
To react.

965
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:24,063
All living things
must abide by the laws

966
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:25,715
of the shape they inhabit.

967
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:28,684
[screaming]

968
00:49:31,289 --> 00:49:33,873
[Mike] While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,

969
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:36,059
I saw It arrive.

970
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:43,817
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

971
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:44,916
Mike,

972
00:49:47,304 --> 00:49:49,039
did you put something
in my drink?

973
00:49:50,507 --> 00:49:52,025
It's, uh...

974
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:53,260
It's a root.

975
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,661
You... [stutters]

976
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,039
You drugged me?
You drugged me?

977
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:57,764
No, it's a root
with properties.

978
00:49:57,864 --> 00:50:00,139
It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me...

979
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,239
Why would you do that?

980
00:50:01,338 --> 00:50:02,969
...to open my eyes.

981
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,637
I don't feel real good.

982
00:50:04,737 --> 00:50:07,875
I need you to look,

983
00:50:07,974 --> 00:50:09,076
and you'll see.

984
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:11,045
[Bill] I don't feel good.

985
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:12,512
[Mike] Open your eyes.

986
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:14,414
Open your eyes.

987
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,699
They showed me the past.

988
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:18,668
[yelps]

989
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:25,992
Showed me the way
It appeared to them.

990
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:27,092
[whimpering]

991
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:34,985
[screams]

992
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:40,306
They showed me
their pain.

993
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,492
[both screaming]

994
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:46,512
They showed me
how to stop It!

995
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:48,731
[Native Americans chanting
in native language]

996
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:55,072
[Bill breathing heavily]

997
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:57,623
It's over.

998
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:59,193
It's over.
You're okay.

999
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:02,295
You're okay.
Did you see it?

1000
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:03,663
The ritual?

1001
00:51:03,762 --> 00:51:05,519
- The Ritual of Chud?
- Yeah, I knew you...

1002
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:08,068
I knew you would see it.

1003
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:11,271
I saw the whole flaping
thing, Mike.

1004
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:13,657
That's how we kill It.

1005
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:21,916
How are we going
to do it?

1006
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:25,385
Everybody already
[stuttering] said no.

1007
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:27,170
But with you,

1008
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,623
they'll listen.

1009
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:34,610
This won't work
without all of us.

1010
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,800
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

1011
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,268
Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.

1012
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,409
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

1013
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:47,157
Every night since Derry,

1014
00:51:49,525 --> 00:51:50,994
I've been having
these nightmares.

1015
00:51:52,594 --> 00:51:55,699
People in pain.
People dying.

1016
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:57,251
People...

1017
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,684
[Eddie]
So, you have nightmares.

1018
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:00,742
I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.

1019
00:52:00,842 --> 00:52:02,974
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

1020
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:08,760
I've watched
every single one of us...

1021
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,047
[Bill] You've seen
every single one of us what?

1022
00:52:15,853 --> 00:52:18,121
At the place that
Stanley wound up.

1023
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,376
That's how we end.

1024
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:25,144
Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shooot?

1025
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:26,722
I mean,
what makes her so different?

1026
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:27,965
The Deadlights.

1027
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,701
The Deadlights.

1028
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:46,132
She was the only
one of us

1029
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,550
that got caught in
the Deadlights that day.

1030
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:51,204
We were all
touched by It.

1031
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:52,704
Changed.

1032
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:56,608
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

1033
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,012
A virus.
You understand.

1034
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:00,347
Slowly growing.

1035
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:03,682
That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.

1036
00:53:03,782 --> 00:53:05,818
This whole time,
metastasizing.

1037
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:07,436
It just got to Stan
first, because...

1038
00:53:07,536 --> 00:53:08,536
He was the weakest.

1039
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:10,056
Jesus Christ, Rich.

1040
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:12,114
Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.

1041
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:13,460
I mean,
Rich, come on.

1042
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,362
What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.

1043
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,300
It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,

1044
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,664
unless we stop It.

1045
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,405
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

1046
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:23,652
The Ritual of Chud.

1047
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:26,806
The Shokopiwah.

1048
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:30,077
The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying.

1049
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:32,079
"All living things
must abide by

1050
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,697
"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."

1051
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:34,864
A tribal ritual?

1052
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:38,052
Are you flaping kidding me, man?

1053
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:39,853
All right,
there's gotta be another way.

1054
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:41,989
Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?

1055
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,246
Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.

1056
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:45,864
Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.

1057
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:47,577
[Beverly] It doesn't
work that way.

1058
00:53:48,913 --> 00:53:50,713
None of us make it
another 20 years,

1059
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,150
and the way it happens...

1060
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:58,371
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...

1061
00:53:58,472 --> 00:53:59,871
We die.

1062
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:01,041
Horribly.

1063
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:02,842
Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.

1064
00:54:02,943 --> 00:54:04,577
I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.

1065
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:05,978
[Bill] All right, guys.
Look.

1066
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,865
I've seen [stuttering]
what he's talking about,

1067
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:12,036
and it's all true.

1068
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:14,771
It's the only way.

1069
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:17,791
If we want
this ritual to work...

1070
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:19,210
We have to remember.

1071
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,030
Remember what?

1072
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,315
[wind blowing]

1073
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:29,719
[Mike] It's better
if I show you.

1074
00:54:30,987 --> 00:54:32,755
We don't have
much time.

1075
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,693
His cycle
will end soon.

1076
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:39,847
And once it does...

1077
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,197
[Eddie] We're fucked.

1078
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,704
[Beverly] The Barrens.

1079
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:07,423
This is where we came.

1080
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,161
After the rock fight.

1081
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:12,695
The clubhouse.

1082
00:55:13,496 --> 00:55:15,114
You built that for us.

1083
00:55:15,215 --> 00:55:17,331
Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.

1084
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,909
[Eddie] You did.
I do remember that!

1085
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,237
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1086
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,007
You okay?

1087
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:26,059
[Beverly laughs]

1088
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,744
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

1089
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:30,280
You haven't changed.

1090
00:55:31,347 --> 00:55:32,532
It's a good thing.

1091
00:55:32,632 --> 00:55:33,851
[both chuckle]

1092
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:39,889
You know what?
I actually think the door was more like

1093
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,193
around...

1094
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:43,960
[crashing]

1095
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:49,699
Found it.

1096
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,467
I'm okay!

1097
00:55:52,202 --> 00:55:53,269
Come down!

1098
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,771
What the dick is this?

1099
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:13,224
How'd you build it?

1100
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:16,175
When did you build it?

1101
00:56:16,275 --> 00:56:18,344
Here and there,
I guess.

1102
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:20,001
It was already dug
out from something,

1103
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:22,181
so I just had to
reinforce the walls

1104
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:23,884
and get some wood
for the roof door,

1105
00:56:23,983 --> 00:56:25,684
and that's pretty much it.

1106
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:27,753
Pretty good for
my first time, huh?

1107
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:30,123
[Young Stanley yelps]

1108
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:31,940
[Young Richie] Now,
that's a cool feature.

1109
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,478
What happens when
you put your hand

1110
00:56:33,577 --> 00:56:34,856
on the other pillar,
professor?

1111
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:37,311
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,

1112
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:38,532
why we have permits.

1113
00:56:38,632 --> 00:56:40,590
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

1114
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,447
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

1115
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:44,385
Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.

1116
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,681
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

1117
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,780
That's a flashlight.

1118
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,038
What is that,
a horse hitch?

1119
00:56:49,137 --> 00:56:50,416
When do you have
horses down...

1120
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:51,516
Oh, this is cool.

1121
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:52,813
That was like,
three dollars,

1122
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,190
so be careful with that, please.

1123
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,128
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

1124
00:56:56,228 --> 00:56:57,469
Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?

1125
00:56:57,565 --> 00:56:59,686
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

1126
00:56:59,775 --> 00:57:00,775
Be awesome and have fun

1127
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,614
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?

1128
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:03,771
Wow.

1129
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,161
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

1130
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,260
- I broke it?
- Yeah,

1131
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,527
you broke it
with your face.

1132
00:57:08,628 --> 00:57:09,628
What?

1133
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,750
[Young Eddie] I'm not putting
my flaping hand down there.

1134
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:17,353
[blows]

1135
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:20,490
[Eddie] Oh, man.
That's so cool.

1136
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,476
[Bill] Oh, my God.

1137
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:26,947
[Eddie] How do we all not
remember that this was here?

1138
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:28,931
[Richie as Pennywise]
Hey, Losers.

1139
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:33,237
Time to float.

1140
00:57:36,773 --> 00:57:37,958
[laughing]

1141
00:57:38,057 --> 00:57:39,992
- Ahh!
- flap, Richie.

1142
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:41,650
- Dude!
- Remember when he used to say

1143
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:44,231
that shooot?
And he'd do that little dance.

1144
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:46,465
[vocalizing]

1145
00:57:46,565 --> 00:57:48,335
Am I the only one
who remembers this shooot?

1146
00:57:48,434 --> 00:57:51,471
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

1147
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,806
All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shooot.

1148
00:57:53,907 --> 00:57:55,409
I'll go flap myself.

1149
00:57:55,509 --> 00:57:57,476
[whistling]

1150
00:57:57,577 --> 00:57:59,295
It smells so flaping
terrible in here.

1151
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,534
Hey, you guys?

1152
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,405
[stuttering] This says "Stan."

1153
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,443
"For the use
of Losers only."

1154
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:15,978
Bill.

1155
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:27,007
- ['80s music playing]
- The flap is this?

1156
00:58:27,106 --> 00:58:28,344
So you don't get
spiders stuck

1157
00:58:28,445 --> 00:58:29,882
in your hair
when you're down here.

1158
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:31,820
Stanley, we're not afraid
of flaping spiders.

1159
00:58:34,664 --> 00:58:35,998
I stand corrected.

1160
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,135
[laughs] That's a first.

1161
00:58:38,635 --> 00:58:40,034
Touche.

1162
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,887
Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.

1163
00:58:41,987 --> 00:58:43,356
What are you talking about?

1164
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:45,213
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

1165
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,231
- I don't see any sign.
- [Young Eddie] Are you

1166
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:49,168
being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

1167
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:51,503
Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?

1168
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:53,561
And I remember you agreeing
on the flaping rule!

1169
00:58:53,661 --> 00:58:54,661
[both grunting]

1170
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,277
[Young Richie]
I can see your vagina!

1171
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:57,655
[Young Eddie]
Ten minutes each.

1172
00:58:57,755 --> 00:58:59,791
[Young Richie] Go back in
your dumb little corner!

1173
00:59:00,023 --> 00:59:01,541
I fucked your mom!

1174
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:04,443
[Young Eddie] No, you didn't.
Take that back!

1175
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:06,530
You're awfully good at
this, new kid.

1176
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,965
You really think so?

1177
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,485
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.

1178
00:59:12,585 --> 00:59:14,583
Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.

1179
00:59:14,682 --> 00:59:15,880
I was thinking about applying.

1180
00:59:15,981 --> 00:59:17,157
[Young Richie] I'll do that.

1181
00:59:17,257 --> 00:59:20,025
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.

1182
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:22,161
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

1183
00:59:22,262 --> 00:59:24,047
What's in Florida, Mike?

1184
00:59:25,114 --> 00:59:26,699
I don't know.

1185
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,157
You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.

1186
00:59:29,257 --> 00:59:30,934
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

1187
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,239
You already act 80.

1188
00:59:32,338 --> 00:59:34,614
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.
[imitates kissing]

1189
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:35,715
[all laughing]

1190
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,563
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

1191
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:43,150
When we're older?

1192
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,485
[Young Richie] What?

1193
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:47,920
Why wouldn't we be?

1194
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:49,538
Do any of your parents
still hang out

1195
00:59:49,637 --> 00:59:51,195
with their friends
from middle school?

1196
00:59:52,074 --> 00:59:55,045
I mean, things might
be different then.

1197
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:58,114
We all might be different.

1198
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,769
We'll always still be friends.

1199
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,105
I don't think that just,
you know,

1200
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:07,324
[stuttering] goes away
because we get older.

1201
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:10,639
[Young Beverly]
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1202
01:00:13,063 --> 01:00:15,715
You don't have
to be so...

1203
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:16,815
Sad.

1204
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,456
He was old
before his time.

1205
01:00:23,556 --> 01:00:25,492
[Eddie] Yeah.

1206
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:28,228
I wonder what he was
like all grown up.

1207
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,246
Probably what he
was like as a kid.

1208
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,751
The best.

1209
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,052
Here.

1210
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:41,190
All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?

1211
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:43,610
The ritual.

1212
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,112
To perform it
requires a sacrifice.

1213
01:00:46,211 --> 01:00:48,748
- Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
- Wait, what?

1214
01:00:48,847 --> 01:00:50,806
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1215
01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:53,262
I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.

1216
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:55,639
It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.

1217
01:00:56,606 --> 01:00:57,606
Mike?

1218
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:00,427
The past is buried.

1219
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:02,695
But you're gonna have
to dig it up.

1220
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:04,764
Piece by piece.

1221
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:06,099
And these pieces,

1222
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,784
these artifacts,

1223
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:10,387
that's why we're here.

1224
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,056
They are
what you'll sacrifice.

1225
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,577
And since Stan
isn't here to find his...

1226
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:19,646
I figured we should
all be here together

1227
01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:21,264
to find his artifact.

1228
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:25,536
I think Bill just did that.

1229
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,626
Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?

1230
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:34,603
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1231
01:01:34,704 --> 01:01:36,630
This is flaping stupid,
all right?

1232
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,264
Why do we need tokens?
All right?

1233
01:01:38,364 --> 01:01:39,867
We already remember
everything.

1234
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,166
Saving Bev,
defeating It...

1235
01:01:41,266 --> 01:01:43,135
I mean,
we're caught up!

1236
01:01:43,235 --> 01:01:44,554
It's not everything.

1237
01:01:46,155 --> 01:01:48,257
We fought.
But what happened after that?

1238
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:51,295
Before the house
on Neibolt.

1239
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:53,697
Think.

1240
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:58,684
[stuttering] We can't
remember, can we?

1241
01:01:58,784 --> 01:02:00,788
See, there's more to our story.

1242
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:02,239
What happened that summer.

1243
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:04,858
And those blank spaces,

1244
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,059
like pages torn out of a book.

1245
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:09,596
That's what
you need to find.

1246
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:11,364
We need to split up.

1247
01:02:11,463 --> 01:02:13,733
You each need to
find your artifact.

1248
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,702
Alone.
That's important.

1249
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:16,802
When you do,

1250
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:19,572
meet me
at the library tonight.

1251
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:21,507
[Eddie] Yeah,
I gotta say,

1252
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:23,844
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,

1253
01:02:23,945 --> 01:02:25,501
we're gonna do much
better as a group.

1254
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:27,159
Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.

1255
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,817
Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?

1256
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,750
We were together that
summer, right?

1257
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:32,849
[Bill] No.

1258
01:02:33,353 --> 01:02:37,056
Not that [stutters]
whole summer.

1259
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,657
[Young Bill]
Take it back.

1260
01:02:38,757 --> 01:02:40,242
- [groans]
- [Young Beverly] Bill!

1261
01:02:41,677 --> 01:02:43,413
You're just
a bunch of losers.

1262
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:45,097
flap off!

1263
01:02:45,197 --> 01:02:46,717
- flaping...
- Stop!

1264
01:02:48,485 --> 01:02:51,170
We were all together
when we hurt It.

1265
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,405
That's why
we're still alive.

1266
01:02:53,505 --> 01:02:56,193
Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.

1267
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:06,699
[Young Beverly]
I bet by tomorrow,

1268
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,918
we'll all be
back together.

1269
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,757
[stutters] I don't think so.

1270
01:03:11,858 --> 01:03:13,911
Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.

1271
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:17,347
Maybe Richie was right.

1272
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:22,668
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.

1273
01:03:22,768 --> 01:03:25,072
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

1274
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:26,858
It's a little late
for that.

1275
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:32,228
You should go.

1276
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:35,666
Before your dad sees.

1277
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:04,360
[doorbell rings]

1278
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:11,233
Yes?

1279
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:14,271
Sorry. I...

1280
01:04:15,806 --> 01:04:17,824
May I help you?

1281
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,192
I thought I rang Marsh.

1282
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,492
Marsh?

1283
01:04:21,878 --> 01:04:23,346
Alvin Marsh?

1284
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,347
My father.

1285
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,784
I grew up here.

1286
01:04:34,257 --> 01:04:35,257
Dear,

1287
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:39,146
it's not for me to
tell you this,

1288
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:41,565
but your father
passed away.

1289
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:46,335
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?

1290
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:52,059
We hadn't spoken
in a while.

1291
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:54,260
Well, won't you
come in?

1292
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,362
Let me offer you
something to drink.

1293
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:59,364
No, it's fine.
I have to go.

1294
01:04:59,465 --> 01:05:01,952
It's the least
I can do.

1295
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,289
Sure. Okay.

1296
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:11,494
[door closes]

1297
01:05:18,268 --> 01:05:20,788
Is it like you remember?

1298
01:05:20,887 --> 01:05:22,487
Cleaner.

1299
01:05:22,722 --> 01:05:24,858
Well, you feel free
to look around

1300
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,760
while I get
the water boiling.

1301
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,858
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1302
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,347
Don't be so polite.

1303
01:05:59,608 --> 01:06:01,411
[Mr. Marsh]
Today is her birthday.

1304
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:07,449
I can still smell
her perfume.

1305
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:13,056
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1306
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:16,643
Mama was sick.

1307
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:20,313
You know that's why
she did what she did.

1308
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:22,548
She did what she did

1309
01:06:22,648 --> 01:06:26,735
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1310
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:29,907
You look like her.

1311
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:35,045
But you are nothing
like her.

1312
01:06:37,882 --> 01:06:39,382
Come here.

1313
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:43,855
I said come here!

1314
01:06:46,556 --> 01:06:47,958
Close your eyes.

1315
01:06:59,402 --> 01:07:00,603
[sniffing]

1316
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:06,425
You know that I
would never hurt you.

1317
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:07,777
You know that,
don't you?

1318
01:07:17,554 --> 01:07:20,039
[sobbing] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1319
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:23,425
You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?

1320
01:07:24,128 --> 01:07:25,527
Always.

1321
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:27,958
[laughs]

1322
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:37,969
"Your hair is winter fire,

1323
01:08:38,768 --> 01:08:41,520
"January embers...

1324
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:44,175
"My heart burns
there, too."

1325
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:04,011
- [music playing]
- There. I do apologize.

1326
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:09,416
It gets so very hot
here this time of year.

1327
01:09:09,515 --> 01:09:10,951
It's fine.

1328
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:14,854
Well, you feel like you
could just about die.

1329
01:09:14,954 --> 01:09:18,024
But you know what
they say about Derry.

1330
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:22,246
"No one who dies here
ever really dies."

1331
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:25,748
[clock ticking]

1332
01:09:34,823 --> 01:09:38,295
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1333
01:09:40,497 --> 01:09:42,448
It's good.
Strange.

1334
01:09:42,548 --> 01:09:44,149
Strange?

1335
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:45,717
Oh, my.

1336
01:09:45,818 --> 01:09:48,204
Strange, how?

1337
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,958
- [oven timer dings]
- [Mrs. Kersh] Oh.

1338
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:55,128
I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.

1339
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:56,529
You stay right there.

1340
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:58,765
I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...

1341
01:09:58,864 --> 01:10:01,600
No, no, no. I insist.

1342
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,854
[record skipping]

1343
01:10:06,923 --> 01:10:09,109
Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?

1344
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,643
Yes, dear.

1345
01:10:10,743 --> 01:10:14,713
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1346
01:10:14,814 --> 01:10:17,016
And he didn't ask
for a handout

1347
01:10:17,117 --> 01:10:19,786
the way that people
come in here these days.

1348
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,454
You know what he did?

1349
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:23,622
What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?

1350
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:26,743
My father joined the circus.

1351
01:10:37,555 --> 01:10:40,291
[music becomes distorted]

1352
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,163
I was always
Daddy's little girl.

1353
01:10:48,298 --> 01:10:49,365
What about you?

1354
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:56,823
[Pennywise] Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?

1355
01:10:56,922 --> 01:10:58,675
[Beverly breathing heavily]

1356
01:11:00,144 --> 01:11:01,677
Are you?

1357
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:05,099
[stomping footsteps
approaching]

1358
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:06,198

1359
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:09,618
[Beverly yelping]

1360
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,943
Mustn't lie
to our father!

1361
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:17,862
[Mrs. Kersh cackling]

1362
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,365
Help!

1363
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:27,003
[Pennywise]
Run, run, run.

1364
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:29,238
Run, run.

1365
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:36,113
You haven't
changed anything yet.

1366
01:11:38,814 --> 01:11:43,020
You haven't
changed their futures.

1367
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:50,792
You... You haven't
saved any of them.

1368
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,798
Close your eyes, Bev.

1369
01:11:57,368 --> 01:11:58,417
flap you!

1370
01:11:58,518 --> 01:12:00,703
If you don't believe,

1371
01:12:03,506 --> 01:12:05,208
close them

1372
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:07,909
and see!

1373
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:12,416
[laughing evilly]

1374
01:12:14,783 --> 01:12:16,020
[screaming]

1375
01:13:08,037 --> 01:13:09,506
Come on, you.
Come on.

1376
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:13,260
[Connor] Ken,
you little bitch...

1377
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:14,359
Yes!

1378
01:13:14,461 --> 01:13:15,595
You're flaping good.

1379
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:17,779
[electronic voice]
Game over.

1380
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:22,286
- Ah, well, I gotta go.
- Hey!

1381
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:23,784
Um...

1382
01:13:26,457 --> 01:13:28,175
How about we
go again?

1383
01:13:28,274 --> 01:13:29,708
Play some more,
you know?

1384
01:13:29,809 --> 01:13:31,278
[Belch] flap you, man.

1385
01:13:31,377 --> 01:13:32,395
Only if you want to.

1386
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:39,185
Dude, why are you
being weird?

1387
01:13:39,286 --> 01:13:40,921
I'm not
your flaping boyfriend.

1388
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,822
Whoa, I...
I didn't...

1389
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:44,756
What the flap's
going on here?

1390
01:13:44,856 --> 01:13:46,059
You assholes
didn't tell me

1391
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:47,860
your town is
full of little fairies.

1392
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:49,439
[Young Henry]
Richie flaping Tozier?

1393
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:52,283
What? You're trying to
bone my little cousin?

1394
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,052
Get the flap out of
here, faggot!

1395
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,891
flaping move!

1396
01:14:12,835 --> 01:14:14,371
[panting]

1397
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:24,145
[crying]

1398
01:14:24,863 --> 01:14:26,382
[Pennywise]
Want a kiss, Richie?

1399
01:14:29,953 --> 01:14:31,287
[breathing heavily]

1400
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:32,805
[rustling]

[laughing evilly]

1405
01:14:57,564 --> 01:14:59,960
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1406
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,456
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1407
01:15:02,555 --> 01:15:04,953
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1408

01:27:06,452 --> 01:27:10,229
as fat and gross and
disgusting like you?

1587
01:27:10,329 --> 01:27:11,764
[lighter clicking]

1588
01:27:11,863 --> 01:27:13,599
No matter
how many stupid poems

1589
01:27:13,698 --> 01:27:14,918
[demonic voice] you write.

1590
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:17,854
[gasps]

1591
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:24,793
"Your hair is winter fire.

1592
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:32,734
"January embers.

1593
01:27:35,139 --> 01:27:37,774
"My heart
burns there, too."

1594
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:48,784
[panting]

1595
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:05,018
That's not the real Beverly.

1596
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:07,686
Beverly would never
say anything like that.

1597
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:09,206
She'd never say that.

1598
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:26,738
- [screams]
- Kiss me, fat boy.

1599
01:28:26,838 --> 01:28:28,324
- [yells]

01:28:32,195 --> 01:28:33,229
[grunting]

1602
01:28:36,832 --> 01:28:42,256
Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.

1603
01:28:42,355 --> 01:28:43,622
Just leave me alone.

1604
01:28:43,722 --> 01:28:44,922
Alone?

1605
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:49,628
Oh, you've always
been alone.

1606
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:52,865
That's not true.
I have real friends.

1607
01:28:52,966 --> 01:28:54,868
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1608
01:28:54,967 --> 01:28:56,770
They're my real friends.

1609
01:28:56,869 --> 01:29:00,541
Kiss me as if it
were the last time.

1610
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,141
[grunting]

1611
01:29:02,242 --> 01:29:03,394
[roars]

1612
01:29:07,931 --> 01:29:09,765
[janitor] What the hell
are you doing, kid?

1613
01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:12,835
[exhales]

1614
01:29:16,573 --> 01:29:18,007
[sniffling]

1615
01:29:21,743 --> 01:29:22,912
[door opens]

1616
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:27,317
Guys?

1617
01:29:28,618 --> 01:29:29,819
[Beverly] Hey.

1618
01:29:31,421 --> 01:29:32,788
[Ben] Hey.

1619
01:29:34,257 --> 01:29:36,542
So, what did you see
out there?

1620
01:29:36,643 --> 01:29:38,728
Something I wish
I hadn't.

1621
01:29:42,365 --> 01:29:43,765
So, what, we just...

1622
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:50,789
We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1623
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:53,159
I hope so.
Don't you?

1624
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:55,462
I don't know.

1625
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:58,398
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1626
01:29:58,497 --> 01:29:59,497
Mmm.

1627
01:29:59,864 --> 01:30:01,381
Come on.
There must be something from

1628
01:30:01,481 --> 01:30:03,386
the past that you don't
want to forget again.

1629
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:07,457
I remember
being scared shitless.

1630
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:09,425
Cold.

1631
01:30:10,944 --> 01:30:13,380
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1632
01:30:13,479 --> 01:30:16,367
Okay. Please forget
that moment.

1633
01:30:18,002 --> 01:30:20,203
I remember this.

1634
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:25,208
I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.

1635
01:30:27,645 --> 01:30:29,445
Not him, so much,

1636
01:30:31,715 --> 01:30:33,917
but how he made me feel.

1637
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:38,921
And a kiss.

1638
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:47,546
It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,

1639
01:30:47,646 --> 01:30:49,382
the more I can see it.

1640
01:30:49,483 --> 01:30:51,818
The more I can see that moment.

1641
01:30:51,917 --> 01:30:53,337
The more
I can see...

1642
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:55,372
Bill.

1643
01:30:58,341 --> 01:30:59,475
I think.

1644
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:04,480
I don't know.
Do you remember...

1645
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:08,484
- [door opens]
- Bev, um...

1646
01:31:09,987 --> 01:31:11,938
- Move. Move.
- [Beverly] What's wrong?

1647
01:31:12,037 --> 01:31:14,073
I'm leaving.

1648
01:31:14,173 --> 01:31:15,676
[Ben] What?
You can't leave, man.

1649
01:31:15,775 --> 01:31:17,310
We split,
we all die.

1650
01:31:17,411 --> 01:31:19,530
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1651
01:31:20,064 --> 01:31:22,264
Rich. Um...

1652
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,400
Rich.

1653
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:30,090
Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!

1654
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:32,359
Come on down.
It's the last day

1655
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:34,811
of the festival here
at Canal Days.

1656
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:36,529
[upbeat music playing]

1657
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,630
Ahh!

1658
01:31:38,282 --> 01:31:39,382
Asshole!

1659
01:31:45,588 --> 01:31:47,524
[Muzak playing]

1660
01:31:53,063 --> 01:31:54,530
- [ripping]
- Hello?

1661
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:57,134
[sniffing]

1662
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,993
Can I help you?

1663
01:32:08,094 --> 01:32:09,496
Yeah, I called in...

1664
01:32:09,595 --> 01:32:11,315
I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.

1665
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:12,899
Kaspbrak?

1666
01:32:12,998 --> 01:32:14,184
It's an inhaler.

1667
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:18,805
Uh... Eddie Kaspbrak?

1668
01:32:18,904 --> 01:32:20,457
Mmm-hmm.
That's me.

1669
01:32:21,759 --> 01:32:22,960
I remember you.

1670
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:24,394
Yeah.

1671
01:32:24,644 --> 01:32:26,179
- Mmm-hmm.
- How's your mom?

1672
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:28,014
Oh, uh...
Well, she died a few years ago.

1673
01:32:28,113 --> 01:32:29,751
It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.

1674
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:30,850
What's that?

1675
01:32:30,949 --> 01:32:32,903
- What's what?
- That.

1676
01:32:34,171 --> 01:32:35,921
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

1677
01:32:36,021 --> 01:32:37,224
- Okay.
- [grunts]

1678
01:32:37,323 --> 01:32:39,559
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1679
01:32:39,658 --> 01:32:41,761
It might not be cancer.

1680
01:32:41,862 --> 01:32:43,046
Cancer?

1681
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:46,932
But it might be.

1682
01:32:47,033 --> 01:32:48,802
You just stay here.

1683
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:50,837
I'll get you something.

1684
01:32:50,938 --> 01:32:52,189
[squeaking]

1685
01:32:52,655 --> 01:32:53,655
Okay.

1686
01:33:03,332 --> 01:33:05,601
You came here for your
stinky breath pills?

1687
01:33:07,104 --> 01:33:09,288
[stammers] My breath
is fine.

1688
01:33:09,389 --> 01:33:11,123
Thank you.

1689
01:33:11,224 --> 01:33:13,860
That's not
what my dad said.

1690
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:15,945
He said you have a tumor.

1691
01:33:18,582 --> 01:33:19,867
On your dick.

1692
01:33:19,966 --> 01:33:21,033
[laughs]

1693
01:33:21,134 --> 01:33:23,420
But you don't
take pills for...

1694
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:26,689
Wait, what did
your dad say?

1695
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:28,958
There you go.

1696
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,500
I hope your dick
feels better.

1697
01:33:33,729 --> 01:33:35,097
Thank you.

1698
01:33:36,466 --> 01:33:39,719
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1699
01:33:39,819 --> 01:33:42,005
[Mrs. Kaspbrak] Eddie!

1700
01:33:45,007 --> 01:33:47,109

[Mrs. Kaspbrak] Eddie?

[Young Eddie] The flap
is she doing here?

1721
01:34:58,974 --> 01:35:00,233
What is taking you
so long?

1722
01:35:00,332 --> 01:35:02,386
I don't know.
Why are you here?

1723
01:35:11,795 --> 01:35:12,994

We're all scared.

That's what worries me.

1793

Because that's
what It wants.

Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.

Why did you do that?

1834
01:41:36,029 --> 01:41:38,664
Because he says
it's your time.

on the meaning of

what I just read,

1924
01:46:56,916 --> 01:46:59,252
the word "Leshanot"
comes up a lot,

01:46:59,353 --> 01:47:02,273
which means "to
change, to transform."

1926

Which makes sense,
I guess,

1927
01:47:05,324 --> 01:47:08,078
because today I'm
supposed to become a man.

1928

01:47:58,162 --> 01:48:00,930
are the hardest to
walk away from.

1941
01:48:04,801 --> 01:48:07,320
The good stuff?

1942
01:48:07,421 --> 01:48:11,591
The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?

1943
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:15,279
Those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose.

1944
01:48:16,979 --> 01:48:20,016
- Maybe I don't want to forget.
- [camera clicking]

1945
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:25,355
Maybe if that's what
today is all about,

1946
01:48:27,623 --> 01:48:29,509
forget it, right?

1947
01:48:29,609 --> 01:48:31,211
- Thank you, Stanley.
- [stammering]

1948
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:32,945
Today, I'm supposed
to become a man,

1949
01:48:33,046 --> 01:48:36,033
but I don't feel
any different.

1950
01:48:38,001 --> 01:48:40,087
I know I'm a loser.

1951
01:48:40,186 --> 01:48:42,355
And no matter what,

1952
01:48:42,456 --> 01:48:44,416
- I always flaping will be.
- [congregants gasp]

1953
01:49:04,761 --> 01:49:06,630
Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.

1954
01:49:48,171 --> 01:49:50,524
[Mrs. Hanlon] Mike! Help!

1955
01:49:50,623 --> 01:49:52,259
[Mrs. Hanlon screaming]

1956
01:49:52,359 --> 01:49:53,493
Help us!

1957
01:49:53,592 --> 01:49:56,762
- Please, Mikey, get help!
- [Mr. Hanlon] Help us!

1958
01:49:56,863 --> 01:49:59,899
Please, Mikey,
get help!

1959
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,560
- [Mrs. Hanlon] Mikey!
- [both scream]

1960
01:50:07,056 --> 01:50:08,559
[Henry yelling]

1961
01:50:18,469 --> 01:50:19,470
[groans]

1962
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,106
[laughing]

1963
01:50:26,609 --> 01:50:29,395
You should
have burned, Mike.

1964
01:50:29,496 --> 01:50:30,496
[yelling]

1965
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,470
Just like
your druggie parents.

1966
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:40,273
- [grunting]
- Can you see them yet?

1967
01:50:40,372 --> 01:50:41,675
[laughing] Crisping?

1968
01:50:41,774 --> 01:50:43,176
[both grunting]

1969
01:50:43,275 --> 01:50:45,412
Like fried flaping...

1970
01:50:45,511 --> 01:50:46,511
[groans]

1971
01:50:54,171 --> 01:50:55,372
[thuds]

1972
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:00,092
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1973
01:51:00,193 --> 01:51:01,994
Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.

1974
01:51:02,095 --> 01:51:03,646
[retches] No.

1975
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:05,916
Oh...

1976
01:51:08,618 --> 01:51:09,837
[Beverly] Mike?

1977
01:51:09,936 --> 01:51:12,122
- [Ben] Hey.
- [Beverly] Hey. Oh, my God.

1978
01:51:13,222 --> 01:51:14,423
[Beverly screams]

1979
01:51:16,193 --> 01:51:18,078
[Beverly panting]

1980
01:51:18,177 --> 01:51:19,746
Are you all right?

1981
01:51:19,845 --> 01:51:21,926
No, I'm not all right.
I just flaping killed a guy.

1982
01:51:22,698 --> 01:51:24,201
I was talking to Mike.

1983
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:27,770
Where's Bill?

1984
01:51:29,139 --> 01:51:31,608
- [cell phone ringing]
- [clears throat]

1985
01:51:33,443 --> 01:51:34,761
Bill, we're all
at the library.

1986
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,262
Where are you at?

1987
01:51:36,363 --> 01:51:38,564
[stuttering] He took a little
kid, Mike.

1988
01:51:38,664 --> 01:51:42,202
He took a little kid right
in flaping front of me.

1989
01:51:42,301 --> 01:51:44,037
No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just...

1990
01:51:44,136 --> 01:51:45,614
Look, just come here
to the library.

1991
01:51:45,715 --> 01:51:47,039
We can talk about
the plan.

1992
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:49,208
- I'm gonna go kill It.
- No, no, no.

1993
01:51:49,309 --> 01:51:53,078
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1994
01:51:53,179 --> 01:51:54,530
Bill! Bill!

1995
01:51:59,302 --> 01:52:00,921
He's going
to fight It alone.

1996
01:52:01,021 --> 01:52:03,355
- What?
- [Mike] Alone.

1997
01:52:03,456 --> 01:52:04,690
It's about the group.

1998
01:52:04,791 --> 01:52:06,507
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

1999
01:52:06,608 --> 01:52:08,046
Doing it together
is why it'd work.

2000
01:52:11,782 --> 01:52:14,199
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

2001
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,101
If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,

2002
01:52:16,202 --> 01:52:17,703
there's only one place
he'll go.

2003
01:52:17,804 --> 01:52:19,761
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

2004
01:52:19,862 --> 01:52:22,158
Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?

2005
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:24,595
[sighs] flap.

2006
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,283
[breathing heavily]

2007
01:52:54,057 --> 01:52:55,909
[Beverly] Bill!

2008
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:58,011
No, no,
you guys, no!

2009
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,079
[stuttering]
I started all this.

2010
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,917
It's my fault that
you're all here.

2011
01:53:03,016 --> 01:53:06,418
This curse, this flaping
thing that's inside you all.

2012
01:53:06,519 --> 01:53:08,454
It started growing
the day

2013
01:53:08,555 --> 01:53:10,113
that I made you go
down to the Barrens

2014
01:53:10,212 --> 01:53:14,778
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

2015
01:53:16,212 --> 01:53:17,663
Now, I'm gonna
go in there,

2016
01:53:17,764 --> 01:53:19,399
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,

2017
01:53:19,498 --> 01:53:22,284
but I can't ask you
to do this.

2018
01:53:24,354 --> 01:53:25,671
[Beverly] Well,

2019
01:53:25,771 --> 01:53:27,908
we're not asking you,
either.

2020
01:53:28,007 --> 01:53:29,010
- Bev...
- We didn't

2021
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:30,609
do it alone
then, Bill,

2022
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:33,313
so we're not gonna
do this alone now.

2023
01:53:33,412 --> 01:53:35,631
Losers stick together.

2024
01:53:41,203 --> 01:53:43,875
So, does somebody
want to say something?

2025
01:53:45,708 --> 01:53:48,828
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

2026
01:53:48,929 --> 01:53:50,128
I did?

2027
01:53:51,847 --> 01:53:54,634
- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that.

2028
01:53:54,734 --> 01:53:56,485
"You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?

2029
01:53:57,954 --> 01:53:59,456
[Bill] No.

2030
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:02,926
"Let's kill
this flaping clown"?

2031
01:54:06,863 --> 01:54:09,533
Let's kill this
flaping clown.

2032
01:54:34,356 --> 01:54:35,809
[Richie] Hmm.

2033
01:54:35,908 --> 01:54:37,668
Well, I love what he's
done with the place.

2034
01:54:38,228 --> 01:54:39,345
Beep-beep, Richie.

2035
01:54:39,444 --> 01:54:40,697
All right.

2036
01:54:59,716 --> 01:55:01,818
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

2037
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,355
[groaning]

2038
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:09,509
[Beverly] Ben?

2039
01:55:09,609 --> 01:55:11,811
[Eddie] No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!

2040
01:55:11,912 --> 01:55:12,979
[both] Ben!

2041
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:14,079
Ben? What's wrong?

2042
01:55:14,179 --> 01:55:16,315
[continues groaning]

2043
01:55:16,416 --> 01:55:18,585
- Ben!
- Okay. All right.

2044
01:55:18,685 --> 01:55:20,302
- [Bill] Ben!
- [rattling]

2045
01:55:26,443 --> 01:55:28,427
Okay, that can't
be good, right?

2046
01:55:28,528 --> 01:55:30,404
- [Ben continues groaning]
- [Beverly gasping]

2047
01:55:30,505 --> 01:55:31,614
Help! Hey!

2048
01:55:32,414 --> 01:55:33,617
[whimpers]

2049
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:35,719
[pounding on fridge door]

2050
01:55:38,256 --> 01:55:39,456
[both] Ugh!

2051
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,329
It's Stan.

2052
01:55:49,498 --> 01:55:51,018
- [Ben screaming]
- [whimpering]

2053
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:52,301
[Beverly] It can't
be real.

2054
01:55:53,938 --> 01:55:55,972
- [yelling]
- Oh!

2055
01:55:57,506 --> 01:55:58,926
- [all yelping]
- Oh, God.

2056
01:55:59,025 --> 01:56:00,025
shooot.

2057
01:56:05,283 --> 01:56:06,682
[hyperventilating]

2058
01:56:08,318 --> 01:56:10,753
I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.

2059
01:56:11,889 --> 01:56:12,889
No.

2060
01:56:17,295 --> 01:56:18,627
- Beverly!
- [screaming]

2061
01:56:20,064 --> 01:56:21,363
[Pennywise laughing]

2062
01:56:21,899 --> 01:56:23,365
[Ben whimpering]

2063
01:56:25,235 --> 01:56:26,435
[knife unsheathing]

2064
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:29,222
[screaming]

2065
01:56:29,323 --> 01:56:30,506
[grunting]

2066
01:56:38,849 --> 01:56:40,466
[cracking]

2067
01:56:40,565 --> 01:56:42,752
Richie, what's happening to me?

2068
01:56:44,154 --> 01:56:45,354
[groaning]

2069
01:57:02,572 --> 01:57:05,125
You gotta be
flaping kidding.

2070
01:57:05,225 --> 01:57:06,775
[laughing]

2071
01:57:10,447 --> 01:57:12,748
[yelps] flap!

2072
01:57:14,185 --> 01:57:17,554
Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!

2073
01:57:19,323 --> 01:57:20,439
[snarling]

2074
01:57:20,539 --> 01:57:22,559
Whoa, whoa!
[yelping]

- [footsteps retreating]
- [Pennywise laughing]

2077
01:57:33,237 --> 01:57:34,354
Eddie.

2078
01:57:34,453 --> 01:57:36,573
Hey. Are you okay?

2079
01:57:37,073 --> 01:57:38,074
I'm...

2080
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:44,514
Oh, there he is.

2081
01:57:45,149 --> 01:57:46,815
[screaming]

2082
01:57:48,252 --> 01:57:49,435
Get it off of me!

2083
01:57:49,534 --> 01:57:51,212
- [Bill grunting]
- [continues screaming]

2084
01:57:51,313 --> 01:57:52,313
Get it off of me!

2085
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:55,091
[Ben] Richie!

2086
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:57,377
- [Mike] Richie!
- Richie! Hey!

2087
01:57:57,476 --> 01:57:59,037
- [Bill grunting]
- [Richie screaming]

2088
01:58:00,064 --> 01:58:01,984
- [Richie] Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.

2089
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:04,784
Get the knife!

2090
01:58:04,885 --> 01:58:06,618
God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!

2091
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,206
Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick! [screaming]

2092
01:58:11,707 --> 01:58:13,475
- Eddie, get the knife!
- [grunts]

2093
01:58:14,110 --> 01:58:15,679
Ahh! flap!

2094
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:22,484

[Bill grunts]

2097
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:33,029
[panting]

2098
01:58:36,367 --> 01:58:37,367
[Beverly] What?

2099
01:58:37,466 --> 01:58:38,635
[grunts]

2100
01:58:42,305 --> 01:58:43,707

2102
01:58:49,246 --> 01:58:51,030
Is everybody okay?

2103
01:58:51,131 --> 01:58:53,900
- [coughing]
- [Bill] You all right?

2104
01:58:54,001 --> 01:58:56,270
[stuttering] He could have
flaping died, man.

2105
01:58:56,369 --> 01:58:57,470
You know that, right?

2106
01:58:57,569 --> 01:58:59,105
I can't see.

2107
01:58:59,206 --> 01:59:02,809
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

2108
01:59:02,908 --> 01:59:05,412
You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?

2109
01:59:05,511 --> 01:59:07,764
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

2110
01:59:12,502 --> 01:59:14,503
Please don't
be mad, Bill.

2111
01:59:18,408 --> 01:59:20,277
I was just scared.
[crying]

2112
01:59:22,779 --> 01:59:25,715
That's what
he wants, right?

2113
01:59:28,185 --> 01:59:30,121
Don't give it to him.

2114
01:59:42,664 --> 01:59:44,268
A lot of memories, huh?

2115
01:59:46,536 --> 01:59:47,837
All bad.

2116
01:59:51,375 --> 01:59:53,144
[rats squeaking]

2117
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:01,784
[Eddie] Oh, man.

2118
02:00:03,287 --> 02:00:05,256
Blech. Gray water.

2119
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,994
shooot. This is it.

2120
02:00:46,963 --> 02:00:48,198
This is where
it happened.

2121
02:01:04,081 --> 02:01:05,631
No, no, no.

2122
02:01:05,730 --> 02:01:07,283
No. Ugh!

2123
02:01:15,859 --> 02:01:17,161
[Pennywise] Bevvie.

2124
02:01:26,569 --> 02:01:27,770
Bev, what is it?

2125
02:01:33,010 --> 02:01:34,594
I thought
I heard something.

2126
02:01:34,694 --> 02:01:36,212
- [screaming]
- [laughing]

2127
02:01:37,148 --> 02:01:38,148
Bev!

2128
02:01:38,599 --> 02:01:39,932
Time to sink!

2129
02:01:40,033 --> 02:01:41,217
- [laughs]
- [screams]

2130
02:01:43,653 --> 02:01:45,055
[Mike] Bev!

2131
02:01:46,957 --> 02:01:48,192
[echoing] Guys.

2132
02:01:51,395 --> 02:01:53,063
Okay, guys.
Come on.

2133
02:01:57,534 --> 02:01:59,286
Hey, guys.

2134
02:01:59,386 --> 02:02:01,454
Guys, come on.
[crying] Please, come on.

2135
02:02:01,555 --> 02:02:03,340
I don't want to walk
out of here alone.

2136
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:05,242
[all gasping]

2137
02:02:07,177 --> 02:02:08,895
- You okay?
- [Beverly crying]

2138
02:02:08,996 --> 02:02:11,164
I feel like crying.

2139
02:02:11,265 --> 02:02:14,051
Mike. Where do we go from here?

2140
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:22,809
[Mike] In the depths
is where It crept.

2141
02:02:22,908 --> 02:02:24,676
In the beneath,
to find belief.

2142
02:02:24,777 --> 02:02:26,095
In the depths
is where It crept.

2143
02:02:26,194 --> 02:02:27,581
In the beneath,
to find belief.

2144
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:29,115
Is he okay?

2145
02:02:29,216 --> 02:02:31,252
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

2146
02:02:31,351 --> 02:02:32,886
What's on
the other side?

2147
02:02:32,985 --> 02:02:35,338
I don't know.
No one does.

2148
02:02:38,175 --> 02:02:39,376
[Bill] Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

2149
02:02:40,211 --> 02:02:41,212
Mike.

2150
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:48,335
- Mike, don't.
- All right.

2151
02:02:48,435 --> 02:02:49,872
- See you down there.
- [all] Mike!

2152
02:02:49,972 --> 02:02:51,020
Wait! [stammers]

2153
02:02:57,194 --> 02:02:59,462
- Stay together.
- Okay.

2154
02:03:02,565 --> 02:03:03,800
You guys,
I can't do it.

2155
02:03:05,903 --> 02:03:08,020
I can't.
You saw what happened up there.

2156
02:03:08,121 --> 02:03:10,157
I was gonna
let you die.

2157
02:03:10,256 --> 02:03:12,125
I just flaping
froze up.

2158
02:03:12,225 --> 02:03:14,228
If you let me go
down there with you,

2159
02:03:14,328 --> 02:03:16,164
I'm gonna get us all killed.
[inhales deeply]

2160
02:03:16,265 --> 02:03:17,422
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

2161
02:03:17,523 --> 02:03:18,560
- Give me that.
- Richie.

2162
02:03:18,661 --> 02:03:19,765
Let go,
you little turd.

2163
02:03:19,864 --> 02:03:21,601
- Just let me get...
- [inhaler spraying]

2164
02:03:21,702 --> 02:03:22,935
[inhales deeply]

2165
02:03:23,036 --> 02:03:24,220
- I got it.
- Stop.

2166
02:03:24,954 --> 02:03:26,472
Listen to me.

2167
02:03:26,573 --> 02:03:28,108
You had a moment.
Fine.

2168
02:03:28,207 --> 02:03:30,994
But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?

2169
02:03:32,529 --> 02:03:33,529
Me.

2170
02:03:33,747 --> 02:03:35,024
Who stabbed Bowers
with a knife

2171
02:03:35,125 --> 02:03:36,363
he pulled out
of his own face?

2172
02:03:36,462 --> 02:03:37,462
Also me.

2173
02:03:37,561 --> 02:03:39,480
Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?

2174
02:03:41,804 --> 02:03:43,407
- Me.
- Yeah.

2175
02:03:46,443 --> 02:03:48,828
You're braver
than you think.

2176
02:03:48,927 --> 02:03:50,113
All right.
Thanks, Rich.

2177
02:03:51,047 --> 02:03:53,082
- Ow.
- Sorry.

2178
02:03:55,586 --> 02:03:56,703
[Beverly] Hey.
Here.

2179
02:03:56,802 --> 02:03:57,837
Take it.

2180
02:03:57,938 --> 02:03:59,822
It kills monsters.

2181
02:04:01,823 --> 02:04:04,043
- Does it?
- Yeah.

2182
02:04:04,144 --> 02:04:05,795
If you believe
it does.

2183
02:04:07,363 --> 02:04:08,431
Thanks, Bev.

2184
02:04:26,649 --> 02:04:27,807
[Mike echoing] You guys good?

2185
02:04:27,908 --> 02:04:29,118
[Bill] Yeah.

2186
02:04:33,657 --> 02:04:34,740
Can you get through that?

2187
02:04:34,841 --> 02:04:36,279
[Mike] It's the only way.
This way.

2188
02:04:36,378 --> 02:04:37,493
It's in here!

2189
02:04:41,431 --> 02:04:42,548
Through here.

2190
02:04:42,649 --> 02:04:44,534
It's tight,
but we can get through.

2191
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:01,952
This is where It hid.

2192
02:05:22,538 --> 02:05:26,859
So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?

2193
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,761
Not forever.

2194
02:05:28,862 --> 02:05:30,279
Just a few million years.

2195
02:06:06,216 --> 02:06:09,301
It can only be
attacked in its true form.

2196
02:06:09,402 --> 02:06:10,600
The ritual
will show us that.

2197
02:06:10,699 --> 02:06:12,139
And what is
It's true form?

2198
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:14,039
I hope it's a puppy.

2199
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:16,409
Like a Pomeranian or...

2200
02:06:16,510 --> 02:06:17,510
I'll shut up.

2201
02:06:18,494 --> 02:06:19,529
It's light.

2202
02:06:23,367 --> 02:06:25,435
A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.

2203
02:06:38,614 --> 02:06:39,615
Your artifacts.

2204
02:06:41,217 --> 02:06:43,369
Place them in the fire.

2205
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:45,521
The past must
burn with the present.

2206
02:06:53,963 --> 02:06:57,234
This is the boat
that I built

2207
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:01,171
with Georgie.

2208
02:07:05,775 --> 02:07:08,045
[Eddie] It's my inhaler.

2209
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:12,282
[inhales deeply]

2210
02:07:13,283 --> 02:07:14,451
Come on, dude.

2211
02:07:17,054 --> 02:07:19,288
Something that
I wish I had held on to.

2212
02:07:24,962 --> 02:07:27,849
This is a page
from my yearbook.

2213
02:07:27,948 --> 02:07:30,516
That only
one person signed.

2214
02:07:30,617 --> 02:07:33,921
I probably should
have forgotten it,

2215
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:36,472
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet

2216
02:07:38,274 --> 02:07:39,775
for 27 years.

2217
02:07:46,082 --> 02:07:47,761
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

2218
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,978
- You brought an actual token?
- [Richie] Yeah, man.

2219
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:51,875
That's what we were supposed to
do, asshole.

2220
02:07:51,975 --> 02:07:54,251
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

2221
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:55,788
Yeah, but so is your
inhaler, dude.

2222
02:07:55,889 --> 02:07:56,889
Guys, come on.

2223
02:07:56,988 --> 02:07:59,067
All the toxic fumes and
the plastic and shooot, so...

2224
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:01,731
Look closely, Bev.

2225
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:05,085
You see it?

2226
02:08:05,185 --> 02:08:06,603
That's where
you hit Bowers.

2227
02:08:08,604 --> 02:08:09,605
The rock fight.

2228
02:08:12,109 --> 02:08:14,043
The day these bonds were forged.

2229
02:08:15,012 --> 02:08:16,512
That's not
gonna burn, either.

2230
02:08:22,051 --> 02:08:23,252
Oh, wait.

2231
02:08:26,657 --> 02:08:28,158
Couldn't forget
about Stan,

2232
02:08:28,893 --> 02:08:30,092
again.

2233
02:08:35,131 --> 02:08:36,750
[Mike] Okay.

2234
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:37,850
Grab hands.

2235
02:08:39,536 --> 02:08:40,570
Come on.

2236
02:08:48,177 --> 02:08:50,262
The Ritual of Chud.

2237
02:08:50,363 --> 02:08:53,132
It's a battle of wills.

2238
02:08:53,233 --> 02:08:55,668
The first step
was our reunion.

2239
02:08:55,769 --> 02:08:59,555
The second was
the gathering of tokens.

2240
02:09:01,425 --> 02:09:03,460
This is the final step.

2241
02:09:06,296 --> 02:09:07,497
What the...

2242
02:09:16,238 --> 02:09:17,858
flap is that?

2243
02:09:17,957 --> 02:09:19,914
- [Mike] Don't look at them!
- [Eddie] Are those

2244
02:09:20,015 --> 02:09:21,532
- the Deadlights?
- Don't look at it!

2245
02:09:21,631 --> 02:09:22,631
Okay.

2246
02:09:22,796 --> 02:09:24,872
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

2247
02:09:24,971 --> 02:09:26,170
- [Eddie] Say what?
- Say it!

2248
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:27,600
[all] Turn light
into dark.

2249
02:09:27,701 --> 02:09:29,502
[Mike chanting
in native language]

2250
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:31,279
[others in English]
Turn light into dark.

2251
02:09:31,378 --> 02:09:32,773
Turn light
into dark.

2252
02:09:32,872 --> 02:09:34,474
Turn light
into dark.

2253
02:09:34,573 --> 02:09:36,171
[continues chanting
in native language]

2254
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:38,362
[others chanting in English]
Turn light into dark.

2255
02:09:50,942 --> 02:09:53,292
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

2256
02:09:53,393 --> 02:09:54,996
Keep chanting!

2257
02:09:55,095 --> 02:09:56,261
Turn light
into dark.

2258
02:09:56,362 --> 02:09:57,931
[Mike chanting
in native language]

2259
02:09:58,032 --> 02:09:59,365
[others chanting in English]

2260
02:09:59,466 --> 02:10:01,902
Turn light
into dark!

2261
02:10:02,002 --> 02:10:03,837
Turn light
into dark!

2262
02:10:03,938 --> 02:10:06,640
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

2263
02:10:06,739 --> 02:10:08,657
- [Mike] Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

2264
02:10:08,756 --> 02:10:10,673
- [Mike] Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

2265
02:10:10,774 --> 02:10:12,171
[Mike chanting
in native language]

2266
02:10:14,032 --> 02:10:16,109
[Eddie] Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

2267
02:10:16,208 --> 02:10:17,367
Is it working?
Did we do it?

2268
02:10:17,466 --> 02:10:18,652
[box creaking]

2269
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:20,720
[Mike grunting]

2270
02:10:20,819 --> 02:10:22,221
What is this?
Is this part of it?

2271
02:10:22,322 --> 02:10:23,918
Mike, is this supposed
to be happening?

2272
02:10:24,019 --> 02:10:25,817
- [Eddie] What? No, no, no.
- Keep chanting!

2273
02:10:25,917 --> 02:10:26,917
- What?
- Keep chanting!

2274
02:10:27,015 --> 02:10:28,015
Turn light
into dark!

2275
02:10:28,114 --> 02:10:29,512
- Turn light into dark.
- Come on!

2276
02:10:29,613 --> 02:10:32,164
[all] Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

2277
02:10:32,265 --> 02:10:33,550
- [whimpering]
- Whoa!

2278
02:10:35,252 --> 02:10:36,453
[gasps]

2279
02:10:38,021 --> 02:10:39,305
Hey! Hey!

2280
02:10:39,404 --> 02:10:40,724
[all yelping]

2281
02:10:43,793 --> 02:10:44,793
shooot!

2282
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:50,667
Move, move!
Whoa!

2283
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:55,320
[groans]

2284
02:10:55,421 --> 02:10:57,261
- [high-pitched ringing]
- [muffled shouting]

2285
02:10:58,841 --> 02:11:00,641
Bev. Bev.

2286
02:11:01,912 --> 02:11:04,430
- [Beverly] Richie.
- [Richie] Are you okay?

2287
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:05,966
- I can't hear shooot.
- He's okay.

2288
02:11:06,065 --> 02:11:08,222
- [Bill] Are you all right?
- [Ben] Yeah. No, no, no.

2289
02:11:08,323 --> 02:11:10,079
- [Eddie] Wait, where's Mike?
- [Ben] Mike!

2290
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:11,180
[men] Mike!

2291
02:11:11,279 --> 02:11:12,636
- I'm here!
- [Richie] Hey, guys.

2292
02:11:12,737 --> 02:11:14,654
Did we do it? Did we do it?
Yeah? Did we do it?

2293
02:11:14,753 --> 02:11:16,390
[Richie] We put the
tokens in the thing.

2294
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:17,490
That's good, right?

2295
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:19,179
[Eddie] We did it, right?

2296
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:21,114
[all exclaim in fear]

2297
02:11:21,215 --> 02:11:22,614
shooot! shooot!

2298
02:11:22,715 --> 02:11:25,752
Oh, did it work, Mikey?
Did it work?

2299
02:11:25,851 --> 02:11:27,753
[Pennywise laughing]

2300
02:11:27,854 --> 02:11:31,373
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

2301
02:11:32,609 --> 02:11:34,359
Tell them
it's all just a...

2302
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:36,229
What's the word, Eds?

2303
02:11:36,328 --> 02:11:37,581
Gazebo?

2304
02:11:38,849 --> 02:11:40,466
Mike, what's
he talking about?

2305
02:11:40,567 --> 02:11:41,717
[stuttering] Mikey?

2306
02:11:43,252 --> 02:11:48,007
Oh, Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, did you?

2307
02:11:48,108 --> 02:11:49,475
[Pennywise laughing]

2308
02:11:49,576 --> 02:11:50,978
Didn't want them to know

2309
02:11:51,078 --> 02:11:53,980
what actually happened to
the poor Shokopiwah?

2310
02:11:54,081 --> 02:11:56,332
- Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
- [rumbling]

2311
02:11:58,635 --> 02:12:00,337
[Shokopiwah screaming]

2312
02:12:04,841 --> 02:12:07,094
flap, Mikey.
You lied to us, again?

2313
02:12:07,194 --> 02:12:10,296
[stammering] No,
but they didn't believe!

2314
02:12:10,395 --> 02:12:11,993
They didn't believe
they could kill It!

2315
02:12:12,094 --> 02:12:13,572
That's why it didn't
work back then!

2316
02:12:13,671 --> 02:12:15,029
Are you flaping kidding
me, Mike?

2317
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:16,130
- We hurt him.
- flap!

2318
02:12:16,229 --> 02:12:17,537
[Bill] flap you, Mikey.

2319
02:12:17,636 --> 02:12:20,640
I needed something,
anything, for us to remember.

2320
02:12:20,739 --> 02:12:22,208
Anything for us
to believe!

2321
02:12:22,309 --> 02:12:23,376
- God damn it!
- flap!

2322
02:12:23,475 --> 02:12:24,828
[Pennywise laughing]

2323
02:12:29,934 --> 02:12:31,301
[all screaming]

2324
02:12:32,402 --> 02:12:33,453
[Beverly] The Deadlights!

2325
02:12:33,552 --> 02:12:34,889
Don't look at them!

2326
02:12:34,988 --> 02:12:35,988
[groans]

2327
02:12:39,944 --> 02:12:41,545
For 27 years,

2328
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:45,949
I dreamt of you.
[laughing]

2329
02:12:47,185 --> 02:12:49,469
I craved you.

2330
02:12:49,569 --> 02:12:52,139
Oh, I've
missed you! [laughs]

2331
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:54,140
Mike! Move back!

2332
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:58,310
Waiting for
this very moment.

2333
02:12:58,411 --> 02:13:00,881
Mikey!
You gotta move, Mikey!

2334
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:03,217
- Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
- [Eddie] Mike, come on, man!

2335
02:13:03,318 --> 02:13:04,318
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2336
02:13:04,417 --> 02:13:06,603
Time to float!

2337
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:09,122
[all gasp]

2338
02:13:09,222 --> 02:13:10,739
- Oh, shooot!
- Sorry.

2339
02:13:12,909 --> 02:13:14,627
[Eddie] Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

2340
02:13:14,726 --> 02:13:16,496
- [Bill] Go, go!
- [Eddie] Run!

2341
02:13:16,595 --> 02:13:18,899
- Oh, shooot!
- [Bill] Run! Go, go, go!

2342
02:13:18,998 --> 02:13:20,550
[snarling]

2343
02:13:29,226 --> 02:13:30,659
Go, go, go!

2344
02:13:34,865 --> 02:13:35,865
Go!

2345
02:13:49,113 --> 02:13:50,613
[Ben] Go, go, go!

2346
02:13:54,952 --> 02:13:55,952
Where'd he go?

2347
02:13:56,051 --> 02:13:57,451
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

2348
02:14:10,466 --> 02:14:11,867
[gasps]

2349
02:14:12,019 --> 02:14:13,019
[coughing]

2350
02:14:18,841 --> 02:14:20,476
- Oh, shooot!
- [yelps] Can he see us?

2351
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:22,829
- [both screaming]
- Oh, my God!

2352
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:23,980
[Eddie] shooot.

2353
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,431
Oh, shooot.

2354
02:14:26,532 --> 02:14:28,600
[Richie] Holy shooot!
Holy shooot! Run!

2355
02:14:28,701 --> 02:14:30,170
[Eddie] Oh, shooot!

2356
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:31,771
[both gasp]

2357
02:14:31,872 --> 02:14:33,792
[Richie] shooot.
You gotta be flaping kidding me.

2358
02:14:39,628 --> 02:14:40,814
We're trapped.

2359
02:14:40,913 --> 02:14:42,666
- Where do we go?
- [rumbling]

2360
02:14:47,171 --> 02:14:49,073
[both screaming]

2361
02:14:53,475 --> 02:14:54,962
[grunting]

2362
02:14:55,061 --> 02:14:56,061
[gasps]

2363
02:14:58,149 --> 02:14:59,934
[screaming]

2364
02:15:00,033 --> 02:15:01,650
[groaning]

2365
02:15:03,887 --> 02:15:05,622
[yelping]

2366
02:15:11,661 --> 02:15:13,645
- [Eddie] God damn it!
- [Richie] Uh...

2367
02:15:13,746 --> 02:15:15,916
All right.
"Not Scary At All." All right?

2368
02:15:16,015 --> 02:15:17,015
No, no, no.

2369
02:15:17,114 --> 02:15:18,583
- [stammering]
- Wait. Why?

2370
02:15:18,684 --> 02:15:20,420
They're flipped.
He's flaping with us.

2371
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,654
- Are you sure? Positive?
- Trust me.

2372
02:15:22,755 --> 02:15:24,041
- Yes!
- Okay.

2373
02:15:28,645 --> 02:15:29,880
[woman] Where's my shoe?

2374
02:15:36,854 --> 02:15:38,154
[woman tap dancing]

2375
02:15:38,956 --> 02:15:40,173
[woman laughing]

2376
02:15:40,274 --> 02:15:42,675
[Eddie and Richie screaming]

2377
02:15:42,774 --> 02:15:45,045
What the flap?
You told me to trust you!

2378
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:46,563
[screaming continues]

2379
02:15:47,398 --> 02:15:48,547
He's not
flaping with us.

2380
02:15:48,648 --> 02:15:49,926
Let's go to
"Not Scary At All."

2381
02:15:50,025 --> 02:15:51,135
Okay. [breathing heavily]

2382
02:15:57,041 --> 02:15:59,025
It's all right.
Let's go.

2383
02:15:59,126 --> 02:16:00,126
[panting]

2384
02:16:01,311 --> 02:16:02,947
Oh, shooot.

2385
02:16:05,115 --> 02:16:06,899
No way am I falling
for this shooot again.

2386
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,403
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a flaping monster.

2387
02:16:09,502 --> 02:16:10,703
Richie, make it sit.

2388
02:16:10,802 --> 02:16:13,289
I know your moves,
you little bitch.

2389
02:16:15,926 --> 02:16:16,926
Rich?

2390
02:16:17,627 --> 02:16:18,945
It's gone, man.

2391
02:16:19,046 --> 02:16:20,413
- Yeah. Wait.
- Oh. Okay.

2392
02:16:20,514 --> 02:16:21,514
Okay.

2393
02:16:23,266 --> 02:16:24,266
Sit.

2394
02:16:25,435 --> 02:16:26,920
[Eddie] He did it.

2395
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:28,354
Oh, that's cute.

2396
02:16:28,454 --> 02:16:30,492
- That's a good boy.
- That's actually super cute.

2397
02:16:30,591 --> 02:16:31,591
That's a good boy.

2398
02:16:31,690 --> 02:16:33,407
- Are you a good boy?
- [Richie] Good boy.

2399
02:16:33,507 --> 02:16:34,912
- [snarling]
- [both screaming]

2400
02:16:38,014 --> 02:16:39,014
shooot!

2401
02:16:39,365 --> 02:16:41,283
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

2402
02:16:41,384 --> 02:16:42,652
Next time?

2403
02:16:55,165 --> 02:16:58,135
[Georgie] I lost it,
Billy.

2404
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:02,173
It just floated off.

2405
02:17:04,841 --> 02:17:07,610
[stuttering]
I'm not mad at you.

2406
02:17:09,013 --> 02:17:11,747
It's your fault what
happened, isn't it?

2407
02:17:14,084 --> 02:17:18,121
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

2408
02:17:19,489 --> 02:17:20,489
No.

2409
02:17:22,625 --> 02:17:25,611
I just pretended

2410
02:17:25,710 --> 02:17:28,099
because I didn't want to
play with you.

2411
02:17:31,534 --> 02:17:33,370
I just didn't want to.

2412
02:17:34,572 --> 02:17:37,174
You lied and I died.

2413
02:17:37,941 --> 02:17:41,528
You lied and I died.

2414
02:17:41,628 --> 02:17:44,564
You lied and I died!

2415
02:17:44,664 --> 02:17:47,433
You lied and I died!

2416
02:17:47,533 --> 02:17:49,403
You lied and I died!

2417
02:17:49,503 --> 02:17:51,736
It happened because of
me, Georgie. Me.

2418
02:17:51,836 --> 02:17:53,324
No, no, no.
It was...

2419
02:18:01,531 --> 02:18:02,582
Lied and died!

2420
02:18:02,682 --> 02:18:04,550
- [yelps]
- Lied and died!

2421
02:18:04,650 --> 02:18:06,386
Lied and died!

2422
02:18:06,486 --> 02:18:08,522
[muffled]
You lied and I died!

2423
02:18:08,621 --> 02:18:10,123
[breathing heavily]

2424
02:18:10,224 --> 02:18:11,640
[suffocating]

2425
02:18:23,486 --> 02:18:24,988
[exhales shakily]

2426
02:18:27,591 --> 02:18:29,260
[pounding on door]

2427
02:18:39,202 --> 02:18:40,602
[yelps]

2428
02:18:40,921 --> 02:18:43,824
You in there, you little shooot?
I can smell you.

2429
02:18:43,924 --> 02:18:46,343
[sniffs] You smell
just like Lois Lane.

2430
02:18:47,378 --> 02:18:48,529
Here's Johnny!

2431
02:18:48,629 --> 02:18:50,047
[voices chattering loudly]

2432
02:18:53,782 --> 02:18:55,817
[voice laughing sinisterly]

2433
02:19:03,293 --> 02:19:05,429

2437
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:18,808
[continues screaming]

2438
02:19:28,751 --> 02:19:30,404
All that success,

2439
02:19:30,504 --> 02:19:31,871
all those sit-ups,

2440
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:33,772
but deep down,
still just

2441
02:19:33,872 --> 02:19:36,775
a little fat, fat,
fatty loser...

2442
02:19:36,876 --> 02:19:38,145
[Pennywise laughing]

2443
02:19:38,245 --> 02:19:41,831
...who always knew
he would die alone.

2444
02:19:43,533 --> 02:19:45,068
[screaming]

2445
02:19:46,302 --> 02:19:47,304
[hissing]

2446
02:19:48,471 --> 02:19:50,591
- Slut!

[screaming]

2448
02:19:53,576 --> 02:19:54,810
Beverly!

2449
02:19:55,412 --> 02:19:56,811
Bevvie.

2450
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:59,699
Just open up the door for
me, okay?

2451
02:19:59,799 --> 02:20:01,700
Beverly,
can you hear me?

2452
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:03,370
[grunting]

2453
02:20:03,469 --> 02:20:05,737
Come to Daddy, now.

2454
02:20:05,837 --> 02:20:07,074
Bev, don't listen!

2455
02:20:07,174 --> 02:20:08,174
[yelps]

2456
02:20:08,790 --> 02:20:09,790
Bev!

2457
02:20:11,227 --> 02:20:13,212
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2458
02:20:13,313 --> 02:20:14,981
[gasping]

2459
02:20:15,082 --> 02:20:16,899
Beverly, I love you!

2460
02:20:17,868 --> 02:20:18,868
Ben!

2461
02:20:19,218 --> 02:20:21,587
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2462
02:20:21,688 --> 02:20:23,522
Are you still
my little girl?

2463
02:20:23,622 --> 02:20:24,625
Not anymore!

2465
02:20:27,809 --> 02:20:29,828
[Mr. Marsh] You little...

"Your hair
is winter fire.

[shouting]

2472
02:20:43,409 --> 02:20:44,409
No!

2473
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:48,565
[Ben screaming]

2474
02:20:50,799 --> 02:20:51,799
Ben!

2475
02:20:52,152 --> 02:20:54,504

[Ben gasping]

2478
02:21:16,627 --> 02:21:17,927
"January embers."

2479
02:21:19,729 --> 02:21:21,565
"My heart
burns there, too."

2480
02:21:23,433 --> 02:21:24,902
It was you.

2481
02:21:27,671 --> 02:21:29,138
[Pennywise whooping]

2482
02:21:39,849 --> 02:21:41,434
We deserve to die.

2483
02:21:41,534 --> 02:21:42,534
No.

2484
02:21:43,068 --> 02:21:47,174
You were the best big brother
there ever [stuttering] was.

2485
02:21:47,273 --> 02:21:50,010
No! We killed
our little brother!

2486
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:51,477
[Bill shushing]

2487
02:21:51,577 --> 02:21:53,313
He loved you.

2488
02:21:53,413 --> 02:21:55,049
And just because
you didn't want to play

2489
02:21:55,149 --> 02:21:56,367
on a rainy day,

2490
02:21:57,533 --> 02:21:59,202
just one time,

2491
02:22:01,572 --> 02:22:03,574
that does not
make it our fault.

- Miss me?
- [gasps]

2503
02:23:04,534 --> 02:23:06,286
I know what you are.

2504
02:23:06,386 --> 02:23:07,671
That's why
I'm not afraid.

Well, I know
what you are.

2508
02:23:18,549 --> 02:23:20,083
A madman.

You wanna play
Truth or Dare?

2514

Here's a truth.

2515

You're a sloppy bitch!

2516
02:23:39,286 --> 02:23:40,352
Yeah, that's right!

2517

[gasps]

2519
02:24:16,206 --> 02:24:18,475
This kills monsters.

If you believe it does.

2521
02:24:21,427 --> 02:24:23,212

I got him, man!

[labored breathing]

2563
02:26:22,165 --> 02:26:24,501
Come out
and play, Losers!

2564
02:26:26,004 --> 02:26:27,453
He's hurt.
He's hurt really bad.

2565
02:26:27,554 --> 02:26:28,822
We gotta
get him out of here.

2566
02:26:28,922 --> 02:26:30,522
How are we supposed
to do that, Richie?

2567
02:26:34,144 --> 02:26:35,745
I almost killed It.

2568
02:26:37,048 --> 02:26:38,247
The leper.

2569
02:26:39,148 --> 02:26:41,300
My hands
around his throat.

2570
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:43,586
And I could feel
him choking.

2571
02:26:44,956 --> 02:26:46,756
I made him small.

2572
02:26:52,095 --> 02:26:53,329
He seemed so weak.

2573
02:26:56,165 --> 02:26:57,768
He seemed so weak.

2574
02:26:58,735 --> 02:26:59,770
The Shokopiwah.

2575
02:27:01,405 --> 02:27:02,689
All living things
must abide by

2576
02:27:02,789 --> 02:27:04,273
the laws of the shape
they inhabit.

2577
02:27:05,274 --> 02:27:06,793
[Ben] Guys!

2578
02:27:06,894 --> 02:27:08,945
There's a passageway.
Through here.

2579
02:27:10,246 --> 02:27:12,332
The tunnel.

2580
02:27:12,432 --> 02:27:14,334
Pennywise has to
make himself small

2581
02:27:14,433 --> 02:27:17,504
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2582
02:27:17,603 --> 02:27:19,322
Okay, so, if we can get back
there, we can

2583
02:27:19,422 --> 02:27:21,108
- force him down to size.
- Yeah.

2584
02:27:21,208 --> 02:27:24,394
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2585
02:27:26,563 --> 02:27:29,916
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

2586
02:27:30,016 --> 02:27:31,384
[Pennywise laughing]

2587
02:27:31,484 --> 02:27:33,452
- Let's go! Go!
- [Ben] Come on! Come on!

2588
02:27:33,552 --> 02:27:35,337
It's tight. It's tight.
Be careful!

2589
02:27:49,552 --> 02:27:52,856
I need a little rest.
Oh, thanks. [groaning]

2590
02:27:54,024 --> 02:27:55,024
Hey.

2591
02:27:55,708 --> 02:27:56,709
Hey, Richie?

2592
02:27:56,809 --> 02:27:58,045
I gotta
tell you something.

2593
02:27:58,145 --> 02:27:59,729
What?
What's up, buddy?

2594
02:28:02,899 --> 02:28:03,900
I fucked your mother.

2595
02:28:06,369 --> 02:28:08,369
[laughing]

2596
02:28:08,521 --> 02:28:10,340
[Pennywise] Losers out!
[laughing]

2597
02:28:13,144 --> 02:28:14,343
[Bill] Go. Go!

2598
02:28:17,613 --> 02:28:18,614

[Pennywise whoops]

2601
02:28:25,422 --> 02:28:26,622
Gotcha!

2602
02:28:27,924 --> 02:28:28,924
Whoa!

2603
02:28:29,575 --> 02:28:32,879
You filthy little children.

2604
02:28:32,979 --> 02:28:34,547
[laughs]

2605
02:28:34,647 --> 02:28:36,683
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2606
02:28:36,783 --> 02:28:37,941
You die.
That's what you do.

2607
02:28:38,834 --> 02:28:40,004
[Ben] Mike?

2608
02:28:42,605 --> 02:28:44,566
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2609
02:28:46,675 --> 02:28:47,675
Oh!

2610
02:28:47,774 --> 02:28:49,763
Make him
believe that he is.

2611
02:28:49,862 --> 02:28:51,860
- [stutters] What?
- Make him believe that he is.

2612
02:28:51,959 --> 02:28:55,317
Oh? Me?
Small? [laughs]

2613
02:28:56,352 --> 02:28:59,405
I am
the Eater of Worlds.

2614
02:28:59,504 --> 02:29:00,690
Not to us,
you're not.

2615
02:29:03,425 --> 02:29:04,827
You're just a clown.

2616
02:29:09,066 --> 02:29:10,066
[growling]

2617
02:29:10,165 --> 02:29:11,501
You're a weak old woman.

02:29:14,336 --> 02:29:16,990
The Eater of Worlds.

2619
02:29:17,091 --> 02:29:18,441
A headless boy!

2620
02:29:20,343 --> 02:29:21,828
Impostor!

[snarling]

2622
02:29:23,329 --> 02:29:24,781
You're a mimic!

2623
02:29:27,050 --> 02:29:28,650
A mimic!

2624
02:29:28,768 --> 02:29:31,570
You're a flaping bully!

A clown!
A dumb flaping clown!

You're a clown!

02:30:18,434 --> 02:30:20,420
[Ben] Clown!

2646
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:23,090
- Clown!
- You're just a clown! Clown!

2647
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:25,860
- I am the Eater of Worlds!
- [Ben and Bill] A clown!

2648
02:30:25,959 --> 02:30:27,397
- [Pennywise snarls]
- [Bill] Whoa!

2649
02:30:27,497 --> 02:30:29,578
[losers chanting]
A clown! A clown!

2650
02:30:30,181 --> 02:30:31,564
[screaming]

2651
02:30:31,664 --> 02:30:33,968
[Mike] No one's
afraid of you.

2652
02:30:34,067 --> 02:30:35,485
No one's scared of you.

2653
02:30:37,087 --> 02:30:39,388
[losers] Clown! Clown!

2654
02:30:40,389 --> 02:30:44,077
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2655
02:30:44,177 --> 02:30:45,762
[moaning]

2656
02:30:46,529 --> 02:30:48,698
- Clown.
- Clown.

2657
02:30:50,902 --> 02:30:52,502
A clown.

2658
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,922
With a scared,
beating heart.

2659
02:30:55,022 --> 02:30:56,605
[whimpering]

2660
02:30:59,075 --> 02:31:00,709
[heart beating]

2661
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:06,415
- [snarls]
- [yelps]

2662
02:31:10,452 --> 02:31:12,122
- [whining]
- [heart continues beating]

2663
02:31:17,426 --> 02:31:19,195
[screaming]

2664
02:31:42,519 --> 02:31:44,888
Look at you.

2665
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:50,290
You're all grown up.

2666
02:31:53,363 --> 02:31:54,730
[laughing]

2667
02:31:58,269 --> 02:31:59,769
[wheezing]

2668
02:32:15,684 --> 02:32:17,620
[dying breath]

2669
02:32:54,492 --> 02:32:55,725
Eddie. Eddie.

2670
02:32:59,397 --> 02:33:01,564
Eddie.
We got Pennywise, man.

2671
02:33:03,665 --> 02:33:04,869
Eddie?

2672
02:33:15,345 --> 02:33:16,712
- [crying]
- [rumbling]

2673
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:18,882
[Beverly] Richie.

2674
02:33:19,516 --> 02:33:20,733
He's gone.

2675
02:33:20,833 --> 02:33:22,271
He's all right.
No, he's just hurt.

2676
02:33:22,370 --> 02:33:24,637
We gotta get him outta here.
He's hurt. Ben.

2677
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:26,574
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2678
02:33:26,674 --> 02:33:27,674
Bev.

2679
02:33:28,225 --> 02:33:29,691
Richie. [sniffles]

2680
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:33,430
What?

2681
02:33:33,813 --> 02:33:35,731
Honey, he's dead.

2682
02:33:39,102 --> 02:33:41,320
We have to go. Come on.
Come on, Richie.

2683
02:33:41,421 --> 02:33:42,956
We gotta go.

2684
02:33:43,056 --> 02:33:45,136
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- [rumbling intensifies]

2685
02:33:48,611 --> 02:33:50,009
[Ben] Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2686
02:33:50,109 --> 02:33:51,832
- [Bill] Got it.
- [all urging]

2687
02:33:51,932 --> 02:33:54,650
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2688
02:33:55,652 --> 02:33:56,802
[Ben] Go! Go! Get up!

2689
02:33:56,903 --> 02:33:59,090
Guys, we can
still help him!

2690
02:34:10,799 --> 02:34:12,870
[Richie] No! Eddie!

2691
02:34:13,304 --> 02:34:14,504
Eddie!

2692
02:34:19,075 --> 02:34:20,277
[Mike] Come on!
Let's go!

2693
02:34:25,316 --> 02:34:26,316
Come on! Let's go!

2694
02:34:29,253 --> 02:34:30,254
Move, move!

2695
02:34:36,626 --> 02:34:38,444
- Move, move!
- [Beverly] Run!

2696
02:34:38,545 --> 02:34:39,728
[Mike] Run!

2697
02:34:48,371 --> 02:34:49,806
[all yelping]

2698
02:34:53,709 --> 02:34:55,129
- Eddie!
- No, no, no!

2699
02:34:55,228 --> 02:34:56,228
Eddie!

2700
02:34:57,948 --> 02:35:00,299
We gotta get in there
and get him!

2701
02:35:00,399 --> 02:35:02,051
He's still in there!

2702
02:35:12,694 --> 02:35:13,895
Eddie!

2703
02:35:14,565 --> 02:35:15,764
Eddie!

2704
02:36:15,525 --> 02:36:16,943
[Ben] You know what?

2705
02:36:17,043 --> 02:36:20,180
Eddie would have
hated this, guys.

2706
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:23,350
What? Cleaning ourselves
in dirty water?

2707
02:36:23,450 --> 02:36:24,450
Yeah.

2708
02:36:24,985 --> 02:36:27,686
He'd be telling us we'd get
streptococcal something.

2709
02:36:27,787 --> 02:36:29,923
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

2710
02:36:30,022 --> 02:36:31,661
But he would have
made us laugh, though.

2711
02:36:31,761 --> 02:36:33,025
Oh, yeah.

2712
02:36:33,126 --> 02:36:35,078
He'd be
looking out for us.

2713
02:36:36,813 --> 02:36:38,847
The way he always was.

2714
02:36:42,719 --> 02:36:44,504
Ain't that right, Richie?

2715
02:36:44,603 --> 02:36:45,788
[sobbing]

2716
02:36:47,091 --> 02:36:48,091
Hey.

2717
02:37:18,788 --> 02:37:19,788
Oh.

2718
02:37:20,724 --> 02:37:21,808
Thank you.

2719
02:37:21,907 --> 02:37:23,477
I don't have
my glasses on,

2720
02:37:23,576 --> 02:37:25,612
so I don't know who you people
are, but thank you.

2721
02:37:25,712 --> 02:37:26,712
[all laughing]

2722
02:37:27,797 --> 02:37:29,415
I legit
can't find my glasses.

2723
02:37:29,515 --> 02:37:30,717
You're serious?

2724
02:37:30,816 --> 02:37:32,119
- Glasses?
- Go that way.

2725
02:37:32,218 --> 02:37:33,802
Around here somewhere?

2726
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:41,646
- I can't see them.
- Oh, I see them. Right there.

2727
02:37:41,745 --> 02:37:43,629
- Where?
- Look. Right...

2728
02:37:43,729 --> 02:37:45,114
If you just go, like...

2729
02:37:45,882 --> 02:37:47,317
Anybody have any luck?

2730
02:38:49,445 --> 02:38:50,447
Hey, guys.

2731
02:38:52,316 --> 02:38:53,316
Look.

2732
02:39:02,993 --> 02:39:04,528
Nothing lasts forever.

2733
02:39:24,948 --> 02:39:26,649
I can't go home
like this, guys.

2734
02:39:27,518 --> 02:39:28,667
My mom will kill me.

2735
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:31,103
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2736
02:39:31,203 --> 02:39:33,372
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2737
02:39:33,472 --> 02:39:36,009
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2738
02:39:36,109 --> 02:39:37,586
[Young Beverly]
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2739
02:39:37,686 --> 02:39:39,203
Okay, first of all,
my mom's slippers

2740
02:39:39,304 --> 02:39:40,746
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2741
02:39:40,846 --> 02:39:42,281
No, they don't.

2742
02:39:42,381 --> 02:39:44,139
Yes, they do.
And, also, how would you know

2743
02:39:44,239 --> 02:39:45,878
what they smell like
in the first place?

2744
02:39:45,977 --> 02:39:47,575
[Young Mike] Can we
just keep it quiet,

2745
02:39:47,675 --> 02:39:48,754
please,
until we get home?

2746
02:39:48,853 --> 02:39:50,889
[Young Ben] "Potpourri" is
literally a French word

2747
02:39:50,989 --> 02:39:51,989
meaning "rotten pot."

2748
02:39:52,088 --> 02:39:54,447
[Young Richie] I knew there
was something rotten about it.

2749
02:40:06,056 --> 02:40:10,127
- [cell phone ringing]
- [Bill sighs]

2750
02:40:14,096 --> 02:40:16,349
- Mike?
- Hey. [chuckles]

2751
02:40:16,449 --> 02:40:18,618
I just thought
I'd check up on you.

2752
02:40:18,718 --> 02:40:20,195
You know,
just to see if you learned

2753
02:40:20,296 --> 02:40:21,533
how to finish
a book for once.

2754
02:40:21,634 --> 02:40:23,522
[chuckling]

2755
02:40:23,622 --> 02:40:25,408
I just finished
the first chapter.

2756
02:40:27,144 --> 02:40:30,681
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2757
02:40:31,415 --> 02:40:32,415
Good.

2758
02:40:32,513 --> 02:40:34,400
Say, can I ask
you a question?

2759
02:40:34,501 --> 02:40:35,501
Sure.

2760
02:40:37,186 --> 02:40:39,088
Why do you think
we're not forgetting?

2761
02:40:39,989 --> 02:40:41,876
You know, like last time?

2762
02:40:41,976 --> 02:40:43,693
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2763
02:40:46,897 --> 02:40:48,247
Or maybe 'cause
we have more

2764
02:40:48,347 --> 02:40:50,784
we want to remember
than we want to forget.

2765
02:40:50,885 --> 02:40:52,402
I like that one.

2766
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:57,550
You decide
what you want to do?

2767
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:58,725
About leaving Derry?

2768
02:40:58,825 --> 02:41:01,177
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2769
02:41:02,546 --> 02:41:04,113
Just seeing
what It wanted me to.

2770
02:41:07,886 --> 02:41:10,620
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

2771
02:41:11,754 --> 02:41:13,907
Go get it, Mikey.

2772
02:41:14,007 --> 02:41:15,541
Oh, did you get the letter?

2773
02:41:15,641 --> 02:41:16,709
[stammers]

2774
02:41:16,809 --> 02:41:18,077
What letter?

2775
02:41:18,177 --> 02:41:20,915
You'll know
when you see it.

2776
02:41:21,014 --> 02:41:23,049
Well, hold on.
I just got the mail.

2777
02:41:23,148 --> 02:41:24,635
We all got one.

2778
02:41:27,236 --> 02:41:28,471
[Bill] Patricia Uris?

2779
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:30,440
Just...

2780
02:41:31,608 --> 02:41:32,926
Just read it.

2781
02:41:33,027 --> 02:41:34,027
Okay.

2782
02:41:34,193 --> 02:41:36,413
And call me.
Anytime.

2783
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:38,465
I will.

2784
02:41:38,565 --> 02:41:39,615
And, Bill,

2785
02:41:45,254 --> 02:41:47,506
I love you, man.

2786
02:41:47,606 --> 02:41:49,308
I love you, too.

2787
02:41:49,408 --> 02:41:51,762
All right.
See you around.

2788
02:42:18,923 --> 02:42:21,273
[Stanley] Dear Losers,

2789
02:42:21,373 --> 02:42:23,309
I know what this must seem like,

2790
02:42:23,409 --> 02:42:25,194
but this isn't
a suicide note.

2791
02:42:26,965 --> 02:42:30,649
You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.

2792
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:33,753
It's because I knew I was
too scared to go back.

2793
02:42:33,852 --> 02:42:35,823
And if
we weren't together,

2794
02:42:35,923 --> 02:42:39,259
if all of us alive
weren't united,

2795
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:41,560
I knew we'd all die.

2796
02:42:41,661 --> 02:42:46,000
So, I made
the only logical move.

2797
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:47,783
I took myself
off the board.

2798
02:42:50,054 --> 02:42:51,638
Did it work?

2799
02:42:51,737 --> 02:42:53,238
[Stanley sighs]

2800
02:42:53,338 --> 02:42:55,379
Well, if you're reading
this, you know the answer.

2801
02:42:57,693 --> 02:42:59,663
I lived
my whole life afraid.

2802
02:43:01,531 --> 02:43:05,584
Afraid of
what would come next.

2803
02:43:05,684 --> 02:43:07,737
Afraid of what
I might leave behind.

2804
02:43:10,707 --> 02:43:11,742
Don't.

2805
02:43:13,777 --> 02:43:15,879
Be who you want to be.

2806
02:43:17,147 --> 02:43:18,715
Be proud.

2807
02:43:19,449 --> 02:43:21,067
You sleep okay?

2808
02:43:21,167 --> 02:43:22,167
Yeah.

2809
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:25,438
I had a beautiful dream.

2810
02:43:25,538 --> 02:43:28,358
[Stanley] And if you find
someone worth holding on to,

2811
02:43:29,558 --> 02:43:32,429
never ever let them go.

2812
02:43:41,004 --> 02:43:42,673
Follow your own path.

2813
02:43:47,309 --> 02:43:48,811
Wherever that takes you.

2814
02:43:55,352 --> 02:43:58,487
Think of this letter
as a promise.

2815
02:44:01,490 --> 02:44:03,627
[Eddie] A promise
I'm asking you to make.

2816
02:44:04,861 --> 02:44:05,862
[Mike] To me.

2817
02:44:07,097 --> 02:44:08,432
[Ben] To each other.

2818
02:44:10,367 --> 02:44:11,801
[Beverly] An oath.

2819
02:44:15,672 --> 02:44:17,708
[Stanley] See,
the thing about being a Loser

2820
02:44:20,409 --> 02:44:22,478
is you don't have
anything to lose.

2821
02:44:25,148 --> 02:44:26,148
So...

2822
02:44:27,167 --> 02:44:29,069
[Young Richie]
Be true.

2823
02:44:29,170 --> 02:44:30,352
[Young Eddie]
Be brave.

2824
02:44:31,388 --> 02:44:32,588
[Young Mike] Stand.

2825
02:44:33,355 --> 02:44:35,308
[Young Beverly] Believe.

2826
02:44:35,407 --> 02:44:37,693
[Young Bill]
And don't ever forget...

2827
02:44:38,828 --> 02:44:40,297
[Young Stanley]
We're Losers,

2828
02:44:41,565 --> 02:44:43,532
and we always will be.
