1
00:00:00,935 --> 00:00:03,001
(wine pouring)

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,009
(glasses clink)

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,346
(machine whirring)

4
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,626
(film reel ticking)
(lion roaring)

5
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,738
(dark electronic music)

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,555
- No.

7
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,993
(screams)

8
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,001
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,852
Much better than
mother's old sign.

10
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,688
(chuckles)

11
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,933
(dark atmospheric music)

12
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,963
(thunder claps)
(keyboard clacks)

13
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,069
- [Man] She caught him in her
trap, the son of a bastard.

14
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:02,004
All the son of a bitch
could muster in his defense

15
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,489
was a lyric from
better days past.

16
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,877
As the gun muzzle nestled
between his lips, he quivered,

17
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:13,899
saying, "no one knows what it's
like to feel these feelings,

18
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
"like I do.

19
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,673
"And I blame..."

20
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,057
(distant thunder rumbles)

21
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,343
(hums melodically)

22
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,092
- [Woman] Oh, come here,
I'm gonna tickle you.

23
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,829
- Mommy Wolf!
- Am I Mommy Wolf?

24
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:36,048
- And Izzy bear! (laughs)

25
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,283
Hi, my love, how are ya?

26
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,087
You've found a Halloween
mask in the middle of May?

27
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,195
Not bad, did you go with Mommy?

28
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,853
- We went shopping
all day, didn't we?

29
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:48,909
- Come here, Daddy has
to go to work, come here.

30
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,579
I need a hug.

31
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,917
You're the best hugger in
the world, you know that?

32
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,417
(gasps)

33
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,586
- Go wash your
hands, okay, babe?

34
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,687
- I love you!

35
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,427
- Oh. (chuckles)

36
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:07,462
- You're a rock star.
- Yeah, I know.

37
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:08,997
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

38
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,174
- [Man] And uh, you look
kinda sexy with that mask.

39
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:12,352
- You know what's not sexy?

40
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,449
How much my ass hurts from
driving around all day

41
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,572
looking for that stupid thing.

42
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,507
I'm tired, I'm behind
on a deadline--

43
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:21,004
- Hey, you know how important
it is for my students to know

44
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:25,314
that I support the ideas 100%,
so, you saved my ass, again.

45
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,098
I know it won't
be the last time.

46
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,012
- So, did you get
your writing done?

47
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,721
- Yeah, I think I kinda
hit a breakthrough.

48
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm not too happy about
the ending, though.

49
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,694
- Don't all horror
stories end the same way?

50
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,129
(dark atmospheric music)

51
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,314
Kill the monster or
the monster kills you?

52
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,884
- What if you have to
live with the monster?

53
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,288
Oh well, I'll figure it out.
- Okay.

54
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,175
- [Man] Bye.

55
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,192
(moody rock music)

56
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,521
- My test patient's charade
of misconstrued feelings

57
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,956
will lead to
misguided intentions.

58
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,826
Therefore, no matter
how she dolls up now,

59
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:13,762
this will manifest one
day into her actions.

60
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:16,165
The makeup she wears
is merely a mask

61
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:18,567
covering up scars
none of us can see.

62
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,803
If we don't begin to pay
attention and help those types

63
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:25,408
of people before maniacal
thoughts become actions,

64
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:27,225
you might never know
when your worst enemy

65
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,826
could be sitting
right next to you.

66
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,314
Thank you.

67
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:34,165
(class applauds)

68
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,353
- Kinda exhilarating, isn't it?

69
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,423
That feeling you
get behind the mask.

70
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:45,093
That strange freedom
and anonymity,

71
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:48,012
with the power to do
almost anything you want.

72
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,935
Very beautiful imagery, Kara.

73
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,036
Creative.

74
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,973
My one criticism, if you
can even call it that,

75
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,742
is what do we do with the
people who love their masks?

76
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:04,079
Those who refuse to
take 'em off, ever.

77
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,516
Are they worth the time,
money and resources?

78
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,252
- Okay, but the foundation
built on "we, the people" has

79
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,321
been trampled on by the
time-money resource--

80
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,656
- Wah, wah, wah,
wah, liberal alert.

81
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,559
- Okay, but as a democratic
republic, can we let our society

82
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,860
to devolve into a
self-centered existence?

83
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,896
- Okay, can we have some
poll numbers on that?

84
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:23,766
- You know what, maybe my test
patient's some evil genius

85
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:27,185
plotting to kill me and chaos
theory wins again, right?

86
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,322
- Alright, anyways.

87
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,807
Inspiring, very creative.

88
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:33,290
But, is it A+ material?

89
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,396
Show me those thumbs.

90
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,947
Oh! (whistles)

91
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,182
The tribe has spoken.

92
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,918
Salty or sweet,
choose your treat.

93
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,420
- [Kara] Mm, my favorite color.

94
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,290
- Mm, do feel free
to use that lab.

95
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,158
Minimum 1,000 words on
your most vivid memory

96
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,862
of when your maniacal thoughts
didn't become conscious

97
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:56,865
actions and what positive
effect you believe it had

98
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,768
in your young lives.

99
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,819
Make good choices this
week, my pet brains, okay?

100
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,622
See you soon.

101
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,211
That was great.

102
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,028
- So, do you really
think I was inspiring?

103
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,846
- (chuckles) My neurons
are still buzzing.

104
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,449
(Kara chuckles)

105
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,052
- So, I was thinking
about writing a book.

106
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,271
- Oh.
- On my test patient.

107
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,704
You know, a story about
her fucked up story.

108
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,112
Think that'll be something
you could help me with?

109
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,595
- Yeah, I mean, I--
- Perfect.

110
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:26,893
- Well--
- When can we start?

111
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,197
(both chuckle)

112
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,492
- I think you should clear
it with Dean Winters first.

113
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:33,168
- Ew, he's such a creep.

114
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:35,170
(both laugh)

115
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,173
But yes, I totally
ran it by Mr. A.

116
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,350
He actually thought it was
a great idea and thought

117
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,978
you'd be perfect for it.
- Mm-hm.

118
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:44,196
Why don't we just talk
about it next week?

119
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,082
- Next week?

120
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:50,052
You're trying to drive
me crazy, aren't you?

121
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,370
Office hours this
weekend, maybe?

122
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,639
- Uh, no.

123
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,827
- [Kara] Okay, never mind.

124
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:01,124
- Listen, I uh, Christine
told me she explained to you

125
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,466
the whole nanny situation,
I hope she wasn't too--

126
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,067
- Firm, but fair.

127
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,235
Can you please tell her
again how sorry I am?

128
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,137
An idiot, I was--
- Come on, it's okay.

129
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,122
It's water under the bridge.

130
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,192
No harm, no foul.

131
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,610
- No harm, no foul, I like that.

132
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,245
(chuckles)

133
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:18,747
That reminds me.

134
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,432
Make sure you check your email
before you go home tonight.

135
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,704
- Have a good weekend.
- You, too.

136
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,875
(ominous tones)

137
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,994
- All clear from tower three,
about to set the last trap.

138
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,544
Rally at my cabin afterwards?

139
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,269
Earth to Poppy, do
you copy, Poppy?

140
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,770
- Oh, I have a nice
surprise for you, actually.

141
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,241
Seems like a young man has
wandered into the woods alone,

142
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:22,110
and now he's trespassing
without prior authorization.

143
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,113
- Tell him to go
away, we're closed.

144
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,316
- I told him that already,
but he said he talked to Burl.

145
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,683
- What?

146
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,886
Where are you?
(man yells)

147
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:31,986
- My god.

148
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:34,056
Are you okay there, buddy?

149
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,625
- I'm okay!

150
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:40,578
I just, oh, ripped up the
ass a little bit, I'm okay.

151
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,534
- (chuckles) Okay.

152
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,985
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

153
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,834
- You're Bishop, P. Bishop.
- Yeah, okay.

154
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,942
You've got 15 minutes,
and that's it,

155
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,677
because the camp is closed.
- No, look. (sighs)

156
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:59,282
I'm not just wandering
around alone out here.

157
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:03,519
I'm actually on my first
investigative report.

158
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:06,288
The blog site Bigfoot Afoots
dot com, have you heard of us?

159
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,407
- No.
- Well, we've heard of you.

160
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,395
Now, I heard you
mention the name Burl,

161
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:16,197
because I believe he's
the one that confirmed

162
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,234
the Sirsquatch sight,
the Sirsquatch sighting.

163
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,434
- What?

164
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,437
- Sirsquatch, he's...

165
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:26,557
- (chuckles) Hold onto
your nuts, squirrel boy.

166
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,236
Jesus.

167
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,658
- Does her shirt
say Squatch on it?

168
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,027
- Get off.
- Okay.

169
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,126
- Help.

170
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,730
(phone vibrates)

171
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,220
(suspenseful music)

172
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,971
- [Teacher] Oh, boy.

173
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,080
(sighs)

174
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,039
- Hi.

175
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:51,226
- [Teacher] I heard you
wanted to see me after class?

176
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:54,963
- (chuckles) Oh, my god.
- What?

177
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,063
- Hi, babe.

178
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:59,701
Okay.
- What?

179
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,951
- I'm sensitive.
- Mm.

180
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,572
You're so sexy.

181
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,155
- I'm so pregnant.

182
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,211
And I'm bloated and I'm
achy, I'm tired and I'm fat.

183
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,248
- You are so not fat.

184
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:13,697
You are glowing.

185
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,421
(chuckles)

186
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
What's up?

187
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,392
- Oh, nothing, I'm
just, I'm preoccupied.

188
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:24,491
- By?

189
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,097
- I should've thrown it away,
why didn't I throw it away?

190
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:30,197
- What, the baby?

191
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,001
(wife chuckles)

192
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,101
- So...

193
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,090
Today, um...

194
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,110
You got a letter addressed to
you but there was no address,

195
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,779
and there was no stamp
on it, so I was curious.

196
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,081
- Okay.

197
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,549
- So, I opened it.

198
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,586
- (grunts) Sounds serious.

199
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,321
"Dear, Mr. Baumgarner.

200
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,658
"I must first start by
saying I'm your biggest fan."

201
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:56,758
Oh!

202
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,359
Sounds good so far.

203
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,211
"My name is Marilyn Bishop.

204
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:05,333
"You might not recognize
me, but my family,

205
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,802
"owner of the
Merrymaker camp grounds,

206
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:10,139
"undoubtedly make
famous by your book."

207
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,239
Hello?

208
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,011
Oh, my god.
(dark atmospheric music)

209
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,980
"I believe whatever
maimed and killed

210
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,283
"those two girls
will never return.

211
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,519
"I do not know this for
certain, but I do not, nor did I

212
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,123
"raise my children to live
in fear of the unknown."

213
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,624
- Mm-hm.
- Whoa.

214
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,326
"My two beautiful daughters
in the picture," what picture?

215
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,576
- Oh, yeah.

216
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,746
- My god, this is amazing.

217
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,683
Huh.

218
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,086
Okay.

219
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,673
"They have endured so much
over the past 15 years,

220
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:48,893
"they simply deserve only the
beauty that Merrymaker holds."

221
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,563
Wow.

222
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,399
Why in the world would
you throw this away?

223
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,822
- I don't know, 'cause it's
a mildly obsessed fan letter,

224
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,859
in response to a horror book
that you wrote seven years ago?

225
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,794
- What, hello?

226
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:07,962
An invitation to the
reopening of the camp

227
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:10,331
that I made famous
is not a fan letter.

228
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,309
It's her last dying wish,
for crying out loud.

229
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:13,409
- Honey.

230
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,186
Well, her last dying
wish is in two days.

231
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,642
- Okay, I can drive,
it'll take me 10 hours.

232
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,277
- What?
- I zip in, zip out.

233
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,653
Snip the ribbon, I'll be back
before you'd even miss me.

234
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:25,129
- Roland.
- We'll go together.

235
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,083
Hey, my juices are
already pumping.

236
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,052
Maybe this is a sign.

237
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,422
Come on, the three of us
in the middle of nowhere.

238
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,357
It'll be great, Izzy, we'll
find somebody to watch Izzy.

239
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,626
One of the students--
- Oh, one of your students?

240
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,328
They're gonna grocery shop?

241
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,505
And they're gonna clean
the house and they're gonna

242
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:46,402
bathe Izzy and feed
her and put her to bed?

243
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,303
No, we tried this
once before, remember?

244
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,673
With that student, Kara?
(Roland groans)

245
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:53,308
And her intoxicated
baby sitting routine.

246
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:56,278
No, we are adults now.

247
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:57,378
- Mm.

248
00:14:58,965 --> 00:14:59,965
Grownups.
- Yes.

249
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,652
- Alright, alright, alright.

250
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,921
I'm being ridiculous, I'm sorry.

251
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,304
- Oh, it's okay.

252
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,075
- I'm gonna clean up.
- Okay, babe.

253
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,129
- I'll see ya in five!

254
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:17,166
Never know what might
happen in five.

255
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:20,784
(moody atmospheric music)

256
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,273
- Jesus H, who in
the hell is that?

257
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,508
- I'm from Bigfoot's Afoots--
- Not you.

258
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:28,244
- It's just a lost camper.

259
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,821
I'm taking her into
the infirmary, she's
a little delirious.

260
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,921
This is her belongings.

261
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,884
- Any sign of, uh--
- Nope.

262
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,284
Traps are set, though.

263
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:37,753
- Great job.

264
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:40,169
Okay, meet me back at my cabin
when you're done with her.

265
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,269
- Mm-hm.

266
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,342
- What can I do you for?

267
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,230
- Fascinating place
you have here.

268
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,783
Are these the sassafras trees?

269
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,303
Which cabin y'all got
the baby-eatin' inbreed

270
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,438
shackled up in? (laughs)

271
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,423
- (chuckles) Right this way.
- Okay.

272
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,278
- Maybe next time
you'll wear looser pants

273
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,375
when you're thinking about
breaking and entering.

274
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,802
- So this is where
it all happened.

275
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,289
- We've repainted and
remodeled all 13 cabins.

276
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,226
Now all that's left is
to put the bodies in 'em.

277
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,394
- Bodies?

278
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,363
Like dead bodies?

279
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:22,647
- Yeah, dead bodies.

280
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,668
Of bloggists first.

281
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,570
- (chuckles) Mm-hm,
touché, touché.

282
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,087
Okay, you fill in the blank.

283
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,341
The first thing
that people think of

284
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,376
when they say Merrymaker is--

285
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,046
- Look, I know.

286
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,014
The perception of our
camp based on that book

287
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,216
is completely moronic
and ridiculous.

288
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,001
Entertaining, but fictional.

289
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,822
What happened to those two
young girls is a tragedy,

290
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,741
and should be viewed and
treated as such, in my opinion.

291
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,749
If you believe that, you must
also believe that animals

292
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,480
are gonna rise out
of the cemetery.

293
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,000
- Do you have a cemetery here?

294
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,202
- We have a proud
family history here,

295
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,438
and I intend to get these
grounds up and running

296
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:06,324
just as my mother's mother's
mother did long before me.

297
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,928
You seem disappointed.

298
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
- Well, I was...

299
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,989
I was just hoping
that you could confirm

300
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,204
the Bigfoot sightings.

301
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,126
- The what what whatting?

302
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,227
- Sirsquatch.

303
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,648
He was reported .67 miles from
here, that's why I'm here.

304
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:36,005
Are you sure you
haven't seen any traces

305
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,074
or any signs or any...
- Of a bigfoot?

306
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:41,309
No. (laughs)

307
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,077
- But, but Burl, he--

308
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:44,712
- "But Burl?"

309
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,890
I don't know what Burl was
thinking, but Burl's way

310
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,351
of thinking is the reason
why Burl is no longer here.

311
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,069
Why don't I give you the
quick tour on the way out?

312
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,074
- [Poppy] Hey,
you're safe, okay?

313
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,679
- No, no safe here.

314
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,782
Safe.

315
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:08,185
(speaks Spanish)

316
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,858
- You came a long
way from home, huh?

317
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,061
- I no want to go.

318
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,332
Though I go.

319
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,202
Then...

320
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,105
In the camera, I see it.

321
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,942
Monstro, I record it.

322
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,961
- I'm gonna get you
your camera back,

323
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:35,864
and you're gonna be
okay, just relax,

324
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,748
and let me clean you up.

325
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,736
I believe you, okay?

326
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,104
You're safe.

327
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,272
I promise, if you weren't safe,

328
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,409
I would drive you to the
desert tonight myself.

329
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:48,844
I would.
- You will drive me?

330
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,645
(speaks Spanish)

331
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,797
- Come on, let's
take one of these.

332
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,398
You'll feel so much better.

333
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,547
(suspenseful music)

334
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,667
- [Bishop] Is this
off the record?

335
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:13,768
- Sure.

336
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,912
- The truth is, when they
found those two girls,

337
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,508
only my mother and my brother
and my step-dad were there.

338
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:20,607
- Oh.

339
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,445
Well, can I talk to
mom, or brother, or...

340
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,648
- My brother, Wayne, turned
18 and checked out that summer

341
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,384
after it all went down,
haven't heard from him since.

342
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:33,484
(ominous tones)

343
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,413
Our real dad left
when we were little.

344
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:37,659
Probably because he
couldn't deal with my crazy,

345
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,545
overbearing mother and left
her alone to run the place.

346
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,981
She met the meat-sack known
as Burl and married the oaf.

347
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,119
But when she died last year,

348
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,241
half cancer, half broken heart,

349
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,277
Burl was asked to leave.

350
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:57,778
So, I'm sorry if I don't look
like a buck-toothed inbred

351
00:19:57,878 --> 00:19:59,647
who likes to blend
babies into smoothies.

352
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:00,798
- Oh, my gosh!

353
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,019
Did they base the Fran character
off of you in the book?

354
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,472
The innocent daughter turned
psychopathic scalping expert?

355
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,494
(chuckles)

356
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,612
- You'll never know.

357
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,301
- Okay, but what
about the camcorder

358
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:23,305
that was found with the
maimed girls on the lake?

359
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,740
I mean, there was
no tape in there?

360
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,156
At least, that's what the
police report says, but is that

361
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:29,257
what you say?

362
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,529
- Looks like your time is up.

363
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,666
- Okay.

364
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:37,867
Well, just answer
one more question.

365
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,690
What's the rush?

366
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:46,561
I mean, what's out here
that's makin' ya so anxious?

367
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,565
- You people are what's
making me so anxious.

368
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:52,768
I'm sorry that our camp
contains no man-eating inbreeds,

369
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:56,270
no Bigfoots, no nothing
but real people,

370
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,722
just getting ready for
a nice grand re-opening.

371
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,594
No trespassing means no, even
in the middle of nowhere.

372
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,518
Here we go.

373
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:10,617
Alright.

374
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,277
Godspeed.

375
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,510
- I would be doing a great
disservice to my readers if I

376
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:40,631
didn't at least try to interview
the little Mexican girl.

377
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,873
(dark atmospheric music)

378
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,414
Ranger Bishop?

379
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:00,568
(chuckles)

380
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:01,919
Ranger Bishop?

381
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,876
Careful of your vagina
on the way over, buddy.

382
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:12,847
(branch snaps)
(leaves rustle)

383
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:15,965
(suspenseful music)

384
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,327
(camcorder chimes)

385
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,979
Bigfoot Afoots
investigation blog log.

386
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,101
Time is, uh, I don't
know what time it is,

387
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:36,287
but I'm at Merrymaker camp
ground and I'm hearing

388
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,724
familiar but
unidentifiable sounds, I...

389
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,650
(chuckles)

390
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,786
This could be the very moment.

391
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:52,320
Tonight.

392
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:55,638
That I make bonafide
first-contact.

393
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,977
With the primordial Sirsquatch.

394
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:05,733
I'm now going to attempt to
climb down over this fence

395
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,017
and investigate further.

396
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,253
Log out.

397
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,015
(intense dark tones)
(screams)

398
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,384
(animal snarls)
(flesh squelches)

399
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,285
(screams)

400
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,650
- "I'm your biggest fan."

401
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,728
(suspenseful music)

402
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,130
Oh, hi, baby.

403
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,433
Come here.

404
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,154
Did you have a bad dream?

405
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,255
Yeah?

406
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,090
Did Mommy get you
another teddy bear?

407
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,527
He's cute, what's his name?

408
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,877
Should get you back to bed.

409
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,421

(music swells and intensifies)

426
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,125
- [Poppy] Anita, you
need to see this.

427
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:10,662
- Copy.

428
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,916
- Hey, hon.

429
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:18,486
I, uh, I hope you're
enjoying your facial by now.

430
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:21,355
I know, I know,
I'm a stubborn ass,

431
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:23,191
but uh, this might
be good for us.

432
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,759
You know how I
feel about my fans,

433
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:27,461
and I'll be outta your
hair for a couple days,

434
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:29,000
maybe you'll get
some writin' done.

435
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,531
(phone bleeps)

436
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,048
Ah, come on.

437
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:34,786
Really?

438
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,422
(sighs)

439
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,329
- Hm.

440
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,464
Any other traces?

441
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,602
- These.

442
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,205
Scat over there next to
big freakin' footprints.

443
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,560
It's getting closer.

444
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:00,862
Lupita told me last night

445
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,830
that guts fell out of
a tree onto her head.

446
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,066
- What, no, that's
delirium, hallucinations,

447
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:07,067
malnutrition, dehydration,
sun exposure--

448
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,371
- This has gotten so out
of control since he left!

449
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:11,547
- We do not need Burl, do
you understand me, Poppy?

450
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:13,683
- Well, I called him because
we do need him, okay?

451
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:16,393
I need him to eliminate
a problem from my life.

452
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,663
He might just be my
ticket out of town.

453
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,054
- Well, well.

454
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:27,655
Miss Tinkerbell.

455
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,525
You look more like a fairytale
every time I see you.

456
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,741
How goes it, Muffin?

457
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,112
- (sighs) Spinnin' my wheels.

458
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,482
Hey, can I pop one of those
squares from you, Daddy-O?

459
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,086
- You should never smoke.

460
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,574
Go on.
(Poppy chuckles)

461
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,692
- Hey, you two lung
cancer advocates.

462
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,627
- Ah!

463
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,615
(Burl sighs)

464
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:56,432
- Well, stick around, soldier.
- What'd she tell you?

465
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,702
- Clean up, 101.

466
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,905
I brought my own bag
of tricks with me.

467
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,896
And your little sister wanted
me to bring this in for ya.

468
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,248
Don't worry, I didn't peak.

469
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,317
Miss me?

470
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:14,669
- Like my period.

471
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:16,965
Reporter showed up, said he
spoke to you specifically.

472
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,425
How in the hell
does that happen?

473
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,776
- Change the voicemail
code if you don't want me

474
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,027
responding to, uh,
guest inquiries.

475
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,650
The poor soul.

476
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,885
- Alright, any cockamamie
ideas you're brewin' up in that

477
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:34,521
burnt out head of yours, you
dispose of 'em immediately,

478
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:37,540
and I will consider letting
you stay in my camp, you copy?

479
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,762
- Oorah.

480
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,680
You sizzle just
like your momma did.

481
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,017
Any luck with the
traps here, Popsicle?

482
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:51,506
- No, he's too
smart for the traps.

483
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:52,884
He did take that blouse, though,

484
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:54,324
but he left the traps untouched.

485
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,346
- Sounds like he's
playing with ya.

486
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:02,817
Sounds like you two need a big
bad wolf after all, don't it?

487
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,315
- Should be a pot
of boiling water

488
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:05,775
waiting for you
in the mess hall.

489
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,505
Welcome to the
house made of brick.

490
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,542
- Easy there, little piggy.

491
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,179
You may just not
make it out alive.

492
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,450
(mumbles)

493
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,141
- I just threw up a little bit.

494
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,308
(dark atmospheric music)

495
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,179
- Hey, uh, can you help me out
with some directions, please?

496
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,896
I guess my GPS must be
a generic piece of shooot.

497
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,683
- Sorry, did you say somethin'?

498
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:37,784
- Uh, no.

499
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:40,188
Hey, what are the chances?

500
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,790
That's actually where I'm
headed, Merrymaker camp ground.

501
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:44,288
Do you know if
it's close to here?

502
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:45,525
- Why?

503
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:48,262
Are you one of those freaks
into havin' sex at murder sites?

504
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:50,113
'Cause that's freaky,
out of bounds.

505
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,501
You don't look like a freak.

506
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,878
- You must be deeply in touch
with your freakiness, huh?

507
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,173
I wrote the book.

508
00:30:58,272 --> 00:30:59,673
Oh, never mind.

509
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:01,709
How much is this?
- 4.72.

510
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:02,808
- Here we go.

511
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,162
Keep the change.

512
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,328
- Anything I could
help you with today?

513
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:09,826
- If I keep goin'
down the street,

514
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:11,644
am I gonna hit the
camp ground, yes or no?

515
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,538
(suspenseful music)

516
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,308
- Either way, I'd watch my back.

517
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,744
I read the Merrymaker book.

518
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,615
It ain't far from the truth.

519
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:30,653
(ominous tones)
(muffled chatter)

520
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,720
- We're leaving.

521
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,755
- Why does your sister fight?

522
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:49,723
She likes to hide monstros?

523
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,575
- No, she's just a fighter.

524
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,943
- [Lupita] She's a monstro.

525
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,147
- No, she's just a product
of her environment.

526
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,285
- What?

527
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,518
Why'd you no run away?

528
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,807
- Because, I made a promise
that I didn't wanna make

529
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:07,990
a long time ago.

530
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,428
Come on.

531
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,336
(suspenseful music)

532
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,037
Who is that?

533
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,697
- I have no idea,
just get outta here.

534
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,000
- Whoa, whoa whoa whoa!

535
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:07,099
I surrender!

536
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,471
I'm unarmed! (chuckles)

537
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,954
Roland Baumgarner!

538
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,357
I'm on the good team!

539
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,612
- Poppy, change of plans,
get to the mess hall.

540
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,109
- But I thought
you said take her?

541
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,210
- Just get to the mess
hall, I'll meet you there.

542
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Wow.

543
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,603
Mr. Baumgarner!

544
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,290
- You know, I heard you
guys have a camp to reopen,

545
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:31,826
and could use a famous face.

546
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:33,327
- You're here.

547
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:34,478
You actually came.

548
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,066
- Yeah, well, I was
in the neighborhood,

549
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:41,518
and figured I'd swing by, if
you have room for one more.

550
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:43,920
- Mom's letter worked?

551
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,607
- I always say you are
nothing without your fans.

552
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,665
- I just mailed it a few
days ago and I thought,

553
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,060
there's no way...

554
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,516
But it's actually happening.

555
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,585
Oh, my god, it's unbelievable.

556
00:33:57,684 --> 00:33:59,435
- This, this is great.

557
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,457
The Merrymaker camp ground.

558
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:03,557
Hoo!

559
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,242
Any ax-murderers to report?

560
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,980
- Not recently.
- Sorry to hear that.

561
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,315
Maybe we'll have some
baby stew later, then?

562
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,820
(chuckles)

563
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,456
Should I just follow you in?

564
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,411
- Welcome to Merrymaker
camp, Mr. Baumgarner.

565
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,510
- Alright!

566
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,496
(moody rock music)

567
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:51,822
Ah!

568
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:54,907
Hey, hello.

569
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:56,764
- Penelope Bishop.
- Oh, Roland Baumgarner.

570
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:58,382
Pleasure's mine.
- Roland Baumgarner?

571
00:34:58,481 --> 00:34:59,599
- (chuckles) Yes, that's me.

572
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,181
- The famous author, here?

573
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,039
- [Roland] The one and
only, I think, yeah.

574
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:04,985
- Here, in the flesh.
- Wow.

575
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,088
This is quite a
reception, thank you.

576
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,322
Thank you, well--

577
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,224
- [Anita] What did
I say about smoking?

578
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:11,626
- All you need. (laughs)

579
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:12,860
- You'll respect our rules,

580
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,677
and not subject young
and impressionable--

581
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:17,931
(chatter in Spanish)

582
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,333
- What fence did
you sneak over in?

583
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,836
(speaks Spanish)

584
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:26,606
Is there mucho more of
you comin' for dinner?

585
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:27,842
- Alright, excuse Burl.

586
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,793
He left his manners
on the cutting floor.

587
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,329
- Old habits die hard.

588
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,867
I hope you like your Bambi dead.

589
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,086
(Roland laughs)

590
00:35:39,186 --> 00:35:40,655
Sloppy does.

591
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:41,972
Inside, campers.

592
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,010
- He's funny.

593
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,730
(chatter in Spanish)

594
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,586
- [Poppy] God, I can't
believe you're here.

595
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,568
- [Roland] Wow,
well, hello. (laughs)

596
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,668
(laughter)

597
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,340
- Best aperitif in 1,000 miles.

598
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,677
- Not only illegal, but
known to numb the brain.

599
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:05,079
- Yeah, well, then fill me up.

600
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:07,481
- Bingo.
(Roland laughs)

601
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,382
(Anita laughs)

602
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,619
- It's not quite as, uh,

603
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,590
creepy out here as I
thought it would be.

604
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,192
It's dark, quiet
and it's kinda nice.

605
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,248
I don't think I'd be
survivin' out here, though,

606
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,677
you know, so exposed.

607
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,500
At home, I'm roughin' it if
I don't shower twice a day.

608
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,969
(Burl laughs)

609
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:30,505
- No showers, no
food. (chuckles)

610
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,673
Survivin' fine, and I
ain't roughin' it, come on.

611
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,543
- [Roland] I like
roughin' it a little bit.

612
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,144
- [Burl] Bingo. (laughs)

613
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:38,244
Bingo.

614
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,918
- Who is miss, uh,
keep to yourself

615
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,534
and say not a word over there?

616
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,688
- [Poppy] She doesn't
speak good English.

617
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,891
- Yeah, and unfortunately,

618
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,025
Lucinda won't be
with us much longer.

619
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,793
(Lupita speaks Spanish)

620
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:56,094
- Lu-Pi-Ta.

621
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:57,831
And you lie.

622
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:01,202
I want to leave now,
away from the monstro.

623
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,869
- The monstro?

624
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:04,447
What did she--
- I don't understand.

625
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,907
- Oh, shooot!
- Oh, my god!

626
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:07,742
- Help me!
- What the?

627
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:08,842
What the?

628
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,527
God.

629
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,746
Are you okay?

630
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:13,847
Oh, my god.

631
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,353
- What the flaping flap?

632
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,222
You flap-face liar!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

633
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:24,057
You're okay.
- I, do I look okay?

634
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:26,059
- What happened?
- What happened?

635
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,032
I, a very large
beast-like thing,

636
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,400
dragged through the
god damn forest,

637
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,570
and under to its
underground lair!

638
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,039
- Whoa.

639
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,141
- Call the police!

640
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:45,079
Because Sirsquatch, he is out
there and he is pissed off!

641
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,856
- Sirsquatch?
- No, don't worry about it.

642
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:48,034
- Yeah.
- I know this guy.

643
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:50,985
(Lupita speaks Spanish)
- Yeah, yeah.

644
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:53,853
- I gave you back your camera.
- With no recordings.

645
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:56,157
Where the recordings go?
- Oh, okay, okay, wait, wait.

646
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,159
Everybody just take
a deep breath, okay?

647
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:00,456
I mean, you must admit that
somethin' got to this kid,

648
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:01,561
so what's goin' on?

649
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:05,233
- Our friends here are both
fascinated by a supposed

650
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,235
(chuckles) Bigfoot.

651
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:08,735
- "Supposed?"

652
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,304
- Bigfoot.
- "Supposed?"

653
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:11,972
"Supposed," my ass!

654
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,974
Look at my ass!
- Whoa!

655
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:16,244
Why isn't somebody
calling the cops?

656
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:18,378
- Because it's 85 miles
to the nearest station.

657
00:38:18,478 --> 00:38:20,547
We have full legal
jurisdiction here.

658
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:21,916
- Burl, if you please?

659
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,934
- Like, it's out of your
jurisdiction, I'd say.

660
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,231
- Oh no, please, Burl could
drive them both into town.

661
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:28,447
There's a clinic and a bus
stop about 25 miles away.

662
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:29,956
You are hysterical, my friend.

663
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:31,494
You could have a
closed head wound,

664
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:33,711
subarachnoid hemorrhaging,
a concussion, maybe you--

665
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,831
- I'm hysterical,
because of you!

666
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:38,248
- Kiddies, kiddies.

667
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,284
Cool it off, settle down.

668
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,121
The land plays tricks
on you way out here.

669
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,925
Bears look like beasts,
wolf calling something.

670
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,612
There's no sacrifices.
- Who are you?

671
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:54,181
- He's the reason
why you're here.

672
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
- You're Burl?

673
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,701
- In the flesh, darlin'.

674
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,523
You're a wreck.

675
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:04,925
We'll make you beautiful.

676
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,260
Smoke and a pancake, boy.

677
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,528
- (groans) Watch it, oh, my god.

678
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:10,697
- I bet that hurts.
(reporter groans)

679
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:11,797
(reporter yells)

680
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,266
- Well, I'm sorry about that.

681
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,536
We do get our fair share
of trespassers out here.

682
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,954
Just trying to do our
best amongst the freaks.

683
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,315
Take it from people who have
lived here their whole lives.

684
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:24,454
There's nothing out there.

685
00:39:24,554 --> 00:39:27,181
- There is something in the
woods, but you know this.

686
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,217
- Okay, okay, so where is
her camera that she claims

687
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:32,686
holds possible proof of
the Merrymaker murderer?

688
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:33,920
- No one said that.

689
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,581
- [Roland] Well, we
should look at it.

690
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,192
- [Anita] Mm-hm?

691
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,608
Oh, sure, yeah, we'll have a
movie night, it'll be great.

692
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:43,431
Just one second, excuse me,
um, Penelope, just a moment.

693
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,666
- This is, this is...

694
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:50,371
I must admit, though, my
curiosity is beyond beat.

695
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,347
- We agreed to this a
long time ago, Penelope.

696
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:54,364
You promised me.
- No we did not agree to this.

697
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:56,422
In circumstances that
include a maimed reporter,

698
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:58,559
and a delirious Mexican
girl, things have changed.

699
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,735
- What's changed, except
that we're all-systems-go?

700
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:02,831
- Something is
killing people, Anita.

701
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,253
And you can say that--
- Fine, fine, fine.

702
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,630
You can run away if you need to.

703
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:09,487
It won't change anything
except everything.

704
00:40:09,588 --> 00:40:10,724
(Poppy chuckles)

705
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,981
- Just remember what happens
at the end of your plan.

706
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:15,429
- Maybe something will gut
me and hang up by a tree,

707
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:16,996
dance on my bones.

708
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:19,134
For your sake, I hope that
makes it easier for you

709
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,382
to abandon your legacy.

710
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:27,041
Okay, campers, we
have a game plan.

711
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,543
You, uh, señorita, are
gonna come with me.

712
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,778
- And Mr. Baumgarner, we
set you up in cabin six,

713
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:34,248
which is between mine
and Anita's cabins.

714
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:36,951
- Alright, but shouldn't we
be watching her tape first?

715
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,367
- Oh, you're more than welcome
to look at it if you want,

716
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:40,836
but her tape's completely blank.

717
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,710
- Okay.

718
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:50,012
(moody rock music)

719
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,088
- Well are you gonna sit there
or are you gonna come inside?

720
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:16,706
- You captured
nothing, comprendo?

721
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,076
Nada.

722
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:23,079
You stay here, Poppy
will be back to get you.

723
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,547
Goodbye, Snoopita.

724
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,018
(Lupita speaks Spanish)

725
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,610
- There you go.
- Well! (whistles)

726
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,014
What've we got here?

727
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:43,818
That's, uh, quite a
few beds. (laughs)

728
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,253
- I would shower
tonight, if I were you.

729
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:49,824
Unless you're scared of walking
in the woods by yourself.

730
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:50,923
- Oh.

731
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:53,376
Is that you offering
me protection?

732
00:41:55,246 --> 00:42:00,282
What do you guys do around
here for fun, post meridiem?

733
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,619
- Oh, Anita reads.

734
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,822
Burl listens to the radio.

735
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,525
I just sit and wait
for the anti meridiem.

736
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,179
I don't sleep much.

737
00:42:12,278 --> 00:42:13,780
- Ironic.

738
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,358
With a name like
Poppy, I thought you'd
fall right to sleep.

739
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,333
- Not even opiates
will help you here.

740
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,023
Anita's cabin's next-door,
if you need anything else.

741
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:25,326
- Um, how are the showers?

742
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,228
Are they like--
- They're community.

743
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,996
Everything's community here,
it's kinda like prison,

744
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,733
except without the bars.
(Roland laughs)

745
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,501
- It sounds like you're
pumped to be opening back up.

746
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:36,135
- [Poppy] Oh, I just work here.

747
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:37,920
- I'm sure you do
more than that.

748
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,923
- Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

749
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,010
- I'm sure I will!

750
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,813
(dark atmospheric music)

751
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:50,266
(Lupita speaks Spanish)

752
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,670
- Okay.

753
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,106
Vaminos.

754
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,280
- What happened
to your co-pilot?

755
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,284
- Damn shame.

756
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,338
Guess he didn't have
anything to report.

757
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:47,757
Took off faster than
diarrhea on a baby's butt.

758
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,413
I don't think you'll ever see
his face round here again.

759
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:54,949
- I'm not as
confident as you are.

760
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,048
- You should be.

761
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,070
I made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

762
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:06,275
Good thing you brought
me in, you need me.

763
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,380
- I have a proposal for you.

764
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,416
- [Burl] I'm all ears.

765
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,688
(suspenseful music)

766
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:23,326
(water splashes)

767
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:46,215
- Those are my terms.

768
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,402
- After I pull my
end of the deal,

769
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:50,853
you grant me a full pardon.

770
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:55,242
All past indiscretions
you forget.

771
00:44:55,342 --> 00:44:56,726
In this life or the past.

772
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,798
- If you deliver.

773
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:04,918
(water splashes)

774
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:06,920
- Whoa, oh, I'm sorry.

775
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:09,123
I thought you hadn't
come home by now.

776
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:11,425
- [Poppy] No, I
haven't done either.

777
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:15,143
- Oh, well, (chuckles) I'll
be outta here in a second.

778
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,900
- [Poppy] Why can't
you look me in the eye

779
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,166
when you say that?

780
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:23,186
- Um, because I'm not
used to such overt,

781
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,206
look, you could be my student.

782
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,489
- But I'm not.

783
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,793
(suspenseful music)

784
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,639
- Stop, wait, wait.

785
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:35,576
- [Poppy] What are
you hiding down there?

786
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:39,847
- Please stop, I think we
have to stop, I'm married.

787
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:42,465
- [Poppy] Not in this version.

788
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,311
(branch snaps)

789
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:01,349
(intense dark tones)

790
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,514
- [Izzy] Mommy!

791
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:14,782
- Yeah, honey!

792
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:16,766
Give me one second,
I'll be right there!

793
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:21,838
Seems like there's (mumbles).

794
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,492
- [Izzy] Mom!

795
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,260
(mumbles)

796
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,543
- You're what?

797
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,447
(suspenseful music)

798
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,632
(computer chimes)

799
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,775
(computer chimes)

800
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,434
(keyboard clacks)

801
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:11,353
(computer chimes)

802
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,490
(computer chimes)

803
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,711
(keyboard clacks)

804
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:21,664
(computer chimes)

805
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,434
(computer chimes)

806
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,960
(computer chimes)

807
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:35,911
(computer chimes)

808
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,320
(computer chimes)

809
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:54,882
(heavy knocks)

810
00:48:54,981 --> 00:48:56,498
- Is Lupita in here with you?

811
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,487
- Hey, what...

812
00:49:00,586 --> 00:49:02,186
(groans)

813
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:03,956
- Copy.

814
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,726
- (sighs) What's happening?

815
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:07,827
What's going on?

816
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,913
- I'm responsible
for you, so get on.

817
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,351
- Whoa.

818
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:18,653
(dark electronic music)

819
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:26,728
I'm sorry about what
happened last night.

820
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:32,668
- What happens here stays here.

821
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,431
- Is that what I think it is?

822
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,831
- This is nothing.

823
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:47,382
Just a little hiccup.

824
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,324
We get our fair share
of skinny-dippers, too.

825
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,101
- Who the flap would
skinny-dip out here?

826
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,559
- Her shorts are
shredded, Anita.

827
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:54,907
- Listen.

828
00:49:55,007 --> 00:49:56,965
- Your re-opening probably
needs to be canceled.

829
00:49:57,065 --> 00:49:58,065
Don't you agree?

830
00:49:58,164 --> 00:49:59,164
- [Anita] Absolutely not.

831
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:00,501
- This could've been me, Anita.

832
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:02,237
- Yeah, she's right.
(suspenseful music)

833
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:03,936
Something strange is
goin' on out here.

834
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:05,913
What is the real story
with that reporter kid?

835
00:50:06,012 --> 00:50:07,730
Who did that to him,
what did that to him?

836
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:10,005
- Everybody calm down, okay?

837
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,693
Mr. Baumgarner, I
will make you deal.

838
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:15,362
We won't reopen until we find
out exactly what is out there.

839
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,380
- So, you're confirming
something is out there.

840
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,237
- You've obviously
nothing to be afraid of.

841
00:50:19,338 --> 00:50:20,338
I can confirm that.

842
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,155
- You don't even know
what we're tracking.

843
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:23,255
- Or what's tracking us.

844
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,951
- I will under no
circumstances confirm

845
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,050
that this is a Bigfoot.

846
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,875
That is pure mythos
and plain stupidity.

847
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:32,211
- Well, whatever
it is, it's big.

848
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:34,514
- Let's take a moment,
devise a search plan, copy?

849
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,182
- Uh, not copy?

850
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:38,652
I'm a writer, not
the Grizzly Man.

851
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:39,949
I'm not going tromping through

852
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,588
the middle of the woods alone.

853
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:42,922
- You won't be alone.

854
00:50:43,023 --> 00:50:44,699
Roland, you come with
me to the gun barn.

855
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,094
Poppy, go get Burl, we'll
rendezvous at the mess hall.

856
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:48,494
- And do what?
- 15 minutes.

857
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:49,594
- Copy, 15.

858
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,248
Be careful.
- Copy, careful.

859
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,815
- I bring this life,

860
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:10,666
given from God above.

861
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,371
Offer it to protect
the ones I love.

862
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:22,911
If it's needed to take
this away from me,

863
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,916
(sighs) dear lord,

864
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,820
use the most with courage,

865
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,557
and victory.

866
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,384
(dark atmospheric music)

867
00:51:44,483 --> 00:51:46,081
- [Roland] I thought
you said there was

868
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:47,181
nothing to be afraid of?

869
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,923
- With a collection
like this, there isn't.

870
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:53,226
Burl left some beauties behind!

871
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,262
- Listen, I could
pretend that I'm half

872
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,496
as tough as you
ladies, I'm really not.

873
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,793
You know, I think it might
be best if I just head out,

874
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:02,001
maybe come back when you
have this all worked out?

875
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,170
- Oh, Ro, the party's
just getting started.

876
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:05,572
Come on.

877
00:52:05,672 --> 00:52:07,541
Hunt with me, Roland.

878
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:09,909
Get your primal juices flowing.

879
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,711
Make you feel like a
real man, I promise.

880
00:52:12,811 --> 00:52:16,282
- (chuckle) Well,
my courage, uh,

881
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:18,818
at this point, is pretty low.

882
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,588
- Well, courage is not the
absence of fear, my friend.

883
00:52:21,688 --> 00:52:24,056
It's the action taken
in the face of it.

884
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:25,826
You know, I could've
been like you.

885
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,360
- Yeah, really?

886
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,576
- [Anita] I wanted to be a
doctor, once upon a time.

887
00:52:29,675 --> 00:52:30,675
- What happened?

888
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,085
- Two teenage girls got murdered
on my family's camp ground.

889
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:36,902
Buried us in debt,
lawsuits and lies.

890
00:52:37,003 --> 00:52:39,206
Your little book
didn't help much.

891
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:41,708
After my mom got sick, I
inherited all the people comin'

892
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:44,710
up here lookin'
for the Merrymaker
Murderer, breakin' in,

893
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:48,849
vandalizing property, I've
found more used condoms than--

894
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:51,367
- Your mom, she wrote
like she was such a fan.

895
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:55,538
- Oh, she would kill
to be here right now.

896
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,998
- I've never really
shot a gun before, so--

897
00:53:05,097 --> 00:53:06,248
- You'll figure it out.

898
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,952
(moody atmospheric music)

899
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:17,827
- Burl!

900
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,429
Burl, where are you?

901
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,766
Burl.

902
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,202
Burl!

903
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,608
Burl, come in, we need you.

904
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,690
- Poppy, come in, please.

905
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,737
Poppy!

906
00:54:00,835 --> 00:54:02,355
- What, they've
disappeared now, too?

907
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,693
You think maybe they're
already out lookin' for Lupita?

908
00:54:06,793 --> 00:54:07,893
- Yeah.

909
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,112
Yeah, yeah, that's
probably where they are.

910
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:12,981
Okay, I have an idea.

911
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,887
(suspenseful music)

912
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:46,215
(Burl chuckles)

913
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,601
- What do we have here?

914
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,643
You little pervert, you.

915
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,648
Ah-roo!

916
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,286
(chuckles)

917
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:37,751
- You think she's up there?

918
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:39,434
Why would she go up there?

919
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:41,836
- It's up there.

920
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,606
- Why don't we wait
for "it" to come down?

921
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,943
- Yeah!

922
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:49,244
Why don't you wait here?

923
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,548
(Roland sighs)

924
00:55:55,251 --> 00:56:00,322
(dark atmospheric music)
(liquid drips)

925
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:40,172
(distant screams)

926
00:57:40,273 --> 00:57:41,789
Did you hear that?

927
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,860
- Yeah.

928
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:44,992
Was that your sister?

929
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:47,197
- I think so.

930
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,762
- [Roland] I don't think just
storming up there and ringing

931
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:54,369
the doorbell is a good idea.
- We have guns, it doesn't.

932
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,177
- Oh, my god.

933
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:04,998
Holy shooot.

934
00:58:05,097 --> 00:58:06,666
Holy shooot!

935
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:07,949
What the flap?

936
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,286
- Roland, hey, listen to me!
- What?

937
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:14,474
- You're okay, you're okay.

938
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,358
There's nothing you
can do for her now.

939
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,184
- No, wait, I'm not
going any damn further.

940
00:58:19,284 --> 00:58:21,429
- You don't have a
choice, this is it, okay?

941
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,800
You got this, you got this.

942
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,469
Okay.

943
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,373
(suspenseful music)

944
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:42,719
One.

945
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:44,268
Two.

946
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,608
(music swells)

947
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,577
- Help, run, run!

948
00:58:51,677 --> 00:58:52,677
Run!

949
00:58:52,777 --> 00:58:53,777
It's here!

950
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:00,768
(screams)
(intense music)

951
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,277
- What the flap
was that? (screams)

952
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:04,438
What the flap?

953
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,762
- You're okay, we're okay!

954
00:59:10,862 --> 00:59:14,300
- No, I'm not okay.
- Hey, everybody is okay.

955
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,735
- Stop saying that!

956
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:16,835
Nothing is okay.

957
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,688
Okay?

958
00:59:19,237 --> 00:59:21,474
Your camp is harboring a
wild beast, Bigfoot thing,

959
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:23,411
that's mauling people
and needs to be killed.

960
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,110
You can't have
people staying here.

961
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,208
You're lucky I'm not
threatening to sue your ass!

962
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:28,465
- (chuckles) Sue us for what?

963
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,641
What can you take from us
that you haven't already?

964
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:32,139
- You just take
me back to my car,

965
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,838
so I can get the hell
outta here, okay?

966
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:36,054
I have a wife and a
child, and another child,

967
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,940
in the real world
to get back to!

968
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:39,909
- Copy that.

969
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,579
(moody electronic music)

970
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,119
- shooot.

971
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,755
No flaping way.

972
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,293
I'm trapped in my
own god damn book.

973
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,797
- Do we have insurance in here?

974
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,251
- flap you and your
Smokey the Bear Insurance.

975
01:00:06,351 --> 01:00:07,750
You have a serious
fuckin' problem

976
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,637
is what you have, Ranger Bishop.

977
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,793
Now, this is a crime
scene, a murder scene,

978
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:16,128
and you're
accessories to murder.

979
01:00:16,228 --> 01:00:18,630
I know you say you're the
law out here, but I think

980
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:21,516
this has gone to levels beyond
your fuckin' jurisdiction!

981
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,809
Do you realize a Saab
is a vintage classic?

982
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:33,112
Do you know how much
depreciation value
this just cost me?

983
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:36,349
- Mr. Baumgarner, you
like secrets, right?

984
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:37,916
- Yeah, why?

985
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:40,353
- [Anita] We've been keeping
a little secret from you.

986
01:00:40,452 --> 01:00:43,322
- The secret is out, I need
god damn medical attention!

987
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,673
- You deserve to know the truth.

988
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,043
- The truth, what truth?

989
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,313
- Nice drivin', city boy.

990
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:57,184
- Is that Burl wearin' my mask?

991
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:08,797
- The truth is, we're
smarter than you.

992
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,715
Poppy, listen to me.

993
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:30,670
No matter what happens next,

994
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:33,487
there is nothing that we
can't get through together.

995
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:36,858
We're blood.

996
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,637
Oh, Mr. Baumgarner!

997
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,708
Hi!

998
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:54,143
(laughs)

999
01:01:55,228 --> 01:02:00,215
Welcome to the Merrymaker camp
ground official reopening.

1000
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,969
Boy, I do apologize
that things haven't gone

1001
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,139
a little bit more smoothly.

1002
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,708
We have been dealing with
a little bit of an issue,

1003
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:12,210
these last few months,
and my, oh my, you just

1004
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,681
would've thought that all
hell had broken loose, but uh,

1005
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:18,934
luckily, crisis averted.

1006
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:24,806
So, I had Penelope get together
a little something for you.

1007
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,909
A little visual aid, so
Penelope, if you please.

1008
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:42,166
Since you got all the credit
for writing down our story,

1009
01:02:42,266 --> 01:02:44,264
I thought that you should
at least see the truth.

1010
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,797
- [Girl] You know how to
raise this thing, right?

1011
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:52,657
- [Camera Girl] Dude,
don't worry about it.

1012
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:54,802
- Just film it.

1013
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,458
Apparently there's this
camp counselor who eats

1014
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:01,626
babies or something who
lives in that cabin.

1015
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,762
I've been double dog
dared and bet five dollars

1016
01:03:03,862 --> 01:03:07,266
that I won't go inside of
it, alone, for 10 minutes.

1017
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:08,800
- [Camera Girl] Alone?

1018
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,137
That's two dollars a minute,
that's a pretty good deal.

1019
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:12,315
- [Girl] If I gave you $20,

1020
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:13,972
you still wouldn't
go in it, you baby.

1021
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:16,269
- I told you, my number's 100.
- Fine, then stay here.

1022
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:17,847
- [Camera Girl] No,
Caitie, come on.

1023
01:03:17,947 --> 01:03:20,179
Caitie, it was funny
before, but not anymore.

1024
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:21,679
Caitie.

1025
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,637
- I thought you weren't
scared of anything?

1026
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:25,367
- You won't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

1027
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,302
Watch me.

1028
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,860
(door creaks)

1029
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,717
- Holy crap!
- God, what was it, take this!

1030
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:39,664
- [Caitie] I don't know,
there's something in there!

1031
01:03:39,764 --> 01:03:41,166
Violet, come on.
- Hello?

1032
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:44,103
- [Caitie] No, Violet, come
on, please, let's just go.

1033
01:03:44,202 --> 01:03:45,202
No.

1034
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:46,836
(screams)

1035
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:52,244
Violet, Violet!
(Violet screams)

1036
01:03:52,344 --> 01:03:54,144
(screams)

1037
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,635
- And, the rest,
they say, is history.

1038
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:03,472
Thank you, Poppy.

1039
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:11,445
Boy, I did not think that a
fan letter would get you here.

1040
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:16,418
But when you showed up,
come hell or high water,

1041
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,521
I just knew that our
ship had come in.

1042
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,489
So, tell me, Mr. B.

1043
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:29,597
How much are the lives
of that cutie-pie wife,

1044
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:33,121
and little bun in the oven
of yours worth to ya, hm?

1045
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,422
What about your little girl?

1046
01:04:37,523 --> 01:04:40,074
(Roland whines)

1047
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:43,846
Isabella?

1048
01:04:43,945 --> 01:04:45,702
Something really scary
and bad can happen--

1049
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:46,802
(Roland screams)

1050
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,900
(thuds)
(tense music)

1051
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,536
- Get back!
(animal snarls)

1052
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:52,905
Go on, bear, go on, bear.

1053
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:54,106
- What is he doing?

1054
01:04:54,206 --> 01:04:56,208
You can't flaping bring
that thing in here.

1055
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,110
You can't bring
that thing in here!

1056
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,480
- Signed, sealed and delivered.

1057
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:02,597
As promised.

1058
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,119
- Get behind me, Poppy.

1059
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:08,603
- That is not a Bigfoot.

1060
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,458
- It's your brother.
- What?

1061
01:05:12,557 --> 01:05:14,976
- You heard him, your
brother, not a Bigfoot.

1062
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:18,947
- That's, that's Wayne?

1063
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:21,766
That's our Wayne?

1064
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:23,135
But Mom said that he--

1065
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:25,271
- Mom lied to ya, sweet pea.

1066
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:26,887
Your mom had a lot of secrets.

1067
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,009
(suspenseful music)

1068
01:05:30,108 --> 01:05:33,527
(woman pants and grunts)

1069
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,748
- What's momma to do?

1070
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,853
Not clip the wings
of her baby bird.

1071
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,909
Cradle you.

1072
01:06:03,009 --> 01:06:05,726
And coddle you in
my arms forever.

1073
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,630
No!

1074
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:13,452
Our divine mother
gives us obstacles,

1075
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,521
and those obstacles provide
us with the nutrients

1076
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:20,259
of opportunity for the
growth of our species.

1077
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:23,010
You are my challenge!

1078
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:27,081
You are the fruit
of a mother's labor!

1079
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,670
Left out to spoil in the sun!

1080
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:34,039
You will rise out of the ashes,

1081
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:38,244
and your scars will be proof
that you cannot be taken down

1082
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:42,315
by mere mortal men!
(whip cracks)

1083
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:43,815
(gasps)

1084
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,539
- What in God's name?

1085
01:06:55,746 --> 01:06:58,230
- Their parents are
already searching for them.

1086
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,715
We don't have much
time, I need you, baby.

1087
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,570
If I'm to keep this
place going, I need you.

1088
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,706
I need you to be strong for me.

1089
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:10,809
This'll just be
our secret, okay?

1090
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:11,909
Okay?

1091
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:21,721
Now, I need you, I need
you to get that bear

1092
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,538
that you shot that's
still in the walk-in.

1093
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,139
I need you to bring me his paw.

1094
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,543
You gotta be quick.

1095
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:33,414
(dark electronic music)

1096
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,243
- Wayne?

1097
01:08:17,342 --> 01:08:18,342
Wayne.

1098
01:08:18,442 --> 01:08:19,442
Wayne, it's me.

1099
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:20,627
It's Pop tart.

1100
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,551
(Wayne squeals)
(screams)

1101
01:08:26,652 --> 01:08:28,936
- Calm down, calm down.

1102
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,858
You're okay, you're okay.

1103
01:08:32,957 --> 01:08:35,493
Time to take the armor off.

1104
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:37,962
You and me both, okay, bear?

1105
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:40,481
Can you be brave for me, bear?

1106
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,805
It's okay, bear.

1107
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:47,905
It's okay.

1108
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,025
Oh, baby.

1109
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:52,862
Oh, baby.

1110
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:57,149
This off now, let
you see what the

1111
01:08:57,248 --> 01:08:59,100
real world looks like.

1112
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,293
(Roland whimpers)

1113
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,310
- You killed those
two girls, Wayne?

1114
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:13,782
Wayne.

1115
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,969
And that camper girl?

1116
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,572
Those are innocent
people, Wayne.

1117
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:20,671
- Who's innocent?

1118
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,341
The boy's handicapped!

1119
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,042
- He's not a boy,
he's a grown ass man,

1120
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:26,458
and if you ask me, you're just
as much to blame as he is,

1121
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:27,957
so I would shut
it, if I were you!

1122
01:09:28,056 --> 01:09:29,715
- He's never hurt you, has he?

1123
01:09:29,814 --> 01:09:30,814
Let him be.

1124
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,326
- You wanna wipe
the slate clean?

1125
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:34,426
- Yeah.

1126
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,122
- He can't be here anymore.

1127
01:09:37,222 --> 01:09:38,805
Either you do it, or I will.

1128
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,676
You got your orders.

1129
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,514
- He is what will always
be great about humanity.

1130
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:51,685
No matter how deep
the shooot gets...

1131
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:55,623
(sighs)

1132
01:09:56,074 --> 01:09:57,358
His spirit is undying.

1133
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,331
God damn national monument.

1134
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,601
Come here, bear.

1135
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:15,877
I swore to your momma
I'd protect ya until
your last breath.

1136
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:21,315
I can't let 'em take
you away in chains, boy.

1137
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:27,886
(thud)
(Poppy gasps)

1138
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,018
(gun fires)

1139
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:42,136
(suspenseful music)

1140
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,342
(faint heartbeat thuds)

1141
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,456
Y'all ain't even
my flaping kids.

1142
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,095
- Jesus flap, Annie!

1143
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,185
- Burl and I had unfinished
business I just finished.

1144
01:11:13,284 --> 01:11:15,020
- I am done with
this flaping shooot!

1145
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:17,256
I am done with your
flaping schemes!

1146
01:11:17,355 --> 01:11:18,591
I'm out, okay?

1147
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,659
- Just try and hold
it together, Penelope!

1148
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,760
Okay?

1149
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:25,813
We're almost done here.

1150
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:30,101
Now, kindly remove the
gag from Mr. Baumgarner,

1151
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,787
and we can get down to
business, do you understand?

1152
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,854
(Roland pants)

1153
01:11:49,954 --> 01:11:51,356
- You crazy bitches.

1154
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:53,814
- I've always wanted to ask
you something, Mr. Baumgarner.

1155
01:11:53,913 --> 01:11:54,913
Face to face.

1156
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,078
You never camped here.

1157
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,012
You don't know us.

1158
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:03,484
So, our family, our
story, our history,

1159
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,186
was that just
about money to you?

1160
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,507
- What's wrong with money?

1161
01:12:09,608 --> 01:12:12,978
- Nothing's wrong with money,
(chuckles) we love money.

1162
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:15,274
This little adventure that
we are currently engaged in

1163
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,315
is entrepreneurial in nature.

1164
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,966
- I bet this was so cute.

1165
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:24,605
- Oh, yeah, babe.

1166
01:12:24,706 --> 01:12:26,546
You have no idea how
deep inside of you I am.

1167
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:30,110
Every man has to answer
for his sins, Roland.

1168
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,180
flap, just as Burl.

1169
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,567
- What about Burl?

1170
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:36,667
- What about Burl?

1171
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:38,319
Pictures and the laptop, please.

1172
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:43,423
Oh, thank you.

1173
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,278
I realize there needs
to be incentives

1174
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:48,229
for both parties for a deal.

1175
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,717
- Yeah, us backward folk,
we got lots of cousins,

1176
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,034
like cousin Kara?

1177
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,306
She thinks you're
gross, by the way.

1178
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,198
- So, what do you say, Roland?

1179
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:10,935
Shall we commence with the
first official business

1180
01:13:11,036 --> 01:13:14,421
transaction for the newly
reopened Merrymaker camp ground?

1181
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,242
- Transaction?
- Mm-hm!

1182
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:21,313
6523343013, know that number?

1183
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:23,898
Yeah, that one just
happens to be my fave.

1184
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,533
I'm gonna need
the password, hon.

1185
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:30,104
- The password is
blow me, bitch.

1186
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,760
- I need that money
to get out of here,

1187
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:36,761
so you're gonna
flaping cooperate.

1188
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:39,230
- Or we can do this the I'm
your biggest fan misery way.

1189
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,766
It's totally up to you, but
I really don't wanna have to

1190
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:44,369
go after the wife and the kids
and the white picket fence.

1191
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:45,586
I'm fuckin' tired, Ro.

1192
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:53,612
- Double one, three, oh.
(Anita sighs)

1193
01:13:53,712 --> 01:13:54,712
Isabella (mumbles).

1194
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:00,719
- (chuckles) What is this?

1195
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:01,819
- What is it?

1196
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:08,060
- There's gotta be another
account or something, right?

1197
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,395
Is this where you need to
put the minimum balance, or--

1198
01:14:10,496 --> 01:14:12,771
- I thought you said that
this was hundreds of thousands

1199
01:14:12,872 --> 01:14:14,389
of dollars?
- Just shut up, Penelope.

1200
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:16,769
You wrote a best-seller,
10 million copies sold.

1201
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:18,485
Where's the money, Roland?

1202
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:20,988
- Who do you think I am?

1203
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,457
Steven flaping King?

1204
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,011
I've written one book.

1205
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,947
From which the distribution
takes a cut, agent fees,

1206
01:14:29,046 --> 01:14:32,184
manager fees, flaping
attorney fees, all plus tax!

1207
01:14:32,283 --> 01:14:33,719
- Oh, my god, this is pathetic.

1208
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:36,770
- No, what's pathetic is that
my wife makes the real money.

1209
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:41,208
If it wasn't for her--
- Wait!

1210
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,677
He flaping writes a new book.

1211
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:45,963
- [Anita] What?

1212
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,581
- We just gave him
the perfect story.

1213
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,841
He survived a Bigfoot attack!

1214
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,854
- You do need a hit, Roland,
be good for your ego.

1215
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,710
And apparently the Bigfoot
is very popular right now.

1216
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,345
- Yeah, he writes
a Bigfoot book,

1217
01:15:01,445 --> 01:15:04,515
he gets to live, and the
checks start coming in,

1218
01:15:04,615 --> 01:15:06,784
like from donors or something,

1219
01:15:06,885 --> 01:15:09,036
and we never have to
flaping see him again.

1220
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,458
- Oh, Poppy. (chuckles)

1221
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:16,077
This is turning out so
much better than I planned.

1222
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:17,945
Okay!

1223
01:15:18,262 --> 01:15:20,599
With a down payment
today, of course.

1224
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:22,868
So, uh, Mr. Baumgarner.

1225
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:25,703
I would like to be the first
to thank you for your generous,

1226
01:15:25,804 --> 01:15:28,774
albeit paltry 18,000 dollar
donation to the Merrymaker

1227
01:15:28,873 --> 01:15:32,310
camp grounds memorial
and conservation fund.

1228
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:34,779
So, about how long, just
ballpark, do you think

1229
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,279
it's gonna take to whip out a
first draft of this new book?

1230
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,904
- Just shoot me.

1231
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:50,511
- Ah.

1232
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:56,984
That would be what's referred
to as a bad business decision.

1233
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:02,222
Do we have a deal or what?

1234
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,342
- Do I have a choice?

1235
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:05,443
- No.

1236
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:11,032
- Three months, no
more than 300 pages.

1237
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,220
- I could live with that.

1238
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:17,037
And you're gonna live with that.

1239
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,527
Okay, (chuckles) that is a deal.

1240
01:16:21,627 --> 01:16:22,793
- [Roland] Deal.

1241
01:16:22,894 --> 01:16:24,650
- [Anita] What do you
say we untie the man?

1242
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:25,751
- Alright.

1243
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,820
(Roland groans)

1244
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,893
- Take it easy gettin' up out
of the chair there, Ro-Ro.

1245
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,194
Probably smart a bit.

1246
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,682
- Oh, flap.

1247
01:16:44,783 --> 01:16:47,152
(ominous music)

1248
01:16:47,252 --> 01:16:49,020
(Poppy yelps)

1249
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:50,520
(pants)

1250
01:16:50,988 --> 01:16:52,707
- [Anita] Come on,
bud, you're not a hero.

1251
01:16:52,806 --> 01:16:54,025
- Just shut up, okay?

1252
01:16:54,126 --> 01:16:56,261
Or I will blow your
flaping tits off,

1253
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,079
and burn this shooot heap to
the ground, so help me god.

1254
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,684
- That's a tranq gun, you doof.

1255
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,305
- Is that right, Pops?

1256
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:09,023
(Poppy groans)

1257
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,591
Ah, you stay right there.

1258
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:16,280
Now, give me the keys
of your flaping truck.

1259
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,381
Okay?

1260
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,466
- Roland, you got nothing.

1261
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:22,837
I would not be so quick
to rush home to the wife,

1262
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:26,623
if I were you.

1263
01:17:26,724 --> 01:17:28,283
- If I were you, I'd
go flap yourself.

1264
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,863
And by the way, no deal.

1265
01:17:31,962 --> 01:17:34,015
No flaping Bigfoot deal.

1266
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,449
Bigfoot is so played out.

1267
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,771
- I really don't think
that you are considering

1268
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:43,041
the ripples that these
actions will take.

1269
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:46,394
- Oh, I have thought
about the ripples.

1270
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:50,597
(gun cocks)

1271
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:55,988
I'm gonna kill you,
but before I kill you,

1272
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:58,372
I'm gonna answer your
flaping question.

1273
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,908
You wanna know why
I chose this place?

1274
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:08,667
It's because people
in the real world

1275
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:11,152
don't give a flap
what happens out here.

1276
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,740
That's why it's called the
middle of fuckin' nowhere, okay?

1277
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:19,845
Whatever you say, doesn't
flaping mean shooot in my world.

1278
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:21,680
So, yeah, the answer is yes.

1279
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:24,949
You and your fucked up camp
and your fucked up family

1280
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:27,351
paid for my dream house, now
give me the flaping keys,

1281
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,869
so I can get the
flap home, okay?

1282
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,940
The flaping keys, now.

1283
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,078
That's right.

1284
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:48,724
Oh, shooot.

1285
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,460
(ominous tones)

1286
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,780
You stay right there.

1287
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:59,350
(animal snarls)
(yells)

1288
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:02,802
(dark electronic music)

1289
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:24,692
(Anita grunts)

1290
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,792
(flesh squelches)

1291
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:02,296
(Anita grunts)

1292
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:12,338
(Anita screams)

1293
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:19,012
(moody electronic music)

1294
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:55,649
(suspenseful music)

1295
01:20:57,153 --> 01:21:02,189
(dog barks)
(car door opens and closes)

1296
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:07,661
(tires screech)
(dog barks)

1297
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,564
(muffled clunk)

1298
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:33,354
- Oh, my god.

1299
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:35,273
Oh, my god!

1300
01:21:35,372 --> 01:21:37,442
No, shh, baby.

1301
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,542
Oh!

1302
01:21:38,877 --> 01:21:40,612
What happened to you?

1303
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:42,881
Who did this to you?

1304
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,980
Shh, shh.

1305
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:45,699
Baby, what happened?

1306
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:47,018
Tell me.

1307
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:49,921
Roland.
(Roland mumbles)

1308
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,939
Look at me, baby, what
happened, what happened?

1309
01:21:52,038 --> 01:21:53,038
Who did this to you?

1310
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:55,426
Ro, who did this to you?

1311
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:56,976
- I was attacked.

1312
01:21:58,046 --> 01:21:59,564
- By who?

1313
01:21:59,663 --> 01:22:01,064
Roland?

1314
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:02,416
Who did this to you?

1315
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:07,988
Who?

1316
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:09,990
- Bigfoot.

1317
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,560
(chokes)

1318
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:18,698
- [Christine] Honey,
look at me, look at me.

1319
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:31,412
(knocks)

1320
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:43,574
- Kara.
- Oh, hi, Christine.

1321
01:22:43,675 --> 01:22:46,211
Um, is Roland around?

1322
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,828
- No, he's not home right now.

1323
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:51,349
- Okay, um, is he okay?

1324
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:52,884
I heard he was attacked or--

1325
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:55,287
- He's doing much
better now, thank you.

1326
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:57,203
But he resigned
from the university.

1327
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,340
- Are you guys moving?

1328
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:03,028
That's exciting, where to?

1329
01:23:03,127 --> 01:23:05,047
- Is there something I
can help you with, Kara?

1330
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:08,916
- [Kara] Yeah, sorry.

1331
01:23:09,015 --> 01:23:11,052
Yeah, I was cleaning my
apartment, and found this.

1332
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,909
I figured you should
probably want it back.

1333
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:14,488
- Mystery solved, thank you.
- Yeah.

1334
01:23:14,587 --> 01:23:17,641
Well, you know,
whatever happens, I
hope at least inspires,

1335
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:20,327
you know, some good writing,
he's a good teacher.

1336
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,819
- [Christine] Well, I'll
let him know you stopped by.

1337
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,957
- (chuckles) Yeah, I mean,

1338
01:23:25,057 --> 01:23:27,373
he always told me to take my
work really seriously, so...

1339
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:31,404
- I thought all work and no
play makes Ro-Ro a dull boy?

1340
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:48,255
(somber atmospheric music)

1341
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,560
I'm sorry, did I startle you?

1342
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,003
- What, what's this?

1343
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,908
- It's the missing key.
- I know, where'd you find it?

1344
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,329
- Kara had it.

1345
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:13,430
- Oh.

1346
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,582
I didn't know you gave her one.

1347
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:17,618
- I didn't.

1348
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,889
- [Roland] When did she
come by, when'd you see her?

1349
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:27,479
- So, um, Penguin called.

1350
01:24:27,578 --> 01:24:30,215
And, uh, offered me an
assistant editor position,

1351
01:24:30,314 --> 01:24:32,384
and I've agreed to take it.

1352
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,488
Contingent that they publish
my first attempt at a novel.

1353
01:24:36,587 --> 01:24:37,921
That's what this is.

1354
01:24:38,021 --> 01:24:40,606
- Oh my, (chuckles)
honey, that's amazing.

1355
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:43,010
Why didn't you tell me before?

1356
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:48,332
- 'Cause I just recently
figured out how to end it.

1357
01:24:48,432 --> 01:24:50,702
You know all horror
stories end the same way.

1358
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:53,003
You gotta kill the
monster, right?

1359
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:54,605
(Roland chuckles)

1360
01:24:54,706 --> 01:24:57,141
- This is huge, I
can't wait to read it.

1361
01:24:57,242 --> 01:24:58,600
It's gonna be your
first big hit.

1362
01:24:58,699 --> 01:25:00,579
- Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves here.

1363
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:05,131
- I know I keep saying it, but,

1364
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:09,837
maybe this whole thing was
really a blessing in disguise.

1365
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,506
No pain, no gain, right?

1366
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:15,975
- If you believe
that kind of thing.

1367
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,581
- What'd you find to write
about that was so horrifying?

1368
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,055
- All kinds of things I wish
I didn't know about you.

1369
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:00,622
- Oh, no.

1370
