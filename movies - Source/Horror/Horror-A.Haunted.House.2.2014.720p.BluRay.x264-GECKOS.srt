1
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,387
Help me get her in the car, Ray!

2
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,222
Okay, but this bitch
heavy as hell, Cuz!

3
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,598
Nigga, get yo' hands off her ass!

4
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,392
Let me finger gangbang
her at least, homie!

5
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,895
- Just help me get it off of her!
- Okay, one finger then!

6
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,898
A'right, but we ain't
goin' inside, homie.

7
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,399
We gonna go around
the emergency loop...

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
roll her ass out like
we do all the homies...

9
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,903
that get shot in the hood, homie.

10
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,737
Why you snuff her
fine ass anyway, homie?

11
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:11,948
I wanted to bone, Cuz.

12
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,740
- She was possessed, Ray!
- Possessed?

13
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:16,409
Possessed like head spinnin'
around vomitin' everywhere?

14
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,579
Or like possessed like Kanye
when you take a picture of him?

15
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,748
Just drive like you
got warrants, please!

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,584
Nigga, I do got warrants! Look!

17
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,585
These right here! Jaywalkin'!

18
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:28,421
For eating grapes in the grocery
store without payin' for 'em!

19
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,257
Shavin' my dog's balls in public.

20
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,343
Drivin' with my hands
off the wheel, Cuz.

21
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,929
I be ghost-drivin' my whip, Cuz.
I like doin' that shit, homie.

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,847
An altercation with my Moms,
homie, but she provoked me, Cuz!

23
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,225
- Ray-Ray, I think she's waking.
- All right, here! Take this...

24
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,228
and pistol-whip her
with the butt of the gun.

25
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,603
I'm not pistol-whippin'
my girlfriend!

26
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,884
A'right, nigga, well, you drive
and I'll pistol-whip that bitch!

27
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:50,694
- Kisha, resist!
- But you didn't!

28
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:54,145
I've seen you for the
bitch that you are, Malcolm.

29
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,367
- What's she talkin' 'bout, homie?
- Booty pirates!

30
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:00,567
- Nuttin', she's possessed, man.
- S'right, you fucker!

31
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,206
He's a ghost buster!

32
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,459
That sound real suspect
back there, homie.

33
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,793
Was you in juvie, Cuz?

34
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:09,212
If you don't cry you ain't
no bitch in there, homie.

35
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,966
I didn't cry. Doodles on
they. Joke's on them, Cuz.

36
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:15,719
By the power vested to me,
that somebody gave me...

37
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,388
while I was locked up...

38
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:19,681
- Who are you?
- It's Father Williams, homie.

39
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,891
She do a mean impression
of that nigga, Cuz.

40
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,978
I do a mean impression
of The Butler. Check it:

41
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,563
"I'm here for the boss.
I'm here to serve the boss."

42
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,733
- Who are you?
- I'm Forest Whitaker, homie.

43
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:29,942
From the movie that's
like "The Help" but...

44
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,401
He didn't doo-doo
in the pie, homie.

45
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,903
Ray, I'm not talkin' to you!
I'm talkin' to Kisha. Ray!

46
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,906
Are you gonna let that
bitch choke you out, Cuz?

47
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,274
You a bitch, homie...

48
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,329
- Get the fuck off me!
- Kisha! Kisha!

49
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,331
Shit, she breathed
in my face, homie.

50
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,165
I'll get the bird
ﬂu, it's contagious...

51
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,375
She blacked out, Ray.

52
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,502
Hurry, we don't have much
time! Get us to the hospital.

53
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,502
Hurry!

54
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,156
Ray? Ray?

55
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,204
Oh, shit!

56
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,641
Oh, my God!

57
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,852
Kisha?

58
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,253
Kisha!

59
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,759
Ray? Ray!

60
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,698
It's a good thing I drank
that Hennessy earlier.

61
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,533
I can't feel shit, homie!

62
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,284
- I think Kisha's dead.
- Good!

63
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,233
Let's get the tuck
outta here, homie!

64
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:26,664
Listen. We were never here.

65
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,211
- I'm with you, Cuz.
- All right. Deuces!

66
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,158
We ghost hunters!

67
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,390
I don't know about
this place, baby.

68
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,518
You've said that about
every house we looked at.

69
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,686
There's just something creepy
about this place, like...

70
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,521
give me the heebie-jeebies...

71
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,272
like somethin' bad
happened in here.

72
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,926
Well, I love it. And I love you.

73
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,362
There you go, bribin'
me with vagina.

74
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:59,531
- Whatever works.
- Know when I'm weak.

75
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,935
Disgusting.

76
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,203
Oh, it's disgusting
when we do it...

77
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:05,704
but when you kissing
the whole entire...

78
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,539
sophomore class it's cool, huh?

79
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,209
Gimme that damn
camera, you little gnat!

80
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,711
- Finger. Real creative.
- Cut her some slack.

81
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,295
She's just goin' through a phase.

82
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,881
Yeah, a phase. It's called "whore."

83
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,884
- Look at that. Last a lifetime.
- Malcolm, stop!

84
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,718
No, see, that's a phase.

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,264
Looks like he met an
imaginary friend. It's normal.

86
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,391
What you doin' there, buddy?
Wanna help me load some boxes?

87
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:28,261
- Cool!
- A'right. My man!

88
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,896
- Sorry, Malcolm. I can't.
- Why not?

89
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,651
Tony says, "Aw, hell
no! I ain't yo' slave!"

90
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,821
Is it me or does his
imaginary friend sound black?

91
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,322
Pretty progressive.

92
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,283
Why don't you and
your friend go play?

93
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,187
Okay. That game sounds like fun!

94
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,024
I don't like the
tripping game, Tony.

95
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,336
Look at all that sexy. Come here.

96
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,536
Gimme a kiss. Let's piss
off your forefathers.

97
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,177
Malcolm, it's 2013.

98
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,387
Interracial relationships
are not a big deal anymore.

99
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,473
Yeah, you tell that to the sistas.

100
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,350
You know, they be like,
"Oh, I know he didn't!"

101
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,521
"He did not kiss that
pasty ass white bitch!"

102
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,189
Pasty?

103
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,315
"Yes! Not with them
old thin ass lips.

104
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,817
Look at them, look
like baloney slices!"

105
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,362
"See he spray scrippin' and
it don't make no damn sense."

106
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,699
Come here, Shiloh Junior.
There's my baby boy.

107
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,701
I still can't believe you
named our dog Shiloh Junior.

108
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,372
Well, I was gonna name him
Shiloh ll or Shiloh the Sequel...

109
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,168
but he wouldn't answer to
those, so Shiloh Junior it is.

110
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,170
C'mon! Hey, come on, Shiloh Junior.

111
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,338
Babe, are you gettin' this?

112
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,757
I don't understand your
obsession with cameras.

113
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,343
Hey, you can never have
too many cameras, okay?

114
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,386
Hey, Shiloh! Come on, baby.

115
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,471
You ready to go see your
new house, Shiloh Junior?

116
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,307
Come on, Shiloh
Junior. Shiloh Junior!

117
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,307
Hey, get inside.

118
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,850
Don't make me put
bass in my voice. Hey!

119
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,851
Shiloh!

120
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:54,129
God, I don't know
what's wrong with him.

121
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,526
Shit! Breathe!

122
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,100
I'm gonna call 9-1-1!

123
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,865
Call 9-1-1. Tell
'em the dog is white!

124
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,367
Tell 'em the dog is white!

125
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,737
Oh, God. I got a pulse.
Breathe! Shiloh, like this...

126
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,903
Fuck! Oh, my back!
Oh my fuckin' back!

127
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,908
Please, help me!

128
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,911
My fuckin' dog is a pancake!

129
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,918
Get me a goddamn pump!

130
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,966
It's working! Come on!

131
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,685
Meet me at the hospital!

132
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,853
The hospital's that way!

133
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,495
So young, never had a
chance to lick his balls.

134
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,372
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm good.

135
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:57,167
You know, I'm just so happy
I got to spend time with Shi...

136
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,161
It's just every time I try
and say the name Shiii...

137
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,709
Shiloh!

138
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,543
Oh, God, it hurts! Oh, God!

139
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,555
It's tingly in... Oh God!

140
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,735
I'm goin' with you! Oh, God!

141
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,230
Time to go, bye-bye.

142
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,567
Shiloh!

143
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,026
Junior.

144
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,632
You could put a whole lot
of birth control in that.

145
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,300
I really hate you.

146
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:49,829
That's what your daddy said.
That's why the nigga gone.

147
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,471
What've you got there?

148
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:54,141
An old box that I
found in the basement.

149
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,310
Don't you think we should
return it to the prior owners?

150
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,213
If they wanted it, they would've
taken it in the first place.

151
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,149
Okay, look, Becky,
I'm not your dad.

152
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:05,819
I'm just the guy
that's like... your mom.

153
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,613
So I'll make you a deal.
I'll let you keep the box...

154
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,824
if you promise to try and make
this work between me and you, okay?

155
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,853
- It's for your mom.
- Fine.

156
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,237
I think we're gettin' somewhere.

157
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:22,336
- ¿Qué pasa, mi amigo?
- ¿Qué pasó, hombre?

158
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,838
Aqui nomás, me tiene trabajando
como negro. Está cabrón.

159
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,081
No habla español.

160
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,762
I just do that when I'm talkin'
to negritos. It's all good.

161
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,806
- Did he just call me a nigger?
- What's goin' on, bro?

162
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:35,640
We just moved in with
my girl right here...

163
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:38,309
and we was just wonderin' maybe if
you want to add us to your route?

164
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,312
Are you serious? Dude,
I live here, puto!

165
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,815
- It's my house!
- Oh shit! I'm sorry.

166
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,317
I just assumed... you got
the gloves and the hat...

167
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,485
and the lawnmower and the truck.

168
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,822
'Cause I'm Mexican I must be Jose!

169
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:50,822
Are you?

170
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,325
- No, fool! My name is Miguel!
- Is that your truck?

171
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,827
- Yeah, that's my truck!
- Then who's Jose?

172
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,163
That's my middle name. You
wanna guess my last name?

173
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,206
You guys are here,
you might as well.

174
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,542
I don't know. Rodriguez?

175
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,501
- That's racist, bro.
- You asked...

176
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,171
- Did he ask me or what?
- I'm just fuckin' with you!

177
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:09,173
For the record, my
name is Miguel Jose...

178
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,260
Jesús González... Smith.

179
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,764
Wait, wait, wait. Your
last name is Smith?

180
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,212
Yeah, I'm Mexican on my mom's side.

181
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:21,854
So, why is there
González on your truck?

182
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:24,690
Shit, would you trust your
garden to a guy named Smith?

183
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,567
True. True. Hey, my
name is Malcolm, bro.

184
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,196
- I bet your last name is Johnson.
- See, that's some racist shit!

185
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,644
- Am I right?
- But you're right!

186
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,284
Nice to meet you, man.

187
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:38,120
Yeah, it's a pleasure meeting you!

188
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,620
I can cut your grass on Tuesdays.

189
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,149
What can I say, I'm a
gardener by ethnic default.

190
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,945
Be good, negrito! Watch out, guera!

191
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,465
What? You gonna try
and tease a brother?

192
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,674
That's a invite? Come
here, let's do the quickie.

193
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,302
One, two, I'm done.

194
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,721
- What's that?
- What? Oh! That's Abigail.

195
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,432
I found her in the
wardrobe that was left here.

196
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,143
Well, put it back. Hey, stop!

197
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:02,144
She's creepy!

198
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,605
- We look alike.
- Yeah, same eyes and pigtails.

199
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,883
Wait, no, no, don't
put it on the bed!

200
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,735
How you doin'?

201
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,833
Oh, you ain't gonna
say nothin', huh?

202
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,202
So... Girl you stupid.

203
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,173
You don't want none
of this? Come here.

204
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,043
I can't play with it but you can.

205
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,889
Oh, you gonna bite
my lip? Take that!

206
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,600
You fuckin' like this!
It was gonna come.

207
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,595
It was gonna come!

208
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,058
Just wanna put the tip in. I'm
gonna put the tip in a minute...

209
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,057
Look at that.

210
00:10:58,493 --> 00:10:59,701
You got that goody.

211
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,230
Bite the pillow, bite
that fuckin' pillow.

212
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,543
You gonna eat my
butt now. Oh, shit!

213
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:12,575
Nigga... she... she lickin' that.

214
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,384
Oh, you taste like
doo-doo. But I love it!

215
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,220
You on the pill? I don't
wanna get you pregnant.

216
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,554
You wanna little doll babies?

217
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:20,889
They gonna have my
eyes or yo' eyes...

218
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,087
You gonna give me splinters!

219
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,048
Fuck this shit, man. I wanna cry!

220
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,697
Don't look. Don't
look. Hold on a second.

221
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,201
This side is wet with
soap, this one is dry.

222
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,702
I'll clean you up, baby.

223
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,203
I mighta leaked in you.

224
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,206
I don't know if I came,
I leaked a little bit.

225
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,875
That's a'right. You
ain't even ovulatin'.

226
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,245
Why you trippin'?
Come on, stop worrying.

227
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,745
- Honey, we're home!
- Shit! You gotta go!

228
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,556
- Shit! No!
- Malcolm!

229
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:06,559
- Hi, honey!
- Honey, where are you?

230
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,729
You gotta go! We...
I'm just upstairs!

231
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,255
You gotta get outta here.

232
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,571
Fuck!

233
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,938
Shit!

234
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,655
"Hanging Out".

235
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,948
Sounds a little soft for
my taste, but... fuck it.

236
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,210
Yeah, I don't think this is right.

237
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,883
Maybe I should download the manual.

238
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,756
I seen some shit,
but that was crazy!

239
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:31,227
A demonic figure tried to
hang a family in the backyard.

240
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:33,480
I gotta keep this from
Megan and the kids.

241
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,481
Is it weird that I
was aroused by this?

242
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,884
Why is my dick bending in my jeans?

243
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,894
Hello?

244
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:48,662
Hello?

245
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:52,832
- Twinkle little star...
- Who is this? Hello!

246
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,326
It's the Devil!

247
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,346
That's a ugly motherfucker.

248
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,624
Is that Steven Tyler?

249
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,587
What the hell? Same tree!

250
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,761
Shit! Kisha?

251
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,533
Baby, what you doin'!

252
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,536
I almost dumped the fuck out you!

253
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,203
You got to holler at me!

254
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,706
You can't just be walkin' up.

255
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,167
You gotta give me like
a "whoop-ti-whoo"...

256
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,835
a "kakow!" or a "tsh-tsh"!

257
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:39,171
Just make your own up.
Please announce yourself!

258
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,950
Honey, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

259
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,549
I think I did.

260
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,845
Wait. So now I look like a ghost.

261
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,346
Excuse me, where
you goin' with this?

262
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,514
So now I'm too pasty for you?

263
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,392
I can't do anything about that!

264
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,852
Unless you want me to get
skin cancer from the sun.

265
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,520
And what, deep nasty wrinkles...

266
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,688
and then they'll have
to give me chemo...

267
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,524
and I'll lose all my hair,
and then I'll look like...

268
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,359
a nasty bald raisin!
Is that what you want?

269
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,652
Is that what you want?

270
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,528
I don't want you to
look like a raisin!

271
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,198
I don't like to date raisins,
I don't like the raisins...

272
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,658
on Morgan Freeman's face!

273
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,910
I don't like the new
ones that Obama got...

274
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,870
the young raisins on his face!

275
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:17,375
I don't like raisins. So
please, don't look like a raisin.

276
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,030
I need to go meditate and
get my chi back in alignment.

277
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,082
What chi? It was just...

278
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,312
- Walk to the light!
- It's bedtime.

279
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,649
What you all dressed up
for? We goin' to a club?

280
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,485
Formal party? We
goin' to a Pajama Jam?

281
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,278
- Just bed.
- Come on, Megan.

282
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,655
You gotta be more comfortable
with this relationship...

283
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,572
You're right.

284
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,450
Put on some sweat pants and some...

285
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,328
Oh, my Jesus Lord! You're naked!

286
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,331
I am. I like being naked, though.

287
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,334
I could be naked all day.

288
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,671
All day? But come on,
that's not practical, hon.

289
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:03,922
You got a job.

290
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:07,174
You don't wanna be on the bus
naked or in Starbucks naked.

291
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:07,842
Why not?

292
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:09,845
'Cause that coffee
spill on you, it's hot!

293
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,428
It's gonna leave a scar.

294
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,878
Melt one of your
nipples off or somethin'.

295
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,350
The camera's on, baby.

296
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,846
Good. Just make sure
you film my good side.

297
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,692
What the fuck? Are you serious?

298
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,485
We gonna get all angles on that...

299
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,945
Oh, shit.

300
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:29,865
Baby, your creepy doll
is makin' my dick scared.

301
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,700
Just let her watch.

302
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:34,854
You just said the right
type of nasty shit!

303
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,869
Oh, God! I gotta
replenish my ﬂuids.

304
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,039
After round two.

305
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,346
- That was wild.
- Come here, Malcolm.

306
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,966
What, aren't you done yet?

307
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,690
I am now. Ready for round three?

308
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,807
Seriously...

309
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,489
No más. No más. Oh, my God!

310
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,866
Baby, you gotta train
for some shit like this!

311
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,869
Come on, Malcolm, bell's
ringing. Time for round four.

312
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,205
No, no, baby. My ding-ding's
knocked out cold.

313
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,708
I can't do it. Corner's
throwin' in the towel!

314
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,917
Let's go, Malcolm.

315
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,071
I gotta get some Enswell if
we keep goin'! Wait, no, baby!

316
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,578
Right now she is
tearin' me up! My God!

317
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,666
Want me to choke you?
Is that what you like?

318
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,476
Stop being a bitch!

319
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:42,846
Yeah! Come on! Oh,
you want some of this?

320
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,815
You like that? It's
kinda like a blindfold...

321
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,933
except you can't fuckin' breathe!

322
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,819
- Feel like you're dyin'?
- Thing just moved!

323
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,822
Except you can't fuckin' breathe!

324
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,941
Thing was watching!

325
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,526
You little...

326
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,536
Who was watching?

327
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,689
Oh, baby, come
here. Check this out!

328
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,708
- Oh, my God!
- Did you see it?

329
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,586
- How could I not?
- I thought I was trippin'!

330
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,587
I am so fat! Look at me!

331
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,589
I look like a huge blubber ass!

332
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,425
- I'm like Miss Piggy in there!
- What're you talking about?

333
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,511
You were gonna shoot my good side.

334
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,306
I did shoot your good side.
Look, I got all that ass up in...

335
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,766
Look at all that ass, girl.

336
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,934
I'm black, brothers like an ass.

337
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,884
You know I do mean that
as a compliment, right?

338
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,605
I see what's going on.

339
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,192
You hate my vagina! You
think it's too loose!

340
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,693
It's not! It's only
on the outside...

341
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,778
but once you choose a wall,
it's pretty damn tight.

342
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,655
You know what, Malcolm,
I have had two kids!

343
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,784
I mean, do you think the stork just
dropped 'em off on the doorstep?

344
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,287
No! You're knocked
up for nine months...

345
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,454
and then your lady parts
are stretched to limits...

346
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,125
you cannot even fathom!

347
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,460
Okay, baby. I think
your vagina's cute.

348
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,337
Erase the tape or we are
never having sex again.

349
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,133
- Well, since you put it that way.
- Erase the tape!

350
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:55,301
- Okay, I'm erasin' the tape!
- I want to see you do it.

351
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,636
- I'm erasing the tape.
- Erase it right now! Do it!

352
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,182
- Baby, I like the way your vagina...
- Erase the tape!

353
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,309
It's not loose! I
like the way it sounds!

354
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,212
Sound like it was
blowin' speakers. It's...

355
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,891
You know, it's kinda
like W. Ferse's bebop!

356
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,237
Who the hell's hittin' me? Abigail?

357
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,230
You got a page?

358
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,333
"In a relationship
with Malcolm Johnson"?

359
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,501
I only hit it once!

360
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,746
What in the hell?

361
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,883
I think I might've
fucked the wrong bitch.

362
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,469
Now she's blowin' up my cell phone?

363
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,635
Look at that.

364
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:43,008
Straight up stalker! She's crazy!

365
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,185
Listen, it's time to turn
my camera game up a level.

366
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,396
I'm talkin' bathrooms,
countertops, computers...

367
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,232
stuffed animals, mouths and asses!

368
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,854
It's goin' down
everywhere! I'm live.

369
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:00,644
Kitchen? Oh, yeah, I see you.

370
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,163
Perfect. Yeah, and
I got the ass, too.

371
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,692
All inconspicuous.

372
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:12,195
Told you, cameras everywhere.

373
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,631
Hey, Becky, wanna
play Hide and Clap?

374
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,203
Fuck off!

375
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:17,674
That's, "No, thank you."

376
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,178
Let's do this. Ah,
lady's blindfold.

377
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,346
You got this out your
momma's room, right?

378
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,181
Oh, boy.

379
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,182
Things me and your
momma do with this!

380
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,184
Sometimes she tie my
hands and ﬂip me over...

381
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,354
and toss that... salad.

382
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:31,522
- Tony likes salad.
- Anyway.

383
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,301
I'll put this on. Let's do it!

384
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,779
One, two, three. First clap!

385
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,730
Come on. Come on. Gimme a clap.

386
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,869
Yeah, I'm gettin' close.

387
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,872
I smell you. I smell you.

388
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:52,210
You smell like kids, like
worms, coins and doo-doo. Like...

389
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,577
Shit!

390
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,509
Can we just play Tag next
time? I just wanna play Tag.

391
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,753
Wyatt? Wyatt?

392
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,256
Where you at, you little shit?

393
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,263
Third clap.

394
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,648
I got you, Wyatt.

395
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,911
I win! You took your blindfold off.

396
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,247
You're right, Tony.
Malcolm is an idiot.

397
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,749
Take your camera, loser.

398
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,028
Yeah, I wanna learn
how to start a fire.

399
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,825
What the... hell was that?

400
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,205
I coulda swore...

401
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,961
Shit!

402
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,544
Fucked you up!

403
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:56,217
Fuck, are you crazy!
Who the fuck are you!

404
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,234
- Malcolm! Oh my God!
- Baby?

405
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,528
You can't be jumpin' out
on brothers like that.

406
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,530
You'll get knocked the
fuck out every time.

407
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,825
- It was supposed to be a joke!
- You okay?

408
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,535
'Cause I fucked you up!

409
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,204
Like, I hit you with the
force, like with the follow-up.

410
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,414
I wanna ask they
replay that shit. Damn!

411
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,739
'Cause you got
froze. You went, "Oh!"

412
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,121
"Please help me."

413
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,750
God, I hope this works.

414
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,714
What is that thing?

415
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,097
That is not human.

416
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,695
That was weird.

417
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,586
Damn.

418
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,906
- I caught yo' ass!
- No, you didn't.

419
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,605
Bullshit!

420
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,923
Becky...

421
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,174
It's your box.

422
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,384
What?

423
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:51,711
I want you to touch me.

424
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,134
Okay.

425
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,012
Not that box.

426
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,700
You know I love you
and those kids, right?

427
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,536
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to keep you guys protected.

428
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,563
Yeah.

429
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,575
- What was that?
- What?

430
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,712
- That!
- The wind?

431
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,467
Nigga, the windows
are closed! Okay?

432
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:29,885
I'm tellin' you, that was
either a ghost or a demon.

433
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,710
Or maybe it was a demon
pregnant with a ghost.

434
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,047
Oh, this is cute!

435
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:40,673
I'm gonna so wear this,
all day, every day.

436
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,648
What if it's a burglar?

437
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,151
Why the fuck are you
excited? It's a burglar!

438
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,319
Either way it goes,
it's some scary shit!

439
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,279
Okay, not all burglars are scary.

440
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,575
- It is a burglar or a ghost!
- If you talk to him, he'll leave.

441
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,786
- You shoot it in the face!
- You've talked to him already.

442
00:24:54,787 --> 00:24:56,328
If the motherfucker's
foot do this...

443
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,705
- ...you shoot him in the face again!
- That is way too harsh.

444
00:24:58,707 --> 00:24:59,957
What're you gonna do?

445
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,376
- I'll handle it.
- What're you gonna do?

446
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,377
Shoot him.

447
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,531
You are not allowed to shoot
anyone in the face, mister!

448
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,042
Becky?

449
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,729
What in the...? Becky! Oh, God!

450
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,190
Becky! Becky!

451
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,857
Becky! Oh, my God!

452
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:30,605
- Get me somethin', Megan! Becky!
- Here's the ﬂy swatter!

453
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:40,163
That's just gross. That
fuckin' sound, it bothers me.

454
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,862
- Use this!
- Gimme!

455
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,041
- Here's what I got!
- Gimme!

456
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,682
Get that thing outta
here! I got an idea!

457
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,934
Come on! Bitch, why
ain't you movin'?

458
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,211
Fuck!

459
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,097
See, now this is a good idea.

460
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,218
A'right. G'night, Becky.

461
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,978
Night, sweetheart.

462
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,287
- Hey, buddy, what you doin'?
- Havin' a tea party.

463
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:22,623
You wanna go outside and do
somethin' a little more masculine?

464
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:26,618
- Like play some football?
- No, not really.

465
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,631
Don't sit there!
That's Tony's seat!

466
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,328
Oh, sorry.

467
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,384
My bad, Tony.

468
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:39,007
Tony says, "No problem,
bee-yotch." Want some tea?

469
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,009
Yeah.... sure.

470
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:47,679
You know, Wyatt, about
your little buddy Tony...

471
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,484
I don't think he's such
a good Influence on you...

472
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:52,182
know what I mean?

473
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,519
- What the...? That's straight vodka!
- Tony calls it tea.

474
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,622
He drinks a lot of tea.

475
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,500
I really think you guys
need to stop this friendship.

476
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,667
He doesn't think
that's such a good idea.

477
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,753
You know what, you tell Tony...

478
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,464
that I said you and him ain't
gonna be friends no more...

479
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,538
and that's final!

480
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,181
On second thought, you and Tony
have a beautiful friendship.

481
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,391
Okay, I'll be downstairs
doin' somethin'...

482
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,884
With less fuckin' chairs.

483
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:27,814
This isn't good.
It's happening again.

484
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:30,012
It's really fuckin' happening.

485
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,179
What the fuck?

486
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,855
Who is it?

487
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,032
Hello?

488
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,037
That's a spooky knock.

489
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,673
Oh, you better run!

490
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,294
Knock on my door, come
out there and slap you...

491
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,545
What the fuck!

492
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,048
I got a knife!

493
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,938
"Miss Me?" Abigail!

494
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,702
Aw, hell no! Look, we gotta talk.

495
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:26,538
This is a mistake, okay?
This shit gotta stop.

496
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,748
It's gone too far.

497
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,875
You see this? "Miss me"?

498
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,295
In the house with Megan,
are you fuckin' crazy?

499
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:36,214
I take full responsibility,
all right? This is my bad.

500
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,259
I don't mean to sound
clichéd. It's not you, it's me.

501
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,555
Don't play fuckin' innocent
with me, you knew I had a girl!

502
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,515
I'm just bein' selfish right now.

503
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,474
I would love to have
you and Megan and...

504
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,644
be honest with you,
my stuffed animals.

505
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,605
I'd like to bring them in the mix.

506
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,849
I'm tryin' to make this work.
You're just not makin' it easy.

507
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,519
I swear to... Fuck!

508
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,365
You see what you made me
do? Only you do this to me!

509
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,659
Fuckin' crazy!

510
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,983
Oh, you lucky my momma
told me, don't hit bitches!

511
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,202
Enough.

512
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,839
Fuck, you scare...

513
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,842
I didn't touch you!
I didn't touch you!

514
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,871
You get outta my life, I'll
get outta yours. I'm done.

515
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,711
Make no mistake...

516
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:34,182
after this, it's over.

517
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,843
You ready to go again? Yeah.

518
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:46,117
- Hello, Malcolm?
- Professor Wilde. How you doin'?

519
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,827
Malcolm, I'm glad you reached out.

520
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,622
What exactly am I
dealing with here?

521
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:53,375
Well, the being you
described to me is a demon!

522
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,460
Fuck, I knew it!

523
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,797
A rare and obscure one
from Babylonian times...

524
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,133
named Ahghoul. And
he's a trickster!

525
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,636
And chances are this is not your
first encounter with this demon.

526
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,472
Have you had paranormal
experiences in your past?

527
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,808
Actually, yeah. About a year ago.

528
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,054
This is way worse
than I had thought...

529
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,224
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck!

530
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,819
Nigga, I thought
somebody was shootin'!

531
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,778
Thai food!

532
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,824
It's spicy going in, but
it's twice as spicy going out!

533
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,826
That's scientifically impossible!

534
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,662
I smell you in here!
What in the hell!

535
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,064
Excuse me.

536
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,336
- I hire based on skill level.
- Are those titties?

537
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,382
Ladies, remember, we're
making meth, not baby aspirin.

538
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:45,344
All the stories revolve
around Ahghoul's attempts...

539
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,180
to trick people into
bringing him into our world...

540
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,516
and it can come in the
form of a possession...

541
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,518
a spirit that only
a child can see...

542
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,521
or an ancient object that
lures in the impressionable.

543
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:59,525
So what you're saying is something
is coming after me and my family.

544
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,359
Malcolm, that's
exactly what I'm saying.

545
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,362
Damn it, Jessica, you've got
your tit in the pseudophedrine!

546
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,864
Sorry, Malcolm. I
wish you good luck.

547
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,767
Gotta get my "Breaking Bad" on.

548
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,909
Tonight you drown.

549
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,617
Not again.

550
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,291
Sink. Sink. Sink.

551
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,561
Ruined a perfectly
good leather jacket!

552
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:40,523
That's it. Now we drown. Drown!

553
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,050
Drown!

554
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,769
Prepare to meet Hell.

555
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,313
God, that hurl!

556
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,572
My balls. This isn't over!

557
00:31:55,457 --> 00:32:00,327
Is Ahghoul the same demon
that possessed Kisha?

558
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:05,215
When are the
Republicans gonna slip...

559
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,884
and call Obama the N-word?

560
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,887
When are they gonna stop
makin' scary movies...

561
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,388
without the Wayans?

562
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,915
They fuckin' suck!

563
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,759
What the hell?

564
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,539
Steroids, bitch!

565
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,884
You messed with the
wrong nigga today!

566
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,862
Baby, put it down!
What are you doing?

567
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,364
I come in the hallway,
fuckin' creepy box...

568
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,365
with somethin' weird
fuckin' alive in it!

569
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,826
And I knew that it
was death in the box!

570
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,327
So I killed it!

571
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,539
- Baby, it was a gift!
- But it ain't Christmas.

572
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,710
- Baby, no.
- Kwanzaa?

573
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,253
You were so upset when
Shiloh Junior died...

574
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,749
that the kids and I
thought we would get you...

575
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,805
- Don't look. Don't look.
- Oh, my God!

576
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,708
Wyatt, go to your room!

577
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,351
I killed a baby.

578
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,686
Oh God, I think
it's still breathing.

579
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,522
- You're so fucking crazy.
- He's still breathing.

580
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:48,554
I gotta take him out of
misery. I gotta kill him!

581
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,568
Becky?

582
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,737
A'right, let's see
what's in this box now.

583
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:13,219
God! Wow! That stinks!

584
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,721
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing. Just...

585
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,389
You know your pillows
have blue faces on 'em?

586
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,391
- Stay away from my box!
- Calm down!

587
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,353
- Would you calm down?
- I don't wanna calm down.

588
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,896
I want you to stay
away from my box!

589
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,563
Do you have to say "box" so loud?

590
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,398
What is going on in here?

591
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,902
Nothing. We just
playin'. Dolls 'n stuff.

592
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,155
Malcolm came into my
room and touched my box.

593
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,826
- Malcolm, is this true?
- Yes, but only for like two seconds.

594
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,496
It was stinking!
Like, it was rancid!

595
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,498
Here, smell this. I don't
know how she play with that!

596
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,543
He had two fingers in
my tight little box, Mom.

597
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,585
Stop lyin'.

598
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,588
Baby, there's nothin'
tight about her box.

599
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,675
It's fuckin' huge! I could
put my whole fist in it.

600
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,762
Like, I almost was up to here
for a second. It's crazy big.

601
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,389
You said, "No means no!"

602
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,516
And that is exactly
what I said. I said "No!"

603
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,215
- I did.
- Time the fuck out.

604
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:07,313
She's trying to Dateline
Special the nigga!

605
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:09,440
Where's Chris Hansen? Chris! Chris!

606
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,527
Chris, come on, I know
you around here somewhere!

607
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,195
I know he's in here somewhere.
You tryin' to set a nigga up!

608
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,364
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Right now.

609
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,449
There's something really
strange goin' on in this house.

610
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,744
Wyatt? Wyatt, see,
Wyatt used to be my boy.

611
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,539
Like that was my lil' nigga,
like we was like boom-boom!

612
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,541
When my dog died, that
lil' nigga helped me dah!

613
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,543
But lately, he hasn't
even talked to me!

614
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,711
Like, he won't even play with me!

615
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,706
His little imaginary friend,
Tony? I don't think he's really...

616
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,802
- You're crazy, Tony.
- Imagine that.

617
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:40,306
Did you see that shit?
Look! You missed it!

618
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,807
Okay, look, forget him. Becky.

619
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,476
There's something in that
old box she carries around...

620
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:46,894
that's making her go crazy!

621
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,646
She sleeps with it,
she eats with it...

622
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,356
she even goes to
the bathroom with it!

623
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,818
Who takes a shit with
a box in their hand?

624
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,152
It's fuckin' weird!

625
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,822
And by "weird' you mean
I'm a terrible mother.

626
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,740
What? No. Wait.

627
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,159
Where did you go? Hold
on a minute. Hold on.

628
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,494
If you were just a
little less judgmental...

629
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,496
she wouldn't feel like she
needs to carry her pain...

630
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,498
- around in a "box"!
- This is not about me!

631
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,418
It is always about you, Malcolm!

632
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,670
"You're too fat, you're
a terrible parent...

633
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,880
you like black guys 'cause
they have bigger cocks!"

634
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,842
That sounds like
you! Do you see this?

635
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,844
That's not fuckin' normal!

636
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,512
Okay, she is just
trying to get attention!

637
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,849
When she was a baby,
she would cry and cry...

638
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,768
and cry all damn day in her crib...

639
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:28,186
until finally she realized
I wasn't gonna come...

640
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,271
and pick her up!

641
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,938
If you were a parent
you'd know it's called...

642
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,483
the "cry it out method", Malcolm!

643
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,650
Just pick the little bitch up!

644
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,862
She needs to learn somethin', too.

645
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,489
See what I'm saying?

646
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:43,327
- That is called parenting.
- Wow! Mother of the Year.

647
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,695
Thank you.

648
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,532
That crazy doll keyed my car!

649
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,668
Bro, somebody fucked your car up!

650
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,336
You wouldn't know anybody...

651
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,172
- ...with a auto body shop?
- Are you serious?

652
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,507
Why, contrary to popular belief...

653
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,217
all Mexicans don't have body shops.

654
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,550
What, you think we
all have low riders...

655
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,885
with a bunch of
primer all over it...

656
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:02,221
with a frickin' Mexican horn?

657
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,514
You think I have like six kids
and all my relatives livin' there?

658
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,891
Probably chase Chihuahuas
and make burritos...

659
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:06,891
is that what you think?

660
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,519
- Look at the neighborhood, man!
- I didn't think any of that!

661
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:13,550
- I just want my fuckin' car fixed!
- I'm just fuckin' with you, bro!

662
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,858
You're so easy, man. Oh, shit.

663
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,360
I got a cousin, his
name is Chucho...

664
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,862
he can hook all that
shit up, all right?

665
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,364
Stop fuckin' with
the crazy bitches.

666
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,864
I gotta go, I got the
family waiting. All right?

667
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:22,532
Be good, man!

668
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,606
Where did she go?

669
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,288
- Take it easy, vato!
- Where you goin'?

670
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,581
Goin' to the swap meet.

671
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,875
We're gonna get some Chihuahuas.

672
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,697
Now that's racist!

673
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,798
So I moved into the house across
the street and I just love it.

674
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,827
The streets are so quiet.
It's perfect for a haunting.

675
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,639
You know, I never got your name.

676
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:49,809
Kisha? What in the fuck!

677
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:53,146
- You two know each other?
- Oh! Well, yeah.

678
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,858
You know the boyfriend that
I told you abandoned me...

679
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,010
and left me in a ditch to die?

680
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,849
That's him.

681
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:04,490
- Awkward!
- Yeah!

682
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,452
I think I'll let
you two have at it.

683
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:10,664
And thank you so much,
Megan, for the coffee, really.

684
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:14,239
And, Malcolm, it
was great seeing you.

685
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,195
See you around, Malcolm.

686
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:21,541
Really?

687
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,836
How come you never
told me about her?

688
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:28,264
Well, it was just a time in my
life I just wanted to forget.

689
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:30,684
You need to star': remembering.
She was fucking beautiful!

690
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,644
- She was a'ight.
- "A'ight"?

691
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,481
- I mean, she got nice legs.
- Legs.

692
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:40,853
- Little ass, but...
- Ass. How 'bout all this?

693
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:44,822
It's fuckable. Okay? But
that's the... all this...

694
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,240
She's crazy!

695
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,327
She was crazy, baby,
like she was possessed!

696
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:51,454
- You mean she was possessive.
- No, the bitch was possessed.

697
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:52,856
- What?
- Yes!

698
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,333
First of all, she
was verbally abusive.

699
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,876
Hey, baby, what's for dinner?

700
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:59,827
Eat your mothers
pussy you fucking fuck!

701
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:03,842
It was like she gave up.

702
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,762
Eventually I was able to
drag her to couples' therapy.

703
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:09,431
Dr. Rousch, me and my girlfriend,
we're kinda goin' through...

704
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,182
a little rough patch.

705
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,351
I mean, she won't
communicate with me.

706
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,721
No matter what I do,
she just sits there.

707
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,358
Okay, and she'll
growl a little bit.

708
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,608
Yes, I can hear that.

709
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,652
And the smallest
things just set her off.

710
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,862
Like crucifixes, or questions.

711
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,731
Is that right, Kisha?

712
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,204
You got a prescription
for "crazy bitch"?

713
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,706
Oh, Malcolm, I'm so sorry.

714
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:39,657
- It sounds horrible.
- Well, wasn't all bad.

715
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,666
- Wait, I'm come.
- Shut up, you little bitch!

716
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,833
I think you just
knocked out a tooth!

717
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,306
Whose ass is this,
huh? Whose ass is this?

718
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,005
The Devil's!

719
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,717
See, now you just made it weird.

720
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,182
Look at me, goddamnit!

721
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:07,856
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

722
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,327
Oh baby, you're
makin' my toes do this.

723
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,911
You're makin' my toes do this.

724
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,414
Really, Malcolm?

725
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:18,193
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

726
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,865
What? Too soon?

727
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,844
There's somethin'
goin' on with this box.

728
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:32,043
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

729
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,884
What the heck is this
little pervert doin'?

730
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,056
Oh, dude, that is just weird!

731
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,559
Oh, really?

732
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,865
What kind of sweet
tooth fairy is this?

733
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:53,534
- This nigga need a daddy.
- "Dear Diary.

734
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:56,204
I lost my virginity to Joey today.

735
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,539
Actually, that's not totally true.

736
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,911
I mean, I've only
had sex with seven...

737
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,545
teen guys...

738
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,574
but only in the butt,
so it doesn't count."

739
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,885
"I mean, I've sucked
a lot of dicks, Diary.

740
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,721
I stopped counting after
the blowjob party...

741
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:13,804
at Ashley's house.

742
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,891
There must've been
30 or 40 guys there."

743
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,391
She ain't got no bone in her neck.

744
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:18,726
She got that Plastic Man.

745
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:23,099
"PS: Diary, I'll never
stop sucking dicks. Ever!"

746
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,860
Would you look there?

747
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:29,905
A mood ring. So, what mood is that?

748
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,907
It's called: "You're
not my father".

749
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,824
Yeah, that's bitchy
lil' white teenager.

750
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,570
See, that'll get you slapped
in most black neighborhoods.

751
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,530
Are you okay?

752
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,570
Becky?

753
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:55,681
That is some serious meat-mouth
you got goin' on there.

754
00:41:55,681 --> 00:42:00,929
It's easier going down than it
is coming up. Yeah, it's weird.

755
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,855
Breath smell like sirloin.

756
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,759
I hope that hole
cold ain't contagious.

757
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,889
Professor, it's kinda loud there.

758
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,599
Did I catch you at a bad time?

759
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,869
Endicott? I'm a sativa man.
I got important shit to do!

760
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:21,539
Hold on! I'm at a party.

761
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:24,068
I need some of my medicine.

762
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:30,958
Professor! How do I
get rid of the demon?

763
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,510
Professor! Professor!

764
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,679
Malcolm, that demon's tryin'
to get to you through...

765
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,681
your family and
he's not gonna stop!

766
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,516
You've got the
paranormal equivalent...

767
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,351
of a perfect storm, my friend!

768
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,186
Oh shit! The po-po!

769
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,688
Professor, please! What's goin' on?

770
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,856
I got 12 ounces of crystal
meth jammed up my anus.

771
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:47,940
I gotta get outta here!

772
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:49,775
- Police!
- Oh, fuck!

773
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:51,862
Professor! Professor, please!

774
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:54,697
- Hands up now!
- I can't go back in!

775
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,023
Professor! How do I
get rid of the demon?

776
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:04,902
You're under arrest! You
on the screen, freeze!

777
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,163
Hey, knothead!

778
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,717
Oh no, not my favorite
shirt. That bitch.

779
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:15,039
What the...?

780
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:19,248
Oh, my God! Are you
fucking kidding me?

781
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:22,085
No, no, no! Not my clothes! No!

782
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,442
Oh, shit! This crazy wooden bitch!

783
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:32,318
She's burning my clothes!

784
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,322
Oh, my God! Oh, it's
"Fatal Attraction".

785
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,521
She's gonna boil a rabbit!
She's gonna boil a rabbit!

786
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,496
- Can I get you somethin' to drink?
- Sure, man.

787
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:43,789
- Tequila?
- Really, bro?

788
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,791
What, you bring the
Mexican into your house and:

789
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,168
"He must want tequila, we
should give him tequila."

790
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,503
"I'm glad he parked his burro
so now I can offer him...

791
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:51,797
some of his beverage."

792
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,672
I bet you this shit
has a worm in it.

793
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,675
Should've walked in here with
a serape and a sombrero...

794
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,844
for you too, huh? That's what
you wanted really, wasn't it?

795
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:01,715
You get me all worked up, man!
Look, I could use a drink now.

796
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,184
What kind of tequila
is it? Is it silver?

797
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,519
'Cause I can't drink that
gold shit. That's for cholos.

798
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,980
- Thank you, man.
- We're becomin' friends, right?

799
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,677
Now we are.

800
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:15,362
- I could trust you with things.
- I mean, I can keep a secret, man.

801
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,655
I'm good at that shit.

802
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,197
The neighbors next door
to me don't even know...

803
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,365
there's a black
guy living here yet.

804
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,983
So, what do you wanna talk about?

805
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:25,204
Okay, you know the people that
lived in this house before me?

806
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:27,373
Was there anything
strange goin' on...

807
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,751
like were they actin'
weird or anything?

808
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,371
You saw somethin' a little...

809
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:37,175
- spooky, or supernatural...?
- I seen some shit.

810
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,302
Come on, man, you don't
believe in that, do you?

811
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,846
'Cause if you did, you
know, you'd have been like...

812
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,847
"Nigger, I'm out!
Not gonna do this."

813
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:45,349
You mean to tell me you don't
believe in the paranormal?

814
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:47,853
'Course I believe in that
shit! I'm half Mexican, bro!

815
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,521
I believe in all that shit
people don't believe in.

816
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:55,860
Freakin' La Llorona, El Cucui,
Chupacabra, Bigfoot, Obamacare.

817
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:57,528
Interracial dating. Nuclear war.

818
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,197
You name it, I'm all for it.

819
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,534
Me personally, I wouldn't
stay one night in this house.

820
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:04,702
Oh, shit!

821
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:06,788
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, bro.

822
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:09,206
When I first found out that
there was a black guy...

823
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,458
movin' in the neighborhood...

824
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,378
I was like... there goes
the property value...

825
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,380
I'm gonna have to
keep the kids inside...

826
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,547
there's gonna be gangs...

827
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:19,592
I'm gonna have to cover graffiti,
but you turned out to be okay.

828
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:20,594
You're really cool!

829
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:23,889
You're very accommodating.
I think I can help you.

830
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,041
Really.

831
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,559
I need you to cut
the chicken's neck.

832
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,894
Oh, hell fuckin' no!

833
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:31,563
You wanna get rid
of the demon or not?

834
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,565
I know, but can't we just
go down to the store...

835
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,567
- ...and just like, buy a chicken?
- No, man!

836
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:37,902
You need a blood sacrifice.

837
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:40,487
Right. Come here. Let's do it.

838
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,489
Hold on! Hold up, wait a second!

839
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,242
Let me get my shit together.

840
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,690
You gonna shit in my
baby's cereal, chicken?

841
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:51,025
You wanna piss on my
momma? In her face?

842
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,699
I'll fuck your thing!

843
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,257
Where did you get this
chicken? Your uncle's farm?

844
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,126
No! A cock fighting ring.

845
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,045
You so dead, motherfucka.

846
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:15,690
Whassup, chicken,
you scared? Whassup?

847
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,059
You don't want none
of this, motherfucker!

848
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:24,896
Bite him back,
Malcolm! Bite him back!

849
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:29,536
Drown, bitch!

850
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,565
I'll kill your ass!

851
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,157
Watch what I do to
your fuckin' baby!

852
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,659
What you doin', man? What'd you do?

853
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:46,664
This pollo is loco!

854
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,813
You got him, Malcolm! That's right!

855
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:57,090
Yeah, you fucked that chicken.

856
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,326
You gotta go to that
great bucket in the sky!

857
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,728
Tell the Colonel I said hi!

858
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,791
Shit!

859
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:18,836
That was like an intense-ass
game of Angry Birds, man!

860
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:21,840
Fuck, bro, you did it! I
think this house is clean!

861
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,675
Well, maybe not clean, but
the demon's gone for sure.

862
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:27,344
What the hell are we gonna do
with all this chicken, Malcolm?

863
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:29,748
Oh, yeah, ask the black guy.

864
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,550
Cheers. Right on!

865
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:42,181
What in the fuck!

866
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:46,780
You! This is nuts!

867
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:50,827
You hear me, you googly-eyed
bitch wanton bitch! Come on!

868
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:55,699
You're making me
bury your fuckin' ass!

869
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:02,204
Get in there!

870
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,704
Die there, bitch!

871
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:08,119
B-I-T...

872
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:10,672
Fuckin' bitch!

873
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:13,880
You want some of this?

874
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:20,356
All right, prepare
to meet your maker!

875
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:24,226
That's right, I'm sending
you back to Taiwan!

876
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,945
You smell like piss and shit!

877
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:29,815
Come on! You make me sick!

878
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,621
You know what brown can
do for me? Take this!

879
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:38,492
You sign! Get the fuck outta here!

880
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,630
See, I tried to do it the easy way.

881
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,882
Now you're gonna make me violent.

882
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:49,161
Come on, you fuck! Shut up!

883
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:55,141
How you like that, bitch?
I want you to watch.

884
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,135
Let's see you writing now!

885
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,313
Miss me? This is fun.

886
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:04,184
We about to have a
barbecue. Get in there.

887
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:06,820
Yeah! Hey, how you doin'?

888
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,690
You gonna fuckin' burn today, baby!

889
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,186
That's what fucking
hell feels like!

890
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,813
You fuckin', fuckin' doll!

891
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:46,400
I don't want you!
Just die, you little...

892
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:50,851
I'll fuckin' cut your
goddamn eye out, you bitch!

893
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,025
Malcolm!

894
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,161
- Don't say nothing.
- What did you do to our room?

895
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:58,829
Honey, it's not what
it looks like, okay?

896
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:00,748
- Really?
- Listen, listen to me.

897
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,335
This one, she's crazy!
It's not me, she's crazy!

898
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,503
- You're crazy. You're crazy.
- No, honey!

899
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,505
- It's not what it looks like!
- Yeah, right.

900
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:11,842
I'm not done wit' you,
you fuckin' home-wrecker!

901
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:13,210
God!

902
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,347
See, nobody will
listen to the black guy!

903
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,932
So everybody dead! I see
how you lookin' at me.

904
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:22,186
Let me tell you somethin':
This house is haunted.

905
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:24,856
You know that little doll
that you like so much? Abigail?

906
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:26,858
Let me tell you
somethin' about Abigail.

907
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:27,858
She's alive!

908
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,195
That's right, she's alive!

909
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:33,864
Not like alive, alive, but
alive as in "is possessed."

910
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,282
You know how I know?

911
00:50:35,284 --> 00:50:37,869
'Cause it made me have
sex with it! Repeatedly!

912
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:41,289
Upstairs, downstairs, in
the kitchen, in the yard!

913
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,333
While you were sleepin' next to us!

914
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,210
Right there where
you're sitting, twice!

915
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,711
And that's why, when you came
upstairs and you caught me...

916
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:50,422
and I was killing the doll,
because I was just like...

917
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,217
"You're fuckin' up
my relationship!"

918
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,916
And that box? It's cursed!

919
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:57,222
That box and that box.

920
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,724
That's haunted with a demon.
That box, cursed with dudes.

921
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:00,724
But that's a whole 'nother story.

922
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:02,559
And your son, his little
imaginary friend...

923
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:05,896
that teaches him curse words
and gets him crunk on vodka!

924
00:51:05,898 --> 00:51:08,815
Yeah, yeah, I'm blowing
your spot, little man.

925
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:11,735
- Well, he's not so imaginary!
- He's cray!

926
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:14,405
No, no, no. You
cray! You cray-cray!

927
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,782
You and your whole lot
of other ethnic words...

928
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:19,577
that's goin' out of style.
You ain't funky fresh or dope.

929
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,246
So, how 'bout that, cray-cray?

930
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,273
Mom, he's scaring me.

931
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,918
Is that the nigga
whose room exploded?

932
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:30,255
I'm scarin' you! Opie,
you somethin' else!

933
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:31,922
You know what, that's it.

934
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,925
I've had enough of this
whole haunted house craziness!

935
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:37,427
It's bad enough that
you think it's real...

936
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:39,514
but now you're scaring the kids!

937
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:40,847
- I'm scaring the kids!
- Yes!

938
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:44,686
Ain't that the pot
callin' the kettle a nigga!

939
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:45,728
No, no, no, baby!

940
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,940
Your kids are scaring me! Okay?

941
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,233
Look at this one!

942
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,693
She's Marilyn Manson in the skin...

943
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,568
and Charlie Manson in the eyes!

944
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,945
Her eyes are crazy, okay?

945
00:51:54,947 --> 00:51:57,364
That's a crazy woman
carryin' around a box...

946
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:58,740
like fuckin' Lionel
on the Peanuts...

947
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:01,786
and he's hangin' out with
dead niggas and I'm crazy?

948
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,871
So, what am I supposed
to do with all this?

949
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,498
Maybe you weren't ready!
Maybe we moved in too soon.

950
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,543
Maybe you're not
ready for a family!

951
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,585
But we come as a
package deal, okay?

952
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,739
This ain't about you or them, okay?

953
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:14,215
Bullshit.

954
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,217
No! Hey! Don't touch that shit!

955
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,469
Don't touch it!
There's a demon ring.

956
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:21,222
Don't you answer that, you hear?

957
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,974
That's the devil
callin' right there.

958
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,976
That is an evil
ring! You hear that?

959
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,394
Yeah, I said it, a demon ring!

960
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:30,565
And you can insta tweet
that on your gram-o-vine!

961
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,932
Nobody touch it!

962
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,228
Stop ringing!

963
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:40,900
Stop ringing! Stop!

964
00:52:45,164 --> 00:52:49,034
- That's a demon callin'.
- Malcolm? Your pocket.

965
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,840
We gotta change my ringer.

966
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,510
Why do we even have
home phones anymore?

967
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,706
I mean...

968
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,181
Yeah? Who is it?

969
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,516
What the hell?

970
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,760
Hey, how you doin',
officer? What's goin' on?

971
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:12,523
We got a call about
a domestic dispute.

972
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,940
Are you Malcolm Johnson?

973
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:16,360
Yeah, that's me, but
there's no dispute.

974
00:53:16,362 --> 00:53:17,612
I mean, the phone, but...

975
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,697
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

976
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,407
- Oh, my God!
- Just raised the voice a little bit!

977
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:24,202
How could I call?
My phone is broken!

978
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,371
I know what... It's
the doll! It's the doll!

979
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,704
It was the doll, brother, listen!

980
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:30,541
There's this doll, I was
fuckin' this doll, right?

981
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,835
- He's on PCP.
- No, I'm not on PCP!

982
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,505
You fuckin' bitch!
You fuckin' bitch!

983
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,172
You fuckin' bitch!

984
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:39,201
Malcolm, maybe this
is for the best.

985
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:23,913
Canister of gas for death.

986
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,594
Now you burn... fire.

987
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:07,713
What is...

988
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,217
Malcolm?

989
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:20,217
Malcolm?

990
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,355
Damn, son, you look fucked up!

991
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,699
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!

992
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:30,869
Mom, your man's in here
pukin' like a little bitch!

993
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:32,898
See that shit, Tony?

994
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:38,753
Sometimes the victim
may be tormented...

995
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,505
by more than one demon.

996
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:42,507
These cases lead to transference.

997
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,675
Trans who? What the
fuck is that, dog?

998
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,512
- Father Williams! Mind your tongue.
- You are a man of the cloth!

999
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:50,347
Damn man, ain't like I'm
rapin' mu'fuckers no more...

1000
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:51,806
you know what I'm sayin'?

1001
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,393
Shit. Keep on wit' your
little lesson, brother.

1002
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,396
Victims have also been known
to break their own bones...

1003
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:00,190
- ...during the possession.
- True. That happened to me.

1004
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:03,277
I was first in prison, I was
tryin' to give myself head, right?

1005
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,528
'Cause I ain't know nobody.

1006
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,822
If I woulda knew somebody,
I wouldn't have had...

1007
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,824
to do it to myself. And
it wasn't no, no gay shit.

1008
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,701
- First get that out your head.
- That's enough!

1009
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:12,536
I've had enough of your insolence!

1010
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:14,539
My what? My insolence?

1011
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:17,375
Dog, you gonna bring up
my condition right now?

1012
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,378
You gonna bring up
my diabetes, dog!

1013
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,878
Talkin' 'bout my insolence.

1014
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,340
'Cause I like cake?
Yeah, I like cake, guys.

1015
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:27,717
I like cake, birthday
cake, all kinds of cake.

1016
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,804
Now come on, cake, cake, cake!

1017
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:33,306
Man, you know what?
I'm sick o' yo' shit!

1018
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,641
Get outta here!

1019
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:38,134
Everybody break out.
Get your boy wit' you.

1020
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:40,844
Yeah. I mean really, man.

1021
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,818
Wooh. Malcolm?

1022
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,485
Hey, Father Williams!

1023
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:47,572
Fuck, nigga, what'd I tell
you about callin' me that?

1024
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:50,490
- I'm sorry. Hey, Doug!
- Roll down, man!

1025
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:53,159
I'm sorry you caught that, man.

1026
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:54,829
I'm so stressed out, man.

1027
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:57,373
I had to shank a mo'fu.
You saw that, right?

1028
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,293
- I didn't see nothin'.
- That's a good answer.

1029
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:01,543
That's a good answer.

1030
00:57:01,545 --> 00:57:04,213
If you saw it, if you
woulda said yes, I woulda...

1031
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:07,173
That's all right, I
don't have nothin'.

1032
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:08,509
That's the only one I had.

1033
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,844
I used to have two shanks,
but I don't keep that anymore.

1034
00:57:10,846 --> 00:57:12,262
I stopped doin' two shanks...

1035
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:14,347
'cause it just was a thang,
and ever'body was like:

1036
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:15,349
"Two shanks."

1037
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,518
Yeah, so... how you doin'?

1038
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:20,605
I... I need your help.

1039
00:57:20,606 --> 00:57:24,442
- It's happenin', Doug.
- Hell no!

1040
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:27,527
I'm not comin' over there
and fuckin' with you...

1041
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,195
and your creepy lil' bitch again!

1042
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:30,530
I ain't even with
that bitch no more!

1043
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:32,282
I'm beggin' you, man,
I just need your help.

1044
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:33,492
I just don't know
who else to go to.

1045
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,619
Let me explain to you
why I became a priest.

1046
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,788
Now, obvious one is
for the little boys.

1047
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:38,623
Yes.

1048
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:42,793
- What're you talkin' about?
- It's a joke, Malcolm!

1049
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:43,878
No, it was a joke.

1050
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:44,711
No, it was a joke.

1051
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:46,713
I did that, you know,
put it on the priests...

1052
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:48,298
and we laugh, that's all.

1053
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,135
But I don't know if I can help
you wit' your demon situation...

1054
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:54,639
because I haven't
been stayin' steady...

1055
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,849
on my demon fightin' skills,
is what I'm tryin' to tell you.

1056
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:01,221
Malcolm, day after day...

1057
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,356
when you know you can't win...

1058
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:07,818
you're just prolonging
the inevitable!

1059
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,820
All you gotta do is let them in.

1060
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:12,739
Are you talkin' about the Devil?

1061
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,492
Worse. The Kardashians.

1062
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:20,581
Yeah, it's the crazy mama, it's
Kim, Khloe, Courtney crazy...

1063
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:21,831
the two little ones...

1064
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,668
they gonna be freaks. They
got Lamar, they got Scott...

1065
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:24,710
Rob Fat the motherfucker,
Bruce with the acne.

1066
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,172
Rob Fat the motherfucker,
Bruce with the acne.

1067
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,340
What the fuck is wrong
with Bruce Jenner face?

1068
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:31,717
He look like a monster!

1069
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:35,137
He scares me at night!
And he on in daytime.

1070
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,472
He don't look like the nigga
that was on the Wheatie box!

1071
00:58:37,474 --> 00:58:38,349
- And Kanye! And Kanye!
- And Julianne Hough!

1072
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,476
- And Kanye! And Kanye!
- And Julianne Hough!

1073
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,811
I love it and I hate it.

1074
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:44,480
They took Kanye and
they changed him.

1075
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:45,481
Doug, you know...

1076
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:48,317
You have to let go of me, Doug.

1077
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,320
- You can't...
- Doug, you gotta let go of me!

1078
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:51,945
There's no place you can
hide. He has a plan for you.

1079
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:55,324
There's no place you can
hide. He has a plan for you.

1080
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,367
- Doug, get offa me.
- He will get you!

1081
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:00,693
Doug, get your hands offa me!
What the fuck is wrong wit' you?

1082
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:08,920
Oh, you're the one that got
us out here in the hot heat!

1083
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:11,507
Making me bang all on the
windows with my good church hat!

1084
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:14,510
Hon, I could be at home
watchin' that new Madea movie!

1085
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,177
What's the name of
that Madea movie...

1086
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:17,847
with the little girl
from The Fresh Prince?

1087
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:19,181
You know the one, she
played the head of NASA.

1088
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:19,681
You know the one, she
played the head of NASA.

1089
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:20,724
With the aliens!

1090
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:23,853
- "Madea Goes To Mars"!
- "Madea Goes To Mars," that's it!

1091
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:27,188
Hold on, ain't you that
brother that just moved...

1092
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,059
into old Burton place?

1093
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:32,445
- Yeah, it's just...
- With a white woman!

1094
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:32,777
Well, she's not all the way white.

1095
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,362
Well, she's not all the way white.

1096
00:59:34,364 --> 00:59:37,115
She's a white woman
damn near clear!

1097
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:39,117
Come on now, it's 2013.

1098
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,536
Interracial relationships
is not a big deal.

1099
00:59:41,538 --> 00:59:42,454
What?

1100
00:59:42,456 --> 00:59:44,789
You need to tell that
to the lonely sista.

1101
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,416
Look at this one
right here. Right here!

1102
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:46,458
Look at this one
right here. Right here!

1103
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,460
Honey, show him how you
drop it like it's hot!

1104
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:50,795
Hold up, Bertha, hold up. Hold up.

1105
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:52,465
We ain't got no defibrillator.

1106
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:54,382
You know what it is
with the white girl?

1107
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:56,802
They do that cungalingus,
the finga-ligga-linga.

1108
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,762
What is it, the fellatio?

1109
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:00,014
That's what it is, they go deep.

1110
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,139
That's what it is, they go deep.

1111
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:04,559
- You know they ain't got no insides.
- I think that's my cue to go.

1112
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:06,771
'Scuse me, sistas.
Have a good sermon.

1113
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:11,483
- Where you goin'?
- Let it go! You're angry!

1114
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:13,610
Brother be trippin',
that's why I got me...

1115
01:00:13,612 --> 01:00:13,693
Brother be trippin',
that's why I got me...

1116
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,153
a white man at home.

1117
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:17,682
- Yeah, girl.
- Vanilla my ﬂavor.

1118
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:22,619
- Hello, Malcolm.
- Professor Wilde, thank God.

1119
01:00:22,621 --> 01:00:24,371
I been tryin' to reach you!

1120
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,664
I'm sorry, Malcolm,
I've been a bit tied up.

1121
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:29,335
I haven't been able to
find any more on Ahghoul...

1122
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,503
though my resources
are a bit limited.

1123
01:00:31,505 --> 01:00:34,172
Professor? Where the hell are you?

1124
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:36,382
Doin' a stretch of five to ten.

1125
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:39,177
Apparently the authorities
frown on sellin' meth...

1126
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:40,771
to college students.

1127
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:42,514
Yeah, apparently.

1128
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:44,724
You need to hang up
that computer call...

1129
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:47,644
come here and kiss
me on my hot mouth.

1130
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:50,673
I'm feelin' romantical.

1131
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,400
Well, Malcolm, I suppose
I should get going.

1132
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,527
But I will be e-mailing you
the contacts of associates...

1133
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:56,528
who'll be able to help.

1134
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,322
I don't mean to be
pushy, but any way...

1135
01:00:58,322 --> 01:00:59,782
you could do that
before you get raped?

1136
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:03,869
What part of Mandingo
party do you not understand?

1137
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:06,831
It's time to power
the white rabbit.

1138
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:07,664
You know.... dirty the snow.

1139
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,739
You know.... dirty the snow.

1140
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,284
- I'm screwed.
- It's not that bad.

1141
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:17,163
Lights, please. Thank you.

1142
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:21,219
So after several exhausting
days of the exorcism...

1143
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:24,556
I threw some holy water on
her, read an incantation...

1144
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:27,961
and the demon left
the woman's body.

1145
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:31,521
I suppose I just
sat back and watched.

1146
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:34,733
I mean, I'm just the medium
who puts her life in danger...

1147
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,527
Every time she reaches
out to demonic forces.

1148
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:40,322
But you've got a Bible and
a bottle of holy water...

1149
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,532
so you make the
world a safer place!

1150
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:44,409
The fact is, people,
is that God is real...

1151
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:47,735
the Devil is real,
and monsters exist.

1152
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:51,375
They're vicious,
terrifying entities!

1153
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:54,210
But the good news is,
Santa Claus doesn't exist...

1154
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,963
so you don't have to worry
about some creepy old guy...

1155
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,550
- ...coming down your chimney.
- What exactly are you guys?

1156
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,385
And who the fuck hired you?

1157
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:02,135
You can call us Ned and Noreen.

1158
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:03,887
You can call us Ned and Noreen.

1159
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:06,472
See? This is why you don't
hire from Craig's List.

1160
01:02:06,474 --> 01:02:07,920
Asshole!

1161
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:13,563
I don't understand why you
always have to take the credit!

1162
01:02:13,565 --> 01:02:15,733
I mean, even your name comes
first on our book cover...

1163
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:16,442
I mean, even your name comes
first on our book cover...

1164
01:02:16,443 --> 01:02:18,235
and I am the one with a gift!

1165
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,737
It's not my fault that
Ned comes before Noreen...

1166
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,237
in alphabetical order!

1167
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:23,574
Is that why Ned comes
before Noreen in the bedroom?

1168
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,659
Just once I'd like you to do
that thing with your thumb...

1169
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,744
and your forefinger. I think
they call it the "Shocker"?

1170
01:02:27,746 --> 01:02:29,371
Yeah, well, I would like
you to do that thing...

1171
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:29,829
Yeah, well, I would like
you to do that thing...

1172
01:02:29,831 --> 01:02:31,748
with my balls and the Shocker...

1173
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,833
Hi! Can we help you?

1174
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:37,170
Yes. There's something
horrible happening in my house.

1175
01:02:37,172 --> 01:02:39,340
My family doesn't realize
what's going on, but I do!

1176
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,842
I'm sure that there's
a rational explanation...

1177
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:42,967
Please! They're white!

1178
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:43,844
Please! They're white!

1179
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,512
Why didn't you say that?

1180
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,597
Oh, my God! You
should lead with that!

1181
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,726
I mean, if you're black we just
assume that your hauntings are...

1182
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:53,228
bill collectors or
racist police officers.

1183
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,606
But 99% of all hauntings happen
to white people, that's a fact.

1184
01:02:56,608 --> 01:02:57,190
But 99% of all hauntings happen
to white people, that's a fact.

1185
01:02:57,192 --> 01:03:00,527
What he means to say is,
of course we'll help you.

1186
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,570
Thank you so much.

1187
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,530
So we're here to help you people.

1188
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,949
And before you get worked up,
I mean "you people" as a couple.

1189
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:07,952
It wasn't racist
till you explained it.

1190
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:08,577
Yeah.

1191
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,204
The bad news is, you have
a demon in your house.

1192
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,704
The bad news is, you have
a demon in your house.

1193
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:12,789
Here we go again.

1194
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:15,708
Okay, wait. So the
house really is haunted?

1195
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,213
Megan, it's not the
house that's haunted.

1196
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:22,548
I knew it! I knew it! It's
always the little white girl.

1197
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,800
Think about it. "The Exorcist",
"The Last Exorcism"...

1198
01:03:23,802 --> 01:03:25,385
Think about it. "The Exorcist",
"The Last Exorcism"...

1199
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:27,721
"The Exorcism of Emily
Rose", all white girls.

1200
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:29,556
'Cause ain't no black parents
gonna have no white girls...

1201
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,474
talkin' like that.
"Bitch, whatta you mean?

1202
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,601
Who're you cursin' at? And turn
the fuckin' air down in here!"

1203
01:03:33,603 --> 01:03:35,311
Malcolm, just listen for a second.

1204
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:37,438
When we first met you,
there was something...

1205
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:37,815
When we first met you,
there was something...

1206
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,858
attached to you.

1207
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,485
That was a hemorrhoid.
That was... it's good now.

1208
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:44,905
This dark entity has
attached itself to him...

1209
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,282
and now it's feeding
off of all of you.

1210
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,159
So what you're saying is that
this is all Malcolm's fault.

1211
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:50,869
That's right.

1212
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:51,036
Your family could've left here
at any time, but now you're stuck.

1213
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,498
Your family could've left here
at any time, but now you're stuck.

1214
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,833
Like a piece of toilet
paper stuck on your shoe...

1215
01:03:56,835 --> 01:03:58,335
when you leave the bathroom.

1216
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,503
Your wife knew the whole time,
but she didn't tell you...

1217
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:02,505
because she wanted
you to walk around...

1218
01:04:02,507 --> 01:04:04,675
- ...and look like an idiot.
- Get over it!

1219
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:04,842
- ....and look like an idiot.
- Get over it!

1220
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,219
I'm not the one who
had an affair with...

1221
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,346
some low rent palm
reader from Akron!

1222
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,389
And you never would've known
if you weren't a psychic!

1223
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:13,759
But I am psychic, Ned!

1224
01:04:14,853 --> 01:04:16,186
What is that for?

1225
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,271
What you're thinking about
doing to Megan in two seconds:

1226
01:04:18,273 --> 01:04:18,688
What you're thinking about
doing to Megan in two seconds:

1227
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,592
One, two, see?

1228
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:26,195
We came on short notice.

1229
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:28,364
We may need an extra pair of hands.

1230
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:32,110
- Anyone you trust to help?
- I know a guy. He's Mexican.

1231
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:36,277
Megan, let's go to your contacts.

1232
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,376
Hey, nice camera.

1233
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:43,297
I take it your third cousin
owns electronics shops.

1234
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:44,297
Somethin' like that.

1235
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,507
He sells them out of
the back of his truck.

1236
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:45,840
He sells them out of
the back of his truck.

1237
01:04:45,842 --> 01:04:48,177
It's a mobile operation.
Let me know if you want one.

1238
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:50,262
Hey, Ned, something weird.

1239
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:53,514
All these clocks stop at 3:27
when the hauntings happen.

1240
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:57,887
Normally, it's 3:07.
Nope, we're on CP time.

1241
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:58,728
The demon will manifest
itself in many ways.

1242
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:01,315
The demon will manifest
itself in many ways.

1243
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,400
To your son, it's
his imaginary friend.

1244
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,735
To your daughter it's
the voice inside the box.

1245
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:08,322
For Malcolm it's that
sexy little doll Abigail.

1246
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:09,864
See? It's a manifestation!

1247
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,867
You think I'd bang
a doll for no reason?

1248
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:12,326
- Malcolm! Shut up.
- What we're about to do...

1249
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:13,869
- Malcolm! Shut up.
- What we're about to do...

1250
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:17,539
is the first step in banishing
the demon to the netherworld.

1251
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:18,706
What is that?

1252
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:21,543
This helps me communicate
with the demon.

1253
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:24,630
Organic, hydroponically
grown OG Kush.

1254
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,922
Very strong.

1255
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,882
Very strong.

1256
01:05:27,884 --> 01:05:30,753
This is some good shit.

1257
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:35,891
- Pass the man the shit.
- We grow it ourselves.

1258
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:39,478
- High water bill.
- That's that shit right there!

1259
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:39,561
Let me get another hit.
I'm goin' to the further.

1260
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,838
Let me get another hit.
I'm goin' to the further.

1261
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:43,514
Tony!

1262
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:46,681
Tony, where are you?

1263
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,523
Smells like that OG Kush.

1264
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:00,528
Mom!

1265
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:04,202
Becky!

1266
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:06,797
- Cool!
- Wyatt, get upstairs!

1267
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,199
- Cool!
- Wyatt, get upstairs!

1268
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:10,869
Fuck you, you bitch!

1269
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,179
Why are you tying
my baby to a chair?

1270
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,847
Because the bitch
got a demon in her!

1271
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:17,181
Make it stop!

1272
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,184
This is some scary
Cucui shit right here.

1273
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:20,393
I don't know who Cucui is.

1274
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,644
I don't know who Cucui is.

1275
01:06:21,646 --> 01:06:23,646
A Cucui is a ghetto
Mexican bogeyman.

1276
01:06:23,648 --> 01:06:26,692
- Like George Lopez.
- I know, huh?

1277
01:06:26,693 --> 01:06:29,443
I agree, it is scary as fuck.

1278
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:31,989
This spirit is more
powerful than I thought.

1279
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,990
We're gonna need to get a priest
to perform a real exorcism.

1280
01:06:33,992 --> 01:06:35,159
We're gonna need to get a priest
to perform a real exorcism.

1281
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,530
I know a guy! He's a
little unconventional.

1282
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:41,858
I don't know, Malcolm.

1283
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,168
I know, that bitch
don't look right.

1284
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:47,170
Why you gotta call her a bitch?
You disrespectin' he little ho.

1285
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:47,628
Nigga, did you just sell me out?

1286
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:48,505
Nigga, did you just sell me out?

1287
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,673
There's certain words
that trigger white folk.

1288
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,177
I mean, bitch, ho, slut.

1289
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:54,177
No offense.

1290
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:56,547
You can't say those words.
That's like our ni...

1291
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:58,514
What the hell are
you talking about?

1292
01:06:58,516 --> 01:06:59,182
Fuck him.

1293
01:06:59,184 --> 01:07:03,519
- We would never say that.
- Only behind closed doors.

1294
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:07,440
I mean, I wouldn't say it in a
bus or at the Atlanta Airport...

1295
01:07:07,442 --> 01:07:10,568
or in a parking lot of a KFC,
but, yeah, I would say it.

1296
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,528
I got your back.

1297
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,614
This is a lovely
scarf you're wearing.

1298
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,365
It's a sash, you
know what I'm sayin'?

1299
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:18,744
I'm selling these. This a
part of my new clothin' line...

1300
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:21,704
"Jesus Pieces", and I got like
the shoe that the Popee wearin'...

1301
01:07:21,706 --> 01:07:25,541
in leather, suede, in green,
brown, and the Pope hats!

1302
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:28,711
- You know what, that's enough.
- Thank you so much.

1303
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,797
That's right.

1304
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:34,168
Can we help my daughter please?

1305
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,762
Hell, she went really
white girl on me.

1306
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:38,804
"Oh, my God!" I was like, whoa!

1307
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:41,641
- Speaking of white...
- Are you doin' cocaine again?

1308
01:07:41,643 --> 01:07:44,045
Cocaine? No, man,
this stuffs molly!

1309
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,480
Can I try?

1310
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:48,599
It's all good, it's all good.

1311
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,485
I'm gonna take a
little pinch for later.

1312
01:07:51,485 --> 01:07:53,152
He's just bringing his drugs?

1313
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,155
- It's molly.
- Wrap it up!

1314
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:57,023
Hey, chill. Calm down, man.

1315
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,666
Y'alls have some crazy
ass motherfuckers.

1316
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,668
Y'all thought I was
gonna shoot this bitch?

1317
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,835
I'm just gonna pistol
whip her until she weakens.

1318
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,838
You're not pistol
whipping my daughter!

1319
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,840
I am not pistol
whipping my daughter.

1320
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,867
The man's a genius.

1321
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:21,847
In the name of the Father
and the Holy Ghost...

1322
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:24,309
I need three other white people.

1323
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:26,728
Peyton Manning! Kristen Stewart.

1324
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,220
Paula Dean!

1325
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,524
Malcolm, where's Doug?

1326
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,734
I can't find his
black ass in this dark!

1327
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,612
- Where the hell is he?
- Look for eyes!

1328
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:37,280
Like a forest
creature in a cartoon.

1329
01:08:37,282 --> 01:08:38,682
Father Doug!

1330
01:08:39,117 --> 01:08:41,118
He's over here! He's over here!

1331
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:44,021
Doug, no! Nigga, please don't.

1332
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,122
Father, please don't!

1333
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:46,914
No, wait!

1334
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,458
It's better if he points the
gun at himself and not at us.

1335
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,128
- Just talk to him, Malcolm.
- Listen to my voice, okay, Doug?

1336
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,465
This is not what niggas
do! We don't do suicide!

1337
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:57,634
Murder, yes! Suicide?

1338
01:08:57,635 --> 01:08:59,469
That's what they do.

1339
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:03,215
Yeah, we do that. I've
tried at least 20 times.

1340
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,350
Motherfucker got me acting
all crazy, actin' the fool!

1341
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,845
You know damn well I
wouldn't peel my own cap!

1342
01:09:10,148 --> 01:09:12,481
I can't stop it! I can't stop it!

1343
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:15,484
There's somethin' in my head that's
tellin' me to blow off my head.

1344
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,612
Is it this head? Is it this head?

1345
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:19,780
No, no, no! Yeah, up there!

1346
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:23,327
Evenin' break. Who wants a mojito?

1347
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,494
Oh, the black guy still got a gun.

1348
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:28,582
Oh, God! This demon is
a son of a bitch, man!

1349
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:31,167
Father, why have you abandoned me?

1350
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:34,628
Is it 'cause I cuss a
lot, even during prayer?

1351
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,131
Amen, motherfucker sour dough.

1352
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:38,300
Is it because...

1353
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:42,304
I don't get Ryan
Seacrest? I don't get him.

1354
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:43,387
I know what it is...

1355
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:45,806
'cause I dressed up as
a foreclosure sign...

1356
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:48,143
when people was getting
kicked out they house.

1357
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:50,145
On Halloween I just stood there.

1358
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:52,480
I know it was wrong,
but it was funny to me.

1359
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:55,484
Out all of the people
on the Brady Bunch...

1360
01:09:55,484 --> 01:09:57,485
it was Alice that I wanted to fuck.

1361
01:09:57,487 --> 01:10:01,364
In the station wagon, on top
of Mr. Brady architect desk.

1362
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,824
Just used it for
protractors and rulers.

1363
01:10:03,826 --> 01:10:07,496
Is because I actually kinda
thought that it was okay...

1364
01:10:07,497 --> 01:10:09,331
that Chris Brown hit Rihanna?

1365
01:10:09,332 --> 01:10:12,333
I know that bitch hit him
first! She talk too much shit!

1366
01:10:12,335 --> 01:10:14,336
Shit, Island Girl,
whatcha doin' to Chris?

1367
01:10:14,337 --> 01:10:16,337
Why you goin' hoodies
bitchin' on my Chris?

1368
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:17,713
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

1369
01:10:17,715 --> 01:10:20,509
- Somebody help me.
- Doug! Fight it, Doug!

1370
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:24,387
No! Nigga, that's a bigass
gun! That's gonna hurt, nigga.

1371
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:27,212
Malcolm, he has a message for you.

1372
01:10:28,184 --> 01:10:31,257
He says... "Huh, bitch?"

1373
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,902
We're gonna need another priest!

1374
01:10:38,903 --> 01:10:41,363
It's too late. I have
to perform the exorcism.

1375
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,363
It's true.

1376
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:44,615
Although Ned's only formal
training was a "Ghostbusters"...

1377
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:46,409
summer camp back in 1988.

1378
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:48,537
Never cross a stream.
Never cross them.

1379
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:51,539
And he is dumb! I
mean, dumb, dumb, dumb!

1380
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,875
The point is, you can do this!

1381
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:56,252
Do you remember what you said
to me on our wedding night?

1382
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,712
"I have whiskey dick and I'll
make it up to you in the morning."

1383
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:01,925
No! You said God brought
us together for a reason.

1384
01:11:01,926 --> 01:11:03,760
Doesn't sound like me.

1385
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:07,711
- Must've been really drunk.
- Just fucking do it, dummy!

1386
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,569
- Becky!
- Did it work?

1387
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:25,692
- I'm sorry for everything!
- I think you did it!

1388
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,668
- Oh, fuck that!
- Oh, my God!

1389
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,868
Time to die!

1390
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:44,676
- It was him! It was him!
- Don't be like that!

1391
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:46,248
It actually was him.

1392
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:50,250
- Got him in the knee.
- That looked like it hurt, jeez.

1393
01:11:55,313 --> 01:11:58,314
- That's what you call a blowjob.
- A leaf blower?

1394
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,858
- Don't judge me.
- Malcolm!

1395
01:11:59,859 --> 01:12:03,854
Demon, you leave
our daughter alone!

1396
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:07,198
That's not your daughter anymore!

1397
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,367
I didn't mean like
a daughter daughter...

1398
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,270
Seriously? Malcolm, help her!

1399
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:14,689
- Okay. Goddamnit!
- Go get 'em, buddy.

1400
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:18,667
- Wyatt, are you okay?
- Yeah, but Becky...

1401
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,242
she looks pretty fucked up.

1402
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,466
Demon, I'll make you a deal.

1403
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,384
How about, you leave,
and we'll pretend...

1404
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:28,720
- ...none of this ever happened.
- The bitch is mine!

1405
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,930
You heard the man, the
bitch is his. I tried.

1406
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:31,931
Seriously?

1407
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:34,184
She said the bitch is his.
That's pretty emphatic.

1408
01:12:34,185 --> 01:12:37,212
Malcolm, please help
me. I'm so sorry.

1409
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:41,858
Becky will rot in hell!

1410
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,193
Okay, which one is it?

1411
01:12:43,194 --> 01:12:45,194
Rot in hell or you
want me to help you?

1412
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,894
- Malcolm, help her!
- The bitch is confusing me!

1413
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,199
Demon, you leave her alone!

1414
01:12:50,201 --> 01:12:52,536
You take me instead!

1415
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:53,869
Deal.

1416
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:56,739
Wait, no, no, no.
Here, take him instead!

1417
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:03,212
I haven't heard a demon
scream for a while.

1418
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,713
I think it's safe
to go back up there.

1419
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:07,551
- I still have a bad feeling.
- For God's sake, come on, guys!

1420
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,795
- Come on!
- All right.

1421
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:15,350
Oh, my God! Wyatt,
get upstairs right now!

1422
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,560
They're cuddling! The demon's gone!

1423
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,396
I did it! This house is clean!

1424
01:13:20,398 --> 01:13:21,730
Look at his eyes!

1425
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,899
They're rolling to
the back of his head!

1426
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,402
I think he's possessed.

1427
01:13:25,403 --> 01:13:27,404
That's the face he makes
when he has an orgasm.

1428
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:30,323
- I think he's okay, you guys.
- This is not over.

1429
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,827
- Are you guys watching this?
- Yes, we're watching it, dummy!

1430
01:13:33,828 --> 01:13:36,371
I'm so intrigued by this.

1431
01:13:36,372 --> 01:13:40,457
Oh, man! He's all twisted
up like a chocolate pretzel!

1432
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:45,505
Such ﬂexibility and dexterity!
This is making me queasy!

1433
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:49,426
- He could suck his own dick.
- Somebody please help me!

1434
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:50,594
If I could do that...

1435
01:13:50,595 --> 01:13:52,886
I don't think I'd
ever talk to you again.

1436
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,211
Stop it, you unholy demon!

1437
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:58,969
- That is greasy shit!
- Probably Murray's.

1438
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:02,137
The power of Christ compels you!

1439
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:05,524
It burn like bum piss!
That means it's working!

1440
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,860
Pour the whole thing, like
I just won the Super Bowl!

1441
01:14:07,862 --> 01:14:09,889
- Go!
- Are you crazy?

1442
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,231
Is that all you got, bitch?

1443
01:14:31,969 --> 01:14:34,386
Wait, guys! Stop! Everybody stop!

1444
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:38,307
- Malcolm, are you okay?
- No, I think I'm gonna be sick.

1445
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:39,505
What?

1446
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:41,810
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1447
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,213
Oh, my God, I can't...

1448
01:14:48,152 --> 01:14:52,154
- Puking like a runway model.
- I'm good. I'm good.

1449
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,658
You're gonna want to
Febreeze all of this.

1450
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,659
You're gonna wanna just clean this.

1451
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:59,189
I feel so much better now.

1452
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,912
Can't be too sure. Oh, shit.

1453
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:09,255
I gotta get the hell outta here.

1454
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:10,881
Once they see a black
guy in a pool of blood...

1455
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:12,841
you know who they're
gonna come after next..

1456
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,539
I gotta go.

1457
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:18,847
- Now this place is clean.
- It sounded better when I said it.

1458
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:20,475
Get the box.

1459
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,228
- Thank you, guys, so much.
- No need to thank us.

1460
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:24,895
We're happy to help. Come on, Ned.

1461
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,939
And we'll just take
Abigail with us...

1462
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,524
as well, for safekeeping.

1463
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,527
Yeah, I know what you plannin'
on doing with that doll.

1464
01:15:30,528 --> 01:15:32,862
- No, I'm a professional.
- She's a freak bitch.

1465
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:33,529
Stop it.

1466
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,240
How come Noreen ain't
pickin' up on the vibes?

1467
01:15:36,242 --> 01:15:38,326
You know how when you
try to last longer...

1468
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:39,786
you think about baseball?

1469
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:41,912
It's kind of like that.
Throws a haze in their head.

1470
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:44,666
It's the only way to survive
when you're married to a psychic.

1471
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:45,542
Come on, Ned.

1472
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:48,570
I know you're thinking
about fucking that doll.

1473
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,871
- You're had enough.
- Bye, doll.

1474
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:05,185
It's so nice being able to
just relax on the couch...

1475
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,555
and watch "The Bachelorettes".

1476
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:14,721
- You didn't hear that?
- What?

1477
01:16:14,822 --> 01:16:17,407
My nigga senses is tinglin'.

1478
01:16:17,408 --> 01:16:19,199
It's like my Spidey senses.

1479
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:22,369
Would you hush? It is fine!

1480
01:16:22,371 --> 01:16:25,069
My white senses say we're fine.

1481
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:27,876
Everything's okay. It's over.

1482
01:16:27,877 --> 01:16:31,907
- Okay? It's over.
- Okay, okay. I'm trippin'.

1483
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:36,501
Listen to that, whiteness!

1484
01:16:44,143 --> 01:16:46,478
You already know how it's
going down, motherfuckers...

1485
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:47,270
all right?

1486
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,271
I looked in my Dora
the Explorer app...

1487
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:51,274
this the motherfuckin'
correct address.

1488
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:54,277
This ain't a drive-by, homie,
okay? This a walk-in, homie.

1489
01:16:54,278 --> 01:16:56,613
So ain't no escapin'! My
cousin is in here, Cuz!

1490
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,015
Y'all ready?

1491
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:01,242
Hey, yo, Malcolm!

1492
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:03,862
Whassup my niggie? I'm here, Cuz!

1493
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:08,500
What the fuck are you
doin', man? I gotta...

1494
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:10,698
This is bullshit! Oh, my God!

1495
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:13,534
I'm scared as fuck!

1496
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:17,966
I'm good, dog.

1497
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,871
Let me get my motherfuckin'
bearings together, homie.

1498
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,307
All right, let's
go up in there, Cuz.

1499
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:26,850
It smell like dead ass...

1500
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,354
Baloney and sweat socks
up in there, homie.

1501
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,855
It smell like Honey Boo
Boo's boo-boo, homie!

1502
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,483
Malcolm?

Oh, shit! Megan got fucked up!

01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:47,247
Head twisted all backwards, niggie.

1507
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:50,166
Now, upon further
examination, my niggie...

1508
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,335

1509
01:17:52,336 --> 01:17:53,627

1510
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:55,630
I watch "Dexter",
niggie, "CSI New York"...

1511
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:57,172
"Love 'N Hip-Hop Atlanta".

1512
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,509
Don't nobody get killed on
there, but they need to, my nigga.

1513
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,344
Stevie J, you know what I'm sayin'?

1514
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:03,712
This bitch smell like poverty, Cuz!

Hello?

1520
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:22,865
Oh, shit! There's
another dead body, Cuz.

1521
01:18:22,867 --> 01:18:26,786

1525
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,881
Why the fuck they let Dough
Boy live and Ricky dead?

1526
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:40,831
Dough Boy was the evil nigga, Cuz!

1527
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:43,511
I can't believe it!

1528
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:46,164
See if the nigga got
some money, though.

1529
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:54,271
What you hit me for, Cuz?

1530
01:18:54,273 --> 01:18:56,815
You know better than to be
poppin' up on me like that, Cuz!

01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:59,484
You get knocked out every
motherfuckin' time, homie.

01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,184
World star! World star!

You hit me with a brick!

1534
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:05,908
Where's my family? Are they okay?

All of them? Even the little boy?

1537
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,413
He's on the back of a
motherfuckin' milk carton, niggie!

1538
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,112
Good. He may have lived.

1539
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,917
Where's Kisha?

1540
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:17,868
Nigga, I don't know where
the fuck Kisha is at, Cuz!

1541
01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:20,756
- She did this shit!

1542
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,675
The white girl's
neck, snapped it back.

1543
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:25,427
- Kisha did that shit?
- That bitch is gangsta, Cuz!

1544
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:27,512
I need to jump on her
and mount her, Cuz!

1545
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:29,681
I came down to the basement

1546
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,600

01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,770

1549
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:37,774

1550
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,775

1552
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,863
Then all like, "Bitch,

1553
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,407
You can't kill me!
I'm like a roach!

1554
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,283
I don't die, I multiply!

1555
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,904
I got God on my side, bitch!

1556
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,250
Twinkle, twinkle little star...

1557
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:58,586
She's right behind me, isn't she?

1558
01:19:58,587 --> 01:20:01,661
How I wonder...
