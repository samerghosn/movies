1
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,647
Asakusa, last stop, Asakusa.

2
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,610
We don't have much time. Go to work. Saya?

3
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,030
Something wrong?

4
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,791
Every bloodsucker you kill brings us
one step closer.

5
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:16,296
- I'm not here for those bottom feeders.
- It's only a matter of time and patience.

6
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,515
Jesus Christ!

7
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,643
- Hey! Something's not right.
- What?

8
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,897
That ain't no bloodsucker in there.
He's human.

9
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,694
It didn't have time to transform,
that's all.

10
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,739
You're gonna take her word for it?
What if she just screwed up?

11
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,202
Saya, that's enough.

12
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,251
Get some rest. I'll be at the hotel tomorrow.

13
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,463
- The little bitch is out of control.
- We need her.

14
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,551
Saya is all we've got.

15
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,302
Michael, we're done here.

16
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,513
Michael?

17
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,147
Let's go.

18
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,698
Saya sama!

19
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,962
Kato. Tell me about my father.

20
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,383
He was a warrior.

21
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,928
The bravest hunter there was.

22
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,642
How did he tell demons apart from humans?

23
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,686
He stared straight into their eyes,

24
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,148
and he could see they had no souls.

25
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,152
Demons can assume human flesh,

26
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,782
but they can't conjure up human soul.

27
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,702
Heaven put demons into the world

28
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,580
to test our virtues.

29
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,584
If Heaven intended for demons
to live among us,

30
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,962
why do we kill them?

31
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,631
In life we all have duties.

32
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,926
To fulfill our duties is serving Heaven's will.

33
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,889
The rest is not for us to question.

34
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,852
Saya!

35
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,729
Your father was slain

36
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,860
by Onigen,

37
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,532
the oldest, vilest demon of them all.

38
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,701
It's your destiny

39
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,663
to avenge him,

40
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,292
to continue his mission.

41
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,172
Are you determined, my girl?

42
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,720
Yes, Kato.

43
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,684
Three deaths on the American air base
within a week.

44
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,272
Our cleaners got there in time.
No one saw the bodies.

45
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,775
- The underlings are feeding.
- Well, you know the old saying,

46
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,446
"When the hungry demons feed
without discretion...

47
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,406
"...Onigen is near."

48
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:23,460
You're about to get your wish.
To face the leader of the pack.

49
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,508
- The plan?
- The Council wants you on the base

50
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,845
- to find more leads.
- I don't investigate. I kill.

51
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,433
Be my guest.
Kill the bottom feeders and lure out Onigen.

52
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,188
- But this time, let the blood mutate.
- I was never wrong.

53
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,982
Doesn't hurt to be cautious, that's all.

54
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,529
And don't blow your cover
unless absolutely necessary.

55
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,156
The Elder pulled a lot of strings
to arrange this.

56
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,407
Cover?

57
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,872
- What's that?
- It's a new outfit.

58
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:51,047
You know, Dad, you don't have to drive
me to school every day. I can walk.

59
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,925
Don't be silly. It's my only chance
to spend some time with you.

60
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,095
- Everyone else walks.
- You're not everyone, sweetie.

61
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,931
- I'm not a kid, either.
- Is that why you did it?

62
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,727
- To prove that you're all grown up?
- Did what?

63
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:08,189
I was hoping you'd come clean.
That's what grown-ups do, you know.

64
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,526
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, I...

65
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,112
I guess it must've been Frank.
What do you say, Frank?

66
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,906
- Sir?
- Was it you who took my car out

67
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,992
- for a spin last night?
- No, sir.

68
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,330
Did you sneak off the base and boogie
at the Hippy Shake until 4:00?

69
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,750
- No, sir.
- I cannot believe this. You're spying on me?

70
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,047
I don't have to, Alice. You're my daughter.
People know you and people talk.

71
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,134
Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.
I should have told you. Just...

72
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,347
You're always busy, day and night,
working on your second star.

73
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,684
You've gotta understand, we're at war.
We're all at risk, even here.

74
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,271
- This is your war, not mine.
- That's enough, Alice.

75
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,735
- Hey! Watch where you're going, damn it!
- Yes, sir!

76
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,989
- Momma, Momma, can't you see?
- Momma, Momma, can't you see?

77
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,368
Alice! Alice, would you come back here?

78
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,954
The Air Force made a man of me

79
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,039
Alice!

80
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,794
I'm so happy, I'm so proud

81
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,283
So, class, let's give our new classmate
a warm welcome.

82
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,458
There we go. Saya, would you care
to take that desk over there?

83
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,129
Good! Now, I know
you've all been doing your homework,

84
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,133
and you've prepared today's readings,

85
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,720
which will be
from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

86
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,933
- Okey-dokey, we're gonna start on page 135.
- Hey.

87
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:12,772
- She must be lost? Thinks it's a navy base.
- I can't believe they let a Jap enroll here.

88
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,567
Next thing you know,
they think they own the place.

89
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,528
"Like Adam, I was..."

90
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,158
Yes, sir. Our story stands.

91
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,870
They think it's a CIA plan.

92
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:30,517
Frankenstein's monster compares himself
with both Adam and Lucifer.

93
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,895
Can you tell me why, Liz?

94
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,942
Because both Adam and Lucifer
were created by God?

95
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,862
Yes, but these are opposite ends
of good and evil.

96
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:49,786
To which end does the monster belong?
To whom does he reach out in his anger?

97
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,915
Saya, would you care
to join our discussion?

98
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,918
Me no English.

99
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,838
Yes, Alice?

100
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:04,509
Anger is what makes the monster human.
It's neither good nor evil.

101
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,513
He was abandoned
by his creator just like Lucifer.

102
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:14,978
So God and Victor Frankenstein
both deserted their creations

103
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,939
not because they were imperfect,

104
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,193
but because they reminded them
of their own imperfections.

105
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:27,699
That's very interesting.
So, do you think that God

106
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:32,704
- is an irresponsible father figure?
- She must be thinking about her dad.

107
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,622
- What did you say?
- Piss off the princess

108
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,542
and next thing you know,
her dad will court-martial you.

109
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,211
It's not my fault.
Please, don't send me to the chair.

110
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,880
- Yes, now can we...
- Grow up!

111
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,465
...settle down, please.
Come on, let's be nice.

112
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,011
George, could you read the next paragraph?

113
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,639
"Accursed creator!
Why did you form a monster so hideous

114
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,101
"that even you turned from me in disgust?
God, in pity, made man..."

115
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,984
Concentrate, Alice.
Let the mind lead the body.

116
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,115
Good!

117
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,662
That's it for today.
What's our motto, Team Lupin?

118
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,499
- Be a wolf or be gone!
- That's the spirit!

119
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,921
I need your help with this.

120
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,173
- For the team, understand?
- I think so.

121
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,926
- Alice!
- Sir?

122
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,970
You're dragging down the whole team.

123
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,307
- I want you to stay and practice.
- But I have to...

124
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,600
Don't think
you're gonna get special treatment

125
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,937
- just 'cause you're the General's daughter.
- I didn't say that.

126
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,107
- I'll spar with Alice.
- And I will be the ref.

127
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,362
- No, I'll practice on my own.
- Gotta think of the team.

128
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,739
Think of the tournament next week.

129
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,867
- Make a wolf of Alice for me, girls.
- Yes, Mr. Powell.

130
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,288
Bring it on.

131
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:09,217
- What are you doing?
- We tried very, very hard to ignore you.

132
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,220
But you just keep getting on our nerves!

133
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,724
Are you insane?

134
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,383
Go.

135
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,543
Secure that vehicle!

136
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,467
- Who are they?
- We don't know yet, sir.

137
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,511
Step out!

138
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,391
Unlock the doors and step out right now.

139
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,811
- Hey, pal. What do you think you're doing?
- Stop right there, fellow.

140
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,647
Easy, big guy. Do we look like Vietcong?

141
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,274
You keep your hands
where I can see them, wiseass!

142
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,151
- Is that necessary?
- General.

143
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,571
Michael Harrison,
Director of Operations, CIA.

144
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,827
- Those men work for us.
- What are you spooks doing on my base?

145
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,496
- That's classified.
- Langley sent us to assist

146
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,623
- with the war effort.
- In what capacity?

147
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,084
Last time I checked,
D.O. Doesn't come under your jurisdiction.

148
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:52,672
- Am I talking to you?
- General, my superior will call you shortly.

149
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,300
Now I suggest we all calm down

150
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,053
and handle this
like the professionals we are.

151
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,181
- Shall we?
- You keep an eye on them, Frank.

152
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,891
Yes, sir.

153
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:19,157
They were here. I saw them.
Sharon... Linda's head was...

154
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,826
It's okay, sweetie, you're safe now.
That's all that matters.

155
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,411
I saw them!

156
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,790
The Japanese girl, Frank.
Why was she in our school?

157
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,085
- Washington arranged her enrollment, sir.
- Washington?

158
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:36,132
Well, registrar says her name is Saya.
She's the daughter of Motoki Shishikura,

159
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,009
a soon-to-be-appointed ambassador to D.C.

160
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:43,014
Well, you confirm that with our local liaison.
You get a warrant issued and find her.

161
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:47,185
They cleaned it all up!
Dad, look, it's still wet.

162
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,191
We gotta find out
what these guys are doing, Frank.

163
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,527
That could be a problem, sir. We don't have
the authority to detain Agency personnel.

164
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,321
I'll deal with that.

165
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,698
I respectfully disagree, sir.

166
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,454
Then I will have to file an official
complaint with the Pentagon.

167
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,875
I understand, sir.

168
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,630
Dad, whoever they are, they've covered
up two murders. You can't let them go.

169
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,225
- Cut them loose, Frank. Alice.
- Yes, sir. Stand down!

170
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,521
You son of a bitch.

171
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,401
What's wrong with you,
taunting Mckee like that?

172
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,863
In case you didn't notice,
they pulled their guns on me.

173
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,658
We've gotta clean up this mess
or the Council will have our heads.

174
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,577
What's the Elder thinking, anyway,
sending Saya into a high school?

175
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,497
- She's older than all of us combined!
- Yeah.

176
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,668
Christ.

177
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,674
The Elder wants to see us.

178
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,594
Something was wrong with them!
Linda's blood...

179
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,724
Sweetie, you're still in shock.
It's understandable. You go get some sleep.

180
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,311
You have to believe me.
Mr. Powell knows something!

181
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,981
How can he know anything
if he wasn't even there?

182
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:20,069
- Now would you just go get some sleep!
- Dad, you're wrong.

183
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,533
Alice, that's enough! Look,
would you just leave it to the grown-ups?

184
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,119
We'll talk in the morning.

185
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,207
Yes? Frank, what do you have?

186
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,128
Yeah, just as I said.

187
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,631
If there were to be a new ambassador,
I would have been briefed.

188
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,093
Guys with sunglasses and funny hats
wave their cheap badges around

189
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,179
and I'm supposed to believe
they're sent by Langley?

190
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,432
Do what ever you have to.

191
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,685
Find out who they are
and what the hell they're doing on my base!

192
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,361
Sir.

193
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,447
Sit.

194
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,289
- Everything according to plan?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,294
Rumor has it Mckee
was calling Langley and Washington.

196
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:05,299
Very curious about both of you.
Was that part of your plan?

197
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,845
We had a run-in with him, yes.

198
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,767
Having American friends in high places
doesn't mean I'm Uncle Sam.

199
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,603
A little discretion would be nice.

200
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,774
The Council has to remain anonymous.

201
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,152
Our American connections
cannot risk exposure.

202
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,864
Don't get too cozy playing CIA.

203
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,161
I'll take care of it. Leave it to me.
You have my word, sir.

204
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,039
- Hungry?
- Starving.

205
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,500
Here's something to curb your appetite.

206
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,464
A plane crashed in the Okutama Mountains
this morning.

207
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,176
Those are the crew members onboard,
what's left of them, anyway.

208
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,557
This is Onigen's work.

209
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,101
Those photos were taken
before we cleaned up the scene.

210
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,644
No one else knows.

211
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,189
- She's here? She took the bait.
- Yes.

212
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,902
Now, Onigen's here, blood will be shed.

213
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,213
I'm sorry, sir, ma'am.

214
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,718
The Onsen opens 24 hours.
Feel free to enjoy anytime.

215
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:35,055
Anything else you need?
I see you have no luggage.

216
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,727
Observant and caring.
Your wife is a lucky lady.

217
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:46,150
Yes. If only she thinks so.
She and my daughters are preparing dinner.

218
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,403
It will be ready soon in the dining hall.

219
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,239
I can't believe that!

220
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,501
I'm sorry.

221
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:22,353
Come out and play, my children.
The feeding season has begun.

222
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,015
Mr. Powell, how are you?

223
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,725
- How's life?
- Six pence half a shilling.

224
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,395
- You can do the conversion to yen.
- The usual?

225
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,688
On the rocks.

226
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,287
Hi, dear Alice, welcome!

227
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,749
So, what's your poison tonight?

228
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,210
Leave us, Hide.

229
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,007
You lied.

230
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,553
You knew Linda and Sharon were gonna
hurt me and you lied to my dad.

231
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:47,021
Why me? What did I do?
What... What do you want from me?

232
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:51,442
It's all about you, you, you, isn't it?
What if you're wrong? Delusional?

233
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,903
- You ever thought about that?
- I know what I saw.

234
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,910
What you see has got nothing to do
with what's real.

235
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,081
You look around, you see an air base
run by Daddy, flying his B-52s

236
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,002
to wipe out gook farmers in rice paddies,
fighting his righteous war.

237
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,090
But you don't see the real war,
the one that's been going on

238
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,302
since the beginning of time
between your kind and mine.

239
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,973
And the end is upon you, brought on
by your self-deceiving Godliness

240
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,896
and your pretentious moral high ground.
We will come out the victors.

241
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,900
Welcome to the other side
of the looking glass.

242
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,569
Now it's time to die.

243
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,465
Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, please!

244
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,346
No, no!

245
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,837
Let her go!

246
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,807
No!

247
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,783
Get down.

248
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,818
He's getting away.

249
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,237
He's wounded. Get closer!

250
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:14,713
Faster!

251
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,136
Get closer!

252
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,976
Closer!

253
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,222
- I'm a demon?
- No!

254
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,436
You have a human soul!

255
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,853
What is it? She's near?

256
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,535
Mr. Powell, Sharon and Linda,

257
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,581
- all of them...
- They never existed.

258
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,834
What exactly were they?

259
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,879
Bloodsuckers.

260
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,134
They take on human form.
It's the way they live.

261
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,974
So I guess you're not
really a student, are you?

262
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:20,774
- Are there more of those things out there?
- More than you can imagine.

263
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:28,323
- Anything I can do?
- It's not your war. Go home.

264
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,787
- And forget everything.
- And leave you fighting them alone?

265
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,999
I can take care of myself.

266
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,344
My dad is the general at the base.
I could tell him, and...

267
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,471
- Don't tell anyone!
- Why?

268
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,391
You want to live?
You want your father to live?

269
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,142
Then don't!

270
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,315
All right. He wouldn't believe me, anyway.

271
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,820
Saya.

272
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,823
Be really careful, okay?

273
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,268
- Did they see you?
- No, sir.

274
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,869
- Are these weapons?
- No, I don't think so.

275
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,038
There were a total of four cases.

276
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,417
All seemed like standard issues,
as far as I can tell, sir.

277
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,668
From the Agency?

278
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,546
Well, that's if these guys
are actually from the Agency at all.

279
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,673
Call up the tech guys.

280
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,217
What in God's name are these things?

281
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,345
Slugs, snails and puppy dog's tails.

282
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,723
Easy.

283
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,809
I'm here to talk, that's all.

284
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,480
- How dare you enter my home uninvited?
- My apologies.

285
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,190
Old habits die hard.

286
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,193
I've been with the Agency
one day too long I guess.

287
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,777
What do you want?

288
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,031
Did you authorize the burglary, General?

289
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,241
You're not taking it back. It's evidence.

290
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,162
- Of what?
- That's for Central Command to decide.

291
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,539
Wait! General.

292
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,876
I know we started off on the wrong foot.
It's my fault.

293
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,213
But we’re on the same side, I assure you.

294
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,508
The side that murdered
two high school girls? I don't think so.

295
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,637
I have come here to give you Saya, General.
She's not with the Agency.

296
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,932
I can't be held responsible.
She's out of control.

297
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,189
Where is she? Get this down, Frank.

298
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,693
Hotel Yuzuya. Togoshi-ginza Street.
Ni-Cho, five seven...

299
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,820
Hang on. Tell me the street again?

300
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,448
Togoshi-ginza.

301
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,244
I know it. It's in the Shinagawa ward.
About 30 minutes from here...

302
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,932
You left me no choice, General.
I couldn't leave the case with you.

303
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,059
Who are you people?

304
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,647
Saviors of the human race.

305
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,735
The Council has been around

306
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,365
since before your granddaddy's granddaddy
stole his land from the Indians.

307
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,243
We walk a higher path, General.

308
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,581
Run, Alice, run!

309
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,687
Dad! Dad! Dad!

310
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,484
Dad. Dad?

311
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,405
Alice, get off the base!

312
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:41,451
- Alice, you're not safe here.
- I don't know what to do.

313
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,703
Alice, leave, leave.

314
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,625
I love you, sweetie.

315
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,463
Dad. Dad! Dad!

316
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,919
Fucking A!

317
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,446
They were taken at the Onsen Hotel.

318
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,701
Onigen.

319
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,203
She's looking for you.

320
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,164
It's time we fought back.

321
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:15,628
Everything is being arranged.
But it's not gonna be easy.

322
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,965
I don't care!

323
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,260
The Council finds Onigen for me,
that's the deal.

324
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,387
It's already taken too long.

325
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,098
You ever think about the future,

326
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,559
after this?

327
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,646
There is more to life than Onigen.

328
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,485
Not for me.

329
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,649
Damn!

330
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,284
How did you find me?

331
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,119
They killed him.

332
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,374
You were right. She showed.

333
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,876
Copy that. I'm on my way. Take her out.

334
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,464
Take her out now! Do it now!
Do it! Now! Hurry up!

335
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,761
The people you work for, they killed my dad!

336
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,097
- I don’t work for them.
- You're lying!

337
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,765
Thank you.

338
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,479
I kill the bloodsuckers.
They provide me what I need to survive.

339
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,940
That's all.

340
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,194
Why my dad? Why?

341
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,156
I'll find out from...

342
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,533
Down!

343
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,764
- Give me the girl, Saya!
- No.

344
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,602
This has nothing to do with you.
Don't mess with me, halfling!

345
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,563
Luke?

346
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,107
- Michael.
- Put down the gun.

347
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,653
- Put it down.
- He killed Mckee.

348
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,239
Are you insane?
What the hell do you think you're doing?

349
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,617
My job! I've cleaned up the mess, haven't I?

350
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,827
You're making a bigger mess!

351
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,496
Not when I get that girl.

352
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,583
- No.
- Luke,

353
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,753
I'm not gonna tell you again.

354
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,302
You're not really gonna shoot me, Michael.

355
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,762
Try me.

356
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,600
Okay, you win.

357
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,437
But don't think I'm not gonna
tell the Elder all about this.

358
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,441
Be my guest. 'Cause I'm not the one
jeopardizing our mission.

359
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:09,195
- You're getting soft, old man.
- Maybe. But not stupid!

360
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,365
You all right?

361
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,040
Who's stupid now?

362
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,575
We have to go.

363
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,168
Wait.

364
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,929
You drive.

365
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,773
Radio Free Japan. Top of the hour.

366
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,735
The commanding officer of right
Air Force base, General Howard R. Mckee,

367
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,111
has died of a heart attack.

368
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,573
The General was discovered in critical
condition at his home a few hours ago.

369
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,784
The doctors on the scene
were unable to resuscitate him.

370
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,079
Authorities are asking your help
in finding his daughter, Alice Mckee,

371
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,750
who fled the base in an Air Force truck
shortly after hearing the news.

372
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,461
A base psychiatrist
describes the teen as unstable

373
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,629
and cautions that her life may be at risk.

374
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,936
Saya?

375
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,314
Saya, are you okay? Saya?

376
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,945
Wake up.

377
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,614
Saya, wake up.

378
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,949
Your blood.

379
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,374
Why did you save me?

380
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,960
I'm not your kind.

381
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,880
It was the right thing to do.

382
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,092
The right thing...

383
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,804
I used to know right from wrong.

384
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,516
Life used to feel right.

385
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,146
Kato raised me in the mountain village,

386
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,442
where I called home,

387
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,488
where I found the only friend in my life.

388
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,807
Happiness and love was within reach.

389
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,654
But then, the dark dream came.

390
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:52,037
In the dream, I killed him. Love was gone,

391
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,081
replaced by blood.

392
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,625
Saya! Saya sama!

393
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,006
Then I woke up, and it was not a dream.

394
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,384
What's happened?

395
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,595
Come, my girl. We have to go.

396
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,342
Take your father's sword!

397
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,385
I don't understand.

398
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,933
This sword has gathered dark powers

399
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:59,563
from all the demons it has slain.

400
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,024
It's a blessing

401
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,276
and a curse.

402
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,571
One you're not yet ready for.

403
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,827
But we have no time.

404
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,207
Demons have found us.

405
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,544
Kato...

406
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,678
Don't come out till I tell you to!

407
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,322
Don't follow me!

408
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,157
We go together!

409
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,659
No!

410
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,412
Kato.

411
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,082
It's time to be on your own, my girl.

412
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:05,003
What are you going to do?

413
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,721
My duty.

414
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,682
No, Kato!

415
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,644
Stay out of sight

416
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:25,107
until you're truly ready
to face the demons.

417
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,819
Now go and don't look back.

418
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,633
You okay?

419
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,721
You're thinking about your father?

420
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,514
Just...

421
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,184
Just all the little things.

422
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,311
What about you?

423
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,022
You have family?

424
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,861
My mother,

425
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,491
I never knew her.

426
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,745
My father,

427
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,753
he died days after I was born.

428
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,800
How?

429
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,928
Onigen murdered him.

430
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:43,435
The oldest, most powerful demon.

431
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,324
My father's most loyal retainer,

432
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,036
Kato, saved me.

433
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,333
He took me into the mountains,

434
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:12,965
cared for me, trained me to be strong,
to be like my father.

435
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,638
In the end, he died for me.

436
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:51,970
Kato!

437
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,808
Many a night,
Kato told me about my father's murder,

438
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,813
how demons deceived him
in the most despicable way.

439
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,110
That day I finally understood.

440
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,989
I'm my father's daughter,

441
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,534
but I'm also the evil that killed him.

442
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,996
Since that night,

443
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,208
time stopped.

444
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:29,549
I live for one purpose and one purpose only,

445
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,721
to kill Onigen.

446
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,186
That's my duty.

447
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,523
Kato was right.

448
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,861
Demons can't conjure up human souls.

449
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,910
Promise me one thing, also.

450
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,165
Never doubt yourself.

451
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,877
You're human.

452
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,592
I promise.

453
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,774
So much pain. So much struggle. Silly girl.

454
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,361
She's close by. Bring her to me.

455
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,780
Alive?

456
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,700
Still holding a grudge?

457
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,078
The halfling owes me.

458
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:45,083
Don't be ridiculous.
Her power is far beyond what it used to be.

459
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,420
We will see about that!

460
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,516
Let me out.

461
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,935
What?

462
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,689
You go alone.
Too dangerous to stay with me.

463
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,904
No. It's our war now.

464
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:43,892
Come on!

465
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,605
Start!

466
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,761
- Are you okay?
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

467
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,054
Alice!

468
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:51,477
- Dad, don't go.
- It's me! It's me, Alice!

469
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,439
Please wake up!

470
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,526
Okay, let's go!

471
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:26,554
Saya!

472
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,346
Alice. Alice.

473
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,566
This isn't really happening.

474
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,569
Any of it.

475
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:43,608
You.

476
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,287
You're alive.

477
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,630
Saya!

478
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,968
He isn't real!

479
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:56,264
This isn't really happening. None of it!

480
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,852
No. He's alive.

481
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,046
No. No.

482
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,475
You finally found me.

483
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,060
And I found you.

484
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:52,445
Look at you, my girl.
Eaten alive by guilt over a single human,

485
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:58,576
yet not a glimmer of regret for having
slaughtered so many of your own kind.

486
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,078
I'm not your kind.

487
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:07,752
Denial. Stubbornness.

488
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,631
You are, after all, your father's child.

489
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,802
I see you've taken good care of his sword.

490
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:21,224
- Show me your true form, Onigen!
- What do you want to see?

491
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,811
The demon who murdered my father.

492
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,942
The demon who I'll kill.

493
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:35,112
You knew all along, didn't you,
deep down in your heart?

494
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,368
I gave you your strength.

495
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:44,372
I gave you your power.

496
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,961
I gave you immortality,

497
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,588
my daughter.

498
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,009
No!

499
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:18,114
Silly girl, you've suffered long enough.

500
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,367
Come to me.

501
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,647
I've waited a long time, Saya,

502
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,526
for you to gain your strength, to be ready.

503
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,741
You think the more demons you kill,
the more human you become, don't you?

504
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,202
How naive.

505
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,751
The truth is, the more you kill,

506
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,171
the more you unleash your power.

507
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,592
You've come to your true nature.

508
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,137
Don't you see?

509
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:28,142
You've been doing everything you could
to become what you don’t want to be.

510
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,561
- To become me.
- Never!

511
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,564
It's your destiny, silly girl.

512
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,735
Leaves fall, forest grows on.

513
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:42,365
The future lies in you.

514
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,438
Let her go!

515
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,366
Alice! Alice!

516
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,995
Alice!

517
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,707
Don't you see now?

518
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:36,794
Which half of you gives you strength,
which half makes you feeble?

519
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:55,938
Let it all go. Unleash yourself.

520
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:59,400
You gave birth to me, and you can kill me,

521
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,819
but you're nothing to me!

522
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:25,217
You don't know
what it means to be a mother!

523
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:29,847
Kill me, my daughter. Kill me.

524
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,101
And become me!

525
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,594
Saya?

526
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:01,730
Saya.

527
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,746
Are you okay?

528
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:32,595
What's the point? You don't believe me.

529
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,347
These monsters,

530
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,894
you said one of them attacked
the army truck you stole.

531
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:43,939
But, when we found you
at the bottom of the ravine, you were alone.

532
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,858
They cleaned it up.

533
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:48,527
- They?
- The Council.

534
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,656
They killed my father.

535
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,869
Yes.

536
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,079
General Mckee,

537
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:03,834
mortally wounded by the sidearm
of Sergeant Frank Nielsen.

538
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:08,213
Sergeant Nielsen lost his son
in the war three months ago.

539
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:12,927
His psych evaluations show instability.

540
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:22,019
And this girl you mentioned, Saya, I believe.

541
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:27,107
Her name, her identity were false.

542
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,196
In fact, we believe she's not even Japanese.

543
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,199
Where is she right now?

544
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:39,286
She's out there.

545
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,205
Searching.

546
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:45,417
Searching for what?

547
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:48,712
Searching for a way back

548
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:54,718
from the other side of the looking glass.
