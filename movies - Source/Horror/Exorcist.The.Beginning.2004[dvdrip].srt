2
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:15,301
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

3
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:18,372
They're crap, squirrel.
They fall apart before you're out of the door.

4
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:20,931
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

5
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:22,826
Please.

6
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:26,339
My sister, she's very, very sick.

7
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,411
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

8
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:32,385
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

9
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,939
She's very, very sick.

10
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,920
I'll give you two.

11
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:42,279
That's a bad idea, you know.

12
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:45,662
Like feeding pigeons.

13
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:52,069
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

14
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,526
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

15
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,699
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

16
00:04:57,768 --> 00:04:59,623
And I didn't answer.

17
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:02,983
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

18
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:05,536
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

19
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:08,128
No, it's not possible.

20
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,655
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

21
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,996
but they never got that far south.

22
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,746
Nevertheless, there it sits.

23
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,597
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

24
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,735
We believe a rare object waits inside.

25
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:23,872
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

26
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,276
So you think I'm a thief?

27
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:32,898
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

28
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:35,550
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

29
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,660
in everything except himself.

30
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:40,579
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

31
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,782
You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

32
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:44,924
an expert in religious icons.

33
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:48,672
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

34
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:59,800
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

35
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:03,616
a representation
of a mythical demon.

36
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:24,117
It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

37
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,777
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

38
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:29,629
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

39
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,379
You're assuming that I will say yes.

40
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,902
You already have.

41
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:39,317
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

42
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,976
Left. Left, right, left.

43
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:45,394
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

44
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,291
Left.

45
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:50,586
Left, right, left.

46
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,370
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

47
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:05,013
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

48
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:12,180
Beautiful, aren't they?

49
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:15,033
It's a hobby from school days.

50
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,335
Works wonders for the nerves.

51
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,638
You should try it sometime.

52
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,476
What can you tell me about the dig?

53
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:28,403
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

54
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,261
called Derati.

55
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,809
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

56
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,735
on maneuvers there.

57
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,062
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

58
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,469
What have they learned so far?

59
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:47,886
That it's a church
where no church should be.

60
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,260
This is Father Francis.

61
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,847
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

62
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:55,788
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

63
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:58,961
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

64
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,251
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

65
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:08,052
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

66
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:11,433
I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

67
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,418
when Rome learned of the discovery.

68
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,616
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

69
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:19,888
Hmm.

70
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:22,825
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

71
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,590
We haven't...

72
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,764
officially.

73
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:29,552
You're both my guests.

74
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:32,848
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

75
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,987
Well, not until I've seen it.

76
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:38,124
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

77
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:41,194
I'm afraid not.

78
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,600
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

79
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,959
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

80
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:05,228
The British hired me as an interpreter.

81
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:11,786
What happened here?

82
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:15,150
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

83
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:18,825
- How many died?
- All of them.

84
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:17,442
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

85
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,578
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

86
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:23,996
He did.

87
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:28,230
Is something bothering you, mate?

88
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,860
No.

89
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,317
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

90
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,594
I shouldn't...

91
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:41,051
but my will is weak.

92
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,831
Then you might just survive this place.

93
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,927
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

94
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,266
but that progress has slowed down.

95
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,220
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

96
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:00,216
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster- Lancaster Merrin.

97
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:04,890
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

98
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:09,273
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

99
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:12,248
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

100
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:14,177
How about a muzzle?

101
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,170
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

102
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:24,608
- They're not.
- No?

103
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:26,746
Has the structure collapsed?

104
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,856
No, the church is perfect...

105
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:31,514
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

106
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,853
Why's that?

107
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,225
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

108
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:48,088
Well... pleasant fellow.

109
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,460
What's wrong with his face?

110
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:53,625
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

111
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:56,857
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind oflocalized infection.

112
00:11:56,926 --> 00:12:00,700
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

113
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:03,634
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

114
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,709
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

115
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,482
No. I'm a doctor.

116
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,426
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

117
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,442
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

118
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:17,425
Now, that's funny.

119
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,216
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

120
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:23,512
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

121
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,254
Father Merrin.

122
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:32,210
This is Emekwi.

123
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:35,730
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

124
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,485
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

125
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:42,131
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

126
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:45,135
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

127
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,176
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

128
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,932
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

129
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,520
James. Joseph.

130
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:56,848
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

131
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,288
There's your goddamn church.

132
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:56,492
Is this your first assignment, Father?

133
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,758
Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

134
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,127
The Vatican.
Impressive.

135
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:05,062
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

136
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,330
This is strange.

137
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:31,660
It's 1,500 years old.

138
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:33,930
It should be badly weathered.

139
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,892
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

140
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:40,835
Chuma.

141
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,975
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

142
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,597
Hyenas?

143
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,708
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

144
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,650
Even at daytime?

145
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:01,570
No! No! No!

146
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,435
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

147
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:09,474
The heat?

148
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,720
Joseph?

149
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:33,437
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

150
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:36,828
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

151
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,002
I think you're about
ready for this now.

152
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,703
It's a tool for professional diggers.

153
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,945
Wow.

154
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:51,717
His seizure's stopped.

155
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:54,651
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

156
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:57,595
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

157
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:01,787
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

158
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,770
You have no idea.

159
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:08,060
Thank you.

160
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:10,914
So what is it you hope to find here?

161
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,519
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

162
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:20,673
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

163
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,227
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

164
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:27,677
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

165
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:30,594
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

166
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:34,105
I, uh- I found this...

167
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:36,317
and, uh, I want you to have it.

168
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:39,255
It's a St. Joseph, for luck.

169
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,327
Please, for my behavior.

170
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:51,836
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

171
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:55,003
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

172
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:57,657
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

173
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,902
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

174
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,048
It's okay. Come.

175
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,507
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

176
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,437
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

177
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,192
A few days.

178
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:14,939
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

179
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,339
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

180
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,076
Following us, Father?

181
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:32,915
Is it safe to walk around?

182
00:18:32,982 --> 00:18:34,891
Let's see.

183
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,654
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

184
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:59,592
Cast out after the war in heaven.

185
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,969
Can't even trust angels, can you?

186
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:16,622
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

187
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,425
It's odd.

188
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,171
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

189
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,916
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

190
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,422
Look behind you, Father.

191
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,176
Desecration of Christ.

192
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,970
Who would do something like this?

193
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:09,449
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

194
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,882
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

195
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,770
I wouldn't know.

196
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,323
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

197
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:20,039
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

198
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:23,685
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

199
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:26,437
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

200
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:28,645
He's gone mad.

201
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:37,889
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

202
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,808
They are superstitious.

203
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:47,940
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

204
00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:48,509
- Chuma.
- Yes?

205
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:52,472
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

206
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:59,606
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

207
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,877
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

208
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:05,432
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

209
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,667
And what does it say?

210
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:10,590
The fallen shall rise...

211
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:13,273
in a river of blood. "

212
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,009
Do you have a moment?

213
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,825
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

214
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:55,705
Or maybe something
more substantial?

215
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,909
Yes, that would be very nice.

216
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,560
You dabble in the occult?

217
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:06,484
I found them here when I arrived.

218
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,647
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

219
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,278
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

220
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:26,737
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

221
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:29,174
He had no medical symptoms...

222
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,712
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

223
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:36,882
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

224
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:39,667
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

225
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,003
That and the disappearances.

226
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,787
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

227
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:47,188
Runaways?

228
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,141
Or is it those evil spirits?

229
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:51,115
Yeah.

230
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:05,289
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

231
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:08,430
My father was a strong man.

232
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,020
When the Nazis started
rounding up theJews in our town...

233
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,994
he didn't hesitate.

234
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,107
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

235
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:18,186
But someone turned us in...

236
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,073
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

237
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,797
I'm sorry.

238
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:26,445
People can't really
understand, can they?

239
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:29,034
If they weren't there...

240
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,374
if they didn't see.

241
00:24:31,442 --> 00:24:33,351
No.

242
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:38,573
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

243
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,593
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

244
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:47,493
One night I realized
I- I had to tell him the truth...

245
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,957
about... the Nazis...

246
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,901
and what they did to me.

247
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:56,456
After that, he never touched me again.

248
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,690
So...

249
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:02,660
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

250
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,012
I don't know.
I suppose I-

251
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:11,242
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

252
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,676
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

253
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:15,814
No.

254
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:19,114
There's no point in that.

255
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:22,246
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

256
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,449
I should get to bed.

257
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:39,016
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

258
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:43,429
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

259
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,887
He runs the sanitarium.

260
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,645
Well, thank you...

261
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,364
for the medical care.

262
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,790
Deliver us from evil...

263
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,671
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

264
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:03,908
Amen.

265
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,005
You, priest.
What is your name?

266
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm Father Merrin.

267
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,840
God is not here today, priest.

268
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,649
Want some water?

269
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:34,967
Hey, what's wrong?

270
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:44,941
It's late.

271
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,154
You should go back to bed.

272
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,037
Give it to me! It's mine!

273
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,721
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

274
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,637
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.

275
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,425
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!

276
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,428
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

277
00:29:08,502 --> 00:29:10,160
Give it to me!
It's mine.

278
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,847
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!

279
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,305
All right. Okay, okay.

280
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:18,642
Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

281
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:32,402
Joseph, look out!

282
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,605
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

283
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:37,325
Joseph, help me!

284
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,359
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

285
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:03,177
No! Help me!

286
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:27,021
Help! Help me!

287
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,059
Help me!

288
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:41,383
Help me!
Help me! Please!

289
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:55,903
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.

290
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:59,807
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

291
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:01,507
They were focused on his brother.

292
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:06,695
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

293
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:28,092
Can you see?
Can you hear?

294
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:39,780
Come with me.

295
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,296
Monsieur Bession?

296
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:32,217
Mr. Bession.

297
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:34,361
You worked on a dig in Derati.

298
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,916
You drew a picture of an idol.

299
00:32:41,983 --> 00:32:44,700
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

300
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:47,418
Mr. Bession.

301
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:51,131
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

302
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:54,101
I said how do you know my name?

303
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:05,752
Are you hurt?

304
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:07,730
No.

305
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,402
I'm free.

306
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:23,732
God is not here today, priest.

307
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:07,118
I hope he finds peace.

308
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,485
I'm Father Gionetti.

309
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,005
I've been waiting for you.

310
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:15,696
How did he know my name?

311
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:18,668
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

312
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,226
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

313
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,977
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

314
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,859
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

315
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:31,699
So, "touched. "
What does that mean?

316
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:35,725
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

317
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:38,479
was plagued by possession.

318
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:41,035
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

319
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:43,017
committing unspeakable acts.

320
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:46,637
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

321
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:50,863
Simply horny... and inventive.

322
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:55,567
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

323
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:59,278
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

324
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:02,661
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

325
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:05,126
with evil.

326
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:09,030
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

327
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,690
And that evil remains in Derati.

328
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:14,794
You must be careful there.

329
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:18,693
Remember, he is the father of lies.

330
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:22,084
He will seek to poison your mind.

331
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,029
You will need this against him.

332
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:30,696
The Roman Rituals.

333
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:34,344
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

334
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,323
I'm not a priest anymore.

335
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,918
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

336
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,086
Only your faith can save you.

337
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:44,230
Well, then I'm doomed.

338
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:42,716
Joseph?

339
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:04,411
What do you have there?

340
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,563
Can I see?

341
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:34,016
You threw it away.

342
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:38,751
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

343
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:41,665
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.

344
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:44,576
- The clasp must have come loose-
- Liar!

345
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:50,143
Do I repulse you that much?

346
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,142
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

347
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:56,380
I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

348
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,222
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

349
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,709
What?

350
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:09,466
He's coming for you.

351
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:25,202
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

352
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:27,065
Ohh.

353
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:29,019
Don't worry.

354
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:31,059
You'll be fine.

355
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:51,122
Where is everybody?

356
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:54,576
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

357
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,308
Oh.

358
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:26,194
Joseph. Hey.

359
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:37,995
Joseph.

360
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:49,201
You're back.

361
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:53,043
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

362
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:56,970
These lesions-
they're not from the shock, are they?

363
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:59,826
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

364
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,996
Itjust doesn't make sense.

365
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,717
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?

366
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:07,153
In this part of the world...

367
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:09,673
it could be a dozen things...

368
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:12,364
but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

369
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,855
So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

370
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:21,222
I have to do some work up at the dig.

371
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:24,396
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.

372
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,982
Come sit with me, Lancaster.

373
00:40:32,112 --> 00:40:34,414
I promise I won't bite.

374
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:44,487
What is it?

375
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:47,755
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

376
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,921
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

377
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,553
- How?
- I don't know.

378
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,490
Some accident.

379
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:19,051
I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

380
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,798
It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

381
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:25,893
Hey.

382
00:41:28,043 --> 00:41:30,148
Easy.

383
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,031
Help me hold him.

384
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:44,336
Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.

385
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:11,975
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.

386
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,689
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.

387
00:56:14,759 --> 00:56:16,668
You don't understand.

388
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,470
What they did to me
in the camp. They-

389
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:25,145
There's nothing left to bleed.

390
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,786
There is something here,
something evil.

391
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,240
Sarah, it's so much easier
to believe in evil as an entity...

392
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:35,168
but it's not.

393
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:38,810
It's a purely human condition
inside all of us.

394
00:56:40,321 --> 00:56:43,385
Did Bession talk about
what he found under the church?

395
00:56:45,247 --> 00:56:47,799
There's an ancient temple below,
a pagan place...

396
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:51,032
where they used to conduct sacrifices,
human sacrifices.

397
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:54,329
Why would they build a church
on top of something like that?

398
00:56:54,397 --> 00:56:56,917
Perhaps to purify the site.

399
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:59,192
But then why bury it?

400
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,454
No!

401
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:45,029
Merrin!

402
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:47,524
You better come with me.

403
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,987
Jefferies didn't show up
for the dig this morning.

404
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:54,021
He wasn't in his room,
so they came to the bar and they found-

405
00:58:38,624 --> 00:58:41,754
Chief Sebituana's baby
was stillborn last night.

406
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:43,678
He blames the whites.

407
00:58:43,744 --> 00:58:45,686
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?

408
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:48,725
I think this place
is on the verge of an uprising.

409
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,620
I've contacted Major Granville.

410
00:58:50,686 --> 00:58:53,685
A detachment will be here
by this afternoon.

411
00:58:53,758 --> 00:58:55,797
You disagree?

412
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,044
In my experience, bringing soldiers
into a situation is always a bad idea.

413
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:30,601
Who buried them?

414
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:37,577
Everybody died.

415
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,463
Who buried them?

416
01:00:00,844 --> 01:00:04,225
All right! Halt!

417
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:06,153
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.

418
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:08,933
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!

419
01:00:11,368 --> 01:00:13,921
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.

420
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:17,307
Well, you did the right thing
calling me, Father.

421
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:20,349
I've been in these situations before...

422
01:00:20,422 --> 01:00:22,756
and you have to stay on top of-

423
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,338
on top of these people.

424
01:00:29,412 --> 01:00:33,208
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible
for what's happening here, Major.

425
01:00:36,419 --> 01:00:39,167
Major Granville?

426
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:43,420
This dig is too important to jeopardize...

427
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,421
and until I'm satisfied
that the excavation is secure...

428
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:48,916
the British Army will
assume complete control.

429
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:50,648
The Turkana won't like
the show of force.

430
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:53,978
I'm not concerned with
what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!

431
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:57,361
If they start any more trouble,
they will have to answer...

432
01:00:57,436 --> 01:01:00,882
to the might
of His Majesty King George.

433
01:01:06,523 --> 01:01:08,377
You cannot be here.

434
01:01:08,442 --> 01:01:11,255
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.

435
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:14,418
You are not welcome here.

436
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:18,349
I want to know about the plague
that destroyed this village 50 years ago.

437
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,365
It was not a plague.

438
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:24,660
So, what was it?

439
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:26,896
The evil in your church...

440
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,680
it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...

441
01:01:29,748 --> 01:01:31,689
and it is getting stronger.

442
01:01:31,764 --> 01:01:34,763
You must abandon your work...

443
01:01:34,835 --> 01:01:37,518
or we'll be forced to stop you.

444
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:40,400
So you don't want to tell me?

445
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:50,762
He says he doesn't have to tell you
because it's happening again...

446
01:01:50,831 --> 01:01:52,969
right now.

447
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:23,066
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.

448
01:02:23,143 --> 01:02:25,531
Then who's buried in that graveyard?

449
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:09,176
I'm sorry.

450
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:37,041
What are you-

451
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:17,480
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.

452
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:54,501
I will shoot 10, priest,
and you will choose.

453
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,062
I can't do that.

454
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:07,240
No! No!

455
01:06:07,307 --> 01:06:09,347
Now you choose...

456
01:06:09,418 --> 01:06:11,327
or I will kill them all.

457
01:06:14,506 --> 01:06:17,319
Are you praying...

458
01:06:17,384 --> 01:06:18,812
to God?

459
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:21,539
Shoot me.

460
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,130
God is not here today, priest.

461
01:07:06,428 --> 01:07:09,590
Papa!

462
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:47,152
- They're empty!
- What?

463
01:07:47,217 --> 01:07:49,605
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?

464
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,101
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.

465
01:07:52,177 --> 01:07:54,990
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.

466
01:07:55,055 --> 01:07:57,225
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!

467
01:07:57,295 --> 01:07:59,149
There are crosses on the coffins!

468
01:07:59,215 --> 01:08:01,832
The church buried them, didn't they?

469
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:03,689
Didn't they?

470
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:05,666
Yes.

471
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:07,595
Why?

472
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,993
What were they hiding?

473
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,448
That this place is damned.

474
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:15,652
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!

475
01:08:16,618 --> 01:08:19,399
There was a massacre here...

476
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:22,082
1,500 years ago.

477
01:08:22,152 --> 01:08:25,020
An army from the west,
led by two priests...

478
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:28,763
searching for the origin
of a powerful evil.

479
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:32,132
But when they got here
that evil consumed them...

480
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:35,328
turning the soldiers
against each other in a bloodbath.

481
01:08:35,397 --> 01:08:37,763
Only a single priest survived.

482
01:08:37,828 --> 01:08:40,641
When that priest made it back
to the EmperorJustinian...

483
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:44,001
he ordered that a church
be built over the site and then buried...

484
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:45,920
to seal the evil inside.

485
01:08:45,987 --> 01:08:49,051
All mention of it was to be stricken
from the history texts forever.

486
01:08:49,122 --> 01:08:50,976
But it wasn't?

487
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,626
No.

488
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,867
In 1893...

489
01:08:55,936 --> 01:08:59,796
a Vatican researcher
found an ancient letter in the archives.

490
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:02,292
Four priests came
to examine the site...

491
01:09:02,366 --> 01:09:05,659
enlisting the help of the people
of this valley in their search...

492
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,309
and they all disappeared.

493
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:10,550
Where did they go?

494
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,528
No one knows.

495
01:09:13,914 --> 01:09:16,597
The Vatican ordered a cover-up-

496
01:09:16,665 --> 01:09:18,999
the false graveyard...

497
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:21,999
the tale of a plague to-

498
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:24,853
to scare people away.

499
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:27,090
And then the British
stumbled across it.

500
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,671
And I was sent here
to see if the legend was real.

501
01:09:30,742 --> 01:09:33,108
What legend?

502
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,888
That after the war in heaven...

503
01:09:35,956 --> 01:09:38,344
this is the spot where Lucifer fell.

504
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:51,791
God brought you here, Lancaster.

505
01:09:51,857 --> 01:09:53,896
Leave me alone.

506
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:57,742
No.

507
01:09:57,807 --> 01:09:59,595
The devil is here...

508
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:01,517
inside that boy.

509
01:10:01,582 --> 01:10:03,436
The Turkana know it.

510
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:07,275
They came to drive the devil from him,
and he almost killed them.

511
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:09,511
You can't run from this.

512
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,816
You must help me.

513
01:10:12,972 --> 01:10:15,305
I can't.

514
01:10:15,371 --> 01:10:18,184
But you've seen what's going on here.

515
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,638
You have to believe.

516
01:10:24,008 --> 01:10:25,862
I believe in nothing.

517
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:31,647
Found Jefferies.

518
01:10:49,857 --> 01:10:51,482
- Over there!
- As you were!

519
01:10:51,553 --> 01:10:54,453
Major Granville!
Wait!

520
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,196
Get him down.

521
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:33,995
Get him down!

522
01:11:41,524 --> 01:11:43,433
You all right, Major?

523
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:47,473
Savages.

524
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:58,986
Major! Major!

525
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:11,083
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?

526
01:12:11,148 --> 01:12:13,896
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!

527
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,714
- You must leave.
- Granville!

528
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:19,047
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!

529
01:12:19,113 --> 01:12:21,447
You must return Turkana to us now.

530
01:12:21,513 --> 01:12:23,520
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.

531
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:25,448
You have already polluted our lives.

532
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:29,635
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.

533
01:12:29,703 --> 01:12:31,361
Granville!

534
01:12:32,934 --> 01:12:36,228
No!

535
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:39,903
No! No!

536
01:12:42,085 --> 01:12:44,669
No!

537
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:48,251
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!

538
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,110
Chuma!

539
01:12:50,178 --> 01:12:51,835
Merrin.

540
01:12:53,377 --> 01:12:56,060
They believe it is inside Joseph.

541
01:12:56,129 --> 01:12:58,016
They are going to kill him.

542
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,632
Now, please... go!

543
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:06,554
You animals!

544
01:13:32,726 --> 01:13:35,507
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!

545
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:41,489
Three boxes of ammunition!

546
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,280
Sir. The Turkana
are preparing to attack.

547
01:13:48,211 --> 01:13:49,966
Leave me.

548
01:13:51,442 --> 01:13:53,351
Sir?

549
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:57,157
I said, leave me.

550
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:00,677
Yes, sir.

551
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:40,180
We must leave now.

552
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:42,099
Why?

553
01:15:42,165 --> 01:15:44,498
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

554
01:15:44,564 --> 01:15:46,735
Take the boy to Nairobi.

555
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:48,843
Father Gionetti.

556
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:50,987
Why?

557
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:52,967
Turkana are coming to kill him.

558
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:04,613
It's a sandstorm.

559
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:12,291
It won't let us leave.

560
01:16:15,596 --> 01:16:18,529
We have to hide him.

561
01:16:18,603 --> 01:16:20,512
- The church.
- No!

562
01:16:20,586 --> 01:16:22,440
The Turkana won't go in there.

563
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:24,393
It's his only chance.

564
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:28,833
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.

565
01:16:28,904 --> 01:16:30,529
We'll meet you.

566
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:32,487
Francis!

567
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:40,255
Now go.

568
01:16:50,915 --> 01:16:52,670
Sarah?

569
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,231
The Lord is coming for you.

570
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:03,189
Sarah?

571
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:04,789
Sarah!

572
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,947
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sanctu.

573
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,750
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!

574
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:43,793
Sarah?

575
01:19:58,354 --> 01:19:59,913
Sarah!

576
01:20:58,402 --> 01:21:00,310
Oh, my God.

577
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,766
Bession was Sarah's husband?

578
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,366
Yes.

579
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,050
She went into the church
with him, didn't she?

580
01:21:14,526 --> 01:21:17,557
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.

581
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:19,482
Sancti Michael Archangel-

582
01:21:58,674 --> 01:22:00,528
Ready yourselves, men!

583
01:22:09,423 --> 01:22:11,332
Fire!

584
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:28,638
Chuma!

585
01:24:30,186 --> 01:24:32,389
Francis?

586
01:24:32,457 --> 01:24:34,398
Francis.

587
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:55,232
Francis.

588
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:24,688
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.

589
01:25:24,764 --> 01:25:26,618
I need you.

590
01:25:26,683 --> 01:25:30,097
These people need you.
This valley needs you.

591
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:32,690
Hear my cry.

592
01:25:32,762 --> 01:25:34,834
Do not abandon me now.

593
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:03,246
Forgive my sins.

594
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:09,415
Joseph.

595
01:26:14,575 --> 01:26:16,909
Come sit with us, Lancaster.

596
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:20,133
I promise I won't bite!

597
01:26:20,204 --> 01:26:22,887
Joseph, run.

598
01:26:26,092 --> 01:26:28,033
- He's mine.
- Run!

599
01:26:35,242 --> 01:26:38,142
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.

600
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:46,275
I am a fallen priest.

601
01:26:52,485 --> 01:26:54,339
Lord, have mercy on us.

602
01:26:54,404 --> 01:26:56,792
Christ, have mercy on us.

603
01:26:56,868 --> 01:26:59,169
Lord, have mercy on us.

604
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:01,569
God, Father in heaven,
have mercy on us.

605
01:27:03,075 --> 01:27:06,040
God, the Son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us.

606
01:27:06,114 --> 01:27:09,276
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.

607
01:27:09,344 --> 01:27:12,092
Christ, hear us.

608
01:27:13,759 --> 01:27:16,279
Holy Mary, pray for us.

609
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:18,260
Christ, hear us.

610
01:27:19,742 --> 01:27:22,458
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?

611
01:27:22,525 --> 01:27:24,433
Don't you want to
fuck me anymore?

612
01:27:28,635 --> 01:27:31,634
All ye holy angels and archangels...

613
01:27:31,707 --> 01:27:33,462
pray for us!

614
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:36,823
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits,
pray for us!

615
01:27:36,889 --> 01:27:40,684
Why would he listen to you?

616
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:42,516
You.

617
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:45,616
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.

618
01:27:45,687 --> 01:27:47,508
Without hope.

619
01:27:53,044 --> 01:27:55,596
Almighty Lord...

620
01:27:55,668 --> 01:27:57,577
and father ofJesus Christ...

621
01:27:57,652 --> 01:28:00,498
grant me, your unworthy servant,
pardon for all my sins...

622
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:02,984
and the power to fight this cruel-

623
01:28:18,606 --> 01:28:21,921
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.

624
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:24,418
No! Father!

625
01:28:25,324 --> 01:28:27,178
Joseph!

626
01:28:27,244 --> 01:28:30,504
Father, help me!

627
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:33,221
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!

628
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,355
Father Merrin!

629
01:28:36,426 --> 01:28:39,076
Merrin!

630
01:28:54,373 --> 01:28:58,201
O Lord, by your name save me.

631
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,089
By your strength
defend my cause.

632
01:29:30,139 --> 01:29:32,277
No!

633
01:30:04,915 --> 01:30:06,703
- Father!
- Joseph?

634
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:19,658
Joseph!Joseph!

635
01:30:19,727 --> 01:30:21,635
Wait!

636
01:30:23,214 --> 01:30:25,101
Joseph.

637
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:26,920
Father!

638
01:30:26,989 --> 01:30:28,898
I'm coming.

639
01:30:52,358 --> 01:30:55,324
O God, hear my prayer.

640
01:30:55,397 --> 01:30:57,534
The ruthless seek my life.

641
01:30:57,604 --> 01:31:00,767
They do not keep God before them.

642
01:31:00,836 --> 01:31:03,104
Turn back the evil upon my foes.

643
01:31:04,803 --> 01:31:07,648
In your faithfulness destroy them.

644
01:31:34,107 --> 01:31:35,699
Where's your God now, Merrin?

645
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:38,322
Fucking his only son
while you call out his name?

646
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:41,174
He doesn't care about this whore.

647
01:31:41,241 --> 01:31:42,866
But you do...

648
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:45,935
because you want to
shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.

649
01:31:54,805 --> 01:31:57,008
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.

650
01:31:57,076 --> 01:32:00,042
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.

651
01:32:02,355 --> 01:32:06,729
From the souls made to
the image and likeness of God...

652
01:32:06,803 --> 01:32:08,558
I cast you out!

653
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:12,166
You're a killer, Merrin.

654
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:15,207
You looked them in the eye,
pointed your finger, and they died.

655
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,988
God is not here today, priest.

656
01:32:21,678 --> 01:32:23,400
Oh, yes, he is.

657
01:32:40,617 --> 01:32:42,405
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.

658
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:45,189
Fail him like you failed all the others.

659
01:32:45,257 --> 01:32:48,671
God, spare this child,
for he is innocent...

660
01:32:48,743 --> 01:32:50,565
and deserves your blessing.

661
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:53,695
God, spare this child...

662
01:32:53,765 --> 01:32:55,455
for he is innocent...

663
01:32:55,525 --> 01:32:57,696
and deserves your blessing.

664
01:32:57,765 --> 01:33:01,506
God, spare this child, for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

665
01:33:07,011 --> 01:33:10,392
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!

666
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:13,018
It is God himself who commands you.

667
01:33:13,089 --> 01:33:15,259
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!

668
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:17,532
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.

669
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,290
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

670
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:21,049
The mystery of the cross commands you!

671
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:23,540
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!

672
01:33:36,315 --> 01:33:38,703
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.

673
01:33:38,778 --> 01:33:40,949
Sarah.

674
01:33:41,018 --> 01:33:43,286
It's over now.

675
01:33:52,887 --> 01:33:57,616
Joseph.

676
01:34:10,546 --> 01:34:13,033
Merrin!

677
01:34:13,104 --> 01:34:15,657
Father!

678
01:34:23,023 --> 01:34:25,356
Don't be afraid.

679
01:34:25,423 --> 01:34:27,277
I need your help,Joseph.

680
01:34:32,428 --> 01:34:36,834
Listen, whatever you hear,
whatever you see, it's just his lies.

681
01:34:36,906 --> 01:34:40,614
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?

682
01:34:40,682 --> 01:34:43,048
Don't listen!

683
01:34:43,113 --> 01:34:47,006
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.

684
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,948
Can you read this?

685
01:34:50,024 --> 01:34:53,284
I will start there.
Then you will answer.

686
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:55,390
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.

687
01:34:55,462 --> 01:34:57,250
You understand?

688
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,040
Good.

689
01:35:01,157 --> 01:35:03,676
Let's start.

690
01:35:05,155 --> 01:35:07,009
O God...

691
01:35:07,075 --> 01:35:09,757
by your name save me.

692
01:35:09,826 --> 01:35:11,386
Amen. "

693
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:13,279
Save your servant.

694
01:35:13,345 --> 01:35:17,173
Who places his trust in thee, my God. "

695
01:35:17,249 --> 01:35:20,062
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.

696
01:35:20,128 --> 01:35:21,786
lln the face of the enemy. "

697
01:35:21,855 --> 01:35:24,472
O Lord, hear my prayer.

698
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:27,192
And let my cry come unto thee. "

699
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:30,609
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you. "

700
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:39,734
Begone, evil spirit...

701
01:35:39,802 --> 01:35:44,176
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

702
01:35:44,249 --> 01:35:46,583
and of the Holy Ghost!

703
01:35:49,656 --> 01:35:51,990
By the sign of this holy cross...

704
01:35:53,367 --> 01:35:55,406
by our Lord Jesus Christ...

705
01:35:57,238 --> 01:35:59,626
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!

706
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:05,611
The blood of the martyrs commands you!

707
01:36:09,362 --> 01:36:11,631
In God's name, demon...

708
01:36:12,818 --> 01:36:16,045
I cast you out!

709
01:36:30,989 --> 01:36:33,377
Sarah?

710
01:36:55,175 --> 01:36:57,084
Sarah.

711
01:37:11,266 --> 01:37:13,175
Okay?

712
01:37:31,357 --> 01:37:32,982
Thank you.

713
01:37:49,081 --> 01:37:50,935
Look, um-

714
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,269
Sarah, what is it?

715
01:37:53,336 --> 01:37:57,643
What is it, Sarah?

716
01:37:59,062 --> 01:38:01,929
Lancaster!

717
01:38:02,005 --> 01:38:04,176
- No!
- Help-

718
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:06,000
Sarah.

719
01:38:06,068 --> 01:38:08,172
- No!
- Help-

720
01:38:09,747 --> 01:38:11,656
Sarah.

721
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:16,408
Father?

722
01:39:21,696 --> 01:39:23,638
She's with God now.

723
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,572
She's with God.

724
01:40:57,127 --> 01:40:59,777
I trust your mission was successful.

725
01:41:05,444 --> 01:41:08,858
I couldn't find
what you were looking for.

726
01:41:08,932 --> 01:41:11,419
But you found something.

727
01:41:11,492 --> 01:41:13,792
Didn't you?

728
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:21,887
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.

729
01:41:21,953 --> 01:41:24,057
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.

730
01:41:24,129 --> 01:41:26,332
It's Father Merrin.

731
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,076
