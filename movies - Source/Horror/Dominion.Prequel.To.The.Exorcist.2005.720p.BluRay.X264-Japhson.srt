1
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:05,913
I am <i>ObersturmfÃ¼hrer</i>
Rolf Kessel from the SS.

2
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:08,082
And this is one of my men.

3
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,487
We found him in a ditch with
a kitchen knife in his back.

4
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:13,910
Murdered by one of you.

5
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:17,956
You see the German army retreating,
and it makes you feel hope.

6
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,302
It should not.

7
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:24,668
So who is responsible for this?

8
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,751
You, priest.

9
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,277
- What's your name?
- I'm Father Merrin.

10
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,696
Father Merrin.
These people confess to you?

11
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:41,365
- Yes.
- So point out the one who is responsible.

12
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,617
No one here did this, lieutenant.

13
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,577
They aren't capable of it.

14
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,872
Father, you must help me with this.

15
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:51,542
- Oh, but how?
- Well, I need someone.

16
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:53,544
Do you understand?

17
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:56,922
Surely there is one among them
who beats his wife or his children.

18
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,424
A thief, perhaps.

19
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:01,510
Every town has someone it
can do without. Point him out.

20
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,038
There is no murderer here.

21
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,810
I have good news for you.

22
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:13,772
You are all innocent.
Your priest has told me so.

23
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:17,067
The murderer is no doubt
lurking in the countryside...

24
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,303
waiting to strike at the next
group of German soldiers.

25
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:26,660
I am going to shoot 10 of you...

26
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:30,623
in the hope that we can
demonstrate to this wretch...

27
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:34,823
the responsibility he has incurred.

28
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,213
- A worker's hand.
- Farmer.

29
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,507
- Excellent.
- No!

30
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,580
- We will start with you.
- Stop!

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,713
- You have some objection, Father?
- In God's name, you cannot do this.

32
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:53,387
You choose.

33
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:57,483
- What?
- Well, they're your flock.

34
00:02:57,484 --> 00:03:00,556
You live among them. So you choose.

35
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,684
I will not.

36
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,368
You give me 10 of them,
or I will kill them all.

37
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:10,310
Men, women and children.

38
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,251
- Shoot me.
- You have five seconds.

39
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,213
- I can't.
- You can't what?

40
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:21,048
Pick who will be sacrificed?

41
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,219
History is full of priests
who did little else.

42
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,245
You begin to irritate me, Father.

43
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:41,470
That was for making me wait.

44
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:44,932
I still want 10 more names.

45
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:48,270
What are you doing, Father?
Are you praying?

46
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,984
To God?

47
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:56,152
It's all right, Father.
I'll let you pray.

48
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,128
Because I know something.

49
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,046
You see...

50
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,498
...God isn't here today.

51
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:18,465
You win.

52
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,051
- Shoot them all.
- No! Wait!

53
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:33,981
Joost Harmensz, take him.

54
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:38,334
- Too late, Father. You had your chance.
- No, please.

55
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,861
Take Joost. And Jon.

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,722
That's good.

57
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,179
And who shall be next?

58
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:32,452
That's him.

59
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,473
He's Dutch, you say?

60
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,499
Half. His mother was English.

61
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:41,480
Perhaps he'll be a bit more
inclined to see reason then.

62
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:43,732
I wouldn't be concerned
about reason, major.

63
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,234
He's a scholar.

64
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,528
We studied his works at
the Maryknoll Center.

65
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,030
Oh, yes.

66
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,199
You Maryknolls.

67
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,451
Cropping up everywhere these days.

68
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:58,622
It's a wonder the Jesuits don't get
after you for poaching their game.

69
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:01,375
We all serve in the same
cause, Major Granville.

70
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,377
- He's not one of yours?
- No.

71
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:06,171
A simple parish priest from Holland.

72
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:10,092
When did he develop
this archaeological bent?

73
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,052
Right after the war.

74
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:14,888
- There was an incident.
- Yes.

75
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:17,961
Yes, I heard.

76
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,584
And his standing in the Church now?

77
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:26,223
Undecided.

78
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:32,015
The site is right west of Lake
Rudolf, in the Turkana district.

79
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:37,607
It's Early Christian, which makes for
quite a mystery given its location.

80
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,499
Anyway...

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,003
we won't know more about it
until we get inside the thing.

82
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:50,174
I'd only uncovered a small portion
of the roof before I got...

83
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,176
summoned here.

84
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,595
Did you feel summoned?

85
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:57,056
I am sorry.

86
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:00,164
It's a question of status, you see.

87
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,062
My status?

88
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:06,523
Officially, you're still
listed as a displaced person.

89
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:08,932
I wonder...

90
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:14,937
why didn't you take steps
to clear the matter up?

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,061
I've been busy.

92
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,457
Beautiful, aren't they?

93
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,125
Yes, very.

94
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:28,045
- Are you a lepidopterist?
- A hobby.

95
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,288
From school days.

96
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,159
You have been busy.

97
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:40,081
Six archaeological
digs since the war.

98
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:42,750
This is the longest.

99
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:45,729
If this is an official matter...

100
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,233
- ...then what is he doing here?
- Father Francis?

101
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:52,236
Well, for one thing,
he's quite an admirer of yours.

102
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:55,489
I'm about to begin missionary
work in the Turkana district.

103
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,992
I thought maybe we
could help each other.

104
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:01,444
- You know a lot about the people.
- I'd rather not. Thank you.

105
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:06,399
This is a little awkward.

106
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:09,461
Cardinal Jenkins is
somewhat concerned...

107
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:11,880
about an exploration
of this significance...

108
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,050
conducted by a priest
who is on sabbatical.

109
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,500
- Temporary sabbatical.
- Which comes up for review shortly.

110
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,897
Perhaps I should take this up
with the governor's office.

111
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,674
They'd only send you back to me.

112
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,227
Why don't you have a seat, Merrin.

113
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:44,561
You sure you won't have that drink?

114
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:55,674
The cardinal wants to be sure
that the site's religious aspects...

115
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,926
are given proper consideration.

116
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,595
Part of Father Francis' job...

117
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:02,306
- ...will be to see to that.
- Are you an archaeologist?

118
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,296
You're not the sole person
with an interest here.

119
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:12,232
I've contacted your sponsors
at Oxford. They have no objection.

120
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:16,978
If you agree as well, I can
renew your visa immediately.

121
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:25,150
We all must make our little
deals with the devil, Merrin.

122
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,383
Before there were the mines,
traders came to Derati for the water.

123
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:40,040
They still do...

124
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,956
but it is a hard life.

125
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,853
Why in God's name are they
tormenting that animal?

126
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,439
It is a sacrifice.

127
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,942
The new wife of the chief elder...

128
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,195
Sebituana, will soon give birth.

129
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,948
Sebituana does not yet have an heir.

130
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:06,518
So the people make sacrifices in the
hope that the gods will provide one.

131
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,738
It is a necessary thing.

132
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,153
Cruelty is never necessary, Chuma.

133
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,488
You think we are savages?

134
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:19,091
I think some of you
are good people...

135
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,369
lost in confusion.

136
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:25,639
There's nothing confusing
about that ceremony, Father.

137
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,226
They're weakening the bull so
that someone can approach it.

138
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:33,147
And as for some of the Turkana being
savages, you may want to be careful.

139
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:36,303
Sebituana back there
is Chuma's cousin.

140
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,598
Welcome back.

141
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,240
- Did you bring the supplies?
- Yes. They're in the back of the lorry.

142
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:27,868
Chuma, could you get
Rachel's medical supplies?

143
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,870
Here's a letter for you.

144
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:32,398
How was Nairobi?

145
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,544
- Hello. Are you the doctor?
- Mm-hm.

146
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,964
<i>Habari Kani</i>, Lankester.

147
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,758
It's good to have you back.

148
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,552
Oh, thank you. Your room is prepared.

149
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:49,223
We'll need another... Another room,
Emekwi. This is Father Francis.

150
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:52,810
- You're a friend of Lankester's, Father?
- Oh, hello. I hope so.

151
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,562
I've actually come to
open a missionary school.

152
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:58,565
- This is your hotel?
- The finest establishment in Derati.

153
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,402
Emekwi here, he's a Christian.
Maybe he can help you.

154
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:03,070
In any way I can.

155
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,031
James, Joseph.
These are my sons, Father.

156
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:09,994
They shall be your first pupils,
if you will have them.

157
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,521
That's excellent, Emekwi. Thank you.

158
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,443
Well, then, how far
are we from the site?

159
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,592
Merrin.

160
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,648
How old do you think it is?

161
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,717
Well, the architecture seems
to date to the fifth century.

162
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:27,780
The Byzantine Empire had
adopted Christianity by then...

163
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,936
but they never got this far south.

164
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:34,360
Wanna have a look?

165
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,748
You're...? You're sure it's all right?

166
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:40,292
Well, so long as you
don't touch anything...

167
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:42,321
and keep an open mind.

168
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:52,846
It must have been an enormous effort
to get these materials up here.

169
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,348
Up here?

170
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:58,310
Yes. The stones come from
a quarry near the lake.

171
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:01,051
Which means a distance...

172
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,386
of miles.

173
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:12,562
It's impossible.

174
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,943
The stones look almost new.

175
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,127
With the wind and sun up here...

176
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,069
Well, they should be badly weathered.

177
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:32,623
The church must have been deliberately
buried right after it was built.

178
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:37,433
What, they came here and built
something only to bury it?

179
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:41,103
I don't know. Chuma,
hire some more men.

180
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:44,674
Have them work double shifts.
I want these walls cleared.

181
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:26,941
I can't understand it.
Who'd reported it?

182
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:29,682
Except for this.

183
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,952
I cannot thank you enough
for your generosity, Emekwi.

184
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,663
Oh, please, Father,
the building goes unused.

185
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:44,458
And besides, it is nothing more than
our Lord and Savior would expect.

186
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,670
If you need anything,
anything at all, just ask.

187
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:50,923
I wish others of our
faith felt that way.

188
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:54,635
Oh, but, of course, the town will
get the room back soon, since...

189
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:58,138
- Since we have to build a proper school.
- Oh, please, Father.

190
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,601
Do not think me a doubting Thomas.

191
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:04,963
But...

192
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:10,468
we may not need that
new school right away.

193
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,695
Hello, Papa.

194
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:14,989
Hello, Joseph.

195
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,192
- Hello, Papa.
- Hello, James.

196
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,069
Well...

197
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,689
it's a beginning.

198
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,204
Call for the doctor.

199
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,336
It is the heat.

200
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,550
Pick him up. Let's take him down.
I'll get some water.

201
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:03,570
Don't let him take it all at once.

202
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,532
Our friend is back.

203
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,380
Cheche.

204
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:16,489
Come for food and water again.

205
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:20,220
It must be even worse
for him in this heat.

206
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,556
I'll try to get him into the tent.

207
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,333
Do not let the men see that...

208
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:31,924
Don't be afraid.

209
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,277
- You got here quickly.
- Your man made it sound urgent.

210
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:17,778
Well, is it?

211
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:20,948
Chuma, try to make him comfortable
in the back of my truck.

212
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,475
He needs rest and rehydration.

213
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,490
Heat stroke.

214
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:35,379
- You're working them too hard.
- There's water in the tent if you'd like...

215
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,037
I would. Thank you.

216
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,801
We had another visit
from that boy today.

217
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:43,012
- Cheche?
- Yes.

218
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,805
Any luck?

219
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:47,498
Couldn't even get close.

220
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:55,316
I had to sedate him two weeks ago.

221
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:59,219
Just to treat a beating
he took from a villager.

222
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,324
Why don't they help him?

223
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:06,266
They think he's cursed.

224
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,812
What he needs is sustained treatment.

225
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,212
Yes?

226
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:19,574
Nothing.

227
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,891
Early this year.

228
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:55,964
Two of the cattle have
been killed already.

229
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,606
Thank you, Chuma.

230
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,928
I must keep you safe
for the lady doctor.

231
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,952
Cheche.

232
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,757
Cheche.

233
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,415
The sores were very infected.

234
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:53,999
I've cleaned and dressed them.
There's no permanent damage.

235
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:59,008
The leg and arm are
a different matter.

236
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:02,674
Night, Mara.

237
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,761
There's nothing you can do?

238
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,097
Not for the arm.

239
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,241
The leg...

240
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:18,078
The leg could be theoretical...
Theoret...

241
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,998
- Theoret...
- "Theoretically."

242
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,376
Theoretically, the leg
could be re-broken...

243
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:27,379
and set properly by a
surgeon from Nairobi.

244
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,954
They fly from...

245
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:34,451
Do you think he'd allow it?

246
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,633
It was called Chelmno.

247
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:55,606
That was the Polish name.
The Germans called it Kulmhof.

248
00:23:56,076 --> 00:24:01,817
I was in a processing center
for confiscated items.

249
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:08,170
It's amazing what you're capable of
when your physical survival is at stake.

250
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:11,955
Things you think you
could never endure.

251
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:16,371
Well, nobody knew back then.
Everybody... We heard stories.

252
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:21,711
I wish they could fix that generator.

253
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,049
No one wanted to believe.

254
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:26,981
Of course not.

255
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,984
Who could believe such
things were happening?

256
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,903
No one wanted to believe.

257
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:38,692
It's so much easier to believe
evil is random or an ogre...

258
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:43,607
not that it's a human condition,
something everyone is capable of.

259
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:50,655
I believed God let us decide
between good and evil.

260
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:54,008
I chose good.

261
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,120
Evil happened.

262
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,010
Now you travel.

263
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:11,304
What are you looking for?

264
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,805
Nothing.

265
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:20,896
Sometimes I think the best
view of God is from hell.

266
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,479
This boy here...

267
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,779
You brought something
out of that young man.

268
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:34,840
God is in that boy
that doesn't speak.

269
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:37,718
Until he tried to speak to you.

270
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,708
He's an unfortunate.

271
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,000
One of God's afflicted.

272
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:47,802
I think what you're looking for,
Father Merrin...

273
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:51,714
is here.

274
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:11,231
You have been very brave, Cheche.

275
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:14,238
You're on the mend.

276
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:17,659
There.

277
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,911
Better, eh?

278
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,971
Be...

279
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,472
Better.

280
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,415
Yes. Better.

281
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,816
Merrin was right about you, Cheche.

282
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,177
I thought you'd run away.

283
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:44,975
Cheche...

284
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:47,616
if <i>Appa</i> and I...

285
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:49,660
If we could make your leg better...

286
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,523
Better.

287
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:56,447
...would you want that?

288
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:04,300
We'll have a great deal of news
for <i>Appa</i>, won't we?

289
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:07,242
Merrin, it's magnificent.

290
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,630
Wait till you get inside.

291
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:49,470
The war in heaven.

292
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:52,044
St. Michael.

293
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:57,341
It's so strange.

294
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,439
Churches were built to honor God...

295
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,465
provide a house of
worship, but this...

296
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:07,765
This can't have been a meeting place.

297
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,517
No.

298
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,018
This had to have another purpose.

299
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:17,748
Merrin.

300
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,406
Look at the figures.

301
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,964
Yes.

302
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:27,841
Church architecture is supposed
to reach for the heavens.

303
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:31,377
- But this looks as if...
- As if it were holding something down.

304
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,540
These rocks.

305
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,714
These rocks are like plugs.

306
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,098
What is that?

307
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,469
Like a sarcophagus.

308
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,093
Shh.

309
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,393
What?

310
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,115
- You hear that?
- Yes.

311
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,435
Chuma.

312
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:04,675
Bring me some men and the shear legs.

313
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:18,358
What is it?

314
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:21,318
What are you frightened of?

315
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:28,253
It's a temple of some kind.

316
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,217
What idol could inspire
a place like this?

317
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,483
I'd say it's dedicated to him.

318
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:53,244
Some pagan god of these parts.

319
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:55,382
Chuma?

320
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:58,010
The old people would
sometimes tell stories...

321
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,721
of mountain demons
to scare us, but...

322
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,891
They built the church on top of this.

323
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:07,925
That's why they buried it.
To hold this down.

324
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,683
They used St. Michael to emphasize that
the old gods had no power before the one.

325
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,767
But I never believed.

326
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:24,691
These are bloodstains.

327
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,418
- People were sacrificed here.
- Yeah.

328
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:35,287
It's almost like a scene out
of the Inquisition, isn't it?

329
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:12,276
The hyenas must have
attacked the cattle.

330
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:16,412
But the cattle killed them.

331
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,997
Then ate them.

332
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,244
And now they die of it.

333
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:35,505
He wants you to stop digging.

334
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,261
He thinks the church is evil.

335
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:54,627
His side of the family
either old ways or nothing.

336
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:56,490
No argument.

337
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,605
Look here.

338
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,149
Look how it was done.

339
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:22,363
The workers who did this were not just...
Not just workers. They were artists.

340
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,823
The mosaics came
from across the world.

341
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:28,893
Here. The great battle of the angels.

342
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,748
The turquoise from Egypt,
malachite from Namibia...

343
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:35,668
lapis from Afghanistan.

344
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:38,575
Extraordinary.

345
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:43,626
This is St. Michael. It's his church.
It's dedicated to him.

346
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,637
- But the violence.
- It's the war of heaven.

347
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,374
God's angels fighting
Satan and his legion...

348
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:53,833
cast into the underworld.

349
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:57,564
It's the sort of find
that makes a career.

350
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:01,433
I thought that at first,
but now it seems...

351
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,529
There is he.

352
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,782
Lucifer, source of light.

353
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:10,437
He was called the most
perfect of angels.

354
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:16,375
It will make you, Lankester.

355
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:19,448
But what will it make you?

356
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:22,701
You're trying to see through me.

357
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,634
Are you a head doctor as well?

358
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:28,721
It doesn't take an expert
to see you're suffering.

359
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:31,223
You're in guilt.

360
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,881
We're all in guilt.

361
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:36,879
What I told you the other night...

362
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:39,815
I never told anyone else.

363
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:43,968
I told you because of
something I saw in you.

364
00:37:54,414 --> 00:37:56,738
Merrin.

365
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:02,536
I've got to inform Cardinal Jenkins.

366
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:07,551
I hope you understand that if word
gets out about what's in there...

367
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,888
- ...the danger of violation and looting...
- Which is why we have...

368
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,848
to inform Major Granville as well.

369
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,051
Ask him to send a
detachment of guards.

370
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:19,313
Because the British have
proved so trustworthy.

371
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,231
Suppose you haven't seen
the British Museum?

372
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,442
Everything in it was looted
from sites like that.

373
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:26,016
Merrin, please.

374
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:29,146
You're not the only one involved.

375
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,511
Get on, boys.

376
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:55,057
All right, come on!
Come on! Out, out!

377
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:57,851
Welcome, major. Welcome to Derati.

378
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,854
Fall in on the left,
promptly on the right.

379
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:05,636
Fall in and stand easy!

380
00:39:05,694 --> 00:39:07,695
Good morning.

381
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:09,973
Good morning.

382
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:14,034
- Beloved wherever we go.
- Sir.

383
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,787
Sergeant major, have the
men stand to attention.

384
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,374
I have a feeling those good women
report to the local aristocracy.

385
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,836
And I don't want to display
even a hint of disrespect...

386
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:27,506
- ...now or at any other time. Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

387
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:30,718
Respect for the godforsaken
fuzzies at all times, sir.

388
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,970
That is precisely the
sort of comment...

389
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,471
Squad!

390
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,081
Squad, attention!

391
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:41,089
- Men standing to attention, sir.
- Thank you.

392
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:51,614
Mix it with blood or water.
It's for pain.

393
00:39:57,871 --> 00:40:01,624
Sebituana's wife has gone into labor.
She's in a great deal of pain.

394
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:04,001
- This is Dr. Lamu.
- Oh, doctor.

395
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,545
- Joseph Lamu.
- Rachel Lesno.

396
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:09,548
- So good of you to come.
- Not a problem.

397
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:11,842
I told them to bring her here, but...

398
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,452
So I've sent some morphine.

399
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,438
Do you think they count them?

400
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,856
Hm?

401
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,134
Do you think they count
them every night?

402
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:31,403
- Might do.
- Might do.

403
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,906
You got no more sense
than the fuzzies, corporal.

404
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:35,574
Here.

405
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:38,035
Respect the stripes, boy.

406
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,454
Oh, "respect the stripes" now, is it?

407
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:42,998
I tell you, they got
thousands of the things.

408
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:46,168
Just a handful would make us
rich for the rest of our lives.

409
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:49,194
- Or get us hung.
- Yeah?

410
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:52,666
Well, they can't hang us for
having a look, now, can they?

411
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:33,424
His wounds are healing well.

412
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,342
I hope we do as well with this.

413
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:37,502
He's young.

414
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:39,957
His bones are strong.

415
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:10,169
Jesus Christ!

416
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,212
Hundreds of them.

417
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:15,285
Every kind of precious stone.

418
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:19,544
Just a handful is all I need.

419
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,265
All we need, private.

420
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,976
We pool the take. Yeah?

421
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,089
Yeah.

422
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:01,764
Cover them.

423
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:08,479
- Sorry, sir?
- They're British soldiers.

424
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:11,397
I won't have them left like that.

425
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:15,992
Of course, sir.

426
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:17,921
Richardson. Avery.

427
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:21,327
Get some blankets and
cover those soldiers.

428
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,617
You will keep me
informed about Cheche?

429
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:49,026
Yes, of course.

430
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:53,655
Merrin.

431
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:56,403
Merrin.

432
00:44:56,711 --> 00:45:00,745
- What's going on here?
- What do you mean?

433
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:03,050
What's going on here?

434
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:05,743
This whole valley.

435
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:15,020
Why don't you stay a couple of days.

436
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:19,191
You hardly had any rest. I'll show
you the dig, the church we found.

437
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:21,101
Who's in charge here?

438
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:24,220
Military. Major Granville.

439
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:28,075
- Not you?
- No.

440
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:30,069
No, not me.

441
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:43,697
You take care of yourself,
Lankester Merrin.

442
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:47,052
Yes.

443
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:49,212
Thank you.

444
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:35,168
Who, Merrin?

445
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:37,478
Why?

446
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:40,105
Well, these were on the ground.

447
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:43,427
They'd been pried out of the mosaics.

448
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,223
Maybe they were trying
to stop a robbery.

449
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:52,775
- Got killed by the thieves.
- Of course.

450
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:56,664
- Bloody savages.
- No.

451
00:46:56,665 --> 00:46:59,500
There's no reason to suspect
the Turkana, major.

452
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:03,320
- What?
- The style of the killings...

453
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:07,508
- ...the positioning of the bodies.
- He's right.

454
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:10,177
It's Christian imagery, not pagan.

455
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:12,054
John the Baptist, head on a platter.

456
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:15,140
- Peter the Apostle crucified...
- A Christian is responsible?

457
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:17,351
You're both insane.

458
00:47:17,352 --> 00:47:19,186
Merrin.

459
00:47:19,187 --> 00:47:22,523
Chuma, get that man out of here.

460
00:47:22,524 --> 00:47:24,635
Jomo saw what happened, major.

461
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,722
Did he?

462
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:37,246
And what was it this
Jomo saw precisely?

463
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:40,457
Jomo watches from the hills
that lie above this place, and...

464
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,863
- And?
- He says...

465
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:47,881
He says he saw the
two soldiers argue.

466
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:51,051
One killed the other and
then stabbed himself.

467
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:52,553
What the devil are you saying?

468
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:57,683
They were stealing jewels. Then some
sort of madness overtook them...

469
00:47:57,684 --> 00:48:00,673
Be quiet! I won't hear another word!

470
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:11,387
That is the most...

471
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,117
Tell this man that if he repeats
such absurdities, I'll arrest him.

472
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:18,225
- Yes...
- And you as well, do you understand?

473
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:26,033
The idea's absurd.

474
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:30,090
I'm supposed to accept
this was some sort of...

475
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:33,969
acrobatic ritual murder and suicide?

476
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,723
It's not only absurd, it's an insult.
Those men were with me for years.

477
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:41,958
- Major, please, please try...
- I don't need opinions, Merrin.

478
00:48:43,146 --> 00:48:46,440
I've been lenient with
you people, Chuma...

479
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:48,651
but warn the elders...

480
00:48:48,652 --> 00:48:51,737
that unless they hand over
the men that did this...

481
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:56,482
life in these parts will become
distinctly less pleasant.

482
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:05,482
I will get to the bottom of this.

483
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,297
Major, please.

484
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:14,367
Do not choose the wrong
side in this, Merrin.

485
00:49:17,764 --> 00:49:20,307
Remember what you owe...

486
00:49:20,308 --> 00:49:22,586
to whom.

487
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:26,063
The wrong side, major?

488
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:28,306
This is not war.

489
00:49:56,386 --> 00:49:58,554
Hello, Rachel.

490
00:49:58,555 --> 00:50:02,505
- Is he all right?
- Take a look.

491
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:07,716
He started to run a fever
early this morning.

492
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,595
And there was a warmth
radiating from the cast.

493
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:15,561
I took it off,
expecting to find gangrene.

494
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:19,269
You can imagine my shock.

495
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:24,696
- So it's better.
- It's on its way to being healed.

496
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:29,627
This should have taken weeks...

497
00:50:29,628 --> 00:50:32,154
not days.

498
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,032
And the fever's dropping.

499
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:42,878
I only hope that...

500
00:50:44,392 --> 00:50:46,467
Hope what?

501
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:52,524
There are cases of false recovery...

502
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:56,403
of a body's system
appearing to improve...

503
00:50:56,404 --> 00:51:00,722
but it's actually evidence
of a deeper problem.

504
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:05,602
Any reason to believe
that's the case?

505
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,168
No.

506
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,587
No, there isn't.

507
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:17,925
So many terrible things have
happened in the last few days...

508
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:21,580
you just can't see a good
thing for what it is.

509
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,088
I'm just glad there is
something to be grateful for.

510
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:34,092
This village has been on
the verge of an explosion.

511
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:37,444
I don't know who's more
likely to ignite it...

512
00:51:37,445 --> 00:51:40,042
Granville or the Turkana.

513
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:44,518
Mara quit.

514
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:46,120
Oh?

515
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:48,706
The elders told her not to work here.

516
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:51,083
Because of the baby?

517
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:53,210
That's part of it.

518
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:41,701
What's happening?

519
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:51,852
I suppose you've all
had a good laugh...

520
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:55,673
thinking what fools you've
made of the British Empire.

521
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:59,389
But you've fooled no one.

522
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:02,071
I told you I'd get to
the bottom of this.

523
00:53:02,072 --> 00:53:04,930
Major, please stop this.
You don't understand.

524
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:08,065
Sergeant major!

525
00:53:08,703 --> 00:53:11,872
- Sir.
- I want these people kept at a distance.

526
00:53:11,873 --> 00:53:14,541
If they attempt to interfere,
they're to be arrested.

527
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,784
And if they resist, shoot them.

528
00:53:17,045 --> 00:53:18,954
- Sir?
- Do it!

529
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:21,326
Yes, sir!

530
00:53:21,383 --> 00:53:23,217
Not him.

531
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:25,219
I'll need an interpreter.

532
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,763
And interpret carefully, Chuma.

533
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:32,184
Tell them I have waited long enough
to find out who killed my men.

534
00:53:32,185 --> 00:53:35,354
This is a small town. One of them
must know who is responsible.

535
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:39,191
I'll give them one more chance for that
person to reveal the murderer's name.

536
00:53:39,192 --> 00:53:43,225
- Major!
- Mind your own, priest.

537
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:49,910
Sebituana says that everybody knows
that your men killed each other.

538
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:53,814
- They were stealing and they went mad...
- Shut your mouth!

539
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,209
You think you're the
law here, do you?

540
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,879
You go on hiding your murderers
because you don't fear me yet.

541
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,757
- Well, my friend, let me assure you...
- Major, stop this!

542
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:09,286
If a reason for fear is what
you need, then I can oblige!

543
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:20,973
Hold that man!

544
00:54:33,955 --> 00:54:35,873
- Corporal Williams.
- Sergeant major.

545
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:39,960
Have the men stand down and fall in by
the lorry. Allow the natives to tidy up.

546
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:41,170
Move it!

547
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:43,255
Private Evans!
Places on the guard wall!

548
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:46,198
Places on the guard wall!

549
00:54:47,802 --> 00:54:51,456
Sir. To the car, sir.

550
00:55:02,108 --> 00:55:06,094
Left, right, left,
right, left, right...

551
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:27,365
I'm sorry I startled you.

552
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,882
Did you manage to sleep
through the night?

553
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:39,093
Yes.

554
00:55:42,107 --> 00:55:45,428
I wish I could say
the same for Rachel.

555
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:49,396
She woke several times
after you left.

556
00:55:58,164 --> 00:56:01,699
Seemed afraid something
might happen to the boy.

557
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:06,743
She finally calmed down when
I said I'd watch over him.

558
00:56:07,507 --> 00:56:09,701
Which seemed the least I could do.

559
00:56:10,218 --> 00:56:13,373
- Don't.
- Don't what?

560
00:56:13,763 --> 00:56:18,342
Don't acknowledge the fact that I was
the one that asked Granville to come?

561
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:21,478
You didn't ask him to shoot the girl.

562
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:25,065
There's only one person
responsible for what happened.

563
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:27,260
How is he?

564
00:56:30,196 --> 00:56:32,805
He seems fine.

565
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:34,533
Um...

566
00:56:34,534 --> 00:56:36,410
I'll take over.

567
00:56:36,411 --> 00:56:39,068
You've got things to do.

568
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:50,281
Not much, I'm afraid.

569
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:53,677
I doubt there'll be much of a class.

570
00:56:53,678 --> 00:56:58,043
Well, the children seem to
genuinely like school and you.

571
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:01,505
I'm sure some of them will turn up.

572
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,212
Are you all right, Merrin?

573
00:57:05,815 --> 00:57:08,057
Is it cold in here?

574
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:26,251
Prayer, Merrin.

575
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:29,129
It's all we have at times like these.

576
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,040
Yeah.

577
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:36,374
It's like having nothing, isn't it?

578
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:46,756
Lankester.

579
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,428
May I speak to you
at a personal level?

580
00:57:56,157 --> 00:57:58,518
Of course.

581
00:57:58,702 --> 00:58:00,777
Christian to Christian?

582
00:58:06,418 --> 00:58:10,504
"Evil may gain sway over
our lives for a time...

583
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:12,548
but the ultimate power of faith...

584
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:15,551
lies in its ability
to strengthen men.

585
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:19,013
Not to conquer evil,
but to survive it."

586
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:21,207
You wrote that. I read it.

587
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:24,977
A young man's theories.

588
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:27,521
But you proved it.

589
00:58:27,522 --> 00:58:30,724
I survived, if that's what you mean.

590
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,943
But did I live?

591
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:35,019
Not really.

592
00:58:35,113 --> 00:58:38,434
He didn't force you
to wander from him.

593
00:58:38,909 --> 00:58:41,118
He allowed you to...

594
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,396
out of love.

595
00:58:43,997 --> 00:58:47,041
And if you find now that you're
lost, you must have faith...

596
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:50,127
that his love will guide you back.

597
00:58:50,128 --> 00:58:52,986
All you have to do is ask.

598
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:00,410
You mean well,
but you can't see my soul.

599
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:06,425
I'm God's servant. He can.

600
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:32,336
Well...

601
00:59:32,337 --> 00:59:36,048
I didn't think I would see
so many of you today.

602
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:39,802
When you go home, you must
remember to thank your families.

603
00:59:39,803 --> 00:59:41,512
Their families not know, Father.

604
00:59:41,513 --> 00:59:43,847
Their parents tell them
they must not come.

605
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:46,956
They say that Jesus
Christ killed Falashadey.

606
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:51,586
Falashadey, that was her name?

607
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:55,484
They come to school because
they think if they do not come...

608
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:59,055
maybe Jesus Christ
might kill them too.

609
01:00:01,783 --> 01:00:04,559
Joseph, James, come here.

610
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,459
Jesus Christ did not
kill that young woman.

611
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,795
The British major did.

612
01:00:14,796 --> 01:00:17,536
And it was very, very wrong.

613
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:23,874
Jomo, no. You must not.

614
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:56,170
Anderson, get some
medical help in here.

615
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:57,671
Joseph!

616
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:05,998
My son.

617
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:15,508
What did he say?

618
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:20,569
- What did he say?
- He said...

619
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:25,683
that he had to kill them to stop
the Christian evil from spreading.

620
01:01:27,702 --> 01:01:30,063
This, Father?

621
01:01:30,538 --> 01:01:35,960
Is this how the Almighty treats those
who have kept faith with him?

622
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:37,823
Yes.

623
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:51,336
No.

624
01:02:18,545 --> 01:02:20,879
Father. Father Francis.

625
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,173
What is it? What's happened?

626
01:02:23,174 --> 01:02:26,413
I think you'd better
see for yourself.

627
01:02:31,725 --> 01:02:34,132
My God.

628
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:37,563
- How did you...?
- I didn't.

629
01:02:37,564 --> 01:02:39,925
Not intentionally.

630
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:44,517
This may be more your
province than mine, Father.

631
01:02:45,238 --> 01:02:47,100
It's a miracle.

632
01:02:53,538 --> 01:02:56,147
I have to get Merrin.

633
01:02:57,584 --> 01:03:00,075
Will you be all right?

634
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:02,074
Yes.

635
01:03:31,826 --> 01:03:33,702
Maybe you...

636
01:03:33,703 --> 01:03:37,819
are the one proof of
God in this terrible place.

637
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:49,374
Because you're certainly
the only innocent creature.

638
01:04:17,706 --> 01:04:20,398
You know my guilt?

639
01:04:33,722 --> 01:04:35,963
The spirit of our Savior.

640
01:04:36,683 --> 01:04:38,592
It's in you.

641
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:43,138
And it will point the way
out of this darkness.

642
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:47,886
O Lord...

643
01:04:48,695 --> 01:04:51,019
Lord, I pray thee...

644
01:04:51,573 --> 01:04:54,349
hear my voice as I have heard thine.

645
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:59,603
Let this blessed child continue
to be thy messenger...

646
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:05,157
that we may know thy will...

647
01:05:07,422 --> 01:05:09,913
and thy wisdom.

648
01:05:15,472 --> 01:05:20,917
In the name of the Father,
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

649
01:05:37,911 --> 01:05:40,188
God bless this child.

650
01:05:46,086 --> 01:05:50,080
Don't ever touch me
with that again, priest!

651
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:30,450
My God.

652
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:52,551
The boy must be baptized.

653
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:59,033
You're still recovering from
that blow to the head, Father.

654
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:02,119
That's an awfully weak attempt
to explain this away.

655
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,829
Yes, it is.

656
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,706
Then you accept it?

657
01:07:05,707 --> 01:07:08,792
An evil spirit at work in this town?
I didn't say that.

658
01:07:08,793 --> 01:07:10,419
Things you think you heard...

659
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:13,631
- ...things you think you saw...
- You're saying I'm hallucinating.

660
01:07:13,632 --> 01:07:16,467
What about the burn on his forehead?
Did I imagine that?

661
01:07:16,468 --> 01:07:18,844
It's an injury in the
rough shape of a cross.

662
01:07:18,845 --> 01:07:20,512
The rough shape.

663
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:23,682
- You've had a nervous breakdown...
- Breakdown?!

664
01:07:23,683 --> 01:07:26,560
Oh, I think it's you who have
been through too much, Merrin.

665
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:29,855
Will you please try to
control yourselves?

666
01:07:29,856 --> 01:07:32,107
The boy needs rest.

667
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:34,302
And what about his perfect English?

668
01:07:35,028 --> 01:07:38,563
Oh, of course, I must
be imagining that too.

669
01:07:40,951 --> 01:07:42,979
All right.

670
01:07:43,411 --> 01:07:46,205
Let's assume what you say is true.

671
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:48,582
What harm could there
be in his being baptized?

672
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:52,252
A great deal. Those people
hate and fear Cheche.

673
01:07:52,254 --> 01:07:54,463
You want to expose him
to further danger...

674
01:07:54,464 --> 01:07:57,257
by having him join a religion
they equate with evil?

675
01:07:57,259 --> 01:08:00,094
Say it. Say it, Merrin. Or can't you?

676
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:02,805
- The work of Satan.
- It's the work of man!

677
01:08:02,806 --> 01:08:05,599
- Why can't you accept that?
- Because my only concern...

678
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,005
is the eternal soul
of that young man.

679
01:08:11,147 --> 01:08:13,816
Are you so arrogant, Merrin...

680
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:17,695
that you would involve the rest of
the world in your crisis of faith?

681
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:21,115
That you would deny to someone
what you once cherished...

682
01:08:21,116 --> 01:08:24,271
simply because you now doubt it?

683
01:08:27,289 --> 01:08:31,404
- What makes you think he wants it?
- You could try asking him.

684
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,700
He's awake now.

685
01:08:56,234 --> 01:08:58,346
See.

686
01:09:00,572 --> 01:09:03,824
Doctor, please, would you ask
him if he would like to become...

687
01:09:03,825 --> 01:09:06,493
a Christian like <i>Appa</i> and myself?

688
01:09:06,494 --> 01:09:08,203
Unless you object.

689
01:09:08,204 --> 01:09:10,164
Cheche.

690
01:09:23,345 --> 01:09:26,513
- He would like it.
- Good.

691
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:30,168
- Good, Cheche. Good.
- He wants to do it in the church.

692
01:09:31,353 --> 01:09:34,378
He seems to think
that's where you live.

693
01:09:35,357 --> 01:09:38,442
He wants to be as much
like you as he can.

694
01:09:38,443 --> 01:09:42,179
Unless you want to explain
your misgivings to him.

695
01:09:44,074 --> 01:09:47,727
There's a beautiful baptismal
font in the church.

696
01:09:48,203 --> 01:09:50,729
We could use that.

697
01:10:30,579 --> 01:10:32,856
Major Granville.

698
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:46,041
Major Granville, sir.

699
01:10:53,018 --> 01:10:55,342
Sir, are you...?

700
01:10:56,354 --> 01:10:58,355
Are you all right, sir?

701
01:10:58,356 --> 01:11:01,214
All right.

702
01:11:07,073 --> 01:11:10,312
I shall be down in a moment.

703
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:13,862
Sir.

704
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:18,648
Oh, and sergeant major.

705
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:20,294
Sir?

706
01:11:20,295 --> 01:11:23,699
I shall need you to give
Mr. Merrin a message.

707
01:11:24,507 --> 01:11:26,749
Tell him...

708
01:11:28,428 --> 01:11:32,829
Tell him I know now how it's
been for him all these years.

709
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:36,877
But tell him there's no way out.

710
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:41,346
Other than...

711
01:11:43,026 --> 01:11:44,935
Sir!

712
01:11:59,417 --> 01:12:02,336
I just need one or two more
things from the hotel, doctor.

713
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:05,444
- I'll have him ready, Father.
- Thank you.

714
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,978
Don't bother, doctor.

715
01:12:36,037 --> 01:12:39,738
He asked me to give you a message
before he'd shot himself.

716
01:12:45,338 --> 01:12:47,715
Said he understood what
you were going through.

717
01:12:47,716 --> 01:12:50,871
And that this was the only way out.
Any idea what he meant?

718
01:12:52,846 --> 01:12:54,708
No.

719
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,474
He never meant to kill that girl.

720
01:12:57,475 --> 01:13:00,927
That went against every
part of the major's nature.

721
01:13:01,062 --> 01:13:02,925
Something got into him.

722
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:07,684
Mr. Merrin, sir...

723
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:12,072
some of the boys, they...

724
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:16,076
They're not too happy.
The major was well liked.

725
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:19,663
So if you have any pull
with the spearchuckers...

726
01:13:19,664 --> 01:13:22,736
I'd advise them to step quietly.

727
01:13:23,752 --> 01:13:28,116
I'll do what I can.
Thank you, sergeant major.

728
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,332
Carry on.

729
01:15:36,843 --> 01:15:39,094
What do you make of that,
sergeant major?

730
01:15:39,095 --> 01:15:40,721
I don't know.

731
01:15:40,722 --> 01:15:42,833
But get on the radio to town.

732
01:15:43,558 --> 01:15:47,212
I want all available men
up here on the double.

733
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:49,929
Come on.

734
01:15:52,901 --> 01:15:55,778
Okay. We're gonna go down.

735
01:15:55,779 --> 01:15:57,738
Just like that.

736
01:15:57,739 --> 01:16:00,147
That's perfect.

737
01:16:28,603 --> 01:16:30,465
Open the gate!

738
01:16:52,252 --> 01:16:55,870
- What is it?
- It's music for battle.

739
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:26,854
Father.

740
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:44,595
Cheche.

741
01:17:44,596 --> 01:17:46,847
- His fever's come back.
- Quickly, doctor.

742
01:17:46,848 --> 01:17:49,350
- But...
- Please, this is no miracle.

743
01:17:49,351 --> 01:17:51,143
Help me.

744
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:54,086
Hold the child's head over the font.

745
01:18:34,563 --> 01:18:37,670
Ah!

746
01:18:45,574 --> 01:18:50,286
I warned you about that, priest!

747
01:18:58,253 --> 01:19:00,614
It is Sebituana.

748
01:19:01,298 --> 01:19:04,536
He wants to talk to the
British commander.

749
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,760
Some sort of trick, then?

750
01:19:06,761 --> 01:19:09,388
- I'll go.
- No.

751
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:11,713
We'll go.

752
01:19:11,725 --> 01:19:14,727
Corporal Williams,
Private Standish, join us.

753
01:19:14,728 --> 01:19:17,384
Arms at the ready.

754
01:19:25,697 --> 01:19:28,324
Sebituana does not wish to fight.

755
01:19:28,325 --> 01:19:31,349
Well, they ain't dressed for
ballroom dancing, Chuma.

756
01:19:32,454 --> 01:19:34,496
What does he want, then?

757
01:19:38,126 --> 01:19:40,949
For the church to be
buried again. That, and...

758
01:19:44,341 --> 01:19:49,003
He wants Father Francis. He says only he
brought the Christian evil and soldiers.

759
01:19:53,183 --> 01:19:56,477
He must die. So must the boy.

760
01:19:56,478 --> 01:20:00,064
Only Cheche has drawn strength
from all the evil that has happened.

761
01:20:02,984 --> 01:20:05,152
The British, if they leave now...

762
01:20:05,153 --> 01:20:08,530
- ...will be spared.
- Right.

763
01:20:08,531 --> 01:20:13,577
You can tell Sebituana and his friends
to disperse quietly and go home...

764
01:20:13,578 --> 01:20:17,196
and we'll be the ones
doing the sparing.

765
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:26,840
If it's a fight they want...

766
01:20:26,841 --> 01:20:29,913
it's a fight they're gonna get.

767
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:43,065
You had no idea...

768
01:20:43,066 --> 01:20:46,553
what you were toying with, did you?

769
01:20:54,202 --> 01:20:56,942
The book of rituals...

770
01:20:57,205 --> 01:21:00,407
I have a copy.
I've got to get to town.

771
01:21:01,543 --> 01:21:05,030
This boy is possessed.

772
01:21:29,112 --> 01:21:33,430
- Where's Rachel and Cheche?
- Still inside.

773
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:35,982
The boy is...

774
01:21:35,994 --> 01:21:38,935
I must get the book of rituals.

775
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:44,993
Satan is real.

776
01:22:08,735 --> 01:22:13,563
I am perfection.

777
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:40,716
- Francis!
- No.

778
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:46,981
It's too dangerous.

779
01:22:46,982 --> 01:22:49,984
I'm gonna maintain the
perimeter until daybreak.

780
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:52,677
We'll look for the Father then.

781
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:55,781
We have to clear those doors.
We have to get them out.

782
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:59,483
- I've got my men to think of right now.
- They're trapped in there!

783
01:23:03,123 --> 01:23:08,669
We'll wait till the sun to come up.
Then we'll start moving the rubble.

784
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,994
All right, sir?

785
01:23:25,353 --> 01:23:28,856
- Well, are they gone or not?
- There is no way to know.

786
01:23:28,857 --> 01:23:32,109
Right, then. Corporal Williams,
send a detail of men...

787
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:36,155
to help Mr. Merrin clear that rubble.
Then I want you and another detail...

788
01:23:36,156 --> 01:23:39,491
to go out there and see if
our friends are gone or not.

789
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:42,202
And have a look for Father Francis.

790
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:45,406
The rest of the squad's
to stay on the perimeter.

791
01:24:38,635 --> 01:24:43,747
- How could you leave him like that?
- We didn't know what to do, sir.

792
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:52,556
Private Standish, cut him down.

793
01:24:54,776 --> 01:24:56,986
- Father Merrin.
- He's alive.

794
01:24:56,987 --> 01:24:59,321
- Get a stretcher.
- Do it!

795
01:24:59,322 --> 01:25:01,991
Chuma, get the nurse,
tell her to come to the clinic.

796
01:25:01,992 --> 01:25:04,660
Tell her she must come,
tell her it's Father Francis.

797
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:08,112
It's him. It's him.

798
01:25:13,253 --> 01:25:14,878
It's him.

799
01:25:14,879 --> 01:25:17,339
You'll be fine. Give me a hand!

800
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,511
It's him.

801
01:25:22,512 --> 01:25:25,003
It's him.

802
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:36,150
Thank you for coming, Mara.

803
01:25:36,151 --> 01:25:39,436
I did it for Father Francis.

804
01:25:40,447 --> 01:25:43,353
Where is Miss Rachel?

805
01:25:43,408 --> 01:25:45,685
At the dig.

806
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:57,577
- Yes?
- Unction, Father.

807
01:25:58,965 --> 01:26:02,009
I need the last rites.

808
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,552
No.

809
01:26:03,553 --> 01:26:06,305
- You'll be all right.
- My immortal...

810
01:26:06,306 --> 01:26:08,515
My immortal soul...

811
01:26:08,516 --> 01:26:12,252
is in danger. Please.

812
01:26:12,312 --> 01:26:15,052
Please, Merrin.

813
01:26:16,107 --> 01:26:18,150
Please get the kit.

814
01:26:18,151 --> 01:26:20,724
Please.

815
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:38,367
You'll need the book
of Roman rituals.

816
01:26:38,463 --> 01:26:40,547
It's in my room.

817
01:26:40,548 --> 01:26:44,866
- I haven't forgotten the last rites.
- Not for that.

818
01:26:46,596 --> 01:26:49,056
You'll need it for the
rite of exorcism.

819
01:26:49,057 --> 01:26:51,392
You can't make that decision.

820
01:26:51,393 --> 01:26:55,757
- The archbishop needs to be contacted.
- There's no time.

821
01:26:57,941 --> 01:27:00,847
He's in the boy.

822
01:27:03,113 --> 01:27:07,478
Oh, God help us. He's in the boy.

823
01:27:10,412 --> 01:27:12,746
- Any progress?
- No.

824
01:27:12,747 --> 01:27:15,582
- How's Father Francis?
- He's resting.

825
01:27:15,584 --> 01:27:17,084
Savages.

826
01:27:17,085 --> 01:27:21,486
If they think they can get away with
this, they don't understand the British.

827
01:27:26,094 --> 01:27:28,087
Look out!

828
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,970
Chuma, are you all right?

829
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:48,642
Don't go in!

830
01:27:51,953 --> 01:27:56,152
Look after Chuma. Don't follow me.

831
01:28:00,962 --> 01:28:03,156
Rachel?

832
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:19,470
Rachel?

833
01:28:47,842 --> 01:28:50,535
Is that you, Rachel?

834
01:29:17,414 --> 01:29:19,656
Rachel.

835
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:22,784
Rachel.

836
01:29:22,794 --> 01:29:25,237
Rachel, wake up.

837
01:29:25,463 --> 01:29:27,881
Wake up, you're dreaming.

838
01:29:27,882 --> 01:29:29,842
Rachel.

839
01:29:29,843 --> 01:29:32,167
Wake up.

840
01:29:32,387 --> 01:29:35,412
- Where's Cheche?
- No.

841
01:29:36,558 --> 01:29:39,084
I was there.

842
01:29:39,603 --> 01:29:42,509
It was so real.

843
01:29:42,731 --> 01:29:45,566
- Chelmno.
- No, you were dreaming.

844
01:29:45,567 --> 01:29:48,402
- You were dreaming. You are here.
- I wanted to be...

845
01:29:48,403 --> 01:29:52,406
I want to be back. He took me there.

846
01:29:52,407 --> 01:29:55,242
- You were dreaming, that's all.
- But I want to go back.

847
01:29:55,243 --> 01:29:57,911
You have to let me. It was
different, I was helping.

848
01:29:57,913 --> 01:30:00,623
- You can go!
- Rachel!

849
01:30:00,624 --> 01:30:02,817
I'm sorry.

850
01:30:04,044 --> 01:30:06,487
I'm sorry, Rachel.

851
01:30:08,214 --> 01:30:11,619
- I'm sorry.
- We can help each other.

852
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:17,500
Only we can help each other.

853
01:30:18,934 --> 01:30:20,643
Rachel.

854
01:30:20,644 --> 01:30:23,965
We're the same, you and I.

855
01:30:30,028 --> 01:30:34,097
You're a passionate man, Merrin.

856
01:30:35,825 --> 01:30:38,815
Full of hunger.

857
01:30:50,632 --> 01:30:52,424
Get out.

858
01:30:52,425 --> 01:30:54,500
Now.

859
01:31:04,271 --> 01:31:06,714
You call me cruel.

860
01:31:06,898 --> 01:31:10,552
Rachel was rewriting her past.

861
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:14,391
Then you destroyed it.

862
01:31:14,990 --> 01:31:16,899
You're the great deceiver.

863
01:31:24,165 --> 01:31:27,784
Did Father Francis mention me?

864
01:31:28,461 --> 01:31:30,573
He called you Satan.

865
01:31:32,257 --> 01:31:35,968
Did I not roll away
the stones for you?

866
01:31:35,969 --> 01:31:38,745
Why torment Rachel?

867
01:31:38,847 --> 01:31:41,587
She's not the one who sinned.

868
01:31:42,434 --> 01:31:45,921
She never helped another prisoner.

869
01:31:47,105 --> 01:31:50,474
She traded her body for food.

870
01:31:52,235 --> 01:31:54,892
She betrayed her friends.

871
01:31:55,113 --> 01:31:59,617
- Liar!
- You hate God, Merrin.

872
01:31:59,618 --> 01:32:04,232
And why not? God gives you guilt.

873
01:32:04,873 --> 01:32:07,399
The guilt is unbearable.

874
01:32:09,961 --> 01:32:12,463
I do not curse God.

875
01:32:12,464 --> 01:32:14,326
But...

876
01:32:17,344 --> 01:32:20,499
there is one thing you can do.

877
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:25,425
You can cease to care.

878
01:32:27,312 --> 01:32:29,554
That is your offer?

879
01:32:29,731 --> 01:32:34,310
I offer freedom.

880
01:32:35,946 --> 01:32:38,030
Run.

881
01:32:38,031 --> 01:32:42,265
Run, Merrin, run.

882
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:47,572
You tried me, Lord.

883
01:32:47,999 --> 01:32:50,407
I failed.

884
01:32:51,378 --> 01:32:53,904
Forgive my disbelief.

885
01:32:55,257 --> 01:32:57,997
Help my disbelief.

886
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:05,380
Take my disbelief into your
bosom and give me strength.

887
01:33:07,686 --> 01:33:11,304
Absolve my sins and purify me.

888
01:33:13,066 --> 01:33:16,138
Purify me for this task.

889
01:34:19,424 --> 01:34:24,287
Everything was good in Derati
until the missionary came.

890
01:34:25,847 --> 01:34:28,557
Jomo may have held the spear...

891
01:34:28,558 --> 01:34:32,212
but Father Francis killed my son.

892
01:35:15,814 --> 01:35:19,218
Easy, boys.

893
01:35:19,526 --> 01:35:21,720
Let Mr. Merrin through.

894
01:35:28,326 --> 01:35:29,827
Or is it Father Merrin?

895
01:35:29,828 --> 01:35:32,454
Christ, have mercy on us.

896
01:35:32,455 --> 01:35:34,039
Lord, have mercy on us.

897
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,376
Better not come out, priest,
if you know what's good for you.

898
01:35:37,377 --> 01:35:38,669
Christ, have mercy on us.

899
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,421
Blood will flow tonight.

900
01:35:40,422 --> 01:35:42,715
Lord, have mercy on us.

901
01:37:13,515 --> 01:37:17,797
You think your uniform will save you?

902
01:37:26,695 --> 01:37:29,636
Lord, have mercy on us.

903
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:32,812
Christ, hear us.

904
01:37:33,243 --> 01:37:38,523
God... the Father of
heaven, have mercy on us.

905
01:37:38,748 --> 01:37:41,542
- God, the Son...
- It's not working.

906
01:37:41,543 --> 01:37:45,662
Redeemer of the world...
have mercy on us.

907
01:37:45,755 --> 01:37:48,716
Oh, God, the Holy Ghost,
have mercy on us.

908
01:37:48,717 --> 01:37:52,428
Holy Trinity, one God,
have mercy on us.

909
01:37:52,429 --> 01:37:54,836
You're a weak vessel.

910
01:38:12,574 --> 01:38:15,563
A weak vessel leaks.

911
01:38:16,953 --> 01:38:19,622
It is not only me who fights you.

912
01:38:19,623 --> 01:38:22,124
I'm not alone.

913
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,793
All ye holy angels...

914
01:38:24,794 --> 01:38:27,004
and archangels...

915
01:38:27,005 --> 01:38:29,448
pray for us.

916
01:38:30,884 --> 01:38:36,414
All ye holy orders of blessed
spirits pray for us.

917
01:38:37,641 --> 01:38:40,059
St. John the Baptist pray for us.

918
01:38:42,938 --> 01:38:45,879
<i>St. Paul, pray for us.</i>

919
01:38:46,775 --> 01:38:50,110
<i>St. James, pray for us.</i>

920
01:38:50,111 --> 01:38:52,887
<i>St. John, pray for us.</i>

921
01:38:53,907 --> 01:38:56,932
<i>St. Thomas, pray for us.</i>

922
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:01,104
<i>St. Matthew, pray for us.</i>

923
01:39:01,957 --> 01:39:05,657
<i>All ye holy martyrs, pray for us.</i>

924
01:39:05,794 --> 01:39:08,837
<i>St. Gregory, pray for us.</i>

925
01:39:08,838 --> 01:39:12,207
<i>St. Ambrose, pray for us.</i>

926
01:39:12,217 --> 01:39:15,502
<i>St. Augustine, pray for us.</i>

927
01:39:16,263 --> 01:39:19,890
<i>All ye men and women,
saints of God...</i>

928
01:39:19,891 --> 01:39:22,881
<i>make intercession for us.</i>

929
01:39:23,979 --> 01:39:28,296
<i>From thy wrath, O Lord, deliver us.</i>

930
01:39:28,984 --> 01:39:32,152
From anger, hatred...

931
01:39:32,153 --> 01:39:34,989
and ill will, O Lord, deliver us.

932
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:39,521
- From lightning and tempest...
- Don't you want to go back?

933
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,528
Yes.

934
01:39:47,544 --> 01:39:49,406
Go back.

935
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:54,383
From pestilence, famine and war...

936
01:39:54,384 --> 01:39:56,343
O Lord, deliver us.

937
01:39:56,344 --> 01:39:58,705
Go back.

938
01:40:00,765 --> 01:40:05,297
You can undo the events of that day.

939
01:40:05,854 --> 01:40:09,341
You can end your guilt.

940
01:40:20,869 --> 01:40:23,526
Go back.

941
01:40:27,417 --> 01:40:29,710
From everlasting death...

942
01:40:29,711 --> 01:40:34,048
- ...through his ho...
- Don't you want to go back?

943
01:40:34,049 --> 01:40:36,133
Through his...

944
01:40:36,134 --> 01:40:40,250
Through his... Through his ho...

945
01:41:00,784 --> 01:41:02,859
You, priest.

946
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,357
What's your name?

947
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,793
I'm Father Merrin.

948
01:41:10,794 --> 01:41:13,320
And these people confess to you?

949
01:41:13,755 --> 01:41:15,923
So point out the one
who's responsible.

950
01:41:15,924 --> 01:41:19,927
No one here did this, lieutenant.
They aren't capable of it.

951
01:41:19,928 --> 01:41:24,390
- Did you hear what I said?
- That God is not here today?

952
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:26,632
Yes, I know that.

953
01:41:29,604 --> 01:41:32,523
I'm going to shoot 10 of you...

954
01:41:32,524 --> 01:41:36,360
in the hope that we can
demonstrate to this wretch...

955
01:41:36,361 --> 01:41:38,737
the terrible responsibility
he has incurred.

956
01:41:38,738 --> 01:41:40,601
Stop.

957
01:41:42,826 --> 01:41:45,732
You have some objection, Father?

958
01:41:46,621 --> 01:41:48,372
Shoot me.

959
01:41:48,373 --> 01:41:51,333
Yes, you'd like that.

960
01:41:51,334 --> 01:41:53,168
You choose.

961
01:41:53,169 --> 01:41:55,170
You have five seconds.

962
01:41:55,171 --> 01:41:57,715
- I can't.
- You can't what?

963
01:41:57,716 --> 01:41:59,967
Pick who will be sacrificed?

964
01:41:59,968 --> 01:42:03,289
History is full of priests
who did little else.

965
01:42:03,305 --> 01:42:07,457
Father Merrin. You begin
to irritate me, Father.

966
01:42:10,145 --> 01:42:15,008
Tell your men to lay down
their weapons and leave.

967
01:42:15,692 --> 01:42:18,978
Priest or no,
I swear I will kill you.

968
01:42:19,154 --> 01:42:22,281
You'll get what satisfaction
you want, priest...

969
01:42:22,282 --> 01:42:26,860
because my men will not
lay down their weapons.

970
01:43:11,957 --> 01:43:14,400
Feel better?

971
01:43:15,335 --> 01:43:18,087
You did what you could.

972
01:43:18,088 --> 01:43:21,090
You laid down your life...

973
01:43:21,091 --> 01:43:24,510
but God decided to kill them anyway.

974
01:43:24,511 --> 01:43:27,452
Your guilt is gone.

975
01:43:29,724 --> 01:43:32,381
You are free.

976
01:43:32,936 --> 01:43:35,260
Free?

977
01:43:36,106 --> 01:43:37,773
To cease to care?

978
01:43:37,774 --> 01:43:41,428
To walk this earth your own man...

979
01:43:41,903 --> 01:43:45,072
without debt or guilt.

980
01:43:45,073 --> 01:43:47,908
This earth is not your dominion.

981
01:43:47,909 --> 01:43:51,479
Man is the chosen temple of God.

982
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:54,439
His holy vessel.

983
01:43:55,458 --> 01:44:00,087
Through the mastery of
the holy incarnation...

984
01:44:00,088 --> 01:44:02,946
O Lord, deliver us.

985
01:44:03,216 --> 01:44:04,717
Through thy coming...

986
01:44:06,803 --> 01:44:10,788
<i>I will destroy you!</i>

987
01:44:14,436 --> 01:44:17,638
<i>Through thy nativity,
O Lord, deliver us.</i>

988
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:23,301
<i>Through thy baptism and
thy holy fasting, deliver us.</i>

989
01:44:23,987 --> 01:44:27,573
<i>Through thy temptation, 40 days
and 40 nights in the desert...</i>

990
01:44:27,574 --> 01:44:29,649
<i>O Lord, deliver us.</i>

991
01:44:31,036 --> 01:44:33,673
<i>Through thy sacrifice on the cross...</i>

992
01:44:34,164 --> 01:44:36,986
<i>O Lord, deliver us.</i>

993
01:44:37,459 --> 01:44:40,794
Through thy holy
resurrection, deliver.

994
01:44:40,795 --> 01:44:44,632
Through the coming of
the Holy Ghost, deliver.

995
01:44:44,633 --> 01:44:49,417
Be uprooted and expelled
from this creature of God.

996
01:44:50,138 --> 01:44:52,747
Hear therefore...

997
01:44:52,933 --> 01:44:55,506
and fear...

998
01:44:56,061 --> 01:44:57,811
Satan!

999
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:16,901
In the name of Archangel Michael...

1000
01:45:17,999 --> 01:45:20,989
whose church this is...

1001
01:45:22,003 --> 01:45:24,338
in the name of all those...

1002
01:45:24,339 --> 01:45:26,830
who have died for our Savior...

1003
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:31,748
in the name of Christ
and all his saints...

1004
01:45:32,347 --> 01:45:35,123
I cast thee out.

1005
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:37,923
The faith of the
saints casts you out.

1006
01:45:38,562 --> 01:45:41,420
The blood of the
martyrs casts you out.

1007
01:45:41,481 --> 01:45:46,819
The heavenly host of all those
saved and in grace casts you out.

1008
01:45:48,822 --> 01:45:50,980
Please.

1009
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:55,067
Oh, Cheche. Have faith, Cheche.

1010
01:46:02,627 --> 01:46:05,284
I will kill you both!

1011
01:46:09,426 --> 01:46:12,581
With my last effort,
I will oppose you.

1012
01:46:14,889 --> 01:46:18,434
From one end of the
world to the other...

1013
01:46:18,435 --> 01:46:21,145
I will oppose you.

1014
01:46:21,146 --> 01:46:23,731
Until my soul burns in hell...

1015
01:46:23,732 --> 01:46:26,341
I will oppose you!

1016
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:34,649
Stop.

1017
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:40,737
We exorcise you, each unclean spirit.

1018
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:44,585
We cast you out,
each power of Satan...

1019
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:47,195
each infestation of the enemy.

1020
01:46:50,634 --> 01:46:55,461
Repel, O Lord,
the power of this evil prince!

1021
01:47:33,009 --> 01:47:35,344
In the name of the Father...

1022
01:47:35,345 --> 01:47:36,971
the Son...

1023
01:47:36,972 --> 01:47:39,473
and the Holy Ghost...

1024
01:47:39,474 --> 01:47:42,166
I absolve thee.

1025
01:48:23,018 --> 01:48:26,395
He wants to know if you're certain
the demon in the church is gone.

1026
01:48:26,396 --> 01:48:29,635
Yes, from here.

1027
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:41,899
He wishes you strength.

1028
01:48:42,245 --> 01:48:45,080
He says the demon
is your enemy now...

1029
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:47,235
and he will pursue you.

1030
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:23,652
We'll be ready to pull
out within the hour.

1031
01:49:24,412 --> 01:49:26,606
Oh, and Father Merrin...

1032
01:49:27,624 --> 01:49:31,159
anyone asks me
about this place, sir...

1033
01:49:31,419 --> 01:49:33,587
I didn't see a thing.

1034
01:49:33,588 --> 01:49:36,446
They won't get anything out of me.

1035
01:49:37,175 --> 01:49:39,287
Good luck.

1036
01:49:45,559 --> 01:49:47,717
I've got myself a new helper.

1037
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:53,274
Good day.

1038
01:49:53,275 --> 01:49:55,599
Good day.

1039
01:49:57,779 --> 01:50:01,615
- You're leaving too?
- Well, not just yet, but soon.

1040
01:50:01,616 --> 01:50:03,617
- Where?
- To Rome.

1041
01:50:03,618 --> 01:50:05,953
They want a report.

1042
01:50:05,954 --> 01:50:10,666
Yes, the Church is a leaky
structure, but it's all I have.

1043
01:50:10,667 --> 01:50:14,118
I think the Holy See will
find some use for me.

1044
01:50:38,153 --> 01:50:40,430
Will you write me?

1045
01:50:40,572 --> 01:50:42,434
Here?

1046
01:50:42,574 --> 01:50:46,109
- They need me here.
- Yes.

1047
01:50:47,162 --> 01:50:49,320
Write me.

1048
01:55:46,962 --> 01:55:50,781
<i>I am perfection.</i>
