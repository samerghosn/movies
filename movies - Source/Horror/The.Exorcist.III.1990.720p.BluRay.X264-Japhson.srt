1
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,109
Catch.

2
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:24,899
Catch.

3
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,893
Damien.

4
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,682
<i>I have dreams...</i>

5
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:22,223
<i>of a rose...</i>

6
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:26,686
<i>and of falling down a
long flight of steps.</i>

7
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,860
<i>"A light shall shine upon this day,
for the Lord has been born unto us.</i>

8
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,031
<i>And he is called Wonderful.
God. The Prince of Peace."</i>

9
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:04,036
<i>Dockside Hunter, sweep completed.
Negative finding.</i>

10
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,872
<i>Roger, River. Repeat, acknowledge.</i>

11
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:11,294
"Peace, I give you.
My peace, I leave you.

12
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:16,902
As the world gives, do I give to you.
Let not your heart be troubled."

13
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:24,326
<i>Proceeding northeast,
approximate location near...</i>

14
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:29,353
"The Lord is my light and
my salvation. Whom shall I fear?

15
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:32,376
The Lord is the defender of my life."

16
00:05:55,964 --> 00:06:01,010
- How did I do on my theology quiz?
- Change your name to Rajneesh.

17
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:06,599
- Really?
- "God is like a power mower"?

18
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,309
No kidding.

19
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,913
- Father, everything's relative.
- Is it?

20
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:16,776
- Or, maybe not.
- I like a man who knows his mind.

21
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:21,155
Well, that's it. I gotta go now.
I'm driving to Philly.

22
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,908
- Speed kills.
- Who's to say?

23
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,409
Not me.

24
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,082
Father, you mentioned a Damien
Karras in your prayer for the dead.

25
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,541
Yes, I did.

26
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:36,629
Isn't he the one who died
in a fall on those steps?

27
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,923
Yes. 15 years ago today.

28
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,634
- I hear...
- Get lost, will you?

29
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,368
All right, all right. I am in flight.

30
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,641
There's more potatoes.

31
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:17,211
Could you pass the salt? Thank you.

32
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:21,257
Joey, what did you say
that offended Tom Lowery?

33
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:24,468
- He's our biggest benefactor.
- Oh, yes.

34
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,512
What did you say to him?

35
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:31,160
"Jesus loves you. Everyone else
thinks you're an asshole."

36
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,562
- Good morning, John.
- My back aches.

37
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:38,816
- Do we have to have our own Olympics?
- Any plans today?

38
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:43,446
- I'm watching <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
- Very nice.

39
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,741
- Seen it 37 times.
- That's commendable.

40
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:51,186
- Do you have a favorite picture?
<i>- The Fly.</i>

41
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:55,917
- You going alone or with keepers?
- With Bill Kinderman.

42
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,045
- The cop?
- Yeah.

43
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:04,383
Every year on this day he gets
depressed, so I try to cheer him up.

44
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:09,013
I can't believe you said that.
What kind of world is this?

45
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:13,809
Are you an animal? Do you
know what <i>Macbeth</i> is about?

46
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,397
It's a play about the
numbing of the moral sense.

47
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,692
I tell Ryan we have nothing to go on.

48
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:24,362
He says, "Win some, lose some."

49
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:27,323
You're a racist. Did you know that?

50
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:32,578
The police exam asks, "What are
rabies and what do you do for them?"

51
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,040
Ryan said,
"Rabies are Jewish priests...

52
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,835
and I would do anything
I could for them."

53
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:44,048
- What was the murder weapon, Stedman?
- I'd be guessing.

54
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,884
If not us, who? If not now, when?

55
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:50,805
All right. Something like
garden shears, maybe.

56
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,641
- We're abandoned.
- I didn't get you.

57
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:58,229
I was signaling beings on Mars.
Sometimes they answer.

58
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,022
Funny.

59
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:05,631
Are you enjoying your luxury cruise
aboard the <i>Patna,</i> Lord Jim?

60
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:11,701
Telex Richmond right away and urgently
for the file on the Gemini Killer.

61
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:15,580
- The Gemini Killer's dead.
- Who was speaking to you?

62
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:18,416
- He's dead.
- He should live so long.

63
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,502
- The autopsy? When, please?
- Tomorrow.

64
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:24,608
And tomorrow, and tomorrow.

65
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:30,261
I am leaving you. Ryan, Stedman,
go home. Go home to your families.

66
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,820
Talk about wops.

67
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:39,312
- Starving?
- Not really. Just some coffee.

68
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,773
- You've been up since 5:00 a.m.
- I have this.

69
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:46,527
- How was Virginia?
- Neat. We stopped at a diner.

70
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,947
Instead of potatoes,
they served Mama grits.

71
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,742
So she says, "These Jews are crazy."

72
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:57,163
They're all wackos. Next,
they'll wanna eat papaya.

73
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,999
- My God.
- How was your day?

74
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,297
Our trackers at long last brought in
Mushkin, the Georgetown terrorist...

75
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:10,885
who breaks into people's homes
and completely redecorates.

76
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:14,347
- You okay, Bill?
- Hi, Daddy.

77
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,099
- And goodbye?
- Off to dance class.

78
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,604
- Pocahontas with the hair.
- Watch out for red shoes.

79
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:26,714
- You're home now.
- No, I gotta go cheer up Father Dyer.

80
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:48,589
What are you doing out here? Founding
an order called "Lurking Fathers"?

81
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,303
I've been out there for centuries.
Four new popes have been elected.

82
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,578
Official business.

83
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:03,456
All right. So I'm late. So I know it.
So I'm sorry. I got...

84
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:07,775
- Want butter on it?
- No. And can I have two Cokes?

85
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:09,652
- Medium or large?
- Medium.

86
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,113
- What's this?
- I need lemon drops.

87
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:16,325
- We'll be late.
- I used to hear children's confessions.

88
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,536
Now I'm a lemon drop junkie.

89
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:23,266
The weirdoes breathe it on you
along with pot, it's addictive.

90
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:34,885
Now I suppose you have all
sorts of rosary biz and the like.

91
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:39,682
No, no. Loose as a goose.
Maybe you should go home and rest.

92
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:42,810
- I can't go home.
- Why?

93
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:47,873
- The carp.
- You know, I thought you said...

94
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:53,195
My wife's mother is visiting, Father.

95
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:57,575
Tuesday night, she's cooking
a carp. It's a tasty fish.

96
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:00,036
I have nothing against it.

97
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:06,918
But because it's supposedly filled
with impurities, she buys it live.

98
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,879
And for three days it's been...

99
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,945
swimming up and down in my bathtub.

100
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,260
Up...

101
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:18,737
and down.

102
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,100
And I hate it. I can't
stand the sight of it.

103
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,603
Moving its gills.

104
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:29,774
You're standing very close to me.
Have you noticed?

105
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:35,216
Yes. I haven't had a
bath for three days.

106
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:40,012
I can't go home until
the carp is asleep.

107
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:46,606
Because if I see it
swimming, I'll kill it.

108
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:54,131
- And a salad.
- Okay.

109
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:57,843
The whole world is a
homicide victim, Father.

110
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:02,473
Would a God who is good
invent something like death?

111
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:06,352
Plainly speaking, it's a lousy idea.
Not popular.

112
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:09,397
- You're blaming God.
- Who should I blame?

113
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:12,191
- You don't want to live forever.
- I do.

114
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,902
- You'd get bored.
- I have hobbies.

115
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:20,700
In the meantime, we have cancer and
mongoloid babies and murderers...

116
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:25,997
monsters prowling the planet.
Even prowling this neighborhood.

117
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:30,251
Right now, all our children suffer...

118
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:33,004
and our loved ones die.

119
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:37,425
And your God goes waltzing
blithely through the universe...

120
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:40,780
like some kind of
cosmic Billie Burke.

121
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,764
- Bill, it all works out right.
- When?

122
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:46,559
- At the end of time.
- That soon?

123
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,954
No, we're gonna be there. We're
gonna live forever. We're spirits.

124
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:56,545
How I would love to believe that.

125
00:13:56,862 --> 00:14:01,240
It's that kid that got killed.
I heard it on the news.

126
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,848
You wanna talk about it?

127
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,787
You knew him.

128
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:10,958
A little bit. Police Boys Club.

129
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,796
His name was Thomas. Thomas Kintry.

130
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:19,282
Black boy, about 12 years old.

131
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:22,194
The killer...

132
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,974
drove an ingot into
each of his eyes...

133
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,700
then cut off his head.

134
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:37,235
Is this okay, Father?
I can get you something else.

135
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:39,712
Some more coffee?

136
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:50,765
In place of his head was the
head from a statue of Christ...

137
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,211
all done up in blackface,
like a minstrel show.

138
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:58,696
The eyes and the mouth painted white.

139
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:03,495
Mr. Bones.

140
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:09,117
The boy had been crucified...

141
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,664
on a pair of rowing oars.

142
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:30,179
May the Lord be in your heart and
help you to confess your sins.

143
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,084
- Yes?
- I have...

144
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:39,964
a scrupulous conscience, Father.

145
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:45,011
This need to confess...

146
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,822
so many things.

147
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:52,977
If I step on two straws
in the shape of a cross...

148
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:57,126
I feel that I have to confess it.

149
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:03,195
- It torments me.
- Try to make a good confession.

150
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:07,511
And remember, Christ
forgives us all of our sins.

151
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:12,747
Only little things. Nothing.

152
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:16,042
Seventeen of them, Father.

153
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:21,339
The first was that waitress
near Candlestick Park.

154
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,302
I cut her throat and
watched her bleed.

155
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:29,055
She bled a great deal.

156
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:33,851
It's a problem that I'm
working on, Father.

157
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:36,826
All this bleeding.

158
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:22,129
I don't know. I don't know.
He was such a good...

159
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,465
- I've been thinking...
- This is new.

160
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:51,470
Do we need prints from inside?
All you'll get are the priest's.

161
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,848
Yes, I know.

162
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,460
- Then what's the point?
- I'm padding the job.

163
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:57,614
We got an autopsy on the boy.

164
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,058
Yes.

165
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,812
Kintry didn't die from
the decapitation.

166
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:09,692
He was injected with a drug
called succinylcholine.

167
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:15,990
They use it in electroshock therapy.
But injecting 10 milligrams...

00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:22,429
for each 50 pounds of body weight
causes immediate and total paralysis.

169
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,127
He couldn't move while the
killer was cutting him up.

170
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:34,033
- He was conscious?
- Yes. He was fully aware.

171
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:39,472
The drug attacks the
respiratory system.

172
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:43,740
He died from slow asphyxiation.

173
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:54,362
<i>Ms. Scott, report to nurses' station.</i>

174
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:59,259
Father Dyer. Joseph Dyer. D-Y-E-R.

175
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:04,747
- He's in room 411. It's down there.
- 411.

176
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:07,639
<i>Dr. Miller, line</i> 118.

177
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,343
What's this nonsense?

178
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:21,347
- Nothing's wrong. Just some tests.
- They had no rabbit?

179
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,767
- I don't know you.
- Reading <i>Women's Wear Daily</i>?

180
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:30,022
Am I supposed to give spiritual
advice in a vacuum? Is that for me?

181
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:34,088
I found it in the street.
I thought it suited you.

182
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:36,445
You said nothing's wrong.

183
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:40,157
My brother Eddie had
these symptoms for years.

184
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:43,995
- Eddie died at 30.
- So? He got killed in Vietnam.

185
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:46,289
- Could be a connection.
- What?

186
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,501
You sure it's not serious?
Shut up about Eddie!

187
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:53,296
- It was nerves.
- You make people nervous.

188
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:55,089
- Only sinners.
- Everybody!

189
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,989
- Is everything all right, guys?
- We're fine!

190
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:09,312
- I'm just tired.
- Well, call the desk and book a room.

191
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:12,023
- I brought a burger.
- I'm not hungry.

192
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:16,110
- Eat half. It's from Clyde's.
- Where's the other half from?

193
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:18,279
Space. Your native country.

194
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,949
- Who stuck this guy?!
- Peaceful here, isn't it?

195
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,743
Idyllic.

196
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,976
- Those will kill you, incidentally.
- They're quiet.

197
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:31,459
- Mr. Horowitz?
- Nope.

198
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,611
- This is 409?
- 411.

199
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,505
Never mind.

200
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:40,821
Go in peace, my child.
May the Schwartz be with you.

201
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:47,266
- Shouldn't you be reading the Gospels?
- They don't give the fashions.

202
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,393
- This is true.
- Damn right.

203
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:52,980
Gowns are boring.
Get me something to read.

204
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:55,816
- I've gotta go.
- Pick me something up.

205
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:59,278
- The grammar.
<i>- The National Enquirer</i> and <i>Star.</i>

206
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,157
There are missions in India.
Couldn't you find one?

207
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,826
These are last week's editions.

208
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:12,333
I'll leave this mystical conversation.
Aesthetics always gives me a headache.

209
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:16,504
- Is it something I said?
- Mother India is calling you.

210
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:19,574
<i>Dr. Kincaid to Orthopedics, please.</i>

211
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:26,288
<i>EKG stat to ER. EKG stat to ER.</i>

212
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:32,853
Father Kanavan's vocal
cords were paralyzed.

213
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:39,151
He couldn't make a sound, couldn't
cry for help. The killer took his time.

214
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:44,657
- Succinylcholine again?
- In precisely the proper dosage.

215
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:49,245
Too little has no effect.
Too much causes instant death.

216
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:54,959
Our friend has medical expertise.
Did we find a hypodermic at the scene?

217
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,087
- No syringe.
- The fingerprint analysis?

218
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:02,568
- Most of the prints were the priest's.
- You said most?

219
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:05,490
We've got something else.

220
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:12,059
Right here, on the inside pull
of this panel. It's strange.

221
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,328
- Nobody touches this but the priest.
- And the killer.

222
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:23,696
He wants the panel closed so the next
person doesn't know Kanavan's dead.

223
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:27,617
So he puts his hand in
and slides it almost shut.

224
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:33,080
Then he has to pull his hand out
and finish the job from the outside.

225
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:38,210
So the prints on the oars from
the crucified boy match the panel?

226
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:40,651
They're one and the same.

227
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:45,531
Well, aren't they?

228
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:54,492
Two different people
committed these murders?

229
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:58,648
<i>- Where's Julie?
- At dance class.</i>

230
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:03,675
<i>- So late?
- Bill, it's only 10:00.</i>

231
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:06,215
<i>It's very late.</i>

232
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:48,781
<i>Your attention, please.
Your attention.</i>

233
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:53,536
<i>The 12:18 to Elsewhere now
departing from track 11.</i>

234
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:57,187
<i>All passengers boarding
proceed to the gate.</i>

235
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:03,359
Let me out of this damn <i>casa blanca</i>!

236
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:23,482
- It is!
- It isn't. It's out of bounds.

237
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,152
- The line is in bounds!
- It's not!

238
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,798
It hit the dirt!

239
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,409
Earth, come in. Can you hear us?
We are attempting to communicate.

240
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,621
- Come in, please.
- The living are deaf.

241
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:39,790
- We come here first.
- Lieutenant.

242
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:44,253
- How you doing?
- I'm sorry you were killed. I miss you.

243
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:46,694
I miss you too.

244
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:17,309
- I wonder if both of us are dreaming.
- No, Bill. I'm not dreaming.

245
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:38,204
<i>Kinderman.</i>

246
00:27:40,644 --> 00:27:43,120
<i>What are you telling me?</i>

247
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:48,625
Hold it.

248
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:10,186
I've just never seen anything
like this in 20 years.

<i>Dr. Bartlet, please call the operator.

252
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:57,680
What are these?

253
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:04,850
What are they? What's in them?

254
00:30:04,997 --> 00:30:08,979
Father Dyer's entire blood supply.

255
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:15,655
What?

256
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:21,694
All of his blood?

257
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,809
And not a drop of it spilled.

258
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:33,165
All neat. There's not even
a smudge on the jars.

259
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:41,304
There's only the
writing in his blood.

260
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:47,436
Writing?

261
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:54,226
On the wall.

262
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:14,038
<i>- Dr. Hoffman, line 412, please. </i>
- Lieutenant.

263
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,488
Take a squad of men.

264
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:25,785
Make sure all the hospital doors
are locked. Make a pattern search.

265
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:29,705
No one in. No one out.

266
00:31:29,706 --> 00:31:32,644
Except for emergencies.

267
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:38,235
- No one.
- All right.

268
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,010
<i>EKG stat to ER. EKG stat to ER.</i>

269
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:45,320
Now...

270
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:51,477
what time was the body discovered?

271
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:55,579
- At 6.
- By whom?

272
00:31:56,984 --> 00:32:00,135
You saw him at 5 a. m?

273
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:03,424
- Yes, that's right.
- He was awake?

274
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:10,391
- He was awake. I gave him medication.
- How long did it take you?

275
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:14,875
- About a minute.
- And then what?

276
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:17,253
I came back to the desk.

277
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:21,465
You were here until you saw
Father Dyer again at 6:00?

278
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:22,925
That's right.

279
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:28,347
- Were you here or inside the office?
- I was inside, writing reports.

280
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:33,227
If someone entered his room
between when you left and returned...

281
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:36,147
- ...you might not have seen them.
- Right.

282
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:40,401
- Did you see anyone go into the room?
- No, I didn't.

283
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:43,696
- Or leave the room?
- No, I didn't.

284
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:47,513
Did you see anybody in the hallway?

285
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,746
- Mrs. Clelia.
- You saw Mrs. Clelia walking around?

286
00:32:51,747 --> 00:32:55,064
- No, not exactly.
- Not exactly?!

287
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:02,256
- I found her lying unconscious.
- When was that?

288
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:05,551
On my way to give the
Father his last medication.

289
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:07,845
- The 5 or the 6?
- The 6.

290
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,014
Mrs. Clelia is a patient?

291
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:12,266
- Yes, she is.
- In Neurology?

292
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:18,955
<i>Dr. Randolph to Examining Bay 2.

293
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:37,524
How we doing today?

294
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,798
They're all harmless.

295
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,510
Some more serious problems
here too, of course.

296
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:52,205
Some catatonics,
some with Alzheimer's, autism.

297
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:00,040
- Are you my son?
- I'd be very proud to believe so.

298
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,085
You're not my son.

299
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,388
There's your girl over there.

300
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:24,983
Mrs. Clelia?

301
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:29,444
- My name is William Kinderman.
- Yes.

302
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,994
- Would you help me, please?
- What about my radio?

303
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:39,228
- Pardon me?
- I said, my radio.

304
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:42,037
Aren't you gonna fix it?

305
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:49,363
Nothing ever gets fixed around here.
Just a bunch of pies and anchovies.

306
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:53,951
Go away! I don't ever
talk to strangers.

307
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:59,373
- I'm the radio repairman, Mrs. Clelia.
- Well, fix it.

308
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:03,689
- Well, what's wrong with it?
- Dead people talking.

309
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,358
It's right here. Do you see it?

310
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:13,821
Yes, I see it.

311
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:20,541
I knew you weren't a radio repairman.
That's a telephone I'm holding.

312
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:29,946
It's all right. A lot of people
wouldn't know the difference either.

313
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:32,635
It's all right.

314
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:38,053
You have a very kind face.

315
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,568
You will do well.

316
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:02,353
- You caught her on a talkative day.
- You being funny?

317
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:05,147
No, she's quasi-catatonic.
In and out.

318
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:08,466
- What's this?
- The disturbed ward.

319
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:29,777
To get out...

320
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:37,722
you punch a four-digit combo that
sends a signal to the control booth.

321
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:43,330
The inner door opens. The booth
operator checks through the glass.

322
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:49,379
- Every day, there's a new combination.
- I'd like to look around.

00:37:57,761 --> 00:38:00,699
<i>Die not, poor Death</i>

333
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,491
<i>Nor canst thou kill me</i>

334
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:10,079
I was only 21 when I died.

335
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,082
We're a hospital, not a war zone.

336
00:38:13,443 --> 00:38:18,221
How do you expect us to keep
people calm when you're..?

337
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,776
You need a court warrant
to do what you're doing!

338
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:37,842
I appreciate your trying to
prevent further tragedy.

339
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:41,470
Think of the state of our
patients' minds when...

340
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:44,682
- Lieutenant wants fingerprints taken.
- Prints?

341
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:48,997
- Not on your life. No way, Jose!
- He's right here.

342
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:54,191
- Want to talk to him?!
- Heard of malpractice?

343
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:57,194
- Heard of the Gemini Killer?
- Have I what?

344
00:38:57,195 --> 00:38:59,155
- I said...
- Yes! So what?

345
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:02,742
- He's dead.
- Right. He died in the electric chair.

346
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:06,975
- Why are we talking about..?
- Just a minute, I'll explain.

347
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:10,708
The Gemini is dead. We know that.

348
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:14,712
Do you recall the stories
in the papers and on TV...

349
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:18,174
about his strange m.o?
I'll remind you.

350
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:24,972
Supposedly, the middle finger of the
victim's left hand was always found...

351
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:27,934
severed. Always missing.

352
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:33,874
In addition, on the victim's back,
we were told, the killer carved out...

353
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:37,485
a sign of the zodiac.

354
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:41,697
- The Gemini symbol, the twins.
- That was 15 years ago.

355
00:39:41,698 --> 00:39:44,492
- Go ahead.
- Why are you encouraging..?

356
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:46,885
Shut your mouth!

357
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,433
Excuse me.

358
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:02,033
Excuse me.

359
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,933
<i>EKG stat to ER.</i>

360
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:15,586
The Gemini m.o. that you
heard about is false.

361
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:20,778
The missing finger was
on the victim's right hand.

362
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:23,698
It was the index finger. This one.

363
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,577
And the sign of the
Gemini was carved...

364
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:30,100
not on the victim's back...

365
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:34,060
but on the victim's left palm.

366
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:37,795
Only Richmond Homicide
knew that. No one else.

367
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:41,382
Misinformation was fed to
the press to weed out...

368
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:44,218
those who said they were the killer.

369
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,722
"I cut off this finger,"
the loony says.

370
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:53,019
"And on their backs I
made my mark." Next case.

371
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,580
But, in this case, gentlemen...

372
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,404
three decapitations, three victims...

373
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:07,283
with this finger severed.
The correct one.

374
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:10,601
And the sign of the Gemini here.

375
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:15,016
Here!

376
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:19,609
One more thing.

377
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:26,135
The Gemini wrote letters to the
newspapers, bragging of his murders.

378
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:29,305
He always doubled his final L's.

379
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:34,119
Two L's, as in "wonderfull."

380
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:36,496
Yes.

381
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:41,609
The victims' names always start
with K, like Karl, his father...

382
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,529
the famous evangelist he
hated and wanted to shame.

383
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,659
And whom he wanted
to kill and keep killing.

384
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,104
But the priest,
Father Joseph Dyer...

385
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:56,682
Dyer's middle name was Kevin.

386
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,193
Kevin.

387
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:08,701
Even that could do it.

388
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:14,368
- Would it take a lot of strength?
- No, not at all.

389
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:16,750
Very little, in fact.

390
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:24,336
Spring-activated. Open it,
and it closes on its own.

391
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:30,088
Takes strength just to open it.

392
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,610
It's a little stiff.

393
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:45,769
Needs adjustment.

394
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,675
- What's this?
- What?

395
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:49,700
This label.

396
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:53,681
- Just a shipping tag.
- Is it new?

397
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:55,790
Just came in.

398
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:58,577
A replacement?

399
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:02,541
Where's the old one?

400
00:43:12,743 --> 00:43:17,010
Two priests and a crucified boy.

401
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:22,647
Clearly some religious connection.
But what is it?

402
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:28,567
I don't know what I'm
looking for. I'm groping.

403
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,203
But besides being priests...

404
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:41,830
what might Kanavan and Dyer have
had in common? Where's the link?

405
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,457
I don't know. I don't know.

406
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:51,215
Dear God.

407
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:10,652
It could be that exorcism.
The MacNeil kid, Regan MacNeil.

408
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:15,204
The exorcism on Prospect
Street that Damien Karras did.

409
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:18,615
The one that killed him.

410
00:45:52,778 --> 00:45:55,363
- Excuse me.
- Alice!

411
00:45:55,364 --> 00:46:00,805
The speech! Will you give this
to Father, please? I gotta run.

412
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:04,622
- What's wrong with the lights?
- Good night!

413
00:46:04,623 --> 00:46:06,980
Good night, Father.

414
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,416
Your speech, Father.

415
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:36,172
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

416
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:39,305
Need a drink?

417
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:42,434
I do.

418
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:52,003
Do you believe in possession, Father?

419
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:56,299
Who cares? I worry enough
about kids who need scholarships.

420
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,302
- I'll talk to Paul Morning.
- Who is he?

421
00:46:59,303 --> 00:47:02,221
Our chaplain at the hospital.

422
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:05,975
He performed an exorcism
once in the Philippines.

423
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:10,587
- His hair turned white overnight.
- Is that true?

424
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:16,718
- What's that got to do with this?
- You mentioned that exorcism.

425
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:19,130
As a connection.

426
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:23,034
- To the people who were murdered?
- Right.

427
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:26,871
- Joe and Damien Karras were close.
- Yes, I know.

428
00:47:26,872 --> 00:47:30,374
Joe was also a friend
of the MacNeils.

429
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:34,170
- And Father Kanavan?
- He had my job back then.

430
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:37,381
He gave Damien permission
to investigate.

431
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:40,968
- That leaves us with the Kintry boy.
- Does it?

432
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:46,557
Damien gave our School of Linguistics
a tape to analyze for him.

433
00:47:46,558 --> 00:47:51,454
The voice of the MacNeil kid,
supposedly possessed.

434
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:57,443
He wanted to know if the sounds on
the tape were a language or gibberish.

435
00:47:57,444 --> 00:48:02,114
He wanted proof the kid was
speaking a language she didn't know.

436
00:48:02,115 --> 00:48:05,006
- And was she?
- No.

437
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:08,496
English in reverse.

438
00:48:08,497 --> 00:48:12,147
- The expert who figured it out...
- Kintry's mother.

439
00:50:08,753 --> 00:50:11,193
This is impossible.

440
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:30,591
Do you remember coming in
here when the priest died?

441
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,131
- You're the radio man.
- Yes, that's right.

442
00:50:39,826 --> 00:50:42,682
Do you remember coming in here?

443
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,450
Do you remember coming in
and touching those jars?

444
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:02,320
Why did you touch them?

445
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:08,535
Was there anyone else in this room?

446
00:51:10,315 --> 00:51:12,708
Who was in here?

447
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:20,547
That radio isn't mine.
Mine is newer.

448
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:30,857
That man in the isolation tank...
You know, the one you looked in on?

449
00:51:31,795 --> 00:51:35,030
The one you looked in on.

450
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:40,660
The police brought him
in here 15 years ago.

451
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:44,863
They picked him up
wandering the C&O Canal.

452
00:51:48,395 --> 00:51:51,084
Down around Key Bridge.

453
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:58,421
Yes, total amnesia.

454
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:02,761
The man in the isolation tank...

455
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:06,762
You know, the one you looked in on.

456
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:15,379
The police brought him
in here 15 years ago.

457
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,648
They picked him up
wandering the C&O Canal.

458
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:22,779
Down around Key...

459
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,746
You had something to tell me?

460
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:32,418
Please, sit down.

461
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:48,644
There's a paper drive?

462
00:52:50,373 --> 00:52:53,644
Haven't had a chance
yet to read them.

463
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:59,025
I just keep them till I do.

464
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:04,486
I hate to miss the science articles.
They're good.

465
00:53:23,448 --> 00:53:26,600
That man in the isolation tank...

466
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,454
- You know, the one you looked in on.
- Yes.

467
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:34,375
The police brought him
here 15 years ago.

468
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:39,088
They picked him up wandering the
C&O Canal around Key Bridge.

469
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:44,732
Total amnesia. No I.D.
They brought him to us here.

470
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:50,391
And his condition grew worse.
He ended up catatonic.

471
00:53:50,392 --> 00:53:54,955
Completely withdrawn.
But recently...

472
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,008
Well...

473
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:07,366
about six weeks ago,
he slowly started to come out of it.

474
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:13,437
Every day he got better.
Just a little, but better.

475
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,565
And then all of a sudden,
he got violent. Really bad news.

476
00:54:20,422 --> 00:54:23,443
We give him electroshock therapy.

477
00:54:23,592 --> 00:54:28,036
And as of two weeks ago
he's been in isolation...

478
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:34,376
- ...but the thing is...
- Yes?

479
00:54:37,189 --> 00:54:40,080
He says he's the Gemini Killer.

480
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:55,331
I want the file on that man.

481
00:54:55,332 --> 00:54:58,270
Get it. Now!

482
00:54:59,503 --> 00:55:02,505
You want to know
about the man in cell 11.

483
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:07,426
Stretch your memory. What was he
wearing when he was brought in?

484
00:55:07,427 --> 00:55:12,431
- That was quite some time ago.
- Was he dressed like a priest?

485
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:16,533
- Like a priest?
- Were there any signs of injuries?

486
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:22,163
- That would be in the file.
- It is not in the file! It is not!

487
00:55:22,192 --> 00:55:26,320
Two men on every ward.
Rotate them 24 hours a day.

488
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:31,700
In the disturbed ward, one man inside
near the entry door, one man outside.

489
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:36,372
Ask the Jesuits for the dental
records of Father Damien Karras.

490
00:55:36,373 --> 00:55:41,335
Find out if he had a saliva test.
Might help us get a positive I.D.

491
00:55:41,336 --> 00:55:43,563
What for, sir?

492
00:55:43,922 --> 00:55:46,315
Sir, are you all right?

493
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:53,029
<i>IV team to NICU. IV team to NICU.</i>

494
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:58,626
- You all right?
- Yeah.

495
00:55:58,895 --> 00:56:01,122
Father Karras...

496
00:56:01,731 --> 00:56:05,985
was a Jesuit psychiatrist
at Georgetown University.

497
00:56:05,986 --> 00:56:11,344
The man was a saint. He was
my best friend. I loved him.

498
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:15,911
Fifteen years ago he jumped
or was pushed to his death...

499
00:56:15,912 --> 00:56:20,939
down that long flight of
steps next to the Car Barn.

500
00:56:21,251 --> 00:56:23,442
Atkins...

501
00:56:24,087 --> 00:56:26,464
I saw it.

502
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:28,466
I watched him...

503
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:30,610
die.

504
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:35,121
I think...

505
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,572
the man in cell 11...

506
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:41,204
is Damien Karras.

507
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:54,221
It's a wonderful life.

508
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:09,739
Who are you?

509
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:14,738
I am no one.

510
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:19,157
Many.

511
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:22,269
Are you Damien Karras?

512
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,524
You haven't any medical
records for him, have you?

513
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:30,069
- No tedious fingerprints.
- Are you Karras?

514
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,364
I am the Gemini Killer,
James Venamun.

515
00:57:33,365 --> 00:57:37,465
- The Gemini is dead.
- No, not quite.

516
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:41,184
Remember Karen?

517
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:46,233
Little ribbons in her hair?
Yellow ribbons.

518
00:57:48,213 --> 00:57:50,404
I killed her.

519
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,885
After all, it was
inevitable, wasn't it?

520
00:57:54,886 --> 00:57:59,782
"A divinity shapes our
ends," and all that.

521
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:03,330
I picked her up in Richmond.

522
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:08,334
And then I dropped her
off at the city dump.

523
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,799
Some of her. Some of her I kept.

524
00:58:12,946 --> 00:58:15,552
I'm a saver.

525
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:22,891
Pretty dress she was wearing.
Little peasant blouse, pink...

526
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:26,479
and white ruffles.

527
00:58:27,627 --> 00:58:33,382
I still hear from her
occasionally, screaming.

528
00:58:33,383 --> 00:58:38,196
I think the dead should shut up
unless there's something to say.

529
00:58:42,642 --> 00:58:46,707
I also killed the black boy,
by the river.

530
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,831
And the priests.

531
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:54,904
Oh, yes, their names began with a K.

532
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:59,325
That modicum at least I
was able to insist upon.

533
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:03,496
You see, they were off my
beaten track. I kill at random.

534
00:59:03,497 --> 00:59:07,681
That's the thrill of it.
No motive. That's the fun.

535
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:12,982
The black boy and the
priests were different.

536
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:18,404
I was obliged to settle
a score on behalf of...

537
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:21,222
well...

538
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:23,829
a friend.

539
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:27,770
- What friend?
- A friend over there.

540
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:32,566
On the other side, one needs friends.
There is suffering there.

541
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:35,611
- They can be cruel.
- Who is "they"?

542
00:59:35,612 --> 00:59:40,508
Never mind. I cannot
tell you. It's...

543
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:43,432
forbidden.

544
00:59:54,297 --> 00:59:59,525
I do that rather well.
Don't you think?

545
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:05,327
Well, why not? After all...

546
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:10,914
I've been taught by the master.

547
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:13,957
Who is that?

548
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:16,592
The one.

549
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,141
There is only one.

550
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,836
- Who's this Damien you mentioned?
- Don't you know?

551
01:00:33,837 --> 01:00:39,397
I know nothing, except I must go
on killing Daddy. I must shame him.

552
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:44,472
Do the papers call
these Gemini killings?

553
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:48,058
You must get them to
do that. It's important.

554
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:53,731
- The Gemini is dead.
- No, I am not! I'm alive!

555
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:57,777
I go on! I breathe! Look at me!

556
01:00:57,778 --> 01:01:01,843
Look at me and tell me what you see!

557
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,389
I see a man who looks
like Damien Karras.

558
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:11,641
If you looked with
the eyes of faith...

559
01:01:12,709 --> 01:01:14,543
you'd see me.

560
01:01:14,544 --> 01:01:19,772
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Your blindness.

561
01:01:24,596 --> 01:01:31,477
Tell the press that I am the Gemini,
lieutenant, or I will punish you.

562
01:01:31,478 --> 01:01:33,813
- Punish me?
- Yes.

563
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:37,108
- What are you talking about?
- Do you dance?

564
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:39,382
What do you mean?

565
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:56,813
I like plays.

566
01:01:56,962 --> 01:02:00,422
The good ones. Shakespeare.

567
01:02:00,423 --> 01:02:06,494
I like <i>Titus Andronicus</i>
the best. It's sweet.

568
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,663
Incidentally...

569
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:14,202
did you know that you
are talking to an artist?

570
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:20,192
I sometimes do special
things to my victims.

571
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:22,862
Things that are creative.

572
01:02:22,863 --> 01:02:28,601
Of course, it takes knowledge,
pride in your work.

573
01:02:31,371 --> 01:02:33,598
For example:

574
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:39,253
A decapitated head
can continue to see...

575
01:02:39,254 --> 01:02:43,716
for approximately 20 seconds.

576
01:02:43,717 --> 01:02:46,677
So when I have one that's cocking...

577
01:02:46,678 --> 01:02:51,849
I always hold it up so
that it can see its body.

578
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:56,746
It's a little extra I throw
in for no added charge.

579
01:02:57,063 --> 01:03:00,915
I must admit, it makes
me chuckle every time.

580
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,131
Life is fun.

581
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:10,179
It's a wonderful life, in fact...

582
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,061
for some.

583
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,351
It's too bad about poor Father Dyer.

584
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:25,945
I killed him, you know.

585
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:33,285
An interesting problem,
but finally it worked.

586
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:37,520
First, a bit of the old
succinylcholine...

587
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:43,192
to permit one to work
without annoying distractions.

588
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:48,239
Then a 3-foot catheter...

589
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,014
threaded directly into
the inferior vena cava...

590
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:58,332
or the superior vena cava.
It's a matter of taste.

591
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,252
Then the tube moves
through the vein...

592
01:04:01,253 --> 01:04:06,924
under the crease of the arm, into
the vein that leads into the heart.

593
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:14,014
And then you just hold up the legs
and you squeeze the blood manually...

594
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:17,518
into the tube from the
arms and the legs.

595
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:23,293
There's shaking and pounding at the
end for the dregs. It isn't perfect.

596
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,842
There's a little blood left,
I'm afraid.

597
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:29,447
But, regardless...

598
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:34,952
the overall effect is astonishing.

599
01:04:34,953 --> 01:04:38,414
Isn't that really what
counts in the end?

600
01:04:38,415 --> 01:04:44,336
Yes, of course. Good show biz,
lieutenant. The effect!

601
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:46,232
And then...

602
01:04:46,506 --> 01:04:53,596
off comes the head without
spilling one single drop of blood.

603
01:04:53,597 --> 01:04:58,374
Now, I call that
showmanship, lieutenant.

604
01:04:58,935 --> 01:05:04,792
Then of course, no one notices.
Pearls before...

605
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:13,349
Oh, a few boos from
the gallery, I see.

606
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:17,100
That's all right. I understand.

607
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:20,011
I've been dull.

608
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:26,527
Well, I shall liven things up
for you a bit, lieutenant.

609
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:32,524
The master is throwing me
a scrap from his table.

610
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:37,326
A little reward for faithful service.

611
01:05:38,558 --> 01:05:41,496
Something fun.

612
01:05:42,145 --> 01:05:47,421
Something random, something my way.

613
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:54,594
Good night, moon.
Good night, air.

614
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,176
Good night, Amy.

615
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:02,559
Telling her beads.

616
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:05,684
Her beads.

617
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:28,831
- He passed out.
- Again?

618
01:06:29,025 --> 01:06:32,278
- He's hemorrhaging.
- The man in that cell...

619
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:37,175
knows the details of a girl's
murder that happened years ago.

620
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:40,786
A Gemini killing that
wasn't in the papers.

621
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:44,105
His goddamn nose is broken!

622
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:49,628
When I said the man in cell 11 fell
unconscious, you said something.

623
01:06:49,629 --> 01:06:51,172
Really?

624
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:56,033
- Yes, I think you said, "Again?"
- Might've done.

625
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:59,972
- It's happened before?
- Yes, it has.

626
01:06:59,973 --> 01:07:02,081
Many times?

627
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:05,644
No, not really.
It's just been this week.

628
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:09,732
I think the first time was Sunday.

629
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:12,943
- And again?
- The next day.

630
01:07:12,944 --> 01:07:16,363
- If you want exact times, it's...
- On your chart.

631
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:19,931
- That's right.
- Any other times?

632
01:07:21,703 --> 01:07:27,082
- Yesterday morning, before we found...
- Yes. That's all right.

633
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,856
I'm very sorry.

634
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:36,258
When this happens, does
it seem like normal sleep?

635
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:39,744
Nothing's normal about that man.

636
01:07:39,846 --> 01:07:44,517
- You seem a bit pleased about that.
- It's quite unusual.

637
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:48,604
His autonomic system
slows to a crawl.

638
01:07:48,605 --> 01:07:51,792
His heartbeat, his temperature...

639
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,776
his breathing.

640
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:58,673
But his brain wave
activity accelerates.

641
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,325
Accelerates?

642
01:08:01,326 --> 01:08:05,510
Okay, keep that on until the weekend.

643
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:10,272
- You're most kind.
- I'm a bitch.

644
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:16,674
Have you told the man in cell 11
what happened to Father Dyer?

645
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:20,823
- No, of course not.
- Might anyone else have told him?

646
01:08:21,054 --> 01:08:23,806
- Why would they?
- I don't know.

647
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:26,142
I don't, either.

648
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:30,161
- Thanks again, miss.
- Why did you hit him?

649
01:08:33,358 --> 01:08:37,209
- Take it easy on that hand.
- I will.

650
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:40,968
"Save your servant."

651
01:08:43,243 --> 01:08:47,246
That's something our friend
in cell 11 said once.

652
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:51,375
- "Save your servant"?
- Keeps running through my mind.

653
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:55,296
- Odd expression.
- What was odd was how he said it.

654
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,191
How was that?

655
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,386
It was just his voice.
It was different.

656
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:07,850
- Different how?
- He sounded decent. Nice.

657
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:10,457
Completely different.

658
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,793
There was so much emotion
in his voice. He sounded...

659
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:17,921
I don't know. Desperate.

660
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:22,448
And what else has
he said in this voice?

661
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:25,055
Only one other thing.

662
01:09:25,076 --> 01:09:27,553
What was that, miss?

663
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,514
He said, "Kill it."

664
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:42,208
"Save your servant who
trusts in you, my God.

665
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:48,475
Let him find in you a fortified
tower in the face of the enemy."

666
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:57,566
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

667
01:10:57,752 --> 01:11:01,438
The Lord is the defender of my life.

668
01:11:02,048 --> 01:11:04,322
My life.

669
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:10,994
<i>"And Jesus said to the
man who was possessed:</i>

670
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,741
<i>'What is your name?'</i>

671
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:21,216
<i>And he answered:
'Legion, for we are many."'</i>

672
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,888
<i>Many.</i>

673
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:51,764
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Julie.

674
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:55,415
- It's so late.
- Yes, it is.

675
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:58,127
Very late.

676
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:23,082
God! Can't I get any sleep?

677
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,751
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry.

678
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:28,587
Bad enough you wake
me at 5:30 to eat.

679
01:14:28,588 --> 01:14:31,882
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? You do this on purpose.

680
01:14:31,883 --> 01:14:36,281
- What's your name? I'm reporting you.
- Amy Keating.

681
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:44,330
Angels of mercy. Horseshit.

682
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,061
You all right?

683
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:12,148
Yes, I'm fine. I'm just
a little jumpy. That's all.

684
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:13,856
She was slit down the middle.

685
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,314
Cut open...

686
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:20,741
and all her vital
organs were removed.

687
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,406
Then the killer stuffed her body...

688
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:30,370
with other materials
and sewed her back up.

689
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,289
Other materials?

690
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:39,403
Rosaries. Catholic rosaries.

691
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,797
Lieutenant!

692
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,366
Did you get my message?

693
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:14,335
I left it with Keating.

694
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:18,499
Nice girl. Good heart.

695
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:38,523
Yes! About this body of mine...

696
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:41,028
Friend of yours.

697
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,635
Well, there I was...

698
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:49,431
so awfully dead in
that electric chair.

699
01:18:49,432 --> 01:18:54,578
I didn't like it. Would you?
It's upsetting!

700
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:59,859
There was still so much killing
to do, and there I was...

701
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,344
in the void without a body.

702
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,714
But then along came...

703
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:13,956
well, you know, my friend.
One of them.

704
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:18,569
Those others, there. The cruel ones.

705
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:21,271
The master.

706
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:27,803
And he thought that my
work should continue.

707
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:32,600
But, in this body.

708
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:37,959
In this body in particular, in fact.

709
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:42,549
Let's call it revenge.

710
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,113
A certain matter of an exorcism...

711
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:52,369
in which Karras expelled certain
parties from the body of a child.

712
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,349
Certain parties were not
pleased, to say the least.

713
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,480
To say the very least.

714
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:05,489
And so my friend, the master...

715
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:10,805
devised this pretty little scheme
as a way of getting back...

716
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:17,208
of creating a stumbling
block, a scandal...

717
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,648
a horror to all men who seek faith.

718
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:25,069
Using the body of
this saintly priest...

719
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:29,698
as an instrument of...
Well, you know my work.

720
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:34,078
But, the main thing...

721
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,249
is the torment of your
friend, Father Karras...

722
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:45,131
as he watches while I rip,
and cut, and mutilate the innocent!

723
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:49,301
His friends! And again! And again!

724
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:51,804
And on and on!

725
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:54,932
He is inside with us!

726
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,810
He will never get away!

727
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:01,710
His pain won't end!

728
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:17,559
Gracious me. Was I raving?

729
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:24,021
Please forgive me.

730
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:27,151
I'm mad.

731
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,360
Let's see...

732
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,701
where was I?

733
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:40,502
Oh, yes! The master.

734
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,856
He was kind, you see.

735
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:49,361
He brought me to our mutual
acquaintance, Father Karras.

736
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:53,115
Not too well at the time.
I'm afraid he...

737
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:57,828
was passing on in the
dying mode, as we say.

738
01:21:57,829 --> 01:22:00,103
So...

739
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:05,753
as Karras was about to
slip out of his body...

740
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,047
Is this true?

741
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:12,927
The master was slipping me in.

742
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:18,140
There was some confusion when the
medics said that Karras was dead.

743
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:21,811
He was dead, technically speaking.

744
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:25,356
His time was up.

745
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:30,820
He wanted out. But I was in.

746
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:37,243
A little traumatized, true.
After all, his brain was jelly.

747
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:42,123
Lack of oxygen and that
sort of thing. You understand?

748
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:46,293
It took a maximum effort...

749
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:51,924
that at last got me out of
that cheap little coffin!

750
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,845
Vow of poverty, disgusting.

751
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,285
Never mind.

752
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:03,769
Toward the end, a little slapstick...

753
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:07,148
and comic relief when
old Brother Fain...

754
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:12,257
who was tending the body,
saw me climbing from the coffin.

755
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,740
It's the smiles that keep us going.

756
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:21,328
The giggles and bits of good cheer.

757
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:28,349
But then, after that, it was all blue
Mondays for a while, I'm afraid.

758
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:34,675
So much damage to
Karras' brain cells.

759
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,911
So many lost.

760
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:44,143
It's not enough, you see,
to be a spirit.

761
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,353
There's no magic.

762
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:49,690
In this artificial box
you call a world...

763
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:53,611
we can't touch,
except through bodies.

764
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:58,616
We must operate through neurologic
systems, brains that function...

765
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:03,037
and your friend's was
nearly past resurrection.

766
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:08,250
It was quite an effort to regenerate
his puny little brain cells.

767
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:13,990
It took me 15 years!

768
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,984
So many years.

769
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:26,081
Now I'm just a traveling man.

770
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,293
One who moves.

771
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:39,740
I have dreams of a rose.

772
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:45,302
And falling down a
long flight of stairs.

773
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:52,735
I don't believe you're
the Gemini Killer.

774
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:58,926
You are issuing a clear
invitation to the dance.

775
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:03,194
- What does that mean?
- Never mind.

776
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:07,476
Incidentally, don't blame
me for that idiot Temple.

777
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:12,440
That was a suicide. The man
was a lunatic weakling.

778
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,901
Still, he helped me.

779
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,469
Are there services?
I would like to attend.

780
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:25,933
- Temple helped you?
- Of course! He brought you to me.

781
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:31,834
I told him if he failed to
convince you to come to me...

782
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:35,838
that he would suffer
in unspeakable ways.

783
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:41,010
"Pain that cannot be
imagined," I said.

784
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:46,682
Poor superstitious fool, he believed me.
But he couldn't take the pressure.

785
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:51,579
- What pressure?
- The pressure of inimitable me.

786
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:58,110
Some other tasks I said
I had in mind for him.

787
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:01,631
Things. Little things.

788
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:06,594
Did Temple get you out of this cell?

789
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,479
Who gets you out?

790
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,359
Just friends.

791
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:25,365
Old friends.

792
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:38,400
Tell the press...

793
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:43,594
that I am the Gemini, lieutenant.
Final warning.

794
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:51,307
- Incidentally, I can help.
- Help what?

795
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:57,684
Your unbelief.

796
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,070
I'm tired.

797
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:05,618
I am so tired.

798
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:12,291
Bill, help me.

799
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,723
- Damien?
- No!

800
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:47,535
Little Jack Horner.

801
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,331
Child's play, lieutenant.

802
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,272
Father Morning, please.

803
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,483
Jim, I can't read this.

804
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:03,402
Korner. K-O-R-N-E-R.

805
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,404
I'll call again.

806
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,448
See you later, alligator.

807
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:10,785
Sweetheart, let's go
back to your room.

808
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:13,746
Take your time.

809
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:15,748
That's it.

810
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,391
Take it easy.

811
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:24,777
<i>- How do you get out of here?
- Old friends.</i>

812
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,325
<i>Old friends.</i>

813
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,805
<i>I'm a traveling man. One who moves.</i>

814
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:36,247
<i>Old friends. One who moves.
One who moves...</i>

815
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:50,468
I didn't hear it.
Say it again, will you?

816
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,640
- Hit the light!
- Mommy!

817
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:41,435
God almighty! What are
you doing? Are you crazy?

818
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,813
What is the matter with you?!

819
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,607
- I want my mommy.
- Just toys.

820
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,359
Is that a crime?!

821
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,656
- He's after someone. Who?
- You treat your own family like this?!

822
01:30:53,657 --> 01:31:00,287
Aren't you leaving?! Please leave!
I cannot wait for you to leave!

823
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:05,417
You are issuing a clear
invitation to the dance.

824
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:09,152
<i>- To the dance. To the dance...</i>
- Julie.

825
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:19,616
Bill. Hi, honey. Where..?

826
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:32,548
Okay, sweetheart.

827
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,842
That was Bill. A nurse is
coming over with a package.

828
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:53,066
Danny, get in the car!
Roll it! Move it! Go!

829
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:45,743
Go around!

830
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:52,625
Ram it if you have to!
Back up, you son of a..! Get out!

831
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,148
That must be the nurse.

832
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:38,292
Go around the back!

833
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:54,978
- Hi, Dad. Mother, Daddy's home.
- What's this?

834
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:59,467
Billy, what's going on?

835
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:03,179
- I'm crazy. That's the explanation.
- You're honest.

836
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,723
- From the beginning.
- It's fine.

837
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:09,685
No, it isn't.
What's this nurse thing?

838
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:12,659
- What nurse?
- I'm so tired.

839
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:16,166
- Julie!
- Dad, I'm talking.

840
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:18,736
- Sorry, I missed that.
- Bill...

841
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:24,428
what kind of nurse is this? I open
the door for the woman, she faints.

842
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:30,011
And then when she wakes up,
she says, "When is it bedtime?"

843
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,776
Please help me.

844
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,379
Is it bedtime?

845
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,651
So is she staying for dinner?

846
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,991
It's okay.

847
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:54,005
Catatonics are so easy to possess.

848
01:34:55,023 --> 01:35:00,714
I've been waiting for you, lieutenant.
I wanted you to see this.

849
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,300
Julie!

850
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,719
Daddy!

851
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:17,193
Oh, my God! Grandma!

852
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,554
What's this?

853
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:31,284
Morning!

854
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:06,886
You again.

855
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:10,139
You've interrupted me.

856
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:13,768
Have you come to save God's servant?

857
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:18,731
Well, I must save mine.
My son, the Gemini.

858
01:36:18,732 --> 01:36:23,068
He has work to do. Much more.

859
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:27,156
But come in, Father Morning.

860
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:29,514
Enter, night.

861
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:35,062
This time you're going to lose.

862
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:55,351
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

863
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:58,503
and of the Holy Spirit.

864
01:36:58,939 --> 01:37:01,212
Amen!

865
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:11,742
"Save your servant who
trusts in you, my God.

866
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:18,810
Let him find in you, Lord, a fortified
tower in the face of the enemy."

867
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:23,337
"Our Father, who art in heaven...

868
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,923
hallowed be thy name.

869
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:28,300
Thy kingdom come.

870
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:32,948
- Thy will be done..."
- I see, we are praying now.

871
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:39,702
Bright prayers. Do you think they
will save you now, as before?

872
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:42,731
Well, I can pray too.

873
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:47,361
You feel my little orisons
creeping up your spine?

874
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:54,034
The sweaty murmurs of my rosary beads.
The human hearts I've taken into hell.

875
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:57,997
"I cast you out, unclean spirit!

876
01:37:57,998 --> 01:38:03,419
Along with every satanic power of
the enemy! Every specter from hell.

877
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:07,715
In the name of
our Lord, Jesus Christ.

878
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:13,323
It is he who commands you.
He who stilled the sea and the storm.

879
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:20,705
He who flung you from heaven to
the depths of hell! You robber of life.

880
01:38:20,771 --> 01:38:24,273
You author of pain.

881
01:38:24,274 --> 01:38:29,111
You corruptor of justice,
and innocence, and youth.

882
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:32,364
You begetter of death.

883
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:36,514
Sworn enemy of all the human race!"

884
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:51,317
I command you.

885
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,721
Allerton?

886
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:39,703
Nurse...

887
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:28,086
Don't worry about Julie.
We'll get her.

888
01:40:40,076 --> 01:40:43,513
Pray for me, Damien.

889
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:46,847
You're free.

890
01:40:55,008 --> 01:40:58,943
Did you think to save
your friend the priest?

891
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:03,955
My God, help!

892
01:41:05,936 --> 01:41:10,630
- Help me.
- Have I helped your unbelief?

893
01:41:10,941 --> 01:41:13,333
Oh, yes.

894
01:41:15,028 --> 01:41:17,919
Yes, I believe.

895
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:22,093
I believe in death.

896
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:26,264
I believe in disease.

897
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:33,212
I believe in injustice
and inhumanity.

898
01:41:33,213 --> 01:41:39,200
And torture, and anger and hate.

899
01:41:39,678 --> 01:41:45,266
I believe in murder!
I believe in pain!

900
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:51,088
I believe in cruelty and infidelity!

901
01:41:52,566 --> 01:41:58,195
I believe in slime and stink...

902
01:41:58,196 --> 01:42:02,032
and in every crawling,
putrid thing...

903
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:05,369
every possible ugliness...

904
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:10,124
and corruption! You son of a bitch!

905
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:13,810
I believe...

906
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:19,825
in you.

907
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:19,878
My God!

908
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:28,886
Bill.

909
01:43:29,538 --> 01:43:33,040
My God!

910
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:38,379
You grow tiresome,
lieutenant. And foolish.

911
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:44,176
Save your prayers.
God is not here with us now.

912
01:43:44,177 --> 01:43:50,283
There is only the darkness here.
And your death.

913
01:43:51,935 --> 01:43:54,812
Save your servant...

914
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:59,045
who trusts in you, my God.

915
01:43:59,192 --> 01:44:04,550
- You!
- Damien, fight him.

916
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:07,843
- Goodbye, lieutenant.
- Damien!

917
01:44:08,702 --> 01:44:10,382
Fight!

918
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:15,499
- Fight!
- You cannot win.

919
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:20,977
- He dies.
- No!

920
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:26,612
Bill, now! Shoot now! Kill me now!

921
01:44:43,695 --> 01:44:46,254
We won...

922
01:44:47,783 --> 01:44:49,909
Bill.

923
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:52,931
Now, free me.
