00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,826
-Hello.
-Do you live here?

3
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,495
Nobody lives here.

4
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,002
-Where's Freddy?
-Heh, heh. He's not home.

5
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,636
<i>One, two, Freddy's coming for you</i>

6
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,932
<i>Three, four, better lock your door</i>

7
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,437
<i>Five, six, grab your crucifix</i>

8
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,424
Be calm, Kristen.

9
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:38,254
Joey! Kincaid! Help me!

10
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,478
Oh, shit, Kristen. Not again.

11
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,565
-I'm sorry, Kincaid.
-Sorry?

12
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,108
You are one spooked chick.

13
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,240
Joey.

14
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,369
- Thank God. I thought for a minute--
What?

15
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,788
-Dragging us in here?
-Yeah. Cut it out.

16
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,833
You're putting one serious dent
in my beauty sleep.

17
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,170
It's Freddy. He's here. I heard him.

18
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,799
Freddy is dead, buried and consecrated.
We won, remember?

19
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,552
- He's coming back for us.
- Kincaid's right.

20
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,307
Fred Krueger's history. Come here.

21
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:38,647
The pipes are cold. The boiler is cold.
See for yourself.

22
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,325
I don't know.

23
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,485
How are you, Mr. Johnson?

24
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,447
That's nice.

25
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,827
Hi, Kristen.
Rick will be out any second.

26
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,290
-You going out dressed like that?
-What's wrong with it this time?

27
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,376
-I might just wait by the car.
-Me too.

28
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,427
Something wrong with the stairs?
- It's Avoid All Contact Day.

29
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,262
What?

30
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,015
Whoa.

31
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:42,104
When Dad's popping aspirin like popcorn,
it's Avoid All Contact Day.

32
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,942
Waiting for a limo?

33
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,112
I'm off to the club, honey.

34
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,577
Let's go.

35
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,546
All right,
anybody have trig this semester?

36
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,841
-What happened?
-I had a conflict. Homework or Dynasty?

37
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,551
And, uh, Dynasty won.

38
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,678
Sad story. Soaps will kill you.

39
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,892
Mm. There's Dan Jordan.

40
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,648
Mm. We are talking
one major league hunk.

41
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,156
You know,
you are one major league hunk.

42
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,994
- Heh. Thanks, Alice.
- Earth to Alice.

43
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,124
-Earth to Alice. Hey, you spacing again?
-Rick, please.

44
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,211
Well, tell you what, he's a friend of mine.
I'll introduce you.

45
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,257
-Rick.
-Just kidding. But I would introduce her.

46
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,468
All right. I think I see salvation.

47
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,482
How can you ride this health hazard?
It's no wonder that you have asthma.

48
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,610
No, you see,
asthma is an inherited condition.

49
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,321
Read a book now and then,
you might know something.

50
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,991
You know, speaking of books,
isn't trig your favorite?

51
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,952
Dynasty again?

52
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,665
Deb, do us a favor and get a VCR.

53
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,461
Hey, baby, you're sucking
on the wrong nozzle.

54
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,713
Hey, yo, needle dick.

55
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,465
I bet you're the only male in this school
suffering from penis envy.

56
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,763
I owe you one.

57
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,642
Ew! Ew! Ew!

58
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,728
-So disgusting.
-Hey, super girl, it's dead.

59
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,813
Give a bug a break.

60
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,581
Hi, guys.

61
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,251
Hi, guys? That's all you have to say
after last night?

62
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,087
You better be careful.
I'm telling you, he's coming back.

63
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,091
Listen, you got this freak-o talent
to bring folks into your dream...

64
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,968
...but we don't need it anymore.

65
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,638
- Time to start living like regular people.
- Yeah. Let it rest. I mean...

66
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,684
...did it ever occur to you that if you keep
going in, you might stir him up again?

67
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,269
Look, we'll help you.

68
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,313
We all have better things
to dream about.

69
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,274
You got that right. Signed and sealed.

70
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,110
-Then what about this?
-That don't mean dick.

71
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,406
My dog is like me. Drag him
into your crazy dream, and he gets wild.

72
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,285
Here comes your boyfriend.
Can he give you a good night's sleep?

73
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,787
We don't kiss and tell.
How about you?

74
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,001
-Look, we'll talk later, all right?
-Okay.

75
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,465
Those guys are kind of spooky.

76
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,303
-Then you must think I'm a total freak.
-I go back and forth.

77
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,348
Hey, lighten up. No one died.

78
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,796
Hi, Dad.

79
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,804
Looking for something?

80
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,890
Shithead.

81
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,234
I'm late. I know.

82
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,695
Damn contracts.

83
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,906
Let's eat.

84
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,619
-You know, we waited a long time.
-And we gave up, as usual.

85
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,335
You call this vegetation a meal
after a ten-hour workday?

86
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,254
What the hell am l, a rabbit?

87
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,966
Christ, Alice, try to think a little more.

88
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,224
Yeah, I can think.
I can think of how sick I am...

89
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,978
...of watching you drink your life away
and taking it out on me.

90
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:20,275
Alice, Alice, I'm talking to you.
Are you awake or what?

91
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,070
- Dad, don't start.
- Start what?

92
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,614
Telling the little daydreamer to wake up?

93
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,616
It's long overdue.

94
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,328
I don't need this aggravation.

95
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:15,163
Jason. Come on, boy. Come on.
Come on. That's a boy.

96
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,749
You almost scared me, boy.

97
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,230
Yo, open this sucker up!

98
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,024
Damn.

99
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,408
This ain't my dreamland.

100
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,703
Kristen!

101
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,122
If you're here,
I'm gonna pound your ass!

102
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,291
Jason.

103
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,358
Jason?

104
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,190
Fucking A.

105
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:27,689
You shouldn't have buried me.
I'm not dead.

106
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:12,067
Yeah!

107
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,486
Take that, motherfucker!

108
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,068
Kristen, Freddy's back!

109
00:19:55,236 --> 00:20:01,867
Freddy's back! Freddy's back!
Freddy's back!

110
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,458
I'll see you in hell.

111
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,794
Tell them Freddy sent you.

112
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,636
One down, two to go.

113
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,741
<i>MTV in stereo defies the mind.</i>

114
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,746
<i>Illusions of space through sound.</i>

115
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,752
<i>There may be teardrops to shed</i>

116
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,049
<i>I'm coming in from the cold</i>

117
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,886
<i>I watch MTV every morning</i>
<i>when I get up for a couple of hours.</i>

118
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,890
<i>And then right around breakfast time,</i>
<i>you know, I watch a little bit more.</i>

119
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:54,270
<i>Then about lunch when I feed the fish,</i>
<i>you know, I feed the fish and watch them...</i>

120
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,635
Wait.

121
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,769
How's this for a wet dream?

122
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,068
Kristen! Help!

123
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,539
- Joey.
- No!

124
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,971
Hi, guys.

125
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,129
Sort of defeats the purpose, don't it?

126
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,340
-What?
-The mirror.

127
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,634
You can't see yourself in it.

128
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,302
I don't want to.

129
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,099
You know, if Mom was still alive...

130
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,060
...Dad wouldn't treat us like this.

131
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,438
Alice, you gotta learn
to stand up for yourself.

132
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,191
You know, fight back.

133
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,694
Like that. It's all in the mind.

134
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,032
You see yourself doing something
and your body reacts and does it. Like so:

135
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,661
-Like that. Now you do it.
-Me? No, I can't.

136
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,746
-Yeah, yeah, you can.
-No, I can't.

137
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,542
Yes, yes, yes, you can.
Just get up there and just... .

138
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,837
Like that. Big and strong. Do it.

139
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:31,344
Good, good.
But, Alice-san, you must have balance.

140
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,180
Okay. So go to it.

141
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,606
Swish. Killed a fish.

142
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:44,816
Joey.

143
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,318
<i>You know, I watch it for a little bit more.</i>

144
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,197
<i>Then about lunch, when I feed the fish,</i>
<i>you know, I feed the fish and watch...</i>

145
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,994
Joey, I'm getting tired
of picking up your clothes.

146
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,789
And this crap,
I wish you'd turn it off.

147
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,669
Joey.

148
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,402
Here you are.

149
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,155
Where were you this morning?
Rick's looking all over.

150
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,033
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid?
I can't find them anywhere.

151
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,411
-I'm sure they're around.
-Yeah, well, I'm not so sure.

152
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,791
We have matching luggage again.

153
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,922
-The bags under your eyes. Nightmares?
-Yeah.

154
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,757
God, I hate dreaming.

155
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,762
Mm, I love to dream.
I just hate the ones about my Dad.

156
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,764
How do you handle your nightmares?

157
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,975
My Mom taught me when I was little.

158
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,686
Did you ever hear of the dream master?

159
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,440
-Sounds like a game show host to me.
-No, it's a rhyme.

160
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:12,237
Just have to dream about someplace fun.
Remember, you're in control.

161
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,824
How do you know
so much about dreams?

162
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,079
Well, when it's all you have,
you kind of become an expert.

163
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,126
We better get going
before your brother starts a search party.

164
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,967
Anyway, Kafka and Goethe
have never been irreconcilable to me.

165
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,927
Kris, where were you?

166
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,848
Kincaid, Joey. No.

167
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,435
-Hey, what?
-He killed them!

168
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,021
-What? Wait. Calm down.
-No.

169
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,916
Feeling better now?

170
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,502
Yeah, I guess so.

171
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,132
What happened?

172
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,342
You had quite a nasty bump.

173
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,681
-I gotta get out of here!
-No, no, no. You stay put.

174
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,474
You need your rest.

175
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,020
You don't get it. He's after me.

176
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,188
Shh, shh, shh.

177
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,066
It's okay, honey.

178
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:45,038
-I wanna draw some blood.
-No!

179
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,916
No!

180
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,086
Feeling better now?

181
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,255
What happened?

182
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,758
You had quite a nasty bump.

183
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,615
<i>I wanna be your pride and joy</i>

184
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,911
<i>Won't you treat me like a little toy</i>

185
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,456
You seen Rick around?

186
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,752
-No.
-Well, you are his sister, right?

187
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,049
Um, Rick stayed late after school.
Kristen wasn't feeling very well.

188
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,676
Could you tell him I'm looking for him?

189
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,221
Oh, by the way, I'm Dan.

190
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,230
Sorry, Alice. Your shift's over.
My table now.

191
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,819
Hi, guys. Hi, Dan.
How you doing?

192
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,155
Hi. Um, can I get just a Coke
and some fries?

193
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,325
Do you wanna hear our specials
or do you want any dessert?

194
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,661
Oh, hi, handsome. Care for some buns?

195
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,206
Here. You in a hurry?

196
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,543
I gotta get to the library
before it closes. Killer physics test.

197
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,129
I know. I hardly have any time to study.

198
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,297
Maybe you shouldn't
be working here so much.

199
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,342
You don't wanna get stuck
waiting tables the rest of your life.

200
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,554
I know. It's my greatest fear.

201
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,515
You know, he is so cute.

202
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,184
-I wonder where he works out?
-Save it, Deb.

203
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,311
I mean, there is life after exercise.

204
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,690
One of these days,
I'm gonna set you up with a real guy...

205
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,942
...teach you
to get your priorities straight.

206
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,695
I think Sheila's more interested
in dissecting bodies...

207
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,197
-...than looking at the outside.
-Give her time.

208
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,366
Her hormones will kick in some day.

209
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,870
Deb, you know, later in life,
you're gonna appreciate my motto.

210
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,665
-What's that?
-Mind over matter.

211
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,210
- Look, I'll see you later, okay? Bye.
- Bye.

212
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,796
-Bye, Alice.
-Bye.

213
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,802
- Alice, can you leave here?
- What's wrong?

214
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,846
Kincaid and Joey died last night.

215
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,473
-What?
-Yeah.

216
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,892
- Hey, Rick. Rick!
- Yeah.

217
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,060
Stay with her.

218
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,855
Kristen, what happened?

219
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,149
Look, you're gonna hear
all kinds of stories.

220
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,652
And after all
we've been through together...

221
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,447
...how could I let him get to them?

222
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,866
We were a team.

223
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,286
-I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.
-Who?

224
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,956
Rick, we gotta go.

225
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,166
- Now.
- I'm coming.

226
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,877
I'll be right back.
- Before it's too late.

227
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,922
I gotta go. I guess I'll talk to you later.
- Come on.

228
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,438
So, uh, why the haunted house?

229
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:03,069
It's not just a house. It's his home.

230
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,446
And he's waiting in there
for me to dream.

231
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,949
Hey, it's okay. We're with you.

232
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,617
I told you, you can't help me.

233
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,203
This isn't a normal nightmare.

234
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,414
I'm history.

235
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,125
I don't get it.

236
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,878
Come on.
- What'd I miss?

237
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,589
She told us a story about Freddy.

238
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,467
Fred Krueger. He's a town legend.

239
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,887
He was a child killer
freed on a technicality.

240
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,100
-So?
-So a lot of parents got pissed off.

241
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,477
And according to Kris...

242
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,648
...they hunted him down and roasted him
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

243
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,983
Nice neighborhood.

244
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,777
Yeah. Anyway, that's where it gets weird.

245
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,822
Um, she says
that he comes back in dreams.

246
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,909
And if he kills you in your dream,
you're dead for real.

247
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,957
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep</i>

248
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,919
<i>The master of dreams, my soul I'll keep</i>

249
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,672
Dream master.
I think I remember the rhyme.

250
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,470
Kristen, get the hell away
from that house!

251
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:22,148
Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to go
if you don't want to. I'll take care of you.

252
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,527
-I better go.
-Okay.

253
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,196
But I'll call you tonight,
and we'll get through this.

254
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,532
-Okay.
-Okay. Bye.

255
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,326
Bye.

256
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,336
Alice.

257
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,505
Shotgun.

258
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,229
Something the matter with the cuisine?

259
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,231
Well, Mom, I'll tell you.

260
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,777
When two of your friends die
in the same day...

261
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,029
...let me know
what it does to your appetite.

262
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:14,075
You're tired. Don't think I haven't noticed
that you haven't been sleeping.

263
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,328
That has got to stop, honey.

264
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:29,131
-What's wrong with me?
-Adolescent anxiety. That'll make it better.

265
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,266
-Oh, God. Mom, what did you do?
-Oh, Christ!

266
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,814
Jesus, sleeping pills?

267
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,444
-Look, Kristen, I'm sorry. I'm just--
-Sorry?

268
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,573
Sorry that you and your tennis pals
torched this guy, and now he's after me?

269
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,910
In case you haven't been keeping score...

270
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,539
...it's his fucking banquet,
and I'm the last course!

271
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,375
Kristen, we went over this in therapy!

272
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,629
No, mother. You just murdered me.

273
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,007
-Take that to your goddamn therapy.
-Kristen!

274
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,930
Kristen.

275
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,520
Kristen?

276
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,424
Alice.

277
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,512
Alice. Alice.

278
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,350
Dream someplace fun.
Dream someplace fun.

279
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,770
Dream some... .

280
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,581
Thanks, Alice.

281
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,043
Hi, little girl.

282
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,378
Hi.

283
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,548
-What's your name?
-Alice.

284
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,217
I have a friend named Alice.

285
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,435
No! No!

286
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:37,087
Elm Street's last brat. Farewell.

287
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:42,676
-We beat you before!
-And now you're all alone.

288
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,513
Kristen, why don't you, uh...

289
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,559
...call on one of your little friends?
Maybe they could help.

290
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,521
Never! I'm the last!

291
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,442
Why don't you reach out
and touch someone?

292
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,693
No!

293
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,822
No! No!

294
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:10,037
No.

295
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,288
Alice!

296
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,588
How sweet!

297
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,590
Fresh meat.

298
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,847
Alice, wake up and get out!

299
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,309
Alice, I'm so sorry. It was a mistake.

300
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,228
I pulled you in.

301
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,147
Alice, come to Daddy.

302
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,692
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch!

303
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,029
Now no one sleeps.

304
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,073
No!

305
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,788
The souls of my children.

306
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,540
Alice!

307
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,918
You'll need my power.

308
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,538
- Are you okay?
- Kristen.

309
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,125
Kristen, we've gotta get to her house.

310
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,095
Kristen!

311
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,857
Oh, God! Kristen! Oh, God!

312
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,234
Let me go.
- No. Rick.

313
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,255
<i>Hi, Alice. Wish you were here.</i>

314
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,759
- Hi, Alice.
<i>- Your brother's up to his old tricks.</i>

315
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>Rick, as long as I've known you,</i>
<i>I've always wanted to ask...</i>

316
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,640
<i>...what the hell this shit is</i>
<i>that you put in your hair?</i>

317
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,267
<i>- Rick, tell us about your sex life.</i>
- Oh, no. Don't.

318
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,977
- Come on. Sorry.
- We can't.

319
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,938
- Come on.
<i>- No. What are you doing?</i>

320
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,024
<i>- I told you. I want his body.</i>
<i>- Oh, that's bullshit.</i>

321
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,860
<i>-What else do you want?</i>
<i>-She wants my body.</i>

322
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,403
<i>Kristen's my only friend.</i>

323
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,365
<i>- She's my only friend.</i>
<i>- Excuse me. I would like...</i>

324
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,076
Alice, what are you doing?

325
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,162
I don't know.

326
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,540
<i>See you later, bye.</i>

327
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,376
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

328
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,669
It makes me feel better.

329
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,130
<i>Hit it. Hit the ball,</i>
<i>everything will be great.</i>

330
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,423
<i>- I'm gonna hurt somebody.</i>
- Hit it.

331
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,842
<i>What are you doing?</i>

332
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,970
<i>-Hello, baby.</i>
<i>-Great.</i>

333
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,098
You made her so happy then.

334
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:21,061
Yeah. Until all this Freddy shit.

335
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,649
-Why didn't I just stay with her?
-It wouldn't have made any difference.

336
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,693
Sure it would have.

337
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,528
No.

338
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,239
I saw it happen in my dream.

339
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,786
-And there was this horrible man.
-Oh, who? Freddy?

340
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,080
Freddy? I don't wanna
hear about Freddy, okay?

341
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,791
Heard it all from Kristen.
I don't wanna hear any more.

342
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,128
I could smell the smoke.

343
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,589
I could feel the heat from the fire.

344
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,382
-It wasn't a dream!
-Just stop it!

345
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:56,346
She wasn't crazy and neither are you,
so just cut it out. Please.

346
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,225
Jeez, why are you acting this way?

347
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,438
I don't know, Rick.

348
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,565
I just feel so different.

349
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,990
Something happened in the dream.

350
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:19,912
And now it's like part of her is with me.

351
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,874
<i>Okay.</i>

352
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,294
<i>- Miss Kristen Parker. Oh, my.</i>
- I love you too.

353
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,630
<i>Bye, everyone.</i>

354
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,301
Phew, girl, I am so dead on my feet.

355
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,136
We have matching luggage.

356
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,973
-What do you mean?
-You didn't sleep last night?

357
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,850
It's that obvious, huh?

358
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,435
Then you saw him too.

359
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,606
Saw who? I mean, I was up all night
cramming for that physics test.

360
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,735
Oh! And I put this little baby together.

361
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,821
You know how Deb's afraid of bugs.
Well, I made it for her.

362
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,157
Ultra-high soundwaves.

363
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,534
Make them run,
screaming their antennas off.

364
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,288
Look, I'll see you in class, okay?

365
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,803
I don't smoke.

366
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,028
All right, you've got 40 minutes.

367
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,032
So good luck and go for it.

368
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:13,418
- Alice. Help me. Help! Wake up! Wake up!
- Help! Help!

369
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,795
Wake up, damn it!

370
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,351
-Wanna suck face?
-No.

371
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,400
Sheila, wake up!

372
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,361
Sheila!

373
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,115
You flunked.

374
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,661
Sheila.

375
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,499
Sheila. Give her her thing.

376
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,051
Didn't you see it? He was here.

377
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,512
Alice, what are you talking about?
- He was here!

378
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,992
Out of the way, please.

379
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,579
- Step back please. Stand back.
- Step back.

380
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,252
Asthma attacked?

381
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,421
I got it.

382
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:27,677
What 17-year-old has fatal asthma?
God, she was gonna be a doctor.

383
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,847
-It was Freddy.
-Enough with that crap.

384
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,267
I saw it. It was my dream.

385
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,770
I brought Sheila in.

386
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,941
Oh, God.

387
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,902
I brought Sheila in
like Kristen did with me.

388
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:50,158
No, don't. I gave Sheila to him.
And now she's dead.

389
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:57,582
Hey, Rick, I really think Kristen's story
is getting to her.

390
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,502
Dan, I really don't know if it's a story.

391
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,923
Look at us.
We're dropping off like flies here.

392
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,463
- Good to see you. Take care. Bye.
- Bye.

393
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,215
Come on.

394
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:59,894
<i>I can't wait to see you</i>
<i>Your picture ain't enough</i>

395
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:06,693
<i>I can't wait to touch you</i>
<i>ln the flesh</i>

396
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,867
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get a pack of gum?

397
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,706
Hey. Where you been?
I haven't seen you around lately.

398
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,416
I've been working double shifts.

399
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,668
Guess you need the extra money, huh?

400
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:28,381
Look, you know why.
You just don't wanna believe me.

401
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,552
Don't you understand?

402
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,554
I can't sleep.

403
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,222
Someone might die.

404
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:46,358
<i>Met you with a girlfriend</i>
<i>You were so divine</i>

405
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:51,112
Alice, let's say that, uh, this is real, right?

406
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,948
Why, uh, all of a sudden
is this Freddy guy after you?

407
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:05,168
Kristen was the last child left
of the people who killed Freddy.

408
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,090
Maybe Freddy can't get to the new kids.. .

409
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,384
...unless there's someone
to bring them to him.

410
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,140
Danny, we're gonna be late
for the drive-in.

411
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,310
I have to get back.

412
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:27,273
Uh, I guess I'll see you later.

413
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:36,032
<i>'Cause if you say hello</i>
<i>It'll mean you wanna see me</i>

414
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,743
<i>ln the flesh</i>

415
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,329
Ninety-three days
till summer vacation, man.

416
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,082
-What's the matter, you tired?
-No, I'm getting worried.

417
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,961
Let's see if we can make it until summer.
It's like open season around here.

418
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,046
Pretty weird stuff.

419
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,633
Speaking of weird,
you gotta feel for that guy.

420
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,760
Dead girlfriend,
basket case for a sister--

421
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,722
Why don't you learn to shut up, asshole?

422
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,143
-God, what a dick.
-I know.

423
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,396
-You look wasted, man.
-I've been up with Alice.

424
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,983
Hey, how's she doing?
I, uh, saw her last night at the diner.

425
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,318
She's blaming herself for Sheila.

426
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,531
I know how she feels.
I mean, I think about Kristen all the time.

427
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:20,493
You know, maybe I could have stopped it
if I'd have listened.

428
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,705
-You mean, uh, Freddy?
-What else?

429
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,751
You ever take a look at our town's history?
It's not a safe place to be a teenager.

430
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,337
Hey, bozos, let's hustle. Now.

431
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,092
Well, if I'm next, watch your back, man.

432
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,187
Where were we?

433
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,317
Every society
dating back to the ancients...

434
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,944
...has had theories regarding dreams...

435
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,448
...what they mean, how to control them.

436
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,036
Aristotle believed that during sleep,
your soul roams free.

437
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,704
What it sees are dreams.

438
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,916
The skilled dreamers, well,
they are able to control what they see.

439
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,127
There is a myth that there's two gates
your soul can enter.

440
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,005
One is a positive gate...

441
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,007
...the other, a negative gate.

442
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,344
The key element
is that there's a dream master.. .

443
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:23,848
...someone who guards the positive gate
and, in fact, protects the sleeping host.

444
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,976
Taken altogether,
they offer a fascinating perspective...

445
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,770
...on ancient history.

446
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:31,231
Now those of you
who don't find it fascinating...

447
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,150
...you better listen up,
because it's gonna be on the final.

448
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:11,563
Rick, make me laugh.

449
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,611
<i>Going down.</i>

450
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,856
What?

451
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,830
<i>A true warrior needs no eyes.</i>

452
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,840
Come on out and fight me,
you chickenshit.

453
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,685
<i>Ninja warriors have calm.</i>

454
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,730
<i>Find your balance, Rick.</i>

455
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:41,235
Too wimpy to show yourself, Krueger?

456
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,865
Well, how's this for balance?

457
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,625
Yes.

458
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,805
How you gonna fight me
without your weapon, Freddy?

459
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,855
<i>Sayonara, Rick-san!</i>

460
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,902
No!

461
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:34,664
...through the valley of the
shadow of death, I shall fear no evil...

462
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,542
...for thou art with me
with thy rod and thy staff...

463
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:43,756
Dearly bereaved, we gather here in remorse
for Rick Johnson.

464
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,468
A young man whose death
confounds and mystifies us...

465
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,222
...for Rick was in his prime,
beloved by all...

466
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,182
...exemplary of young men's ideals...

467
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,727
...and of strong moral fiber.

468
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,439
We grieve our loss,
but take comfort in knowing such a man...

469
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,607
...rests in the kingdom of God.

470
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,068
Let our faith supersede our knowledge...

471
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,780
...for truly the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

472
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,036
Hello, baby.

473
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,627
I love this.

474
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,091
They think I'm dead, don't they?

475
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,677
This is great.

476
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,639
Hey. What's with the tears?

477
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,143
I wouldn't leave you. Come on, don't cry.

478
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,813
I'm here. It was a joke.
A big joke to fool Freddy.

479
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,775
Come on, smile for me.

480
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,069
No more daydreams.

481
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,655
Well, gotta go.

482
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,166
Good night.

483
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,379
Alice. You okay?

484
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,800
Not really.

485
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,762
Is there anything we can do?

486
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,722
I don't think so.

487
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,268
I guess this is my own war.

488
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,729
No. No, it's not.

489
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,399
We all have to survive.

490
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,777
I mean, look,
I don't spend hours working out...

491
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,571
...to let some night stalker beat me.

492
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,032
You don't really get it.

493
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,660
He's not a night stalker.

494
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,540
And it'll take more than bench presses
to beat him.

495
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,251
So, what do we do?
- Let's go over to Debbie's tonight.

496
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,753
- We have to make a plan.
- Alice!

497
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,714
I gotta go.

498
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,343
-How about I pick you up at the diner at 8?
-Uh, yeah.

499
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,221
Here. It's a good luck charm.

500
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,057
Brings bad luck to the creep
you flatten with it.

501
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,309
This is it.

502
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,522
Mind over matter.

503
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,949
Mind over matter?

504
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,328
Sheila used to say that.

505
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,748
God, every day, she changes.

506
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,959
No.

507
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,211
It's after every death.

508
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,831
What's happening to me?

509
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,464
Alice, where are you going?

510
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,049
Just to see Debbie.

511
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,968
No, you're not.

512
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:01,722
I want you to stay in.

513
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,558
Dad, I gotta go,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

514
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,477
Alice.

515
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,396
Alice.

516
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:14,193
-No.
-You have no right to stop me.

517
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,782
If you just knew what was going on... .

518
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,286
I know very much what's going on
with you and your friends.

519
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:27,999
Yeah. Everybody thinks they know,
but they don't.

520
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,126
Look at me, Alice.

521
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,380
I lost Rick because I didn't watch him.

522
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,507
I don't wanna lose you.

523
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,759
We're all we have.

524
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,920
All the towns in America...

525
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:18,007
...and I gotta move
to the Bermuda Triangle.

526
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,176
That's great.

527
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,738
<i>I want your hands on me</i>

528
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,977
Dan?

529
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,324
- Oh, no.
<i>- Jimmy. Jimmy.</i>

530
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,034
<i>There you are, ma'am.</i>

531
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,953
<i>Hey, he ain't no paperman.</i>

532
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,372
<i>Why, don't you know him?</i>
<i>That's Hot Fingers Curly.</i>

533
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,666
<i>Boy, he really swings out</i>
<i>hopping with a jive.</i>

534
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:18,043
<i>-Do you want to dance?</i>
<i>-Do l?</i>

535
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,795
No!

536
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,041
What will it be?

537
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:08,547
Come on, honey.
I don't wanna be here forever.

538
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:17,056
If the food don't kill you, the service will.

539
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,183
Help us, Alice!

540
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:23,479
- Mm! The usual.
- No!

541
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,606
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

542
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:27,191
My favorite.

543
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,110
-No! Come on, no!
-Eeney, meeney, miney...

544
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,696
- Come on, no!
- ...moe.

545
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,660
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

546
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,953
Rick, you little meatball.

547
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:43,040
-I love soul food.
-No, no.

548
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,416
Stop!

549
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,377
Mm!

550
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,385
Bring me more.

551
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,437
Your shift is over.

552
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:28,293
<i>I want you to come and please me</i>

553
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:35,843
<i>Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me</i>
<i>Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me</i>

554
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,514
Come on. We have to hurry.

555
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,725
-What's going on?
-I'm driving.

556
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,736
He's going after Debbie.
I gotta stop him.

557
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,321
We gotta stop him.
I'm with you on this thing.

558
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,824
I wanna help you.
I'm on your side, okay?

559
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,493
<i>I want you to love me</i>
<i>And just touch me</i>

560
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,037
<i>Put your hands</i>
<i>Put your hands on me</i>

561
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:08,500
<i>Put your hands on me</i>
<i>Put your hands on me</i>

562
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:13,797
<i>Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me</i>
<i>Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me</i>

563
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,134
Here we are.

564
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,227
Come on. We have to hurry.

565
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,521
-What's going on?
-I'm driving.

566
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:41,033
<i>Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me</i>

567
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:51,418
-I don't believe in you.
-I believe in you.

568
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,474
No pain...

569
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,309
...no gain.

570
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,776
He's going after Debbie.
I gotta stop him.

571
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,222
Help me!

572
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,525
Here we are.

573
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,324
Come on. We have to hurry.

574
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,743
-What's going on?
-I'm driving.

575
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,502
He's going after Debbie.
I gotta stop him.

576
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:19,423
You know, I got the weirdest feeling
we've done this before.

577
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,426
-Come on. We have to hurry. I'm driving.
-We have to hurry. I'm driving.

578
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,055
Oh, my God. We're both asleep.

579
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,349
He's got us going in circles.

580
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,309
We gotta go!

581
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,832
You can check in,
but you can't check out.

582
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:43,840
What the hell was that?

583
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,678
Debbie. She's gone.

584
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:53,392
I've collected her, like the others.

585
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,862
All right, I'm gonna punch his ticket in.

586
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,104
Oh, Dan.

587
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,275
I'm sorry.

588
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:44,735
Get him in there.

589
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,911
Base, this is med seven.

590
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:59,458
We have a male Caucasian,
approximately 16 to 18 years of age.

591
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,211
Uh, multiple lacerations
about the head and neck area.

592
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,005
Possible internal injuries.

593
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:07,674
-What's that do?
-Relaxes your boyfriend.

594
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,093
-Put the needle down.
-Sorry, rules is rules.

595
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,179
He stays awake!

596
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,264
Those are my rules, understand?

597
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:15,640
What are you, nuts?

598
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,434
He's allergic, okay?

599
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:20,312
You should have said something
in the first place.

600
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:21,938
Damn kids.

601
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,400
Don't let them put you to sleep.

602
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,988
-We have to get ready for him.
-Okay.

603
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,786
<i>Dr. Schick to OR, stat.</i>

604
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:47,422
-When does he have surgery?
-Fifteen minutes.

605
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,757
Let him be, Alice.

606
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:54,679
-They're gonna kill him.
-What are you talking about?

607
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,348
-Let me go.
-Alice.

608
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,392
Damn it. Get back here! Alice!

609
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,747
Alice!

610
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,594
Come on!

611
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,640
No. No gas.

612
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,894
No gas. No. Don't put--

613
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,313
Fucking A.

614
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:03,493
-Krueger.
-Well, it ain't Dr. Seuss.

615
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,704
Alice! Alice!

616
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:10,041
Alice! Alice!

617
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,795
Get away from him, you son of a bitch!

618
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,224
-Dan.
-I saw him. He was here.

619
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,269
I know.
We have to get out of this place.

620
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,421
Dan.

621
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,632
Out for a spin, lovebirds?

622
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,925
Dan, hold on.

623
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,019
Alice! Alice!

624
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:30,663
Alice, it's too late.

625
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:34,250
He's hemorrhaging.
Bring him out of it. Hurry!

626
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:38,755
Alice.

627
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,596
Alice! Alice!

628
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,642
You gotta put me back under now.

629
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,145
Relax, son.
It was rough, but we pulled you out.

630
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,688
You're gonna be okay.

631
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,694
<i>Freddy's coming for you</i>

632
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:06,408
<i>Three, four, better lock your door</i>

633
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,745
<i>Five, six, grab your crucifix</i>

634
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,789
<i>Seven, eight...</i>

635
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,966
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.

636
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:21,733
You've got their power.
I've got their souls.

637
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:23,526
Come on.

638
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,738
Come on. Come on.

639
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,484
You think you've got what it takes?

640
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:11,241
I've been guarding my gate
for a long time, bitch.

641
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:15,179
I am eternal.

642
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:33,615
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep</i>

643
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:39,871
<i>The master of dreams</i>
<i>My soul I'll keep</i>

644
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:44,542
<i>In the reflection of my mind's eye...</i>

645
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:49,088
<i>Evil will see itself, and it shall die</i>

646
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:13,863
Let them out!

647
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,799
You're dead, Krueger.

648
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:46,289
Thank you, Alice.

649
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:50,001
You saved us, Alice.

650
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:59,135
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

651
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,894
Rest in hell.

652
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:04,033
You know, I slept through all of
last night and I haven't done that in days.

653
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:06,953
I'm still having trouble.

654
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,373
I can sleep two, maybe three hours
if I'm lucky.

655
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:11,624
I don't mind though.

656
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,210
I have more reasons to stay awake now.

657
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,256
Come on.

658
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,591
Make a wish.

659
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:23,594
Oh, come on,
you don't believe in that stuff.

660
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:27,223
Uh, yeah, I do, and I think you do too.

661
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,435
Here it goes.

662
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,320
What'd you wish for?

663
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:54,166
If I tell you, it won't come true.

664
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,103
