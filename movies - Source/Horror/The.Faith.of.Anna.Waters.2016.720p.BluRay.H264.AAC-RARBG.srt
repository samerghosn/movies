1
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:43,192
[man straining, grunting]

2
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,365
PRIEST: In the name
of the whole universe,

3
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,731
by Him who has
the power to consign...

4
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:49,899
That's enough!

5
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:52,698
[evil laughter]

6
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:56,832
So you will kill
in the name of your God

7
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,932
just to save?

8
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,598
I adjure you!

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,765
No more, Father!
You're killing him!

10
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:06,531
I adjure you not by my weakness,

11
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,498
but by the Holy Spirit,

12
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,998
to depart
from this servant of God.

13
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,664
You've killed him.

14
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,632
[phone ringing]

15
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,865
[rings]

16
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:25,799
Miss Waters, Dr. Hawkins
will see you now.

17
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,365
You're clear, Jamie.

18
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:32,332
The numbness in your arm
is from spending too much time

19
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,098
in front of the computer.

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,564
Just to be sure,
we'll do a blood test, huh?

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,998
[phone ringing]

22
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,598
[ringing continues]

23
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,365
[ringing]

24
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,765
Oh, give those homicides
a break, will you?

25
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,998
Get some Ashtanga.

26
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,765
Gotta make the rent, Doc.

27
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,966
Okay, we're done here.

28
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,331
Thanks.

29
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,564
See you next year, Jamie.

30
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,699
God willing, it will skip you.

31
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,265
God has nothing to do with it.

32
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,098
JAMIE: The diagnosis
is extreme overwork.

33
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,931
The doctor prescribed yoga,

34
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,899
but I'm guessing you want me
back at the coal mine tomorrow.

35
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,664
DAN: Yeah, how about right now?

36
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,032
Look, the front page is a mess,
the lead is a disgrace,

37
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,931
and that idiot
filling in for you

38
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,899
got every damn fact in the
East Garfield shooting wrong.

39
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,598
Give Jacob a break.
It's his first week on crime.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,564
- See you tomorrow?
- I'm counting the minutes.

41
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,931
I'll see you later, Jamie.
Oh, and one more thing.

42
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,931
We need you over at north side
for a 10:00 press conference

43
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,233
for the Lakewood murder.

44
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:34,765
- Dan.
- What?

45
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,998
You are coming back
tomorrow, period.

46
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,066
Listen, Dan, something's
happened to my sister.

47
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,265
I'm getting on the first flight
to Singapore.

48
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,498
Singa...

49
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,399
Jamie?

50
00:04:56,401 --> 00:05:00,031
Hi, I'm Majorie from the bureau.
Just this way.

51
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,098
I've located the house
where your sister was found.

52
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,031
It belongs to her ex-husband.

53
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,999
He told the police
that he had loaned it to her

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,098
until she relocated back
to Chicago with their daughter.

55
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,999
- Where's Katie?
- At his place.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,399
Um, the morgue's expecting you.

57
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,598
Anna.

58
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,731
The deceased was found with
a plastic bag over her head.

59
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,899
Five sets of prints
were recovered from the bag,

60
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,432
all belonging to her.

61
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:53,264
Cause of death is asphyxiation.

62
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,231
Judging by the level
of decomposition,

63
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,499
we believe that the deceased
committed suicide

64
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,499
three days ago.

65
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,932
That's not possible.

66
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,098
Anna had no reason
to kill herself.

67
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,365
The autopsy revealed
that your sister

68
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:10,165
was suffering
from Huntington's disease.

69
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,932
Her 12-year-old daughter
also has it.

70
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,264
Huntington's is a hereditary

71
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,399
neurodegenerative
genetic disease

72
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,264
with no known cure.

73
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,932
Sufferers have a 50% chance of
passing it on to their children.

74
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:26,899
It begins with the involuntary
jerking of the limbs

75
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,564
and ends in early death
caused by falls

76
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,432
due to lack of coordination,

77
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:36,098
malnutrition because
of the inability to swallow,

78
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,064
or suicide.

79
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,531
Anna's had Huntington's
since she was ten.

80
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,098
She's stronger than you think.

81
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,531
We recovered a video
from her computer.

82
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:52,499
She left her webcam on
accidentally,

83
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,966
and this is what it captured.

84
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,999
ANNA: God forgive me.

85
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:20,064
[groaning]

86
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:51,264
[girl laughing]

87
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,164
GPS: In 3/4 of a mile,

88
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:17,065
be in either of
the two left lanes.

89
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,499
Then turn left...

90
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,565
[hurried footsteps]

91
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,599
Aunt Jamie!

92
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,664
- [car door closes]
- Katie.

93
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,931
You've got to check out
the house, Aunt Jamie.

94
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,432
It's so old and cool.

95
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,931
Mom thinks a ship captain
used to live here.

96
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,931
I think it's a pirate.

97
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:13,164
There's even a telescope
in my room, Aunt Jamie. Come!

98
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,664
Um, I'll be there in a minute,
sweetie.

99
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,164
I need to have a word
with your dad.

100
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,898
[door slams]

101
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,365
Doctor says it's shock.

102
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,499
She found Anna and stayed
with the body for two days.

103
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,499
- Where the hell were you?
- Tokyo.

104
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,399
Anna called me the day she died,
but I was on a plane.

105
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,197
I called her when I got back,
but she didn't answer,

106
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,698
so I came here.

107
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:44,097
Found Katie
reading next to Anna's body

108
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,030
as if nothing had happened.

109
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,565
- She shouldn't be here.
- I didn't want her to,

110
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,365
but she found out
you were arriving

111
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,898
and insisted on coming back.

112
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,898
She's not listening to anything
I say right now.

113
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,264
Can you blame her?

114
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,432
You walked out
on your wife and daughter

115
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,798
because they were sick.

116
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,499
You'd better go.

117
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:13,532
Anna drew up a will
two years ago.

118
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,998
She wanted to be cremated.

119
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,131
The ceremony's tomorrow.

120
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,965
[car engine starts]

121
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,898
[car departs]

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,432
Katie?

123
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,599
Boo!
[giggles]

124
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,264
Isn't this cool?
You can see real far with it.

125
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,499
Try it, Aunt Jamie.

126
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,965
I saw a nest in one of the trees
the other day.

127
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,931
When Mommy comes back
you can sleep here with me.

128
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,831
What do you mean, Katie?

129
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,631
You want to tell me how
you found Mommy, sweetie?

130
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,931
I was supposed to be away
for a week at school camp,

131
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:38,499
but I got sick
on the second day.

132
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,631
So a teacher drove me back.

133
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,831
Did you call your dad?

134
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,164
Why not?

135
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,931
I knew he would call the police,

136
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:50,097
and he did,
and they came and took her away.

137
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,264
- They had to, sweetie.
- But she was coming back.

138
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:54,532
Mommy was coming back.

139
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,764
Shh. Shh.

140
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,298
When did this happen?

141
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,399
Last month.

142
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,730
I couldn't swallow,
and Mommy took me to the doctor.

143
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,231
When was the last time you fed?

144
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:21,131
This morning after we came back.

145
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,599
Hold still.

146
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:34,931
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

147
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,599
Mommy says Huntington's
a gift from God.

148
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,432
The pain reminds us
how precious life is.

149
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,931
Your granny said the same thing
to your mom

150
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:45,798
when she was your age.

151
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:50,231
Did Granny die of Huntington's?

152
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,565
Yeah, she did.

153
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,965
But you won't.

154
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,097
[chimes jingling]

155
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,764
Mommy?

156
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,730
Does God really exist?

157
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,565
Is He a metaphor,
like the Tower of Babel,

158
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,597
which scholars believe
never actually existed.

159
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,931
We all know
the story in Genesis.

160
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:11,264
Man, speaking one tongue
and full of pride,

161
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:14,065
built a tower to reach
the heavens.

162
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:17,931
And in doing so, angered God,
who destroyed the tower,

163
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,399
scattered Man over
the face of the earth

164
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,931
and confused his language.

165
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,432
Like the invented tower
in that story

166
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:28,697
that explains how people living
in different lands

167
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,399
spoke different languages,

168
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,532
is God Himself
a fictitious character?

169
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,365
Some say the question
is profound and unanswerable,

170
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:43,532
but modern scientific tools
have unearthed what are possibly

171
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,597
King David's City
in Israel's Elah Valley,

172
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,432
the fallen cities
of Sodom and Gomorrah

173
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:52,030
north of the Dead Sea

174
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:56,065
and recently
a ziggurat in North Syria

175
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:59,399
that is possibly
the Tower of Babel.

176
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,931
With the aid of science,
humble rocks and stones

177
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:07,730
will bridge that mystical gap
we know as the leap of faith,

178
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,663
leading us closer to God,

179
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,898
who, I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,898
is very real.

181
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,432
Thank you.

182
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:23,697
Good night.

183
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,563
- Father De Silva?
- Hmm?

184
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,998
I'm Father Matthew Goh
from Saint Benedict Parish.

185
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,898
Ah. Society of Jesus?

186
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:32,998
- Your specialty?
- Uh, computers.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,998
I manage the archdiocese's
presence on the Internet.

188
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,030
Google, Facebook, Twitter.

189
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,264
I can't get past a calculator.

190
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,264
It's Matthew, right?

191
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,197
So, um, it exists?

192
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,898
I'm sorry?

193
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,697
The tower.
You found it in Syria.

194
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,498
Oh, yes.
Uh, we found some stones,

195
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,898
and they carbon-date
back to the tenth century BC,

196
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,231
which was when Genesis
was written.

197
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,498
There you go, Father Matthew.
Good night.

198
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,498
It's rising, Father.

199
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,663
What did you say?

200
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,931
The Tower of Babel.
It's rising

201
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,998
Your cab's here, Father.

202
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,198
I have to go.
Thank you for coming.

203
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,097
Father.

204
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:45,998
[electricity crackles]

205
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,998
[chimes]

206
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,463
[switch clicking]

207
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,298
[clinking]

208
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,498
[clinking continues]

209
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,964
[clinking stops]

210
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,431
[clinking resumes, stops]

211
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,097
- Whoa.
- [gasps]

212
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,830
It's okay.
It's just me.

213
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,564
I knocked, but nobody answered,
so I came in.

214
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,897
I had no idea
this was down here.

215
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,330
My parents bought the place
after the war.

216
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,397
We just lived here for a month
when I was a kid.

217
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,097
Otherwise it's been
pretty much unoccupied

218
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,097
till Anna and Katie moved in.

219
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:50,730
They needed a place before
they went back to Chicago.

220
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,263
Is Katie up?

221
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:56,297
We need to get going
or we're going to be late.

222
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:19,865
[electricity buzzing]

223
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,330
[objects crash]

224
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,698
Where are we going?

225
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,931
Sweetie, I know it's hard,
but...

226
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,663
we're here to say goodbye
to your mom.

227
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:50,431
KATIE: No! No!
[sobbing]

228
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:52,663
You can't burn her.
She's coming back.

229
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,730
Mommy's coming back
in seven days.

230
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:56,230
She's not coming back, Katie.

231
00:22:56,232 --> 00:22:59,197
KATIE:
No! No, Mommy. No!

232
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:03,230
No! Mommy! No!

233
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,698
SAM: She's with God now.

234
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,998
No God would allow people
like Anna and my mother

235
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,263
to suffer the way they did.

236
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,765
You want to come in, sweetie?

237
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,364
Okay.

238
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:41,330
You can come in
when you feel better.

239
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:07,431
[gasps]

240
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,297
Mommy?

241
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,397
Is that you?

242
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,163
[loud whirring]

243
00:24:48,031 --> 00:24:51,463
[mirror squeaking]

244
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:28,330
God forgive me.

245
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,897
God forgive me.

246
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,064
- [shutter clicks]
- [typing]

247
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,730
[keypad beeping]

248
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,431
It started a month ago
with Saint Benedict.

249
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:53,597
This morning the Web sites
of three other churches

250
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,896
were attacked
in the exact same way.

251
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:59,029
Might it not just be a prank?

252
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,930
Corporations and governments
get hacked. Why not the Church?

253
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,997
We're not dealing
with a hacker here, Father.

254
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,997
The defacement may look it,
but...

255
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:11,230
the code used in the attacks is
like nothing I've seen before.

256
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:14,997
Employing such a sophisticated
code to hack a church Web site...

257
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:20,364
It's like... It's like using
a laser to... to kill a fly.

258
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,896
I... I'd really like to help you,
but I just don't see how I can.

259
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:26,829
The Tower of Babel...
I need to know more about it.

260
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:29,064
The Bible mentions many towers.

261
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,431
But it was Man's
use of one tongue

262
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:33,829
that led to
his spiritual suicide.

263
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:38,597
But God destroyed the Tower and
confounded all the languages.

264
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,163
The one tongue is no more.

265
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:43,498
This is binary.

266
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,230
It's the language of computers
and the Internet.

267
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:47,997
The ones and zeros correspond

268
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:50,597
to the two basic states of
electrical signals...

269
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,364
On and off.

270
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:55,765
Now, whether you speak English,
Spanish, Japanese, French...

271
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,498
Binary captures every language
out there,

272
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,597
making it the language
of languages.

273
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,597
It's the new one tongue.

274
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,631
[voices whispering]

275
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:18,263

[board rattles]

277
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:48,463
Where are you?

278
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:04,663
Is my mommy coming back?

279
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:07,163
[board rattles]

280
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:15,431
Who's he?

281
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,997
[gasps]

282
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,297
[cell phone chimes]

283
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:46,797
[chatter on radio]

284
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,263
Just make sure she feeds
in a while

285
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:55,730
and then
once again five hours later.

286
00:31:55,731 --> 00:31:58,564
She can do it on her own,
but just, you know, remind her.

287
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,596
Got it.

288
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:02,364
I'm sorry.
You're not a babysitter.

289
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:04,064
I just...
I don't know anyone here.

290
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:06,230
It's fine, and I love kids,

291
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:07,730
plus it gets me
out of the bureau.

292
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,230
- So...
- Thank you.

293
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:12,196
Um, I shouldn't be long.

294
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,564
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

295
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:03,498
Is this about Anna?

296
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:09,163
Jamie, wait.
Let me help you.

297
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,096
You didn't care
when you dumped my sister,

298
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:13,596
so why the concern now?

299
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:15,596
For all I know, you're the
reason why she killed herself.

300
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:17,131
Miss Waters.

301
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,431
I'm Ravi Sharma.

302
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,064
You said your sister killed
herself. So did my wife.

303
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:27,230
I have something
you need to see.

304
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,997
Darling.

305
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,364
I'll be back in seven days.

306
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:35,096
Wait for me.
I love you.

307
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,131
[groans]

308

309
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,463
[screaming]

310
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,929
[screams]

311
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,364
She had removed her own womb.

312
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,829
It was all captured
on the baby cam.

313
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:34,264
A few days ago I was putting the
baby stuff away when I saw this.

314
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:36,264
What is it?

315
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:45,929
You've seen it before.

316
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,364
In the room
where my sister died.

317
00:34:50,365 --> 00:34:52,398
May I take a look around?

318
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:04,730
Charlotte was an accountant.
Retired.

319
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:07,396
But she still did some freelance
auditing once in a while.

320
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,597
[camera clicking]

321
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:13,896
Was your wife sick?

322
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:24,231
No, that's for the IVF.

323
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,396
We've been trying to have a baby
for years.

324
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:30,063
But the doctors said Charlotte
was too old to get pregnant.

325
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:32,463
Well, she paid the day she died.

326
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:38,663

Hey, Tara.
It's Majorie.

329
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,429
Hey, listen, I'm wondering,
are you still with Chester Tan?

330
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,563
Yeah.

Katie.

334
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:01,730
It's time you fed.

335
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:19,963

DANNY: Can't she stay?
WOMAN: No.

00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,396
Mommy?

339
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:23,996

[Katie hyperventilating]

351
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:31,797
He killed us all!

352
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:40,195
DANNY: He will kill
every one of you.

353
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:43,797
- Who is he?
- He has many names.

354
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:48,362
Jamie, wait.
Let me help.

355
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:50,730
Charlotte removed her womb
because she was infertile.

356
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:52,730
Anna suffocated herself,
starving her brain of oxygen,

357
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:54,697
because that's where
Huntington's starts.

358
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,697
Charlotte told Ravi
she's coming back in seven days.

359
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:59,730
Katie said the same about Anna.
Then there's the symbol.

360
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:02,096
The two cases are linked.
Let me help.

361
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:04,730
I want to find the truth
as much as you do.

362
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,329
MAJORIE: Katie?

363
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,996
There you are.

364
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,295
Are you drawing something?

365
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:40,630
Is that a word game?

366
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:45,130
Can I play?

367
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:51,864
Hmm.

368
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:54,362
They look like names.

369
00:41:54,364 --> 00:41:56,697
Danny says he has many names.

370
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,663
Who's Danny?

371
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:04,195
Well, they look similar.

372
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:06,230
I know. It's an anagram.

373
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,730
- What's that?
- An anagram's a word

374
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:11,362
formed by rearranging
the letters of another word.

375
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,429
I'll show you.

376
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,563
Okay.

377
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,063
Katie.

378
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:25,230
That's your name.

379
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:27,329
Now let's see.

380
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:32,663
And this is an anagram
of your name.

381
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:35,963
Eli...

382
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:41,429
[screams]

383
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:45,563
The plot was confiscated by
the British government in 1938

384
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:51,262
and later resold at an auction
in 1953 to the Harris family.

385
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:03,896
[rustling]

386
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:43,797
[rustling]

387
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,230
[plastic rustling]

388
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:37,396
[gasps]

389
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:41,463
Anna?

390
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:00,096
Miss, are you all right?

391
00:45:04,364 --> 00:45:07,630
[clock ticking]

392
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,063
[computer chimes]

393
00:45:13,097 --> 00:45:14,929
[ticking continues]

394
00:45:14,931 --> 00:45:16,429
[electronic buzzing]

395
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:18,063
[chimes]

396
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,230
[electronic buzzing]

397
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:33,230
[door unlocks]

398
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,563
Katie?

399
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:45,829
- How is she?
- In bed.

400
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:52,262
What is it?

401
00:45:52,264 --> 00:45:55,762
That thing you have in there,
it can give people a real scare.

402
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:58,496
I nearly died of fright
when I saw it.

403
00:45:58,498 --> 00:46:00,496
What thing?

404
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,496
That.

405
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:14,329
It was...
It was right here a moment ago.

406
00:46:15,664 --> 00:46:18,829
Um, what was it?

407
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:22,329
A dummy in a diving suit.
I was right here with Katie.

408
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:27,829
I turned around, and it was
right here on this chair.

409
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:31,163
- Are you okay, Majorie?
- Uh...

410
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,096
[car horn honks]

411
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:37,329
That's my cab.
I... I have to go.

412
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:39,896
Are you sure you're okay?

413
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,396
Yeah.

414
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,396
Uh, I spoke to my friend

415
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:46,396
who works for the lawyer
that your sister used, and...

416
00:46:46,398 --> 00:46:49,195
it wasn't Sam
who wanted the divorce.

417
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:51,195
It was Anna.

418
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:54,163
I just thought you should know.

419
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:13,762
Hey.

420
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:19,429
She's coming back.
Just two more days.

421
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,795
Katie.

422
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,762
[child giggles]

423
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,896
There.

424
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,896
[gasps]

425
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,963
[breathing heavily]

426
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:09,396
MAN: He demands the Tower, but
rejects the tongues I offer.

427
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:12,929
I have sacrificed my blood,
but he will not do my bidding.

428
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:14,996
What tower does he speak of?

429
00:50:14,998 --> 00:50:17,163
[cell phone rings]

430
00:50:18,898 --> 00:50:20,929
- Miss Waters?
- Yeah?

431
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:23,496
Something just happened.
Charlotte's computer

432
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:25,561
deleted three names
from her address book.

433
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:29,329
I didn't see the first two.
It happened so fast.

434
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:32,762
But the last one is someone
by the name of Josh Lim.

435
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,996
- Do you know him?
- No.

436
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,163
There's something else.

437
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:40,130
It's exactly seven days
since Charlotte died.

438
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:43,496
[typing]

439
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:30,496
[vehicle approaching]

440
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,096
Are you okay?

441
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:41,096
When you called, I thought
something had happened to Katie.

442
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,329
No.

443
00:51:43,331 --> 00:51:45,695
She's fine.

444
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:47,329
Why didn't you tell Katie

445
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:50,329
that Anna was the one who wanted
the divorce, not you?

446
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:56,096
I didn't want her to blame Anna.

447
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:02,063
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

448
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:04,063
After Katie got sick,

449
00:52:04,065 --> 00:52:07,929
Anna felt guilty for
not telling me the truth.

450
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:11,695
I told her it didn't matter,
but it ate away at her.

451
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:14,996
She said she didn't want me
going through life

452
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,362
dragging around a sick wife
and daughter.

453
00:52:17,364 --> 00:52:19,528
She said she wanted me
to be free.

454
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,163
You have to tell Katie
the truth.

455
00:52:22,164 --> 00:52:24,130
She can't go through life
hating you.

456
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:37,929
Katie.

457
00:53:34,097 --> 00:53:35,795
Hello?

458
00:53:42,831 --> 00:53:45,262
[object clatters]

459
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:51,795
Josh?

460
00:54:04,398 --> 00:54:06,829
[man sobbing]

461
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:10,963
[sobbing continues]

462
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:19,829
- Josh?
- [sobbing continues]

463
00:54:21,097 --> 00:54:23,596
[screaming]

464
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,829
Josh? No! Josh!

465
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:27,963
- No!
- [screaming]

466
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:37,096
We've got to get you
to the hospital.

467
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:39,528
- Seven days. She... She said...
- Who?

468
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,096
- Who said seven days?
- She... She...

469
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:10,561
- [electronic screeching]
- [high-pitched whine]

470
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:48,396
[cell phone chimes]

471
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:48,061
[chair scrapes loudly]

472
00:57:49,998 --> 00:57:54,228
So you will kill
in the name of your God

473
00:57:54,231 --> 00:57:56,262
just to save?

474
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,896
- I adjure you!
- No, Father!

475
00:57:58,898 --> 00:58:00,762
[chair scrapes]

476
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:13,429
You've killed him.

477
00:58:19,898 --> 00:58:22,461
[metal squeaking]

478
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,596
[squeaks]

479
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:07,061
[squeaks]

480
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:03,161
[hyperventilating]

481
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:04,795
MAN: Danny?

482
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:13,161
Danny?

483
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:16,894
No! Ah! No!

484
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:19,429
Spare him, Nigel, please.
I beg you.

485
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,762
He wants you too.

486
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,894
[inhales sharply]

487
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:31,496
Sam. I found something.

488
01:00:42,164 --> 01:00:46,362
First, thank you, Anna,
for an amazing meal.

489
01:00:46,364 --> 01:00:49,829
May I propose some
post-dinner entertainment?

490
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:55,829
All right. Let the séance
begin. Everybody.

491
01:00:58,164 --> 01:01:01,161
Miss May Wong?

492
01:01:01,164 --> 01:01:06,061
Spirits, ghosts, ghouls,
we wish to converse.

493
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:08,961
Are you present?

494
01:01:11,164 --> 01:01:14,161
Okay, can we have dessert now?

495
01:01:14,164 --> 01:01:16,262
I have the most amazing
chocolate cake ready for you.

496
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:18,228
- [loud rattling]
- [screams]

497
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:21,061
What the hell was that?
Did you do that, Wayne?

498
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:24,728
[laughing]
Okay. That was me.

499
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:26,728
- [rattling]
- You idiot!

500
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:29,461
Um, there's something.

501
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,329
Tell us your name.

502
01:01:45,563 --> 01:01:47,329
[gasps]

503
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,927
May?
May, are you okay? Oh!

504
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:58,496
Oh, sweetie, are you okay? May.

505
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:00,827
Oh. It's okay.

506
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:04,094
It must be the wine. I'm taking
medication for my heart.

507
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:07,161
- I'd better go. Sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay, dear

508
01:02:07,164 --> 01:02:09,528
Please stay. I don't want
to spoil anyone's fun.

509
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,161
Please stay.

510
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:14,628
Turn that thing off.

511
01:02:24,563 --> 01:02:27,862
It's another anagram
for Leviathan.

512
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:30,262
Leviathan is a sea monster
in the Old Testament.

513
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:33,094
Do you see that?

514
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:36,927
Huh. She's sort of
fading away in the mirror.

515
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:40,728
We need to talk to her.

516
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:46,228
"Subterfuge."

517
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:53,596
It's the artist you went to see?

518
01:02:53,597 --> 01:02:56,161
He's dead.
Anna, Charlotte and Josh...

519
01:02:56,164 --> 01:02:59,262
The link between all three
of them is May Wong.

520
01:02:59,264 --> 01:03:01,927
Father?

521
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:05,161
- Father!
- I can't help you.

522
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:07,496
Is this about the case
in Indonesia ten years ago?

523
01:03:07,498 --> 01:03:09,927
- I need to go.
- Father, it wasn't your fault.

524
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:11,695
The Vatican cleared you.

525
01:03:11,697 --> 01:03:13,596
That man didn't die
because of the exorcism.

526
01:03:13,597 --> 01:03:15,561
He died from medical
complications.

527
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:17,528
Resulting from my ignorance.

528
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:20,161
Father, please, I'm begging you.

529
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:23,496
There's something unholy about
this attack on the church.

530
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:25,528
Please.

531
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,228
My faith is not as strong
as you may think.

532
01:03:29,231 --> 01:03:32,827
But isn't that
what makes us human?

533
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:39,161
It's our struggle for perfection
that lends us grace.

534
01:03:39,164 --> 01:03:42,496
We're all inadequate
in His eyes, Father.

535
01:03:57,864 --> 01:03:59,762
- [whooshes]
- [gasps]

536
01:03:59,764 --> 01:04:01,429
Mommy?

537
01:04:03,097 --> 01:04:05,262
[creaking]

538
01:04:05,264 --> 01:04:07,329

544
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:30,661

[telescope squeaks]

552
01:05:42,164 --> 01:05:45,228
May is our chief researcher
in undersea Internet cables.

553
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:48,429
Most of the world's cables
are routed through Singapore.

554
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:51,762
It reflects our maritime past
as a naval base.

555
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:56,994
I understand that you want to
interview May for your story,

556
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,994
but given that she's not around,

557
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,927
can I propose another
researcher?

558
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,894
I'd really prefer
to speak with May,

559
01:06:02,896 --> 01:06:05,862
especially when she is the one
who wrote the software.

560
01:06:05,864 --> 01:06:09,396
Um, can I have her address?
I'll contact her myself.

561
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:12,195
Oh, I'm afraid
it's not our company policy

562
01:06:12,197 --> 01:06:15,862
to divulge the personal details
of our employees to the media.

563
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:17,695
I understand,

564
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:20,894
but I can't write my article
without speaking to her.

565
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:24,161
- Thank you for your time.
- Hang on, Miss Waters.

566
01:06:24,164 --> 01:06:28,429

And arise, Leviathan.

573
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,396
Arise.

574
01:07:53,929 --> 01:07:57,527
Ah. You've finally come, master.

It's the seventh day,

No, Mommy's coming back. No!

Let go! No!

No. Let me go.

01:10:12,697 --> 01:10:14,595
- Let go of me.
- Stay here.

590
01:10:14,596 --> 01:10:16,595
I'm just going to get
some of your things.

591
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:19,194
- I'm not leaving!
- Katie.

I'm Father De Silva.
This is Father Matthew.

605
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,694
- Are you May?
- No.

606
01:12:59,697 --> 01:13:01,828
But I'm looking for her.

607
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:04,095
We traced several cyber attacks
on the Church to this apartment.

608
01:13:04,096 --> 01:13:06,161
Can you help us?

609
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:09,994
Miss?

610
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:13,661

Who are you, miss?

613
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:27,427
You've seen that before.

614
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,595
Father.

615
01:13:31,095 --> 01:13:34,094
Now, the operating system
is very complex.

616
01:13:34,095 --> 01:13:36,228
It'll take me some time
to crack all of it, but...

617
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:39,828
I've managed to track down
some kind of activity log.

618
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,161
The attacks
on the Church Web sites

619
01:13:41,162 --> 01:13:43,862
originated from this machine.

620
01:13:43,863 --> 01:13:45,895
And whoever did it attacked
five other systems.

621
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:48,261
I just need to track down which.

622
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:50,261
Binary is the one tongue.

I want to get Katie out,

627
01:13:59,329 --> 01:14:00,927
but she's locked herself
in her room. Call me.

628
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,728
Katie.

629
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:13,094
Katie?

630
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:16,094
She's in her room.
I can't... I can't get in.

01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,528
Katie?

632
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:31,595
- Katie, it's me.
- Aunt Jamie?

633
01:14:31,596 --> 01:14:33,994
Open the door, sweetie.

634
01:14:33,997 --> 01:14:39,094
- You won't make me leave?
- No. Just... Just open the door.

635
01:14:49,764 --> 01:14:52,360
- Are you okay?
- We've got to get her out.

636
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,094
- No! You lied!
- Listen to me, Katie. I...

637
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:56,994
It's the seventh day,
and Mommy's coming back.

638
01:14:56,997 --> 01:14:59,360
Mommy's dead, baby.
She's not coming back.

639
01:14:59,363 --> 01:15:02,228
She said so herself
before she died.

640
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:06,094
- What did you say, Katie?
- What did Mom say?

641
01:15:06,095 --> 01:15:08,261
Please,
tell me the truth, Katie.

642
01:15:08,262 --> 01:15:10,261
- We got to get her out of here.
- No.

643
01:15:10,262 --> 01:15:12,395
- You're coming with me.
- No! No!

644
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:15,060
I came home from school camp and
Mommy said she was going away,

645
01:15:15,063 --> 01:15:16,993
and she would return
after seven days.

646
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:18,895
I asked her why, and she said

647
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:21,094
she had found a way to make
my Huntington's go away,

648
01:15:21,095 --> 01:15:23,694
but she needed to try it out
on herself first.

649
01:15:23,697 --> 01:15:27,228
Then she went into the study,
and...

650
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:31,027
It's her Huntington's.
It's getting worse.

651
01:15:31,029 --> 01:15:32,993
We've got to get her
out of here.

- Got it.

- [chirps]
- Wait. Something's happening.

01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:51,595
It's launching another attack.

656
01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:56,194
I'll just get some stuff
in the study and we can go.

657
01:15:56,195 --> 01:15:58,161
All right.

01:16:21,697 --> 01:16:22,926

- Yeah, Doc?

I'm afraid I have some bad news.

662
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:37,328
The scans must have
missed something.

663
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:40,993
According to your blood work,
you have Huntington's.

664
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:44,694
I'm so sorry.

If they saw that,
they will all...

678
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:38,027
They'll kill themselves.

679
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:41,060
That was no resurrection.
She came back to life

680
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:43,261
because Leviathan
was inside her.

681
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:46,827
The demon is using this video
of a false resurrection

682
01:18:46,828 --> 01:18:48,860
to trick those
who are susceptible

683
01:18:48,863 --> 01:18:52,860

against God: suicide.

seven days without my disease,

I can save Katie.

I'll see you both in seven days.

I must do this.

You don't know what it's like to
be sick, to always be in pain.

works, then I'll do it.

01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:28,161
The demon who staged the false
resurrection of that woman

719
01:22:28,162 --> 01:22:30,761
is now inside Katie.

720
01:22:30,762 --> 01:22:32,827
He is devious
and very dangerous.

721
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:34,761
Don't go anywhere near him,

722
01:22:34,762 --> 01:22:37,360
and don't listen
to a word he says.

723
01:22:37,363 --> 01:22:41,494
If you never believed in God,
now is the time you do.

724
01:22:43,929 --> 01:22:46,127
[door unlocks]

725
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:54,894
[creaking, loud thudding]

726
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:03,860
Katie?

727
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:07,161
Help her, Father.

728
01:23:07,162 --> 01:23:09,395
DEMONIC VOICE:
All dressed up, Father?

729
01:23:09,396 --> 01:23:11,993
What're you going to do?
Kill this little girl

730
01:23:11,996 --> 01:23:14,560
the same way you killed that man
ten years ago?

731
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:16,560
Silence, demon.

732
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:20,461
[snarling]

733
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:26,127
Repeat after me.

734
01:23:28,262 --> 01:23:31,560
- Lord have mercy.
- [screeches]

735
01:23:31,561 --> 01:23:33,395
Lord have mercy.

736
01:23:33,396 --> 01:23:36,261
- Christ have mercy.
- [groans]

737
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:40,261
- Christ have mercy.
- Lord have mercy.

738
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:41,993
Lord have mercy.

739
01:23:41,996 --> 01:23:44,261
Saint Michael, Saint Gabriel,
Saint Raphael,

740
01:23:44,262 --> 01:23:47,761
all holy angels and archangels,

741
01:23:47,762 --> 01:23:49,694
all holy orders
of blessed spirits...

742
01:23:49,695 --> 01:23:51,560
WOMAN'S VOICE: Jamie.

743
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:55,860
- Anna?
- Don't listen to the demon.

744
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:59,493
I have found the cure that will
save Katie, you and me.

745
01:23:59,496 --> 01:24:02,161
Stop him before he kills us.

746
01:24:06,595 --> 01:24:10,395
- KATIE'S VOICE: Daddy?
- Katie?

747
01:24:10,396 --> 01:24:13,761
- I don't want to die.
- He is lying.

748
01:24:24,063 --> 01:24:25,993
No, Sam.

749
01:24:32,895 --> 01:24:35,894
Holy Lord, almighty Father,
everlasting God and Father

750
01:24:35,895 --> 01:24:37,194
- of our Lord Jesus Christ...
- Daddy?

751
01:24:37,195 --> 01:24:39,594
- Daddy?
- Get me that chair!

752
01:24:39,595 --> 01:24:41,594
No, Daddy. Don't.

753
01:24:41,595 --> 01:24:43,993
No, Daddy. No.

754
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:46,194
No, Daddy.
Daddy, it's me.

755
01:24:46,195 --> 01:24:49,194
No. No. Stop it.

756
01:24:49,195 --> 01:24:52,328
No, Daddy.
Stop it.

757
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:55,228
Why are you hurting me,
Aunt Jamie?

758
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:57,094
Daddy.

759
01:24:57,095 --> 01:25:00,493
- [praying]
- Please. No.

760
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:02,761
It's me, Aunt Jamie.

761
01:25:02,762 --> 01:25:04,493
No.

762
01:25:04,496 --> 01:25:06,659
[snarling]

763
01:25:08,029 --> 01:25:10,194
I adjure you, ancient serpent,

764
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:13,027
by the judge of the living
and the dead,

765
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:16,926
by your Creator, by the Creator
of the whole universe,

766
01:25:16,929 --> 01:25:20,860
by Him who has the power to
consign you to hell,

767
01:25:20,863 --> 01:25:26,060
to depart forthwith in fear
along with your savage minions

768
01:25:26,063 --> 01:25:28,228
from this servant of God, Katie,

769
01:25:28,229 --> 01:25:31,493
who seeks refuge
in the fold of the Church.

770
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:35,228
Make no resistance nor delay
in departing from this man,

771
01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:39,726
for it has pleased God
to dwell in Man.

772
01:25:42,029 --> 01:25:45,094
It is God Himself
who commands you.

773
01:25:45,095 --> 01:25:48,394
The majestic Christ
commands you.

774
01:25:48,395 --> 01:25:50,726
God the Father commands you!

775
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,194
God the Son commands you!

776
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:56,194
God the Holy Spirit
commands you!

777
01:25:56,195 --> 01:25:58,860
The mystery of the cross
commands you!

778
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:01,993
The faith of the holy apostles,
Peter and Paul,

779
01:26:01,996 --> 01:26:04,694
and of all the saints
commands you.

780
01:26:04,695 --> 01:26:07,726
The blood of the martyrs
commands you.

781
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,894
The devout prayers of all
holy men and women commands you.

782
01:26:11,895 --> 01:26:16,560
The saving mysteries of our
Christian faith commands you!

783
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:25,094
- Katie?
- What have you done?

784
01:26:30,262 --> 01:26:32,060
[demonic voice chuckling]

785
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:35,926
So you will kill in the name
of your God just to save?

786
01:26:37,895 --> 01:26:40,961
You doubt your faith, priest.

787
01:26:42,762 --> 01:26:44,926
- Father!
- Stay back!

788
01:26:46,328 --> 01:26:49,493
[cackling]

789
01:26:56,029 --> 01:26:59,228
I crown you like they crowned
the King of Jews!

790
01:26:59,229 --> 01:27:01,426
[cackles]

791
01:27:02,828 --> 01:27:05,560
- [screams]
- Father!

792
01:27:08,996 --> 01:27:09,994
Sam!

793
01:27:11,662 --> 01:27:14,094
[cackling, roars]

794
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:16,161
[screams]

795
01:27:16,162 --> 01:27:20,094
And I crucify you like they
crucified the Nazarene!

796
01:27:20,095 --> 01:27:24,493
Die, priest, and be silent!

797
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,260
No.

798
01:27:33,895 --> 01:27:36,394
[coughing]

799
01:27:36,395 --> 01:27:38,993
Look deep inside yourself.

800
01:27:38,996 --> 01:27:43,426
Find God, who's always
been there, who never left you.

801
01:27:43,429 --> 01:27:45,726
If there is a God, priest,

802
01:27:45,729 --> 01:27:48,993
why would He afflict his
children with pain and disease?

803
01:27:48,996 --> 01:27:53,827
Pain and disease
are part of life,

804
01:27:53,828 --> 01:27:55,894
part of our faith.

805
01:27:57,729 --> 01:28:01,726
Pain and disease
reminds us of life

806
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:06,827
like bitter reminds us of

807
01:28:06,828 --> 01:28:09,094
sweet.

808
01:28:12,895 --> 01:28:14,993
[cackling]

809
01:28:32,996 --> 01:28:35,560
We can reach Katie.
Get her down.

810
01:28:44,595 --> 01:28:47,060
[snarls]

811
01:28:47,063 --> 01:28:49,726
Hold on, Katie!

812
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:52,993
Didn't Mommy say pain reminds us
of how precious life is?

813
01:28:52,996 --> 01:28:55,094
[demon screaming]

814
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:56,926
Can you feel that pain, Katie?

815
01:28:56,929 --> 01:28:59,860
Do you remember
what your mommy said?

816
01:28:59,863 --> 01:29:02,527
Hold on to that pain!

817
01:29:02,529 --> 01:29:04,560
[demon screaming]

818
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,426
[Katie groans]

819
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:09,594
It's working.

820
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:12,460
[sobbing]

821
01:29:13,863 --> 01:29:16,460
[wind whooshing]

822
01:29:29,996 --> 01:29:32,426
[demon screeches]

823
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:48,926
Aunt Jamie?

824
01:29:50,162 --> 01:29:52,594
Katie.

825
01:29:54,328 --> 01:29:56,292
Daddy.

826
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:32,226
The Church is very grateful
for your gift.

827
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:34,394
We're going to
build a seminary here

828
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:37,493
and name it
after Father De Silva.

829
01:30:39,996 --> 01:30:42,092
Thank you for everything.

830
01:30:45,828 --> 01:30:47,894
You take care.

831
01:30:49,561 --> 01:30:51,827
I spoke to your daddy.

832
01:30:51,828 --> 01:30:55,092
You'll be spending Christmas
in Chicago.

833
01:30:55,095 --> 01:30:57,426
Really, Daddy?

834
01:30:58,695 --> 01:31:00,827
Yeah. Let go, little lady,

835
01:31:00,828 --> 01:31:02,993
or your aunt's going to miss
her flight.

836
01:31:12,996 --> 01:31:14,961
Take care.

837
01:31:32,929 --> 01:31:36,226
[radio channels switching]

838
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:40,092
MAN: ...discovered the corpse
