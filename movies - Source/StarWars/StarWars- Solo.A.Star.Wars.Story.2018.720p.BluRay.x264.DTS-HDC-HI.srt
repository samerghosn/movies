we don't got it,

- Right.

What's the difference?

The difference

718
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:09,701
is the Empire

what it's like

to live with a price
on your head?

724
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:24,358
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

to make it up to him.

Maybe.

737

it's worth the risk.

how to find it?

There were factors.

There is no
making this right.

873

You know who I answer to

874
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:51,201
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

875
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:53,340
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."

So here's what I need you
to do for me.

make it up to me?

what was promised.

from somewhere else.

anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

888
00:49:23,188 --> 00:49:25,184

Maybe Mercy Island.

889

DRYDEN: That's impossible.

890
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:29,219
So, let's come up
with some other options.

891
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:30,581
Other ideas
that we might...

892
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,485
What about unrefined?

893
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:38,693
QI'RA: Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

894
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,690
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

895
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:43,925
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

896
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,557
That's a very,
very good one.

897
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,849
DRYDEN: But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

898
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:48,925
Crimson Dawn maintains

899
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:51,262
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

900
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:53,628
It's one that
I can't jeopardize

901
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,759
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

902
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,938
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

903
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:02,735
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

904
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:03,597
Not all we have.

905
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,630
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

906
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,101
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

907
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:20,090
DRYDEN: Possible?

908
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:21,817
It's risky.

909
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,516
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

910
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:26,172
it starts to destabilize,

911
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,807
so unless...

912
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,338

913
00:50:29,668 --> 00:50:30,936

Savareen.

921
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:45,288
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

922
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,472
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.

923

DRYDEN: But Qi'ra's right.

924
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:52,708
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

925
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,090
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship

926
00:50:55,146 --> 00:50:56,800
and a brilliant pilot.

927
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:58,447
We'll find a ship.

928
00:50:58,449 --> 00:51:00,159

Yes, I believe he can.

938
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:35,804
Of course.

940
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:40,695
I'll see you all

941
00:51:40,804 --> 00:51:41,824
Savareen it is.

942
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:43,666

- Me, too.

Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

About 30 hired guns.

there's a compromise,

one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

1841

about a band of mercenaries

to a peaceful planet.

taking more.

1853

Until finally,
the people resisted.

01:41:48,216 --> 01:41:49,975
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

1855
01:41:49,976 --> 01:41:53,640
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

1856
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:56,194
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1857
01:41:56,328 --> 01:41:57,225

with Dryden.

believe in running.

Tell me.

1939
01:46:53,421 --> 01:46:55,853
Job took a bad turn
on Kessel.

1940
01:46:56,246 --> 01:46:58,064
He died saving my life.

1941
01:46:58,221 --> 01:47:00,212
How are you holding up?
You all right?

1942
01:47:00,301 --> 01:47:00,970
I'm okay.

1943
01:47:00,971 --> 01:47:02,667
All right, good.

1944
01:47:02,957 --> 01:47:04,670
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1945
01:47:04,671 --> 01:47:06,038
- No. Thank you.
- No?

1946
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:08,635
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1947
01:47:08,636 --> 01:47:09,654
I always admired him.

1948
01:47:09,657 --> 01:47:11,421
He was a man of principles.

1949
01:47:11,423 --> 01:47:13,886
When he made a commitment,
he honored it

1950
01:47:13,889 --> 01:47:16,210
and I think we can
all take solace

1951
01:47:16,212 --> 01:47:18,688
in knowing how proud
he would've been

1952
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:22,262
to see you here,
following his example.

1953
01:47:22,323 --> 01:47:23,974
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

1954
01:47:23,975 --> 01:47:25,438
They'll make
reliable smugglers,

1955
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:26,768
should we ever
have the need

1956
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:28,556
when they get
their own ship.

1957
01:47:28,559 --> 01:47:30,927
Qi'ra.
Come here.

1958
01:47:32,872 --> 01:47:34,626
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity

1959
01:47:34,627 --> 01:47:36,385
to work for you again, sir.

1960
01:47:36,386 --> 01:47:37,778
I would've been
inconsolable

1961
01:47:37,779 --> 01:47:39,622
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.

1962
01:47:40,904 --> 01:47:43,033
I have no one else
in my life

1963
01:47:43,425 --> 01:47:46,027
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.

1964
01:47:49,756 --> 01:47:52,828
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment

1965
01:47:52,831 --> 01:47:53,622
and get going.

1966
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:54,747
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...

1967
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,916
What?

1968
01:47:55,917 --> 01:47:57,426
...and black markets
to dominate.

1969
01:47:57,429 --> 01:47:59,792
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.

1970
01:48:00,506 --> 01:48:02,666
You want me to open it?

1971
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:04,703
Oh, yes, Han.
I really do.

1972
01:48:31,282 --> 01:48:32,641
Bring me one.

1973
01:48:32,644 --> 01:48:35,101
(CHUCKLES) I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.

1974
01:48:35,104 --> 01:48:37,501
It's very explosive stuff.

1975
01:48:38,051 --> 01:48:40,283
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.

1976
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:02,447
Careful.

1977
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,354
It's magnificent.

1978
01:49:08,932 --> 01:49:10,162
How'd you do it?

1979
01:49:10,279 --> 01:49:11,119
Wasn't easy.

1980
01:49:11,122 --> 01:49:12,113
No, I mean,
how'd you do it?

1981
01:49:12,115 --> 01:49:15,213
It looks exactly
like the real thing.

1982
01:49:15,587 --> 01:49:17,574
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) That's
'cause it is the real thing.

1983
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:18,271
DRYDEN: Yes, and I'm saying

1984
01:49:18,274 --> 01:49:20,429
I would believe you.
It's that good.

1985
01:49:20,497 --> 01:49:22,261
But my associate
already told me

1986
01:49:22,262 --> 01:49:25,118
about your plan to rob me
of my money

1987
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:27,930
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

1988
01:49:27,932 --> 01:49:29,639
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking

1989
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,189
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...

1990
01:49:31,192 --> 01:49:33,574
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.

1991
01:49:33,577 --> 01:49:34,868
Qi'ra, it turns out

1992
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:36,554
has a weak spot for you,

1993
01:49:36,555 --> 01:49:38,385
and we'll deal
with that later.

1994
01:49:38,386 --> 01:49:42,350
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.

1995
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,393
Can you come in
and join us, please?

1996
01:49:47,177 --> 01:49:48,279

1998
01:49:56,274 --> 01:49:59,411
I am sorry, kid.

1999
01:50:02,582 --> 01:50:03,943
Why?

2000
01:50:04,282 --> 01:50:05,110
Come on.

2001
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:07,146
Don't look at me like that.

2002
01:50:07,186 --> 01:50:08,176
You weren't paying attention.

2003
01:50:08,179 --> 01:50:10,942
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."

2004
01:50:11,908 --> 01:50:14,079
Am I wrong about that?

2005
01:50:16,518 --> 01:50:17,664
Uh-uh-uh.

2006
01:50:18,282 --> 01:50:20,027
Back away from that.

2007
01:50:20,029 --> 01:50:21,922
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.

2008
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:23,896
Check that lid.

2009
01:50:26,043 --> 01:50:27,405
Clever.

2010
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:29,341
It's too late.

2011
01:50:29,381 --> 01:50:31,774
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.

2012
01:50:31,777 --> 01:50:34,113
Well, we figured that.

2013
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,074
Drop your weapons.

2014
01:50:53,672 --> 01:50:56,578
(OVER RADIO): <i>It's over.
We got them.</i>

2015
01:50:56,735 --> 01:50:57,907
And there we have it.

2016
01:50:57,908 --> 01:50:59,845
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.

2017
01:50:59,846 --> 01:51:01,568
Qi'ra, help me.

2018
01:51:03,912 --> 01:51:05,247
Tell me what to do.

2019
01:51:06,317 --> 01:51:08,067
What would you do

2020
01:51:08,155 --> 01:51:12,194
if the person you most
trusted in the world

2021
01:51:12,768 --> 01:51:14,237
betrayed you?

2022
01:51:16,989 --> 01:51:18,403
I would want
to know why.

2023
01:51:20,615 --> 01:51:22,779
If it was
a moment of weakness

2024
01:51:22,949 --> 01:51:23,956
or something else.

2025
01:51:24,005 --> 01:51:25,006
And then what?

2026
01:51:26,551 --> 01:51:29,581
And then,
I would ask that person

2027
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:31,875
to prove their loyalty

2028
01:51:31,877 --> 01:51:35,613
by sacrificing
something they love.

2029
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:46,171
I tried to warn you
about her.

2030
01:51:46,438 --> 01:51:48,914
You know, you're wrong
about one thing.

2031
01:51:49,043 --> 01:51:50,305
What?

2032
01:51:50,345 --> 01:51:52,643
I was paying attention.

2033
01:51:52,682 --> 01:51:54,951
You told Chewie
people are predictable.

2034
01:51:57,488 --> 01:51:59,591
You're no exception.

2035
01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:06,381
It's empty.

2036
01:52:06,444 --> 01:52:07,887
<i>The case is empty.</i>

2037
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:10,300
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

2038
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:11,837
Aemon?

2039
01:52:11,899 --> 01:52:12,899
Talk to me.

2040
01:52:19,715 --> 01:52:20,983
(GRUNTING)

2041
01:52:38,849 --> 01:52:41,578
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

2042
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:43,279
because that would leave you

2043
01:52:43,282 --> 01:52:45,735
a little shorthanded
around here.

2044
01:52:46,690 --> 01:52:48,130
So,

2045
01:52:48,131 --> 01:52:52,587
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

2046
01:52:52,667 --> 01:52:54,536
Leaves here
with one of us.

2048
01:52:59,601 --> 01:53:00,979
Beckett,
what are you doing?

Thinking.

2050
01:53:02,082 --> 01:53:03,430
And I prefer to be
the only one

2051
01:53:03,497 --> 01:53:05,322
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.

2052
01:53:05,369 --> 01:53:06,974
Han, grab that coaxium,

2053
01:53:06,975 --> 01:53:08,273
put it in the case.

- We had a deal.
- BECKETT: Yeah.

2058
01:53:14,898 --> 01:53:15,748
I'm sorry,

2059
01:53:15,828 --> 01:53:17,391
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

so negative?

2068
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:46,320
now's as good a time as any

2069
01:53:46,323 --> 01:53:48,418

our relationship.

01:53:48,939 --> 01:53:49,939
How so?

2072
01:53:52,563 --> 01:53:55,560
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

2073
01:53:55,563 --> 01:53:58,432
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.
