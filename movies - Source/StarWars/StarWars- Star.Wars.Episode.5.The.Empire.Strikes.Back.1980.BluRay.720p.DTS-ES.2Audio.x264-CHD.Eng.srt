1
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,336
Echo Three
to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,338
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,341
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,500
I finished my circle.

5
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,179
I don't pick up
any life readings.

6
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,097
<i>There isn't enough life
on this ice cube...</i>

7
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,598
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,516
<i>Sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,352
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:51,305
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,646
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

12
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,234
[Braying]

13
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,814
Steady, girl.
What's the matter?

14
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,902
You smell something?

15
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,276
Rrraaah!

16
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,856
Chewie!

17
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,314
Chewie?

18
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,696
Chewie!

19
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,372
All right!
Don't lose your temper.

20
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:52,620
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

21
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,434
Solo?

22
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,805
No sign of life
out there, General.

23
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,185
The sensors are in place.

24
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,432
You'll know if anything
comes around.

25
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,110
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

26
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,396
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

27
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,571
With all the meteor activity
in this system...

28
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,360
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

29
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,699
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay any more.

30
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,860
I'm sorry to hear that.

31
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,028
Well, there's
a price on my head.

32
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,540
If I don't pay off
Jabba the Hutt...

33
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,042
I'm a dead man.

34
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,076
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

35
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,586
You're a good fighter, Solo.

36
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,670
I hate to lose you.

37
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,672
Thank you, General.

38
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:52,802
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

39
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,810
That's right.

40
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,353
Well, don't get
all mushy on me.

41
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,060
So long, Princess.

42
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,899
Han!

43
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,904
Yes, Your Highnessness?

44
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,026
I thought you had
decided to stay.

45
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,117
Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

46
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,110
changed my mind.

47
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,238
Han, we need you!

48
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,238
<i>We need?</i>

49
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,454
Yes.

50
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,699
<i>Well, what about
you need?</i>

51
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,997
<i>I need?</i>

52
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,038
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,797
You probably don't.

54
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:24,668
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

55
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,543
Come on!

56
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,920
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

57
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,714
Yes! You're
a great help to us.

58
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,713
You're a natural leader.

59
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,387
No! That's not it.

60
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,894
Come on.

61
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,348
A-ha!

62
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,939
You're imagining things.

63
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,808
Am I? Then why are
you following me?

64
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,812
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

65
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,319
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

66
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,822
I can arrange that.

67
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,521
You could use
a good kiss!

68
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:53,324
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

69
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,824
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

70
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,329
How will we
dry out her clothes?

71
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,326
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

72
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,004
Oh, switch off!

73
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,624
Why did you
take this apart now?

74
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both--

75
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:06,629
Excuse me, sir.

76
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,874
Put them
back together now!

77
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:08,793
Might I have a word
with you, please?

78
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:09,877
What do you want?

79
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,341
It's Princess Leia.

80
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,966
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

81
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,807
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

82
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,807
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

83
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:17,850
He hasn't
come back yet.

84
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:18,845
She doesn't know
where he is.

85
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:19,846
I don't know
where he is.

86
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,976
Nobody knows
where he is.

87
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,305
What do you mean,
nobody knows?

88
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,853
- Well, uh, you see--
- Deck Officer!

89
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,562
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I--

90
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:26,893
Yes, sir?

91
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,310
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

92
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,906
I haven't seen him.

93
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,360
It's possible he came through
the south entrance.

94
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,358
<i>It's possible?</i>

95
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,117
Why don't you
go find out?

96
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,240
It's getting
dark out there.

97
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,781
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,824
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

99
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,120
Why not?

100
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,449
Impossible man.

101
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,163
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

102
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,625
Between ourselves...

103
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,795
I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

104
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,415
[Braying]

105
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,593
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

106
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,807
He might have
forgotten to check in.

107
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,312
Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

108
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,432
We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

109
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,810
We'll have to go out
on tauntauns.

110
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,485
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

111
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,687
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

112
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,738
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

113
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,408
Then I'll see you
in hell. Hyah!

114
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,928
Rrraaah!

00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,150

come along now, R2.

There's really
nothing more we can do.

121
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,177

are freezing up.

Don't say things
like that!

124
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,186
Of course we'll see
Master Luke again.

125
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,684
And he'll be quite
all right.

126
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,679
You'll see.

127
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,643
Stupid little short circuit.

128
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,816

Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,836
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

134
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,462
although he does admit
that his own range is far too weak...

135
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,092
to abandon all hope.

136
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,302
Your Highness, there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

137
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,677

must be closed.

138
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:12,971
Close the doors.

00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:13,972

00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,450
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

183
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:04,119
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

184
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,663
This is Rogue Two.

185
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,174
<i>Han: Good morning.</i>

186
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,625
<i>Nice of you guys
to drop by.</i>

187
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,134
Echo Base,
this is Rogue Two.

188
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,639
I've found them.

189
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,509
Repeat, I've found them.

190
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,258
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

191
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:49,456
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

192
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,457
Thanks, 3PO.

193
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,506
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>

194
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,296
R2 expresses
his relief also.

195
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,181
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

196
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,682
You look strong enough...

197
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,682
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

198
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,186
Thanks to you.

199
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,850
That's two
you owe me, junior.

200
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,772
Well, Your Worship...

201
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,473
looks like you managed to
keep me around for a little while longer.

202
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,153
I had nothing
to do with it.

203
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,988
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

204
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,278
for any ships
to leave the system...

205
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,688
until we've activated
the energy field.

206
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,700
That's a good story.

207
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,155
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

208
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,742
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

209
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,159
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

210
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,917
Hah hah hah!

211
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,171
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

212
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,667
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

213
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,210
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

214
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,674
My--

215
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,723
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

216
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,388
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

217
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,557
Who's scruffy-looking?

218
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,191
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

219
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,311
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

220
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,277
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

221
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,666
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

222
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,714
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

223
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,791
Take it easy.

224
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,299
Excuse us, please.

225
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,300
Princess, we have a visitor.

226
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,804
Picked up something
outside the base's Zone 12 moving east.

227
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,183
It's metal.

228
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,394
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

229
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,067
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

230
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,189
No.

231
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,647
Wait.

232
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,400
There's something very weak
coming through.

233
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,615
[Radio Static]

234
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,827
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

235
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,660
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

236
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,165
It could be
an imperial code.

237
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:46,874
It could be
an imperial code.

238
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,082
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

239
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,088
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

240
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,420
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

241
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,893
Grrr!

242
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,537
Gahhh!

243
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,619
<i>I'm afraid
there's not much left.</i>

244
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,622
What was it?

245
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,215
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

246
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,500
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

247
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,011
An imperial probe droid.

248
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,138
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

249
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,222
We'd better start
the evacuation.

250
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,388
Admiral.

251
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,897
Yes, Captain?

252
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,182
I think we've got
something, sir.

253
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,520
The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system...

254
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,363
but it's the best lead we've had.

255
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,490
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

256
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,697
I want proof,
not leads.

257
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,488
The visuals indicate
life readings.

258
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,700
It could mean anything.

259
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,538
If we followed up
every lead--

260
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,203
But, sir, the Hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans.

261
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,491
You've found something?

262
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,707
Yes, my lord.

263
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,461
That's it.
The rebels are there.

264
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:04,053
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

265
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,046
It could be smugglers--

266
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,924
That is the system.

267
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,430
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

268
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,561
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

269
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,846
General Veers,
prepare your men.

270
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,357
Admiral.

271
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,401
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

272
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,194
As soon as each transport is loaded...

273
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,286
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

274
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,363
Right, sir.

275
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,576
All right!
That's it.

276
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,708
Try it.

277
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,625
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

278
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,917
Turn it off!

279
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,672
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

280
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,673
Forget the heavy equipment.

281
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,136
There's plenty of time...

282
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,679
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

283
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,676
Take care, sir.

284
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,760
Thanks.

285
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,935
Chewie, take care
of yourself, O.K.?

286
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,404
O.K., O.K.!

287
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,403
Hi, kid.

288
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,567
There's got to be
a reason for it.

289
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,032
Check it
at the other end.

290
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,326
Wait a second.

291
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,827
You all right?

292
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,240
Yeah.

293
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,963
Be careful.

294
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,803
You, too.

295
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,685
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

296
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,682
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

297
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,685
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

298
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,689
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

299
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,279
Prepare for ground assault.

300
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,211
What is it, General?

301
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,881
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

302
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,165
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

303
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,673
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

304
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,376
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

305
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,183
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

306
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,180
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

307
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,185
He-- He felt surprise
was wiser.

308
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,769
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

309
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,185
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

310
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,778
Yes, my lord.

311
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,572
Lord Vader.

312
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,698
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to--

313
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,411
Aaugh!

314
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,208
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

315
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,500
Captain Piett.

316
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,209
Yes, my lord?

317
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,296
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

318
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,382
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

319
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,718
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

320
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,226
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

321
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,977
[Gagging]

322
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,146
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

323
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,026
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

324
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,275
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

325
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,108
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

326
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,647
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

327
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,156
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

328
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,659
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

329
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,790
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

330
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,957
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

331
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,163
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

332
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,672
Understood?

333
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,173
Good luck.

334
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,173
O.K. Everybody
to your stations.

335
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,464
Let's go.

336
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,980
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

337
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,657
Prepare to open shield.

338
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,703
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

339
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,873
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

340
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,538
Stand by, ion control.

341
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,039
Fire.

342
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:27,353
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

343
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,901
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

344
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,570
Feeling all right, sir?

345
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,413
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

346
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,576
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

347
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,833
I know what you mean.

348
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,303
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

349
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,147
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

350
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,517
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

351
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:13,152
[Thudding]

352
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,463
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

353
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,884
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

354
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,141
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

355
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,729
Steady, Dak.

356
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,682
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

Hobbie,
you still with me?

359
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,556
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

360
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,179
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.

361
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:32,063
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

362
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,103
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

363
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,023
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

364
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,148
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

365
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,822
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

366
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,076
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

367
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,202
Ah!

368
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,451
Dak?

369
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,583
Dak!

370
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,528
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

371
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,114
The shield will be down
in moments.

372
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,910
You may start your landing.

00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,160
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

376
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,538
You'll have to
make this shot.

377
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,376
I'll cover for you.

378
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,955
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

Activate harpoon.

382
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,888
Good shot, Janson.

383
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,232
- One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

384
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,067
Cable out.
Let her go!

385
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,030
Detach cable.

386
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,278
Cable detached.

387
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,798

Hah! That got him!

389
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,224
I see it, Wedge.
Good work.

390
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,761
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

391
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,137
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

392
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,645
We have no choice.

393
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:37,690
Launch patrol.

394
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,609
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

395
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,231
Gahhh!

396
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,771
No, no! No.

That one goes there, right?

of Master Luke now, understand?

Why are you
still here?

420
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,690
Heard the command center

Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

686
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:23,972
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

687
00:50:24,106 --> 00:50:26,063
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

688
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:27,603
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

689
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:30,190
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

690
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,525
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

the negative power coupling.

You could be a little nicer, though.

Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

701
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,121
Occasionally... maybe...

702
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,789
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

I like the sound of that.

706
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:37,128
Stop that.

707
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,922
Stop what?

708
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:41,096
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

709
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,632
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

710

Afraid?

711
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,894
You're trembling.

00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:48,648
I'm not trembling.

713
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:52,938

00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:00,527
No, you're not. You're--

718
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:04,289
Sir, sir!

719
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,036
I've isolated the reverse power
flux coupling.

720
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:10,494
Thank you.

721
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,958
Thank you very much.

722
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,833
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

723
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:23,134
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

724
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,762
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

725
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,092
they must have been
destroyed.

726
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:28,849
No, Captain.
They're alive.

727
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,891
I want every ship
available...

728
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:32,568
to sweep
the asteroid field...

729
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:33,974
until they are found.

730
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,271
Lord Vader.

731
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,282
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

732
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:42,786
The emperor
commands you...

733
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,288
to make contact
with him.

734
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,371
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

735
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:49,204
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

736
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:50,793
Yes, my lord.

737
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:09,766
What is thy bidding,
my master?

738
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:13,519
There is a great
disturbance...

739
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,893
in the Force.

740
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:18,353
I have felt it.

741
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:20,981
We have a new enemy...

742
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:25,114
the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.

743
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:28,532
I have no doubt this boy...

744
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:32,878
is the offspring
of Anakin Skywalker.

745
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:35,210
How is that possible?

746
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,838
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

747
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:42,088
You will know it to be true.

748
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,677
He could destroy us.

749
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:46,931
He's just a boy.

750
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:49,467
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

751
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:53,222
The Force is strong with him.

752
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,559
The son of Skywalker...

753
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:59,481
must not become a Jedi.

754
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,773
If he could be turned...

755
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:04,742
he would become a powerful ally.

756
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:07,407
Yes.

757
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:12,619
He would be a great asset.

758
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:15,077
Can it be done?

759
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:19,163
He will join us or die, master.

760
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,108
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

761
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:40,021
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

762
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,019
Patience!

763
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:42,530
For the Jedi...

764
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,449
it is time
to eat as well.

765
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,449
Hmm? Heh heh.

766
00:54:46,577 --> 00:54:49,697
Eat, eat.

767
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,862
Hot!

768
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,581
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

769
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:03,753
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

770
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,594
Not far.
Yoda not far.

771
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,889
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

772
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,929
Root leaf.

773
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:14,391
I cook.

774
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:18,900
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

775
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:21,150
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

776
00:55:21,278 --> 00:55:22,476
Ah, father.

777
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:24,985
Powerful Jedi was he.

778
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,989
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

779
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:28,777
Oh, come on.

780
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:30,322
How could you
know my father?

781
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:32,163
You don't
even know who I am.

782
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,164
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

783
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:36,036
We're wasting our time!

784
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:38,954
I cannot teach him.

785
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:41,460
The boy has no patience.

786
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,164
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

787
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:45,380
Hmm...

788
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:51,429
Much anger in him...

789
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,469
like his father.

790
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:57,304
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

791
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:00,483
No.

792
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,400
He is not ready.

793
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:03,809
Yoda.

794
00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:07,360
I am ready.

795
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,733
Ben--
I can be a Jedi.

796
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,827
Ben, tell him I'm--

797
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,329
Ready, are you?

798
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:15,697
What know you ready?

799
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:19,166
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

800
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:21,786
My own counsel will I keep...

801
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:24,757
on who is to be trained.

802
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:29,463
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

803
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:31,471
The most serious mind.

804
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:37,271
This one a long time
have I watched.

805
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:40,398
All his life
has he looked away...

806
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:43,561
to the future,
to the horizon.

807
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:47,230
Never his mind
on where he was...

808
00:56:47,364 --> 00:56:48,396
hmm?

809
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:50,442
What he was doing.

810
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,119
Hmph!

811
00:56:52,244 --> 00:56:53,324
Adventure.

812
00:56:53,454 --> 00:56:54,449
Ha!

813
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:55,956
Excitement. Ha!

814
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:58,704
A Jedi craves
not these things.

815
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:01,456
You are reckless!

816
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,541
<i>So was I,
if you remember.</i>

817
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:07,509
He is too old.

818
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:10,304
Yes, too old to
begin the training.

819
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,920
But I've learned so much.

820
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,806
Ahh...

821
00:57:19,396 --> 00:57:22,268
Will he finish
what he begins?

822
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,025
I won't fail you.

823
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,230
I'm not afraid.

824
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:29,980
Oh...

825
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:33,485
You will be.

826
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,989
You will be.

827
00:58:16,204 --> 00:58:17,579
[Squealing]

828
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:18,951
Aah!

829
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:20,956
Sir, if I may venture
an opinion--

830
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,992
I'm not really interested
in your opinion.

831
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,407
There's something
out there.

832
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:25,708
Where?

833
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:26,788
Outside in the cave.

834
00:58:26,922 --> 00:58:28,382
[Banging]

835
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:29,835
There it is.
Listen. Listen!

836
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:30,963
I'm going out there.

837
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,172
Are you crazy?

838
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:33,547
I just got this bucket
back together.

839
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,672
I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

840
00:58:35,806 --> 00:58:37,467
Then I'm going
with you.

841
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,177
I think it might
be better...

842
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:41,349
- if I stay behind and guard the ship.
- [Roar]

843
00:58:41,478 --> 00:58:42,393
Oh, no.

844
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:59,572
Leia: This ground
sure feels strange.

845
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,161
It doesn't feel like rock.

846
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:09,079
Han: There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

847
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:11,007
Leia: I don't know.

848
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:14,135
I have a bad feeling
about this.

849
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:15,340
Yeah.

850
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:17,969
Watch out!

851
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:20,429
It's all right.

852
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,639
It's all right.

853
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:23,561
Yeah, that's what
I thought-- mynock.

854
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:25,431
Chewie, check the rest
of the ship...

855
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,889
and make sure there are
no more attached...

856
00:59:28,025 --> 00:59:29,900
chewing on the power cables.

857
00:59:30,027 --> 00:59:31,605
Mynocks.

858
00:59:32,063 --> 00:59:34,271
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

859
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,563
Han!

860
00:59:42,157 --> 00:59:44,778
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing!

861
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:45,905
Shoo! Shoo!

862
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,666
Wait a minute...

863
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,900
Let's get out of here!

864
01:00:18,027 --> 01:00:20,065
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think--

865
01:00:20,195 --> 01:00:22,353
No time to discuss this
in committee!

866
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:24,447
I'm not a committee!

867
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:33,327
You can't make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field.

868
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,128
Sit down, sweetheart!
We're taking off!

869
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:40,878
Look!

870
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:42,289
I see it.
I see it.

871
01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:43,340
3PO: We're doomed!

872
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:44,797
Leia: The cave is collapsing.

873
01:00:44,929 --> 01:00:46,802
- This is no cave.
- What?

874
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:20,666
Run!

875
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:24,581
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

876
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:27,340
But beware
of the dark side.

877
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:29,096
Anger, fear,
aggression--

878
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:32,306
The dark side of
the Force are they...

879
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:35,351
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

880
01:01:35,478 --> 01:01:38,184
If once you start down
the dark path...

881
01:01:38,315 --> 01:01:40,355
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

882
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:41,860
Consume you it will...

883
01:01:41,985 --> 01:01:43,728
as it did Obi-Wan's
apprentice.

884
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:45,237
Vader.

885
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:47,570
Is the dark side stronger?

886
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:49,074
No, no.

887
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,530
No.

888
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:53,068
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

889
01:01:53,204 --> 01:01:56,041
How do I know
the good side from the bad?

890
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:59,369
You will know
when you are calm...

891
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:01,376
at peace...

892
01:02:01,505 --> 01:02:03,083
passive.

893
01:02:03,215 --> 01:02:06,418
A Jedi uses the Force...

894
01:02:06,552 --> 01:02:08,211
for knowledge and defense...

895
01:02:08,346 --> 01:02:10,503
never for attack.

896
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:11,588
But tell me why I can't--

897
01:02:11,724 --> 01:02:13,762
No, no.
There is no why.

898
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:16,597
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

899
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:19,219
Clear your mind

01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:09,653
Other places.
The future. The past.

1083
01:17:09,788 --> 01:17:12,195
Old friends long gone.

1084
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:15,829
Han?

1085
01:17:15,962 --> 01:17:18,250
Leia!

1086
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:19,460
<i>[Eee!]</i>

1087
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:22,667
Hmm...

1088
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:24,176
Control, control.

1089
01:17:24,302 --> 01:17:26,130
You must learn control!

1090
01:17:26,262 --> 01:17:28,090
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1091
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:32,470
I saw... I saw a city
in the clouds.

1092
01:17:32,603 --> 01:17:34,014
Hmm...

1093
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:36,720
Friends you have there.

1094
01:17:36,856 --> 01:17:38,814
They were in pain.

1095
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,228
It is the future you see.

1096
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:43,643
Future?

1097
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:54,079
Will they die?

1098
01:17:57,002 --> 01:17:58,662
Difficult to see.

1099
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:01,998
Always in motion
is the future.

1100
01:18:03,134 --> 01:18:05,921
I've got to go to them.

1101
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,341
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

1102
01:18:10,474 --> 01:18:13,144
If you leave now,
help them you could...

1103
01:18:13,269 --> 01:18:15,177
but you would destroy all...

1104
01:18:15,313 --> 01:18:18,597
for which they have
fought and suffered.

1105
01:18:31,828 --> 01:18:35,198
No, I don't have
a landing permit.

1106
01:18:35,332 --> 01:18:39,199
I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

1107
01:18:39,337 --> 01:18:41,460
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

1108
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:42,963
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

1109
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,631
3PO: Rather touchy,
aren't they?

1110
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,382
I thought
you knew this person.

1111
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,384
Gaah!

1112
01:18:48,511 --> 01:18:50,304
That was
a long time ago.

1113
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,091
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

1114
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:04,317
<i>Permission granted to land

1115
01:19:04,444 --> 01:19:05,855
Thank you.

1116
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:07,862
Nothing to worry about.

1117
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:09,614
We go way back,
Lando and me.

1118
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:11,402
Who's worried?

1119
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,662
3PO: Oh. No one to meet us.

1120
01:20:01,793 --> 01:20:03,667
I don't like this.

1121
01:20:03,796 --> 01:20:06,167
Well, what would you like?

1122
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:08,671
<i>They did let us land.</i>

1123
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:10,675
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1124
01:20:10,802 --> 01:20:12,177
Trust me.

1125
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,139
See? My friend.

1126
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,979
Keep your eyes
open, huh?

1127
01:20:26,109 --> 01:20:27,984
Gahhh!

1128
01:20:28,112 --> 01:20:29,523
Hey!

1129
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:31,314
Why, you slimy...

1130
01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:34,782
double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

1131
01:20:34,909 --> 01:20:37,318
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

1132
01:20:37,454 --> 01:20:39,114
after what you pulled.

1133
01:20:47,006 --> 01:20:49,497
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1134
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:53,085
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1135
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,256
Well, he seems
very friendly.

1136
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,304
Yes.

1137
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:59,472
Very friendly.

1138
01:20:59,601 --> 01:21:00,930
What are you doing here?

1139
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:03,350
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1140
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,472
What have you done
to my ship?

1141
01:21:05,608 --> 01:21:06,472
Your ship?

1142
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:07,640
Hey, remember...

1143
01:21:07,777 --> 01:21:09,769
you lost her to me
fair and square.

1144
01:21:09,904 --> 01:21:12,027
And how you doin',
Chewbacca?

1145
01:21:12,155 --> 01:21:13,400
Gahh!

1146
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:15,074
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1147
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,525
Gahhh!

1148
01:21:17,662 --> 01:21:19,987
Hello.
What have we here?

1149
01:21:20,122 --> 01:21:21,367
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1150
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:24,250
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1151
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:26,250
And who might you be?

1152
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:27,457
Leia.

1153
01:21:27,587 --> 01:21:29,130
Welcome, Leia.

1154
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:35,670
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1155
01:21:35,805 --> 01:21:39,173
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1156
01:21:39,307 --> 01:21:40,719
My facilities
are at your--

1157
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,180
Well, really!

1158
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,103
<i>What's wrong
with the Falcon?</i>

1159
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:45,427
Hyperdrive.

1160
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:47,438
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1161
01:21:47,565 --> 01:21:49,225
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1162
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,229
She's the fastest hunk of junk
in the galaxy.

1163
01:21:52,363 --> 01:21:55,483
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1164
01:21:55,615 --> 01:21:57,027
Not as well as I'd like.

1165
01:21:57,158 --> 01:21:59,198
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1166
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:00,703
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1167
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:02,204
I've had labor difficulties.

1168
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:03,908
Ha ha ha!

1169
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,582
What's so funny?

1170
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,203
You. Listen to you.

1171
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:09,376
You sound like
a businessman...

1172
01:22:09,505 --> 01:22:10,832
a responsible leader.

1173
01:22:10,965 --> 01:22:13,122
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1174
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:15,796
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1175
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:16,958
Yeah.

1176
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:18,886
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1177
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:20,923
It's the price you pay...

1178
01:22:21,057 --> 01:22:22,966
for being successful.

1179
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:27,725
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1180
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:29,231
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1181
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:30,734
How rude!

1182
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:32,234
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1183
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,234
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1184
01:22:34,363 --> 01:22:35,822
I wonder if-- Hello?

1185
01:22:37,574 --> 01:22:38,949
How interesting.

1186
01:22:39,076 --> 01:22:40,654
Who are you?

1187
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:42,162
Oh, my! I--
I'm terribly sorry.

1188
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:43,782
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1189
01:22:43,913 --> 01:22:44,993
No, please don't get up.

1190
01:22:51,505 --> 01:22:52,916
Gahhh.

1191
01:23:03,475 --> 01:23:06,048
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1192
01:23:06,186 --> 01:23:07,846
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1193
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:09,936
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1194
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:12,189
You must not go.

1195
01:23:12,318 --> 01:23:15,402
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1196
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:17,072
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1197
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,033
<i>Even Yoda cannot
see their fate.</i>

1198
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:22,282
But I can help them.

1199
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:23,869
I feel the Force.

1200
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:25,407
<i>But you cannot
control it.</i>

1201
01:23:25,538 --> 01:23:28,029
<i>This is a dangerous
time for you...</i>

1202
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:31,916
<i>when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1203
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:35,248
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1204
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:38,418
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1205
01:23:38,551 --> 01:23:41,802
But I've learned
so much since then.

1206
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:45,264
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1207
01:23:45,393 --> 01:23:46,672
You have my word.

1208
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:48,185
<i>It is you
and your abilities...</i>

1209
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:49,971
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1210
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:53,521
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

1211
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,524
That's why
I have to go.

1212
01:23:55,653 --> 01:23:58,938
<i>Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor...</i>

1213
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:01,029
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1214
01:24:01,158 --> 01:24:02,653
You won't.

1215
01:24:02,784 --> 01:24:04,694
Stopped they must be.

1216
01:24:04,828 --> 01:24:07,117
On this all depends.

1217
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:09,537
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1218
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:11,457
with the Force
as his ally...

1219
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:14,158
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1220
01:24:14,296 --> 01:24:16,372
If you end
your training now...

1221
01:24:16,506 --> 01:24:20,801
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1222
01:24:20,927 --> 01:24:23,550
you will become
an agent of evil.

1223
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,630
<i>Patience.</i>

1224
01:24:24,765 --> 01:24:26,923
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1225
01:24:27,059 --> 01:24:31,104
If you honor
what they fight for... yes.

1226
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:32,854
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1227
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:34,310
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1228
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:36,434
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1229
01:24:37,737 --> 01:24:39,729
I understand.

1230
01:24:44,368 --> 01:24:45,565
R2.

1231
01:24:45,703 --> 01:24:47,078
<i>[Blip Beep]</i>

1232
01:24:47,203 --> 01:24:49,030
Fire up the converters.

1233
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,246
<i>Luke!</i>

1234
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:55,377
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1235
01:24:55,503 --> 01:24:58,256
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1236
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:59,792
Strong is Vader.

1237
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:02,712
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1238
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:04,304
I will.

1239
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,137
And I'll return.

1240
01:25:06,265 --> 01:25:07,640
I promise.

1241
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:16,314
Told you, I did.

1242
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:18,149
Reckless is he.

1243
01:25:18,277 --> 01:25:19,307
Now...

1244
01:25:19,444 --> 01:25:21,153
matters are worse.

1245
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:24,150
<i>That boy
is our last hope.</i>

1246
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:26,323
No, there is another.

1247
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:59,609
The ship's almost finished.

1248
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:01,810
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1249
01:26:01,945 --> 01:26:03,523
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1250
01:26:03,655 --> 01:26:06,146
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1251
01:26:06,283 --> 01:26:08,524
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1252
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:11,033
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1253
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:13,536
and see what
I can find out.

1254
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:15,539
I don't trust Lando.

1255
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:17,993
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1256
01:26:18,128 --> 01:26:20,619
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1257
01:26:20,756 --> 01:26:22,630
we'll soon be gone.

1258
01:26:22,757 --> 01:26:26,007
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1259
01:26:59,337 --> 01:27:00,664
Gaahh!

1260
01:27:00,796 --> 01:27:01,911
What happened?

1261
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:03,506
Gahhh gahhh.

1262
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:04,912
Where?

1263
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:06,331
Gahhh!

1264
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:08,296
Found him
in a junk pile?

1265
01:27:08,429 --> 01:27:11,134
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1266
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:13,173
Gahhh!

1267
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:14,932
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1268
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,519
No, thanks.

1269
01:27:16,645 --> 01:27:20,228
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1270
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:22,314
Not really.

1271
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,860
You look
absolutely beautiful.

1272
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:31,275
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

1273
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:32,820
Thank you.

1274
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:35,823
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1275
01:27:35,956 --> 01:27:37,533
Everyone's invited,
of course.

1276
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,786
Having trouble
with your droid?

1277
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,331
No, no problem.

1278
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:43,458
Why?

1279
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,969
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1280
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,056
we don't fall into...

1281
01:27:56,185 --> 01:27:58,474
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1282
01:27:58,604 --> 01:28:01,273
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1283
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:03,475
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1284
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:05,483
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1285
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:07,983
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1286
01:28:08,113 --> 01:28:10,189
attracting attention
to themselves.

1287
01:28:10,323 --> 01:28:12,399
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1288
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:14,658
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1289
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:17,158
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

1290
01:28:17,288 --> 01:28:19,614
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1291
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:24,578
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1292
01:28:33,596 --> 01:28:36,385
We would be honored
if you would join us.

1293
01:28:41,896 --> 01:28:43,273
I had no choice.

1294
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:45,640
They arrived
right before you did.

1295
01:28:45,775 --> 01:28:47,270
I'm sorry.

1296
01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:53,114
I'm sorry, too.

1297
01:28:55,411 --> 01:28:57,154
Gahhh.

Here?
We're in danger!

1310
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:26,791
I must
tell the others.

1311
01:30:26,918 --> 01:30:28,876

Lord Vader.

1316
01:30:57,658 --> 01:31:01,027
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

1317
01:31:01,162 --> 01:31:02,988
after I have Skywalker.

1318
01:31:03,122 --> 01:31:04,948
He's no good to me dead.

1319
01:31:05,082 --> 01:31:07,787
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1320
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:10,207
Aaaahhh!

1321
01:31:10,337 --> 01:31:13,707
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

1322
01:31:13,841 --> 01:31:16,166
They must never again
leave this city.

1323
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:17,844
That was never a condition
of our agreement...

1324
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,511
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1325
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:24,798
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

1326
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:25,930
No.

1327
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:27,306
Good. It would be
unfortunate...

1328
01:31:27,438 --> 01:31:30,972
if I had to leave
a garrison here.

1329
01:31:31,108 --> 01:31:35,438
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1330
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:39,564
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1331
01:31:39,699 --> 01:31:41,029
Oh!

1332
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:43,532
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1333
01:31:43,662 --> 01:31:47,743
Oh, oh, oh,
that's much better.

1334
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,250
Wait! Wait!

1335
01:31:49,377 --> 01:31:51,250
Oh, my!
What have you done?

1336
01:31:51,378 --> 01:31:53,252
I'm backwards...

1337
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:55,253
you flea-bitten
furball!

1338
01:31:55,382 --> 01:31:57,256
Only an overgrown
mophead like you...

1339
01:31:57,385 --> 01:31:59,009
would be
stupid enough--

1340
01:32:12,565 --> 01:32:14,109
I feel terrible.

1341
01:32:14,234 --> 01:32:15,645
Gahhh.

1342
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:31,663
Why are they
doing this?

1343
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:38,166
They never even asked me
any questions.

1344
01:32:41,595 --> 01:32:43,172
Lando.

1345
01:32:45,932 --> 01:32:46,929
Grrr!

1346
01:32:47,059 --> 01:32:48,173
Han: Get out of here, Lando.

1347
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,136
Shut up and listen!

1348
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:52,429
Vader's agreed to turn
Leia and Chewie over to me.

1349
01:32:52,564 --> 01:32:54,225
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1350
01:32:54,358 --> 01:32:55,520
Leia:
What about Han?

1351
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,681
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1352
01:32:56,819 --> 01:32:57,934
Vader wants us all dead.

1353
01:32:58,069 --> 01:32:59,233
He doesn't want you at all.

1354
01:32:59,363 --> 01:33:01,319
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1355
01:33:01,448 --> 01:33:03,322
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1356
01:33:03,451 --> 01:33:05,408
And we're the bait!

1357
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:07,363
He's on his way.

1358
01:33:07,496 --> 01:33:10,533
You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1359
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:11,828
My friend.

1360
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:15,283
Stop!

1361
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,833
I've done all I can.

1362
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:20,341
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1363
01:33:20,467 --> 01:33:22,045
but I've got
my own problems.

1364
01:33:22,177 --> 01:33:23,506
Yeah.

1365
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:25,429
You're a real hero.

1366
01:33:35,858 --> 01:33:38,395
You certainly have
a way with people.

1367
01:33:42,198 --> 01:33:43,774
Ah... Ah...

1368
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:54,914
This facility is crude...

1369
01:33:55,043 --> 01:33:57,961
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1370
01:33:58,088 --> 01:34:00,461
for his journey to the emperor.

1371
01:34:00,591 --> 01:34:03,377
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

1372
01:34:03,511 --> 01:34:05,798
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1373
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,886
and allow him to land.

1374
01:34:08,015 --> 01:34:11,349
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1375
01:34:11,476 --> 01:34:13,801
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1376
01:34:13,938 --> 01:34:15,313
I do not want...

1377
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,814
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1378
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:19,395
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1379
01:34:42,007 --> 01:34:44,759
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1380
01:34:44,885 --> 01:34:46,795
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1381
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:48,304
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1382
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:50,304
you have a responsibility for me...

1383
01:34:50,432 --> 01:34:52,224
so don't do anything foolish.

1384
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:06,774
What's going on...

1385
01:35:06,907 --> 01:35:08,365
buddy?

1386
01:35:08,492 --> 01:35:11,409
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1387
01:35:11,537 --> 01:35:14,988
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1388
01:35:15,123 --> 01:35:16,498
The Empire
will compensate you...

1389
01:35:16,626 --> 01:35:17,657
if he dies.

1390
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:19,667
Put him in.

1391
01:35:19,795 --> 01:35:20,791
Rrrah!

1392
01:35:20,921 --> 01:35:23,328

I'm not ready to die!

1395
01:35:29,055 --> 01:35:31,510
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me, Chewie.

1396
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,632
This won't help me.

1397
01:35:33,768 --> 01:35:34,966
Hey, save your strength.

1398
01:35:35,101 --> 01:35:37,676
There will be another time.

1399
01:35:37,813 --> 01:35:39,853
The princess--

1400
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:41,725
You have to
take care of her.

1401
01:35:43,985 --> 01:35:46,274
Do you hear me?
Huh?

1402
01:35:46,404 --> 01:35:47,649
Gahhh...

1404
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,829

01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,311
Gahhh!

1406
01:36:32,033 --> 01:36:34,157
What's going on?
Turn around!

1407
01:36:34,286 --> 01:36:35,614
Chewbacca,
I can't see.

1408
01:36:49,885 --> 01:36:52,043
Gahhh.

1409
01:37:33,429 --> 01:37:36,797
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1410
01:37:36,931 --> 01:37:38,556
He should be quite
well-protected...

1411
01:37:38,684 --> 01:37:40,592
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

1412
01:37:40,728 --> 01:37:43,563
Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1413
01:37:43,689 --> 01:37:45,515
Yes, he's alive.

1414
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:47,725
And in perfect hibernation.

1415
01:37:47,859 --> 01:37:50,814
He's all yours,
bounty hunter.

1416
01:37:50,945 --> 01:37:53,402
Reset the chamber
for Skywalker.

1417
01:37:55,868 --> 01:37:57,658
Skywalker has
just landed, lord.

1418
01:37:57,787 --> 01:38:01,654
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

1419
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:10,332
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1420
01:38:10,466 --> 01:38:12,588
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1421
01:38:12,717 --> 01:38:14,757
I am altering the deal.

1422

alter it any further.

What do you think
you're doing?

1436
01:42:09,788 --> 01:42:11,033
We're getting
out of here.

1437
01:42:11,164 --> 01:42:12,992
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1438
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,877
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1439
01:42:16,002 --> 01:42:16,750
Grrr!

1440
01:42:16,878 --> 01:42:18,503
I had no choice.

1441
01:42:18,631 --> 01:42:20,172
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1442
01:42:20,298 --> 01:42:23,300
We understand, don't we,
Chewie? He had no choice.

1443
01:42:23,426 --> 01:42:24,969
I'm just
trying to help.

1444
01:42:25,095 --> 01:42:27,384
We don't need
any of your help.

1445
01:42:27,515 --> 01:42:28,842
Haaa...

1446
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:30,884
Grrr!

1447
01:42:31,018 --> 01:42:32,048
Ha... Ha...

1448
01:42:32,185 --> 01:42:33,181
What?

1449
01:42:33,311 --> 01:42:34,342
Han...

1450
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:35,595
It sounds like Han.

1451
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:37,225
There's still
a chance...

1452
01:42:37,358 --> 01:42:39,065

1453
01:42:39,193 --> 01:42:41,518

01:42:43,405 --> 01:42:44,400
Chewie.

1456
01:42:47,033 --> 01:42:49,608
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1457
01:42:49,744 --> 01:42:51,488
After all,
he's only a Wookiee.

1458

Oh, no! Chewie,

You have learned

You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1469
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:15,954
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1470
01:44:16,082 --> 01:44:17,279
No.

1471
01:44:21,753 --> 01:44:22,583

01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:41,641
Most impressive.

Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1479

You have
controlled your fear.

Only your hatred

01:47:12,591 --> 01:47:14,797

This way.

1492
01:47:39,409 --> 01:47:41,782
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:06,671
You don't know how
to fix the hyperdrive.

1614
01:59:06,805 --> 01:59:08,180
Chewbacca can do it.

1615
01:59:08,306 --> 01:59:09,682
I'm standing here
in pieces...

1616
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:12,975
and you're having
delusions of grandeur!

1617
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,604
You did it!

1618
02:00:14,497 --> 02:00:17,072
Luke, we're ready
for take-off.

1619
02:00:17,208 --> 02:00:18,323
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1620
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:20,583
<i>When we find
Jabba the Hutt...</i>

1621
02:00:20,712 --> 02:00:21,743
<i>and that
bounty hunter...</i>

1622
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,340
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1623
02:00:23,466 --> 02:00:26,087
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1624
02:00:26,217 --> 02:00:28,293
Princess,
we'll find Han.

1625
02:00:28,429 --> 02:00:29,627
I promise.

1626
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:31,970
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1627
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:33,806
Take care, you two.

1628
02:00:33,934 --> 02:00:35,761
<i>May the Force
be with you.</i>

1629
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:37,389
Gahhh.

1630
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,976
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1631
02:00:49,115 --> 02:00:50,064
Ow.

1632
02:01:12,305 --> 02:01:15,176
<i>[Beep Blip Blip Beep]</i>

1633
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:35,694
<i>[Beep Blip]</i>
