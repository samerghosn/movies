3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,590
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

4
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,756
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

5
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,552
With all due respect...

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,751
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

7
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,676
Yes, of course.

8
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,757
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

9
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,793
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

10
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,873
I'm TC-14 at your service.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,796
This way, please.

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,591
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

13
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,516
Make yourselves comfortable.

14
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,870
My master
will be with you shortly.

15
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,795
I have a bad feeling about this.

16
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,798
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

17
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,674
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

18
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,074
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

19
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,192
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

20
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,038
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

21
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,070
But not at the expense
of the moment.

22
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,997
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

23
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,950
Yes, Master.

24
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,550
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

25
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,716
These Federation types are cowards.

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,558
The negotiations will be short.

27
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,834
What? What did you say?

28
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,793
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,668
I knew it.

30
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,949
They're here to force a settlement.

31
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,198
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

32
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,832
Are you brain-dead?

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,679
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

34
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,633
Send a droid.

35
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,676
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

36
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,995
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,156
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

38
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,437
What is it?

39
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,120
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,629
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

41
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,355
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

42
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,559
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,113
Begin landing your troops.

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,788
My lord, is that legal?

45
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,115
I will make it legal.

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,435
And the Jedi?

47
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,949
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

48
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,752
Kill them immediately.

49
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,997
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,518
Captain, look!

51
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,918
Shields-

52
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,076
Sorry.

53
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,557
Dioxis.

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,708
They must be dead by now.

55
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,399
Destroy what's left of them.

56
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,475
Oh! Excuse me.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,432
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,951
Uh-oh. Blast them.

59
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,959
What is going on down there?

60
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,956
We lost the transmission, sir.

61
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,158
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

62
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,112
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.

63
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,834
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

64
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,836
I want droidekas
up here at once!

65
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,394
We will not survive this.

66
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,833
Close the blast doors!

67
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,269
That will hold them.

68
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,994
They are still coming through.

69
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,951
This is impossible!

70
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,999
Where are those droidekas?

71
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,192
Master! Destroyers!

72
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,678
They have shield generators!

73
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,673
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

74
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,069
They're no match for droidekas.

75
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,791
Sir!

76
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,480
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

77
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,480
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

78
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

79
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,798
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

80
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,399
Let's split up.

81
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,591
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

82
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,471
You were right
about one thing, Master.

83
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,920
The negotiations were short.

84
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,348
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

85
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,471
It's Queen Amidala herself.

86
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,908
At last we are getting results.

87
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,117
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

88
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,197
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

89
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,869
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,433
I was not aware of such failure.

91
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,153
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

92
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,874
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,149
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

94
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,555
You must be mistaken.

95
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,591
Beware, Viceroy.

96
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,314
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

97
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,319
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

98
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,829
You assume too much.

99
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,278
We will see.

100
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,673
- She's right. The senate will never-
- It's too late now.

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,632
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

102
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,911
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,794
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

104
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,990
How could that be true?

105
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,272
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

106
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,995
It must- handiwork-
negotiate- ambassadors-

107
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,634
- nobody would-
- Senator Palpatine.

108
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,557
What's happening?

109
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,476
Check the transmission generator.

110
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,230
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,554
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

112
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,308
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

113
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,158
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

114
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,351
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,710
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,355
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,471
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

118
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,635
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

119
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,708
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

120
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,638
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

121
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,796
and there is no trace of theJedi.

122
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,558
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

123
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,034
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

124
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,312
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

125
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,278
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

126
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,990
Get down!

127
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,352
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

128
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,912
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

129
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,995
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

130
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,677
I spake.

131
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,836
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

132
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,712
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

133
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,751
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

134
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,870
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,753
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

136
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,711
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

137
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,392
You saved my again.

138
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,317
- What's this?
- A local.

139
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,874
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,230
More?
"More" did you spake?

141
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,036
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

142
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,231
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

143
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,596
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

144
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,437
Can you take us there?

145
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,677
On second thought, no.

146
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,188
- Not really, no.
- No?

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,355
'Tis embarrassing...

148
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,268
but my afraid
my've been banished.

149
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,357
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

150
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,392
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

151
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,398
- You hear that?
- Yah.

152
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,115
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

153
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,707
If they find us,
they will crush us...

154
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,197
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

155
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,957
Oh.

156
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,071
Yousa point is well seen.

157
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,429
Dis way. Hurry!

158
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,671
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

159
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,596
Ah, my warning you.

160
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,678
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

161
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,996
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

162
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,308
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

163
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,557
So good bein home!

164
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,748
Hey, yousa.

Noah gain,Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,594
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,673
How wude.

170
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,269
Yousa cannot bees hair.

171
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,756
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

172
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,556
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

173
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,115
Wesa no like da Naboo.

174
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,913
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

175
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,837
Day tink day brains so big.

176
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,918
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

177
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,235
Mesa no tink so.

178
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,113
Day not know of uss-en.

179
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,038
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

180
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,390
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

181
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,115
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

182
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,673
Then speed us on our way.

183
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,188
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

184
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,993
We could use a transport.

185
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,839
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

186
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,918
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

187
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,556
'tis goen through the planet core.

188
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,476
Now...

189
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,317
go.

190
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,590
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

191
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,676
Master, what's a bongo?

192
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,677
A transport, I hope.

193
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,791
Deysa setten yousa up.

194
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,389
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

195
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,513
Any help here would be hot.

196
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,596
Master, we're short on time.

197
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,193
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

198
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,197
This Gungan may be of help.

199
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,152
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

200
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,990
Hisen to be pune-ished.

201
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,198
I saved his life.

202
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,709
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt. "

203
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,514
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

204
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,870
Binks...

205
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,788
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

206
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,032
Begone wit him!

207
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,875
Count me outta dis one.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,991
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

209
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,111
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

210
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,273
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

211
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,517
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

212
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,475
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

213
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,196
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

214
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,638
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

215
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,715
Yud-say boom da gasser...

216
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,512
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

217
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,471
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

218
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,719
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

219
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,711
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

220
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,718
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

221
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,071
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

222
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,715
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

223
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,673
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

224
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,109
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

225
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,037
Yes, my lord.

226
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,192
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

227
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,632
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

228
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,509
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

229
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,313
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

230
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,111
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

231
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,714
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

232
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,589
Wesa dyin' here.

233
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,279
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

234
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,232
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

235
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,115
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

236
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,555
Power's back.

237
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,671
Monster's back!

238
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,872
Relax.

239
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,398
You overdid it.

240
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,435
Head for that outcropping.

241
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,391
Oh, boy.

242
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,270
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

243
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,960
Ah, victory.

244
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,990
Dis'n loverly.

245
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,150
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

246
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,272
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

247
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,436
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

248
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,869
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,959
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

250
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,070
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,758
Process them.

252
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,597
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

253
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,278
Roger, roger.

254
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,036
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

255
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,718
Get their weapons.

256
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,630
Yousa guys bombad!

257
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,474
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

258
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,396
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

259
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,271
The negotiations
never took place.

260
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,674
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

261
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,790
They've knocked out
all our communications.

262
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,116
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

263
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,837
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

264
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,349
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

265
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,392
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

266
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,114
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

267
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,195
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

268
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,798
They can't afford to kill her.

269
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,955
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

270
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,957
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

271
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,957
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

272
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,355
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

273
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,835
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

274
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,748
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

275
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,676
We are brave, Your Highness.

276
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,916
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

277
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,394
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

278
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,117
Be careful, Governor.

279
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,671
We'll need to free those pilots.

280
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,676
I'll deal with that.

281
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,989
Halt.

282
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,711
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

283
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,353
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

284
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,551
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

285
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,193
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

286
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,151
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

287
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,548
Come on. Move!

288
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,630
Go!

289
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,310
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

290
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,029
Hello, boyos.

291
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,678
There's the blockade.

292
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,238
The shield generator's been hit!

293
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,913
How wude!

294
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,032
We're losing droids fast.

295
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,354
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

296
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,634
The shields are gone.

297
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,713
The power's back!

298
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,710
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

299
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,307
Deflector shields up at maximum.

300
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,068
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

301
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,952
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

302
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,150
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

303
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,872
It's small, out of the way, poor.

304
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,672
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

305
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,596
How can you be sure?

306
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,550
It's controlled by the Hutts.

307
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,353
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

308
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,674
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than landing...

309
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,596
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

310
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,711
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

311
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,830
which gives us the advantage.

312
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,998
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

313
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:13,589
She has disappeared, my lord.

314
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,712
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

315
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,634
I want that treaty signed.

316
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,715
My lord...

317
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,273
it's impossible to locate the ship.

318
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,516
It's out of our range.

319
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,789
Not for a Sith.

320
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,156
This is my apprentice...

321
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,111
Darth Maul.

322
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,550
He will find your lost ship.

323
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,914
This is getting out of hand.

324
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,996
Now there are two of them.

325
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,998
We should not
have made this bargain.

326
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,470
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

327
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,353
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

328
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,676
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

329
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,276
R2-D2, Your Highness.

330
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,752
Thank you, R2-D2.

331
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,752
Padmé.

332
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,276
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

333
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,277
It deserves our gratitude.

334
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,479
Continue, Captain.

335
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,071
Your Highness,
with your permission...

336
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,838
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

337
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,156
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

338
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,748
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

339
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,677
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

340
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,597
Hello.

341
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,552
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

342
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,032
I'm Padmé.

343
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,030
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

344
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,067
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

345
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,715
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

346
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,355

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,157
- That's it- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

351
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,192
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

352
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,432
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

353
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,914
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

354
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,031
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

355
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,115
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

356
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,269
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

357
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,833
Wait!

358
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,232
Wait.

359
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,272
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

360
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,994
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

361
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,111
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

362
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,276
The queen wishes it.

363
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,230
She's curious about the planet.

364
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,632
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

365
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,598
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

366
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,388
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

367
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,317
The few spaceports like this one...

368
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,634
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

369
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,590
Like us.

370
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,552
Dissen berry, berry bad.

371
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,518
Icky, icky goo!

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,308
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

373
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,597
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,598
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,037
My droid has a readout of what I need.

376
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,277
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

377
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,197
We'll find what you need.

378
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,238
Don't touch anything.

379
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,913
- Are you an angel?
- What?

380
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,588
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

381
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,472
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

382
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,067
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

383
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,355
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

384
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,154
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

385
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,397
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

386
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,307
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

387
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,634
How long have you been here?

388
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,594
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

389
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,314
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

390
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,034
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

391
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,877
You're a slave?

392
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,959
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

393
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,674
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

394
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,078
- I got ya.
- Hey!

395
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,872
Hit the nose.

396
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,750
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

397
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,394
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

398
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,875
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

399
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,798
Saying of which...

400
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,194
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

401
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,276
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

402
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,152
Republic credits?

403
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,077
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

404
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,192
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

405
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:44,789
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

406
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,672
No, they won't!

407
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,792
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

408
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,992
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

409
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,030
No money, no parts, no deal.

410
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,517
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

411
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,192
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

412
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,596
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

413
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,554
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

414
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,432
I was glad to meet you too.

415
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,998
Yippee!

416
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,075
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

417
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,997
A few containers of supplies.

418
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,031
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

419
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,390
not in the amount
you're talking about.

420
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,317
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

421
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,759
I'll check back later.

422
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,112
Noah gain. Noah gain.

423
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,958
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

424
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:13,434
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

425
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,597
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

426
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,592
Are you going to pay for that?

427
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,317
It costs seven wupiupi.

428
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,673
Oops.

429
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,592
Who, mesa-

430
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,552
- Hi.
- Hi there.

431
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,398
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

432
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,317
He picked a fight with a Dug...

433
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,829
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

434
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,396
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

435
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,353
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

436
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,278
Thanks, my young friend.

437
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,277
But mesa doen nutten!

438
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,907
This storm will slow them down.

439
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,472
Looks pretty bad.

440
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,148
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

441
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,998
We'll be right there.

442
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,230
Here, you'll like these pallies.

443
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,827
- Here.
- Thank you.

444
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,155
My bones are aching.

445
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,637
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

446
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,478
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

447
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,068
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

448
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,474
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

449
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,309
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

450
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,795
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

451
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,068
Mom!

452
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,748
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

453
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,155
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

454
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,670
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

455
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,074
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

456
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,077
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

457
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,597
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

458
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:09,947
He's wonderful.

459
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,797
You really like him?

460
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,717
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

461
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,188
Where is everybody?

462
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,434
Whoops.

463
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,635
Oh, hello.

464
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,911
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

465
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,836
How might I serve you?

466
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,632
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

467
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,150
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

468
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,914
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

469
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,112
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

470
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,110
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

471
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,152
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

472
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,751
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

473
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,476
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

474
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,275
The death toll is catastrophic.

475
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,675
We must bow to their wishes.

476
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,755
You must contact me.

477
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,440
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

478
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,471
Send no transmissions of any kind.

479
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,432
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

480
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,347
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

481
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,835
Either way,
we're running out of time.

482
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,956
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

483
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,753
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

484
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,677
Move against the Jedi first.

485
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,393
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

486
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,317
to sign the treaty.

487
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,510
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

488
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,949
At last we will have revenge.

489
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,833
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

490
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,235
They will be no match for you.

491
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,753
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

492
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,677
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

493
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,155
- Any attempt to escape-
- And they blow you up!

494
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,552
How wude!

495
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,989
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

496
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,916
The Republic's antislavery laws-

497
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,269
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

498
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,469
We must survive on our own.

499
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,873
Xcuse me.

500
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,313
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

501
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,157
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

502
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,873
Very fast, very dangerous.

503
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,436
I'm the only human who can do it.

504
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,438
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

505
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,838
Don't do that again.

506
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,547
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

507
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,152
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

508
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,032
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

509
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,152
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

510
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,838
I don't think so.

511
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,030
No one can kill a Jedi.

512
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,795
I wish that were so.

513
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,876
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

514
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,036
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

515
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,356
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

516
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,632
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

517
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,958
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

518
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,958
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

519
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,990
on a very important mission.

520
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,032
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

521
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,630
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

522
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,911
I can help.
I can fix anything.

523
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,472
I believe you can.

524
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,273
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

525
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,994
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

526
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,510
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

527
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,757
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

528
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,074
Podracing.

529
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,998
Greed can be a powerful ally.

530
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,873
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

531
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,195
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

532
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,197
You could enter my pod.

533
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,032
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

534
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,956
You could make him think
it was yours...

535
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,195
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

536
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,833
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

537
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,349
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

538
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,516
But, Mom, I love it.

539
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:37,030
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

540
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,355
Anakin.

541
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,119
Your mother's right.

542
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,197
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

543
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,231
No.

544
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,556
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

545
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:04,952
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

546
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:06,911
We'll find some other way.

547
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,635
There is no other way.

548
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,911
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

549
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,556
He was meant to help you.

550
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,356
Are you sure about this?

551
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,994
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

552
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,076
The queen will not approve.

553
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,996
The queen doesn't need to know.

554
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,637
Well, I don't approve.

555
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,233
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

556
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,918
How can you do this?

557
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,190
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

558
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,389
My ship will be the entry fee.

559
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,518
Not bad!

560
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,472
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

561
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,751
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

562
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,268
What would the boy ride?

563
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,789
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

564
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,150
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

565
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,838
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

566
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,190
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

567
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,635
That you did.

568
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,432
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

569
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,949
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

570
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,672
The fastest ever built.

571
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,715
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

572
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:35,989
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

573
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,438
and I supply the boy.

574
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,268
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

575
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,197
If it's going to be 50-50...

576
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,833
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

577
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,916
If we win...

578
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,668
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

579
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,871
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

580
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,592
Either way, you win.

581
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,434
Deal!

582
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,958
What if this plan fails, Master?

583
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,673
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

584
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,233
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

585
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,590
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

586
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:35,597
And...

587
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,516
there's something about this boy.

588
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,309
You should be very proud of your son.

589
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,269
He gives without any thought
of reward.

590
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,152
He knows nothing of greed.

591
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,315
He has-

592
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,077
He has special powers.

593
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,949
Yes.

594
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:01,594
He can see things
before they happen.

595
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:04,393
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

596
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,317
It's a Jedi trait.

597
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,112
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

598
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,471
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

599
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,394
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

600
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,192
Who was his father?

601
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,630
There was no father.

602
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,237
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

603
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,469
I can't explain what happened.

604
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,797
Can you help him?

605
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,717
I don't know.

606
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,590
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

607
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:57,996
Wow, a real astro droid!

608
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,434
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

609
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:06,393
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

610
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:08,157
With this?

611
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,918
You're such a joker, Ani.

612
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,112
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

613
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,309
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

614
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,590
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

615
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,074
Keep away from
those energy binders.

616
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:33,510
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

617
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:34,958
Okay.

618
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,954
My tongue is fat.

619
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,038
My tongue- Wrench.

620
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,719
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

621
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,478
I'm stuck.

622
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,434
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

623
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:00,918
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

624
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,030
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

625
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,275
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

626
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,356
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

627
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,596
My mouth.

628
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:10,994
Ani, I'm stuck.

629
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,070
My tongue is fat.

630
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:21,032
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

631
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:25,115
Thank you.

632
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,592
Go.

633
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:43,989
It's working!
It's working!

634
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,588
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

635
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:00,474
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

636
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,396
Most of them.

637
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,396
Has anyone been to 'em all?

638
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:07,188
Not likely.

639
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,396
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

640
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,835
Ani, bedtime!

641
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,599
There we are.
Good as new.

642
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:19,472
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

643
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,876
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

644
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,478
Go on.

645
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,476
You have a big day tomorrow.

646
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,396
Sleep well, Ani.

647
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:32,951
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

648
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,673
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

649
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,438
Wait a minute.

650
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:40,956
I need a midi-chlorian count.

651
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,313
The reading is off the chart.

652
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,237
Over 20,000.

653
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,829
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

654
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,677
No Jedi has.

655
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,755
What does that mean?

656
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,157
I'm not sure.

657
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,992
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

658
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:09,791
Patience, my blue friend.

659
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,070
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

660
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,918
And we'll be far away from here.

661
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:17,918
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

662
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,271
I warn you, no funny business.

663
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,391
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

664
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,875
I have great faith in the boy.

665
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,036
He's a credit to your race...

666
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,231
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

667
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,952
Oh, no!

668
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,711
Why do you think that?

669
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,637
He always wins!

670
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:47,914
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

671
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,273
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

672
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,197
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

673
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,117
the boy and his mother.

674
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,789
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

675
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,351
The boy, then.

676
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,708
We'll let fate decide, huh?

677
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,115
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

678
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,152
Blue, it's the boy.

679
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,349
Red...

680
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,277
his mother.

681
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,909
You won this small toss,
outlander...

682
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,076
but you won't win the race!

683
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:39,190
So it makes little difference!

684
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,309
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

685
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,759
Good morning.

686
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,438
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

687
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,273
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

688
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,630
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

689
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,795
Do what?

690
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,831
Finish the race, of course.

691
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,632
You've never won a race?

692
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,353
Well, not exactly.

693
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,391
Not even finished?

694
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,875
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

695
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,956
Of course you will.

696
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,152
That's absolutely right.

697
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,114
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

698
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:08,710
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

699
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:13,438
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

700
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,235
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

701
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,398
Sebulba!

702
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,358
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

703
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,391
Mawhonic!

704
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,516
A hearty hello...

705
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:47,188
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

706
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,958
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

707
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:57,471
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

708
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:02,875
And hoping for a big win today...

709
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,231
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

710
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,036
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

711
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,387
a local boy.

712
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,150
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

713
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,039
Be safe.

714
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:44,389
I will, Mom. I promise.

715
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,916
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

716
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:18,597
Right.

717
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,074
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

718
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:28,795
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

719
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,478
I will.

720
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,715
May the Force be with you.

721
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,231
Jabba the Hutt.

722
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,271
Welcome.

723
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,317
Begin the race!

724
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,476
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

725
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,436
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

726
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,753
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not-

727
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,632
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

728
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,876
You should too.

729
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,990
You assume too much.

730
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,028
Start your engines.

731
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:12,916
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

732
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,347
Oh, no!

733
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,911
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

734
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,998
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

735
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:58,748
Come on, Ani!

736
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,432
And there goes Skywalker!

737
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:07,958
Go, Ani, go!

738
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,115
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

739
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:23,998
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

740
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,315
on the canyon dune turn.

741
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,628
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

742
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:09,356
Oh, no!

743
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,757
Where is Master Anakin?

744
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,996
Look. Here he comes.

745
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,989
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

746
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,193
Yay! Yippee!

747
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,835
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

748
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:45,476
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

749
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,827
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

750
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,237
Here he comes!

751
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,351
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

752
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,869
followed closely by Skywalker!

753
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,829
Go, Ani!

754
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,989
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

755
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,119
It's Skywalker!

756
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,313
Sebulba!

757
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,512
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

758
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:58,311
Did he crash-ed?

759
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,672
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

760
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:33,112
He's catching Sebulba!

761
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:36,588
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

762
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:07,994
That little human being
is out of his mind!

763
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:10,195
They're side by side!

764
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:39,476
- Yippee!
- Yay!

765
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:45,157
I can't believe it.

766
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,110
The crowds are going nuts!

767
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,635
Yay, Ani!

768
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,831
Mom, I did it! Yay!

769
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,717
Good going, Ani!

770
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,797
We owe you everything, Ani.

771
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,356
It's so wonderful, Ani.

772
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,074
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

773
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:29,315
I'm so very proud of you.

774
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,157
You!

775
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,474
You swindled me.

776
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,228
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

777
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,157
I lost everything.

778
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,670
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

779
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,155
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

780
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,237
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

781
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,510
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

782
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,469
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

783
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,989
I'm sure they can settle this.

784
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,237
Take him.

785
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,908
Hidoe!

786
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,470
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

787
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,588
I'm going back.

788
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,711
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

789
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,149
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

790
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,912
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

791
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:36,837
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

792
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,394
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

793
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,590
Come on. Hup!

794
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,837
Hey. These are yours.

795
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,953
Yes!

796
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:55,078
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

797
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,475
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

798
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,432
- And he has been freed.
- What?

799
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,278
You're no longer a slave.

800
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:05,951
Did you hear that?

801
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,074
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

802
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,751
You are free.

803
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:16,599
Will you take him with you?

804
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,278
Is he to become a Jedi?

805
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,833
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

806
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,231
Nothing happens by accident.

807
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,750
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

808
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,233
Anakin...

809
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,230
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

810
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,113
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

811
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,277
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

812
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,115
Can I go, Mom?

813
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,631
Anakin...

814
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,557
this path has been placed
before you.

815
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,034
The choice is yours alone.

816
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,356
I wanna do it.

817
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,956
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

818
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:07,832
What about Mom?

819
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,636
Is she free too?

820
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,115
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

821
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:18,997
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

822
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,877
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

823
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,274
It is time for you to let go.

824
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:35,395
I don't want things to change.

825
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,795
But you can't stop the change...

826
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,877
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

827
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,751
I love you.

828
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,997
Now hurry.

829
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,639
Thank you.

830
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,557
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

831
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,153
Will you be all right?

832
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,958
Yeah.

833
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,313
Hello, Master Anakin.

834
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:15,430
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

835
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,835
and I'm going away in a starship.

836
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,757
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

837
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,918
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

838
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,032
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

839
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,115
give you coverings and all.

840
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:31,797
I'm gonna miss working on you.

841
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,274
You've been a great pal.

842
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,913
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

843
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,668
Sell me?

844
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,358
Bye.

845
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:41,798
Oh, my.

846
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:07,555
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

847
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,591
Will I ever see you again?

848
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,752
What does your heart tell you?

849
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:20,871
I hope so.

850
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,396
Yes.

851
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,033
I guess.

852
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:28,507
Then we will
see each other again.

853
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:33,792
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

854
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,557
I promise.

855
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:46,313
Now, be brave...

856
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:48,990
and don't look back.

857
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,556
Don't look back.

858
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:35,354
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

859
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:37,152
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

860
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,430
Go!

861
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:43,270
Tell them to take off!

862
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:56,759
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

863
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,319
Take off.

864
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,671
Over there. Fly low.

865
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:25,278
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

866
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:26,878
What was it?

867
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,671
I'm not sure...

868
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,234
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

869
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:33,755
My guess is
it was after the queen.

870
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,269
What are we gonna do about it?

871
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,717
We shall be patient.

872
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,908
Anakin Skywalker...

873
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:42,757
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

874
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:47,514
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

875
01:14:56,119 --> 01:14:58,554
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

876
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,591
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

877
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,756
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

878
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,269
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

879
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:08,278
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

880
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,197
Take him away.

881
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,875
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

882
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,434
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

883
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,073
They will not
stay hidden for long.

884
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,274
The death toll is catastrophic.

885
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,913
We must bow to their wishes.

886
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:39,155
You must contact me.

887
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,551
You all right?

888
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,390
It's very cold.

889
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,679
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

890
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,074
A little too warm
for my taste.

891
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,350
Space is cold.

892
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:14,515
You seem sad.

893
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,789
The queen is worried.

894
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,229
Her people are suffering, dying.

895
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,716
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

896
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:27,314
I'm not sure what'll happen.

897
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,676
I made this for you...

898
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:33,917
so you'd remember me.

899
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,159
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

900
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:39,998
It'll bring you good fortune.

901
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:41,917
It's beautiful.

902
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:44,314
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

903
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,070
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

904
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,634
but my caring for you will remain.

905
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,231
I care for you, too, only I-

906
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:01,430
Miss your mother.

907
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:23,153
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

908
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:24,952
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

909
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:28,197
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

910
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:59,391
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

911
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,353
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

912
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:04,835
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

913
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,474
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

914
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,476
Welcome, Your Highness.

915
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,555
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

916
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,078
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

917
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,555
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

918
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,956
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

919
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:24,037
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

920
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,957
There is a question
of procedure...

921
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:28,469
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

922
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:31,350
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

923
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:34,153
The situation has become
much more complicated.

924
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,511
Ani, come on.

925
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:54,873
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

926
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,037
Pitty hot.

927
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,792
There is no civility,
only politics.

928
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:32,748
The Republic
is not what it once was.

929
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,908
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

930
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,956
There is no interest
in the common good.

931
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,358
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

932
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,073
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

933
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,793
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

934
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,716
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

935
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,956
the chancellor
has little real power.

936
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:57,788
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

937
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,515
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

938
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,993
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

939
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,235
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

940
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:09,430
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

941
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,311
and give us justice.

942
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:17,439
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

943
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,948
He has been
our strongest supporter.

944
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:25,073
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

945
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,396
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

946
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:31,270
Our people are dying, Senator.

947
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:34,917
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

948
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,429
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

949
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,948
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

950
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:42,469
for the time being.

951
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,150
That is something I cannot do.

952
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,667
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

953
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,554
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

954
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,998
Impossible.

955
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:03,680
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

956
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,792
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

957
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,876
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

958
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,752
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

959
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,952
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

960
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:18,671
May the Force be with you.

961
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,958
Master Qui-Gon.

962
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,518
More to say have you?

963
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,356
With your permission, my master...

964
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,717
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

965
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,711
A vergence, you say.

966
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,876
Located around a person?

967
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,194
A boy.

968
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:43,708
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

969
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,557
I have seen in a life-form.

970
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,432
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

971
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:53,788
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

972
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,595
You believe it's this boy?

973
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,188
- I don't presume to-
- But you do.

974
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,796
Revealed your opinion is.

975
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,876
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

976
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,992
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

977
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:11,395
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

978
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,670
I have no doubt of that.

979
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:22,036
Bring him before us, then.

980
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,476
The boy's here to see Padmé.

981
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,113
Let him in.

982
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,908
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

983
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,631
Who is it?

984
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:48,278
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

985
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:50,118
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

986
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,037
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

987
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:54,310
to start my training, I hope.

988
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:58,795
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

989
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,310
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

990
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:05,389
Thank you, Your Highness.

991
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,752
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

992
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:32,511
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

993
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,875
a tragedy has occurred...

994
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,355
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

995
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:42,358
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

996
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:44,390
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

997
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:46,592
This is outrageous!

998
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,154
I object
to the senator's statements.

999
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:53,158
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1000
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:56,988
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1001
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,030
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1002
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,957
who speaks on our behalf.

1003
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,359
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1004
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:12,435
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1005
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,313
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-

1006
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:18,829
I object!
There is no proof!

1007
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,756
This is incredible.

1008
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,667
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1009
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,028
The Congress of Malastare...

1010
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:29,037
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1011
01:24:29,159 --> 01:24:31,115
A commission must be appointed.

1012
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:33,628
- The point-
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1013
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,318
Enter the bureaucrat.

1014
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:37,953
The true rulers of the Republic.

1015
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:42,073
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1016
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:46,238
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1017
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,954
The point is conceded.

1018
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:52,594
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1019
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,393
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1020
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,317
I will not defer.

1021
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:00,796
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1022
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,797
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1023
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,479
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1024
01:25:09,319 --> 01:25:11,550
If this body
is not capable of action...

1025
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,636
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1026
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,036
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1027
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:21,070
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1028
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,909
Vote now! Vote now!

1029
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,390
Order!

1030
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,273
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1031
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,197
a strong chancellor...

1032
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,118
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1033
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,832
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1034
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,952
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1035
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,673
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1036
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,394
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1037
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:02,835
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1038
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,916
They will not go along
with you this time.

1039
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:08,828
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1040
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,319
A ship.

1041
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,756
A cup.

1042
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,597
A ship.

1043
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,078
A speeder.

1044
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:30,150
How feel you?

1045
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,311
Cold, sir.

1046
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,989
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1047
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:39,634
See through you we can.

1048
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,556
Be mindful of your feelings.

1049
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,319
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1050
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,273
I miss her.

1051
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:50,835
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1052
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,996
What has that got to do
with anything?

1053
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:55,350
Everything.

1054
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:58,391
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1055
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,273
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1056
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:04,596
Hate leads to suffering.

1057
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,677
I sense much fear in you.

1058
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:29,310
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1059
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:30,713
I don't know.

1060
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,796
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1061
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,115
I hope not.

1062
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,996
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1063
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:42,917
Wesa warriors.

1064
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,157
Wesa got a grand army.

1065
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:49,351
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1066
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:50,753
Your Highness?

1067
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:55,355
Your Highness...

1068
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:58,438
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1069
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,878
as supreme chancellor.

1070
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,708
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1071
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,037
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1072
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,752
Who else has been nominated?

1073
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,997
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1074
01:28:14,119 --> 01:28:18,829
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1075
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:22,390
I will be chancellor.

1076
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,988
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1077
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:28,192
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1078
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:30,117
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1079
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:33,630
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1080
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:38,988
Senator, this is your arena.

1081
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,190
I feel I must return to mine.

1082
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,515
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1083
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,470
Go back?

1084
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,432
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1085
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,835
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1086
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,632
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1087
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,273
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1088
01:28:57,399 --> 01:28:59,595
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1089
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,516
Stay here where it's safe.

1090
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,997
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1091
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,679
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1092
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,467
The Force is strong with him.

1093
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,430
He is to be trained, then?

1094
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:28,755
No, he will not be trained.

1095
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,471
No?

1096
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:34,395
He is too old.

1097
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,149
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1098
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:42,670
Clouded this boy's future is.

1099
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,551
I will train him, then.

1100
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,439
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1101
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,358
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1102
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:58,755
Impossible to take on a second.

1103
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,471
The code forbids it.

1104
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,831
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1105
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,430
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1106
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:10,913
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1107
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,677
but he is capable.

1108
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,711
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1109
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,828
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1110
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,427
Now is not the time for this.

1111
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:26,077
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1112
01:30:26,199 --> 01:30:28,760
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1113
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,952
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1114
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:34,274
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1115
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:38,597
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1116
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,319
This is the clue we need...

1117
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:43,908
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1118
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,716
May the Force be with you.

1119
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:02,113
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1120
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,037
From your point of view.

1121
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:07,390
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1122
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,273
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1123
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:12,675
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1124
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,597
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1125
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:24,635
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1126
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,876
You won't be, Ani.

1127
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,831
I'm not allowed to train you...

1128
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,916
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1129
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:33,030
Always remember:

1130
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,434
Your focus determines your reality.

1131
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,996
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1132
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,439
Master, sir...

1133
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,996
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1134
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:48,475
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?

1135
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,994
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1136
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:54,270
that resides
within all living cells.

1137
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,432
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1138
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,869
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1139
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,708
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1140
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,592
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1141
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,393
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1142
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,317
They continually speak to us...

1143
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:16,000
telling us the will of the Force.

1144
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:18,110
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1145
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,037
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1146
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,957
I don't understand.

1147
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,435
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1148
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:32,914
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1149
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,953
I welcome your help.

1150
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:38,628
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1151
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,637
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1152
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,512
Wesa goin' home!

1153
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,436
Come on, R2.

1154
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:58,555
Is the planet secure?

1155
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,389
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1156
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,478
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1157
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,636
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1158
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,557
things stay as they are.

1159
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:15,036
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1160
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:16,957
Yes, my lord.

1161
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:18,877
A Sith here?

1162
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:26,435
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1163
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,835
And those two control the pitch?

1164
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:32,157
You catch on pretty quick.

1165
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:33,952
As soon as we land...

1166
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:36,594
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1167
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,708
I agree.

1168
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,479
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1169
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,954
I will take back what's ours.

1170
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,789
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1171
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,716
We have no army.

1172
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,158
And I can only protect you.

1173
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:51,235
I can't fight a war for you.

1174
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,229
Jar Jar Binks.

1175
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:56,189
Mesa, Your Highness?

1176
01:33:56,319 --> 01:33:59,118
Yes. I need your help.

1177
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,275
I have one battleship on my scope.

1178
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:08,355
It's a droid control ship.

1179
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:10,595
They've probably spotted us.

1180
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,358
We haven't much time.

1181
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,159
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1182
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:27,507
Good.

1183
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,789
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1184
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,478
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1185
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:35,710
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1186
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,398
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1187
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:44,069
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1188
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,070
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1189
01:34:50,199 --> 01:34:51,997
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1190
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:55,960
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1191
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,837
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1192
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:14,595
Desa nobody dare!

1193
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,789
The Gungan city is deserted!

1194
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,354
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1195
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:22,438
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1196
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,789
More likely they were wiped out.

1197
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,832
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,Jar Jar?

1198
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,235
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1199
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:34,113
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1200
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:55,155
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1201
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,756
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1202
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,828
Jar Jar Binks.

1203
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:11,436
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1204
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,194
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1205
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,309
I come before you in peace.

1206
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:20,158
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1207
01:36:20,279 --> 01:36:23,317
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1208
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:26,988
Yousa all bombad.

1209
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,559
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1210
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,998
Your Honour.

1211
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:36,912
Whosa dis?

1212
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:39,155
I am Queen Amidala.

1213
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,273
This is my decoy...

1214
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:45,869
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1215
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,118
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1216
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:52,673
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1217
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,234
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1218
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,997
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1219
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:03,237
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1220
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:05,475
I ask you to help us.

1221
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,194
No, I beg you to help us.

1222
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:10,595
We are your humble servants.

1223
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,393
Our fate is in your hands.

1224
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:36,993
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1225
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:43,113
Mesa lika dis!

1226
01:37:44,119 --> 01:37:44,949
Maybe...

1227
01:37:45,079 --> 01:37:47,514
wesa...

1228
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,436
being friends.

1229
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,518
We've sent our patrols.

1230
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,949
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1231
01:38:03,079 --> 01:38:05,149
It won't be long, my lord.

1232
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,271
This is
an unexpected move for her.

1233
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:10,310
It's too aggressive.

1234
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:12,748
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1235
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,314
Let them make the first move.

1236
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:17,237
Yes, my master.

1237
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,231
Deysa comin!

1238
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:23,634
All right!

1239
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:28,717
They're here!

1240
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,158
Good. They made it.

1241
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,119
Yousa doen grand.

1242
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:40,198
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1243
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:42,117
Oh, no, no, no.

1244
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:45,073
So, wesa make you...

1245
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,588
bombad general.

1246
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,073
General?

1247
01:38:52,039 --> 01:38:53,439
Captain.

1248
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,028
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1249
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,957
Almost everyone's in camps.

1250
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:01,152
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1251
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:03,713
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1252
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,592
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1253
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,311
and much stronger.

1254
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,518
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1255
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,756
The battle is a diversion.

1256
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,632
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1257
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,238
R2.

1258
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:23,630
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1259
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,398
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1260
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,478
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1261
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,398
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1262
01:39:32,119 --> 01:39:34,792
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1263
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,511
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1264
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,710
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1265
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,229
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1266
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:43,555
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1267
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,195
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1268
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:51,470
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1269
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,591
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1270
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,516
We will send
what pilots we have...

1271
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,551
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1272
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,591
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1273
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,712
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1274
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,398
There's an even bigger danger.

1275
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,317
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1276
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:11,555
he will return
with another droid army.

1277
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,752
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1278
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,711
Everything depends on it.

1279
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,354
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1280
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:26,356
We are sending all troops...

1281
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,233
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1282
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:31,873
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1283
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,434
This will work to our advantage.

1284
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,233
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1285
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,637
Wipe them out.

1286
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,077
All of them.

1287
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,038
Halt!

1288
01:41:17,359 --> 01:41:19,510
Starting up the shield.

1289
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:48,988
Open fire.

1290
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:07,511
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1291
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,470
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1292
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,756
Roger, roger.

1293
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:37,471
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1294
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:39,953
This is too close.

1295
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,954
Ani, find cover.

1296
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:50,274
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1297
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,708
Fighters straight ahead.

1298
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,908
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1299
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:50,189
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1300
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,555
Cease fire.

1301
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,109
Steady. Steady.

1302
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,952
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1303
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,631
Ouch time.

1304
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:16,194
Fire!

1305
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,311
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1306
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:40,838
Red group! Blue group!

1307
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,677
Everybody, this way!

1308
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,756
Hey, wait for me!

1309
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,154
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1310
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:49,190
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1311
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,952
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1312
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:25,150
We gotta do something, R2.

1313
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:49,917
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1314
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:56,152
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1315
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,470
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1316
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:02,510
Yeah!

1317
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,113
Let's go!

1318
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,310
It's on automatic pilot.

1319
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:22,837
Try to override it.

1320
01:48:20,439 --> 01:48:22,270
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1321
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:29,912
Look, there they are.

1322
01:48:30,039 --> 01:48:32,314
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1323
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,154
Dumb droid. Take that!

1324
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:53,110
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1325
01:48:53,239 --> 01:48:54,354
Get off!

1326
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,274
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1327
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:16,792
This is tense!

1328
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,911
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1329
01:49:21,039 --> 01:49:22,837
It's gonna get us both killed.

1330
01:49:24,439 --> 01:49:26,748
You did it, R2!

1331
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,029
Let's go left.

1332
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:34,109
Go back?

1333
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:38,358
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1334
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,314
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1335
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,194
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1336
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:02,715
Go!

1337
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:08,997
Ascension guns!

1338
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,557
Retreat! Retreat!

1339
01:52:13,239 --> 01:52:15,070
Dis is nutsen.

1340
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,436
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1341
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:48,628
Give me a lift!

1342
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,113
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1343
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,070
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1344
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:01,077
Here. Taken dis one.

1345
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:17,875
Jar Jar!

1346
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,877
Jump,Jar Jar, jump!

1347
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:32,313
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1348
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,756
We're hit, R2!

1349
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:02,273
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1350
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:10,679
Everything's overheated.

1351
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:13,957
Oops. This is not good.

1352
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:25,555
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1353
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,476
Mesa think of something.

1354
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,918
Hands up.

1355
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:31,792
My give up. My give up.

1356
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:43,152
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1357
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:45,077
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1358
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:46,997
this pointless debate in the senate.

1359
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:48,792
Viceroy!

1360
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,751
Your occupation here has ended.

1361
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:55,511
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1362
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,238
Captain!

1363
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:14,076
Jam the doors.

1364
01:56:17,399 --> 01:56:20,153
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1365
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:23,149
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1366
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:27,309
Take this!

1367
01:57:29,239 --> 01:57:30,274
And this!

1368
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,511
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1369
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,391
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1370
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,838
Impossible!

1371
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,756
Nothing can get through our shield.

1372
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,717
Let's get outta here.

1373
01:57:55,439 --> 01:57:57,953
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1374
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,393
We didn't hit it.

1375
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:07,315
Now, this is Podracing.

1376
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,518
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1377
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:32,439
What the-

1378
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,676
Was'n they doing?

1379
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:38,235
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1380
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:42,109
They all broke-ed.

1381
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:31,791
No, it's too late.

1382
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:34,114
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1383
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,157
Promise-

1384
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:39,713
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1385
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,319
Yes, Master.

1386
01:59:45,239 --> 01:59:47,707
He is the chosen one.

1387
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,912
He will bring balance.

1388
01:59:52,079 --> 01:59:53,432
Train him.

1389
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,557
Now, Viceroy...

1390
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:24,956
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1391
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:29,791
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1392
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,350
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1393
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:48,277
And you, young Skywalker.

1394
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:52,190
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1395
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:00,913
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1396
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:04,315
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1397
02:01:04,439 --> 02:01:06,715
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1398
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:10,594
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1399
02:01:15,439 --> 02:01:19,671
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1400
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:24,315
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1401
02:01:24,439 --> 02:01:26,237
I do not.

1402
02:01:26,359 --> 02:01:28,350
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1403
02:01:31,159 --> 02:01:33,720
The chosen one the boy may be.

1404
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,398
Nevertheless...

1405
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,273
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1406
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:42,359
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1407
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:44,310
I will train Anakin.

1408
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:48,710
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1409
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:51,194
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1410
02:01:51,319 --> 02:01:53,150
Need that you do not.

1411
02:01:55,319 --> 02:01:58,436
Agree with you the council does.

1412
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,671
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1413
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:31,032
What will happen to me now?

1414
02:02:31,159 --> 02:02:34,072
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1415
02:02:34,199 --> 02:02:37,475
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1416
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:49,751
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1417
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:52,234
Always two there are.

1418
02:02:52,359 --> 02:02:55,431
No more, no less.

1419
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:58,358
A master and an apprentice.

1420
02:02:58,479 --> 02:02:59,958
But which was destroyed?

1421
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:02,912
The master or the apprentice?

1422
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,515
Hidoe, everybody!

1423
02:04:13,239 --> 02:04:15,070
Peace!
