1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Sazu489...

2
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,718
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

3
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,876
Very good, Lieutenant.

4
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,231
We made it.

5
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,192
I guess I was wrong.

6
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,436
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,078
Cordé.

8
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,192
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,070
I've failed you, Senator.

10
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,269
No.

11
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,709
Milady, you're still in danger here.

12
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,037
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,829
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,631
Senator Amidala, please.

15
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,718
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,199
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,038
If they do break away-

18
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,276
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

19
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,355
be split in two.

20
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,312
My negotiations will not fail.

21
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,870
If they do, you must realize...

22
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,990
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

23
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,473
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

24
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,518
Master Yoda...

25
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,000
do you think it will
really come to war?

26
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,557
The dark side clouds everything.

27
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,435
Impossible to see the future is.

28
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,271
<i>The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honour. </i>

29
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,355
Good.

30
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,836
Send them in.

31
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,678
We will discuss this matter later.

32
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,428
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform-

33
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,356
terrible.

34
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,069
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

35
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,793
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

36
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,310
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

37
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,156
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

38
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,988
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

39
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,952
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

40
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,389
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

41
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,954
But for certain, Senator...

42
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,754
in grave danger you are.

43
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,632
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

44
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,673
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

45
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,711
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

46
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,831
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe-

47
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,189
The situation is that serious?

48
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,637
No, but I do, Senator.

49
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,956
I realize all too well
that additional security...

50
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,389
might be disruptive for you...

51
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,079
<i>but perhaps someone
you're familiar with. </i>

52
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,028
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

53
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,312
That's possible.

54
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,079
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

55
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,235
Do it for me, milady. Please?

56
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,634
The thought of losing you...

57
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,276
is unbearable.

58
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,156
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

59
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,430
Thank you, Master Windu.

60
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,795
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

61
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,389
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,997
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,428
and I rescued you, remember?

64
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,831
Oh... yes.

65
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,959
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

66
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,029
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

67
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,713
Obi? Obi!

68
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,355
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

69
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,356
Senator Padmé.

70
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,915
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

71
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,634
Desa Jedi arriven.

72
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,954
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

73
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,435
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

74
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,112
Ani?

75
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,391
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

76
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,795
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

77
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Well, for a senator, I mean.

78
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,752
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

79
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,589
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

80
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,028
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

81
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,115
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

82
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,276
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

83
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,038
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

84
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

85
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,956
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

86
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,709
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,115
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

88
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,991
I promise you.

89
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,713
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

90
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,638
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

91
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,149
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

92
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,110
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,230
- Why?
- What?

94
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,588
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

95
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,836
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

96
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,678
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

97
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,917
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

98
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,197
<i>And you will learn
your place, young one. </i>

99
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,471
Perhaps with merely your presence...

100
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,398
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

101
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,988
Now, if you'll excuse me...

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,878
I will retire.

103
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,155
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

104
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,316
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

105
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,509
and I'll be in the control centre
downstairs.

106
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,957
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,072
She hardly even
recognized me, Jar Jar.

108
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,437
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

109
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,636
she's forgotten me completely.

110
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,317
Shesa happy.

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,715
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

112
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,469
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

113
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,109
She was pleased to see us.

114
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,116
Now, let's check the security.

115
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,755
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

116
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,029
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

117
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,071
My client is getting impatient.

118
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,918
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

119
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,316
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

120
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,830
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

121
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,791
No assassin would try that way.

122
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,793
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

123
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,999
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

124
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,476
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

125
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,110
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

126
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,037
What is she thinking?

127
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,038
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

128
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,628
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

129
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,912
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

130
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,951
You're using her as bait.

131
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,036
It was her idea.

132
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,594
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

133
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,552
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

134
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,830
Trust me.

135
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,756
It's too risky.

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,312
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

137
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,630
And yours are?

138
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,557
Possibly.

139
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,197
You look tired.

140
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,797
I don't sleep well any more.

141
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,308
Because of your mother?

142
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,952
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

143
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,431
Dreams pass in time.

144
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,394
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

145
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,513
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

146
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,995
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

147
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,315
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

148
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,395
a commitment not easily broken.

149
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,158
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

150
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,748
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

151
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,916
It is my experience
that senators focus...

152
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,793
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

153
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,909
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

154
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,110
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

155
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,913
At least not
on the economics of politics.

156
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,874
And besides, you're generalizing.

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,956
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

158
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,638
Palpatine is a politician.

159
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,274
I have observed
that he is very clever...

160
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,187
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

161
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,116
I think he's a good man-

162
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,037
I sense it too.

163
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,440
Stay here!

164
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,591
Are you all right, milady?

165
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,788
What the-

166
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,672
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,149
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

168
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,033
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

169
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,390
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

170
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,192
If you spent as long practising your
sabre techniques as you do your wit...

171
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,957
<i>you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman. </i>

172
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,672
I thought I already did.

173
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,394
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

174
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,028
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

175
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,915
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

176
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,111
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

177
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,913
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

178
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,913
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

179
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,115
stay away from power couplings!

180
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,993
That was good!

181
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,308
Where are you going?
He went that way.

182
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,351
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

183
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,391
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

184
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,593
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

185
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,279
This is a short cut... I think.

186
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,711
Well, you've lost him.

187
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,195
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

188
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,116
That was some short cut, Anakin.

189
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,548
He went completely the other way.

190
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,635
- Once again you've proved-
- If you'll excuse me.

191
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,548
I hate it when he does that.

192
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,152
Anakin!

193
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,952
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

194
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:00,435
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

195
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,199
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,992
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

197
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,874
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

198
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,559
<i>Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?</i>

199
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,271
Don't say that, Master.

200
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,355
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

201
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,231
Then why don't you listen to me?

202
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,873
I am trying.

203
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,351
Can you see him?

204
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,310
I think he is a she...

205
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
and I think she is a changeling.

206
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,114
In that case, be extra careful.

207
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,388
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

208
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,919
For a drink.

209
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,832
Thank you.

210
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,836
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

211
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,790
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

212
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,911
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

213
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,269
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

214
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,708
Easy.

215
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,875
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

216
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,753
<i>Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?</i>

217
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,117
It was a senator from Naboo.

218
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,753
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

219
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,990
Who hired you? Tell us.

220
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,351
Tell us now!

221
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,031
It was a bounty hunter called-

222
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,397
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo. </i>

223
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,352
Toxic dart.

224
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:56,239
<i>Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan. </i>

225
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:59,635
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

226
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,469
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

227
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,397
Handle that your Padawan will.

228
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,549
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

229
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,229
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

230
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,237
Travel as refugees.

231
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,113
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

232
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,515
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

233
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,159
Until caught this killer is...

234
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,192
our judgement she must respect.

235
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,631
Anakin, go to the senate...

236
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,797
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

237
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,191
I will talk with her.

238
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,278
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

239
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,470
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

240
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,556
Thank you, Your Excellency.

241
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,876
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

242
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,876
Your patience has paid off.

243
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,194
Your guidance
more than my patience.

244
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,549
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

245
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,718
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

246
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,590
Then you will be invincible.

247
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,396
I have said it many times:

248
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,159
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

249
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,076
Thank you, Your Excellency.

250
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,714
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

251
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,273
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

252
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,151
I am concerned for my Padawan.

253
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,874
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

254
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,072
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

255
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,076
The boy has exceptional skills.

256
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,509
But he still has much to learn, Master.

257
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,915
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

258
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,916
Yes.

259
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,837
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

260
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,154
Too sure of themselves they are.

261
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:01,556
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

262
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,069
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

263
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,670
<i>your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance. </i>

264
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,313
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

265
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,432
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

266
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,313
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

267
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,751
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

268
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,192
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and-

269
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,753
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

270
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,757
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

271
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,597
Of course.

272
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,393
Milady.

273
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,596
I do not like this idea of hiding.

274
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,669
Don't worry.

275
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,915
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

276
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,599
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

277
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,472
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

278
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,556
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

279
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,635
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

280
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,193
and do what is requested of us.

281
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,628
Anakin, you've grown up.

282
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,749
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

283
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,873
Don't get me wrong.

284
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,719
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

285
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,229
As wise as Master Yoda and...

286
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,395
as powerful as Master Windu.

287
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,989
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

288
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,991
In some ways-
a lot of ways-

289
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,836
I'm really ahead of him.

290
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,311
I'm ready for the trials...

291
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,671
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

292
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,631
He won't let me move on.

293
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,630
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

294
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,432
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

295
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,789
He doesn't understand.

296
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,911
It's not fair!

297
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,635
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

298
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,671
It's the only way we grow.

299
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,073
I know.

300
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,911
Anakin...

301
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,588
don't try to grow up too fast.

302
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,550
But I am grown up.

303
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,557
You said it yourself.

304
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,631
Please don't look at me like that.

305
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,999
Why not?

306
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,155
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

307
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,957
Sorry, milady.

308
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,278
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

309
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,311
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

310
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,317
He'll be safe with me.

311
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,117
You'll be fine.

312
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,277
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

313
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,630
<i>What if they realize
you've left the capital?</i>

314
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,911
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

315
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,836
Anakin...

316
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,917
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

317
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,871
Yes, Master.

318
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,388
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

319
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,351
You'll be back here in no time.

320
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,551
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

321
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,477
- It's time to go.
- I know.

322
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,989
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

323
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,076
May the Force be with you, Master.

324
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,876
Suddenly I'm afraid.

325
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,435
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

326
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,796
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

327
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,394
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

328
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,430
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

329
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,990
Someone to see ya, honey!

330
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,237
Jedi, by the looks of him.

331
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,792
Obi-Wan!

332
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,067
Hello, Dex.

333
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,667
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

334
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,833
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

335
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,390
Old buddy!

336
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,198
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

337
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,071
You can tell me what this is.

338
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,592
Well, whattaya know!

339
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,994
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

340
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,192
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

341
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,628
Can you tell me
where it came from?

342
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,593
This baby belongs to them cloners.

343
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,837
What you got here
is a Kamino sabredart.

344
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,792
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

345
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,037
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

346
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,913
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

347
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,190
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

348
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,549
for the difference
between knowledge and...

349
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,238
wisdom.

350
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,270
Well, if droids could think...

351
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,355
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

352
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,150
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

353
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,156
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

354
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,637
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

355
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,116
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

356
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,556
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

357
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,432
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

358
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,518
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

359
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,750
Depends on what, Dex?

360
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,598
On how good your manners are...

361
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,837
and how big your... pocketbook is.

362
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,708
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

363
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,875
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

364
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,116
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

365
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,390
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

366
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,637
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

367
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,990
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

368
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,952
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

369
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,070
just south of the Rishi Maze.

370
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,916
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

371
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,836
doesn't exist.

372
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,076
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

373
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,112
If an item does not appear
in our records...

374
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,230
it does not exist.

375
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,269
Hey, you! No droids!

376
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,436
Get outta here!

377
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,797
Thank you, R2.

378
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,313
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

379
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,148
<i>not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like. </i>

380
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,316
Or be with the people that I love.

381
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,151
Are you allowed to love?

382
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,031
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

383
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,634
Attachment is forbidden.

384
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,156
Possession is forbidden.

385
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,715
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

386
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,148
is central to a Jedi's life.

387
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,711
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

388
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,670
You've changed so much.

389
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,233
You haven't changed a bit.

390
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,079
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

391
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,789
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

392
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,480
Use your feelings you must.

393
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,597
Younglings. Younglings!

394
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,028
A visitor we have.

395
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,913
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

396
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,393
Hello.

397
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,952
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

398
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,309
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

399
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,472
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

400
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,592
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

401
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,838
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

402
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,836
How embarrassing!

403
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,070
Liam, the shades.

404
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,708
Gather round the map reader.

405
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,909
Clear your minds...

406
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,349
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

407
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,512
It ought to be here...

408
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,436
but it isn't.

409
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:40,835
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

410
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,391
Gravity's silhouette remains...

411
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,318
but the star and all the planets...

412
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,351
disappeared they have.

413
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,516
How can this be?

414
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,237
A thought?

415
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,916
Anyone.

416
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,713
Master?

417
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,592
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

418
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,509
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

419
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,436
The Padawan is right.

420
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,472
Go to the centre of gravity's pull...

421
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,909
and find your planet you will.

422
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,998
The data must have been erased.

423
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,951
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

424
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,311
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

425
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,592
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

426
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,996
But who and why, harder to answer.

427
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,759
Meditate on this I will.

428
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,795
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

429
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,356
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

430
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,311
I'm not sure I was ready.

431
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,873
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

432
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,235
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

433
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,315
so you could stay in office.

434
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,795
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

435
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,434
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

436
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,471
I couldn't refuse her.

437
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,956
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

438
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,036
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

439
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,150
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

440
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,032
It's unthinkable!

441
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,391
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

442
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,875
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

443
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,990
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

444
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,190
Not if they feel threatened.

445
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,516
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

446
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,516
It's outrageous...

447
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,789
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

448
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,548
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

449
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,514
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

450
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,630
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

451
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,119
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

452
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,800
Let's pray that day never comes.

453
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,480
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

454
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,429
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

455
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,757
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

456
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,632
- But I was thinking-
- Hold on a minute.

457
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,954
Excuse me.

458
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,389
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

459
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,635
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

460
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,672
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

461
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,273
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

462
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,277
I think it would be wise...

463
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,675
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

464
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,831
Sorry, milady.

465
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,956
Perfect. It's settled, then.

466
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,954
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

467
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,831
Our missing planet Kamino.

468
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,237
Master Jedi.

469
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,550
The prime minister is expecting you.

470
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,034
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

471
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,070
He is anxious to meet you.

472
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,269
After all these years...

473
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,835
<i>we were beginning to think
you weren't coming. </i>

474
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,076
Now, please, this way.

475
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,715
May I present Lama Su...

476
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,795
prime minister of Kamino.

477
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,436
And this is Master Jedi-

478
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,476
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

479
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,751
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

480
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,036
Please.

481
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,710
And now to business.

482
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,594
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

483
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,476
200,000 units are ready...

484
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,829
with a million more
well on the way.

485
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,791
That's good news.

486
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,911
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

487
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,237
that his order will be met on time.

488
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,237
I'm sorry. Master-

489
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,793
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

490
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,911
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

491
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,668
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

492
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,469
I'm so sorry to hear that.

493
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,672
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

494
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,030
The army?

495
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:44,630
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

496
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,876
one of the finest we've ever created.

497
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,876
Tell me, Prime Minister...

498
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,355
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

499
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,516
did he say who it was for?

500
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,550
Of course he did.

501
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,239
This army is for the Republic.

502
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,516
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

503
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,996
That's why I'm here.

504
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,036
We used to come here
for school retreat.

505
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:31,710
We would swim
to that island every day.

506
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,876
I love the water.

507
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,909
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

508
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,233
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

509
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,911
I don't like sand.

510
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,195
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

511
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,476
and it gets everywhere.

512
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,556
Not like here.

513
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,036
Here, everything is soft...

514
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,190
and smooth.

515
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,871
No.

516
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,476
I shouldn't have done that.

517
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,036
I'm sorry.

518
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,637
Very impressive.

519
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,795
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

520
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,188
Clones can think creatively.

521
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,028
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

522
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,829
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programmes.

523
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,157
This group was created
about five years ago.

524
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,235
You mentioned growth acceleration.

525
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,190
Oh, yes, it's essential.

526
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,197
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

527
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,788
Now we can do it in half the time.

528
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,434
I see.

529
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:43,356
They are totally obedient...

530
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,039
taking any order without question.

531
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,115
We modified their genetic structure...

532
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,311
to make them less independent
than the original host.

533
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,873
And who was the original host?

534
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,990
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

535
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:59,510
And where is this bounty hunter now?

536
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,675
Oh, we keep him here.

537
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,958
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

538
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,434
Fett demanded only one thing:

539
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:12,027
an unaltered clone for himself.

540
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,469
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

541
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,989
Pure genetic replication.

542
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,112
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

543
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,673
and no growth acceleration.

544
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,916
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

545
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,157
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

546
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,713
Magnificent, aren't they?

547
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,351
I don't know.

548
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,590
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

549
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:01,949
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

550
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,070
They only work on the weak-minded.

551
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,998
All right.

552
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,190
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

553
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,675
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

554
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,711
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

555
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,070
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

556
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:19,110
All right, I get the picture.

557
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,277
Whatever happened to him?

558
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,994
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

559
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,076
Maybe he was the smart one.

560
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:28,349
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

561
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,516
I like two or three...

562
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,630
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

563
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,471
I don't think the system works.

564
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,155
How would you have it work?

565
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,309
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

566
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,148
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

567
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,032
and then do it.

568
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,831
That's exactly what we do.

569
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,871
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

570
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,797
Well, then they should be made to.

571
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,831
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

572
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,916
- You?
- Of course not me.

573
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,873
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

574
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,628
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

575
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,230
Well, if it works.

576
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,757
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

577
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,313
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

578
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,188
Ani, are you all right?

579
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,952
Boba, is your father here?

580
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,914
Yep.

581
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:43,996
May we see him?

582
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,791
Sure.

583
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,396
Dad, Taun We's here.

584
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:05,394
Jango, welcome back.

585
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:07,550
Was your trip productive?

586
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,510
Fairly.

587
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:13,268
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

588
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,072
He's come to check on our progress.

589
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,152
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

590
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,157
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

591
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,795
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

592
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,675
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

593
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,351
Possibly.

594
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,471
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

595
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,831
<i>Boba, rood eht so-heeck. </i>

596
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,353
Master who?

597
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:47,233
Sifo-Dyas.

598
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,873
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

599
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,516
Never heard of him.

600
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,068
Really?

601
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,432
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

602
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:04,913
Curious.

603
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,916
Do you like your army?

604
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,597
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

605
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,032
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

606
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:20,195
Thank you for your time, Jango.

607
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,911
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

608
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:44,670
What is it, Dad?

609
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,911
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

610
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,757
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

611
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,835
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

612
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:02,277
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

613
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,751
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

614
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,036
From the moment I met you...

615
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,190
all those years ago...

616
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,478
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

617
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,394
And now that I'm with you again...

618
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:02,030
I'm in agony.

619
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,994
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

620
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,429
The thought of not being with you-

621
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,110
I can't breathe.

622
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,670
I'm haunted by the kiss...

623
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,632
that you should never have given me.

624
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:25,275
My heart is beating...

625
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,197
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

626
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,072
You are in my very soul...

627
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,155
tormenting me.

628
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,876
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

629
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,835
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

630
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,436
I can't.

631
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,431
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

632
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,393
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

633
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:07,476
No, you listen.

634
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,516
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

635
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:15,155
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

636
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,355
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

637
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,835
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

638
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:25,195
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

639
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,231
Then you do feel something.

640
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,237
<i>I will not let you give up
your future for me. </i>

641
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,429
You are asking me to be rational.

642
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,670
That is something
I know I cannot do.

643
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,237
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

644
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,271
but I can't.

645
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,793
I will not give in to this.

646
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:54,755
Well, you know...

647
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,552
it wouldn't have to be that way.

648
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,398
We could keep it a secret.

649
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,677
We'd be living a lie...

650
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,994
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

651
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,230
I couldn't do that.

652
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,112
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

653
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,878
No. You're right.

654
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,197
It would destroy us.

655
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,108
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

656
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,478
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

657
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:37,592
it will take more time to grow them.

658
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:39,391
I won't forget, and thank you.

659
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,271
Thank you.

660
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,911
R4!

661
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,190
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

662
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:11,670
<i>I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino. </i>

663
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,509
<i>They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army. </i>

664
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,994
<i>I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter... </i>

665
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:20,110
<i>is the assassin we are looking for. </i>

666
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:22,117
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

667
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,195
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

668
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,072
<i>No, Master.
There appears to be no motive. </i>

669
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,952
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

670
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,913
Clear your mind must be...

671
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,032
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

672
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,911
<i>Yes, Master. </i>

673
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:41,952
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army... </i>

674
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,516
<i>at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago. </i>

675
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,998
<i>I was under the impression
he was killed before that. </i>

676
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,476
<i>Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?</i>

677
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,396
No. Whoever placed that order...

678
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,670
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

679
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,269
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

680
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,313
<i>Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him. </i>

681
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,349
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

682
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,516
we could not see.

683
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,829
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

684
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,916
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

685
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,911
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

686
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:28,190
If informed the senate is...

687
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,675
multiply our adversaries will.

688
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:33,797
No.

689
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,996
Mom, no.

690
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,556
Don't go.

691
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:12,396
I don't want to disturb you.

692
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:15,556
Your presence is soothing.

693
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,351
You had another nightmare last night.

694
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:23,795
Jedi don't have nightmares.

695
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,231
I heard you.

696
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,871
I saw my mother.

697
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,751
She is suffering, Padmé.

698
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:43,192
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

699
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,474
She is in pain.

700
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,751
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

701
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,791
but I have to go.

702
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,550
I have to help her.

703
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,030
I'll go with you.

704
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:13,309
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

705
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,757
Dad, look!

706
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,668
Boba, get on board!

707
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,478
Oh, not good.

708
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,112
Wait right there.

709
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:51,150
Okey-okey.

710
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,032
<i>Chut-chut, Watto. </i>

711
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,110
Let me help you with that.

712
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:03,391
What? What do you want?

713
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,875
Wait! You're a Jedi!

714
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,036
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

715
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:16,590
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

716
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,838
Ani?

717
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,351
Little Ani?

718
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:29,077
Nahhh.

719
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,393
You are Ani! It is you!

720
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,876
You sure sprouted, huh?

721
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:41,114
AJedi! Whattaya know!

722
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:47,949
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

723
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,478
My mother.

724
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,989
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

725
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,472
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

726
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:58,795
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

727
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,878
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

728
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,554
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

729
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,590
At least I think it was Lars.

730
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:12,076
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

731
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:14,394
Can ya beat that, eh?

732
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,755
Do you know where they are now?

733
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,630
Long way from here.

734
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,038
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

735
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:28,070
I'd like to know.

736
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:32,318
Sure. Absolutely!

737
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,315
Let's go look at my records, huh?

738
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,472
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

739
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,876
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

740
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,150
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

741
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,998
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

742
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,436
Seismic charges!

743
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:27,833
Stand by.

744
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:54,679
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

745
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,719
Watch out!

746
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,273
Get him, Dad! Fire!

747
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,554
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

748
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,233
We got him!

749
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,271
We'll just have to finish him.

750
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:30,550
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

751
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,039
Fire them now!

752
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:51,074
We won't be seeing him again.

753
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:26,119
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

754
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,628
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

755
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,150
Stay with the ship, R2.

756
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,908
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C-

757
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:45,837
3PO?

758
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,391
The maker!

759
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,078
Master Ani!

760
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:53,872
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

761
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,637
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

762
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,273
Hello, 3PO.

763
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,109
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

764
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:03,117
I've come to see my mother.

765
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,836
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

766
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,992
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

767
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:16,314
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

768
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,078
Owen Lars.

769
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,270
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

770
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,310
I'm Padmé.

771
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,954
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

772
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,832
<i>I had a feeling
you might show up someday. </i>

773
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,238
Is my mother here?

774
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,997
No, she's not.

775
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:35,797
Cliegg Lars.

776
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,831
Shmi is my wife.

777
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,797
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

778
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:52,078
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

779
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:54,953
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

780
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,672
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

781
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,030
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

782
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,109
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

783
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,037
when they took her.

784
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,555
Those Tuskens walk like men...

785
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,070
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

786
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,752
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

787
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,639
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

788
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,153
I just couldn't ride any more
until I heal.

789
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,877
I don't want to give up on her...

790
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,719
but she's been gone a month.

791
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,717
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

792
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,197
Where are you going?

793
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,636
To find my mother.

794
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,519
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

795
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,632
You're gonna have to stay here.

796
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,319
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

797
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:33,317
I won't be long.

798
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,751
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

799
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,154
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

800
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:24,953
What about the senator
from Naboo?

801
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,515
Is she dead yet?

802
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:31,953
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

803
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,274
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

804
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:37,311
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

805
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,476
<i>you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy. </i>

806
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,756
As I explained to you earlier...

807
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,952
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

808
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:58,752
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

809
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,478
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

810
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:05,037
The Techno Union army...

811
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,798
is at your disposal, Count.

812
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,996
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

813
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,917
Good. Very good.

814
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,275
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

815
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,994
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

816
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,152
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

817
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,554
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

818
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,229
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

819
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,511
Mom?

820
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,716
Ani?

821
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,637
Ani?

822
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,398
Is it you?

823
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,956
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

824
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:57,912
You look so handsome.

825
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,190
My son.

826
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:05,958
My grown-up son.

827
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,590
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

828
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,551
I missed you.

829
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,190
Now I am complete.

830
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,877
I love y-

831
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,032
Stay with me, Mom. Everything-

832
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:31,115
I love-

833
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,954
I love-

834
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,676
<i>Anakin!</i>

835
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:33,599
<i>No!</i>

836
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:54,717
What is it?

837
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,069
Pain, suffering...

838
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,551
death I feel.

839
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,912
Something terrible has happened.

840
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,358
Young Skywalker is in pain...

841
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:16,277
terrible pain.

842
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,350
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

843
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,073
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

844
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,511
We'll have to try something else.

845
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:35,993
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

846
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:37,912
It's much closer.

847
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,869
Anakin, do you copy?

848
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,832
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

849
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,189
He's not on Naboo, R4.

850
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,750
I'm going to try and widen the range.

851
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:55,917
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

852
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:04,917
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

853
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:07,395
but it's coming from Tatooine.

854
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,387
What in the blazes is he doing there?

855
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,396
I told him to stay on Naboo.

856
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,349
We haven't got much time.

857
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:20,435
Anakin, do you copy?

858
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,515
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

859
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:31,951
<i>Retransmit this message-</i>

860
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,474
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

861
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,829
<i>My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out. </i>

862
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,189
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant. </i>

863
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,831
I brought you something.

864
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,996
Are you hungry?

865
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,556
The shifter broke.

866
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:36,033
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

867
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:41,756
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

868
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,877
But I couldn't-

869
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,551
Why'd she have to die?

870
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,911
Why couldn't I save her?

871
01:20:57,039 --> 01:20:58,996
I know I could have!

872
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,154
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

873
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,319
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

874
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,871
Someday I will be.

875
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,713
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

876
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,315
I promise you.

877
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:22,270
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

878
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,707
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

879
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,796
He's holding me back!

880
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,956
What's wrong, Ani?

881
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,157
I killed them.

882
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,716
I killed them all.

883
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:57,277
They're dead.

884
01:21:57,399 --> 01:21:59,390
Every single one of them.

885
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:03,356
And not just the men...

886
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:07,150
but the women...

887
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:09,110
and the children too.

888
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:11,996
They're like animals...

889
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:14,350
and I slaughtered them like animals!

890
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,831
I hate them!

891
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,837
To be angry is to be human.

892
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,756
I'm a Jedi.

893
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,636
I know I'm better than this.

894
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:59,391
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

895
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,430
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

896
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:09,235
Goodbye, my darling wife.

897
01:23:13,079 --> 01:23:14,911
And thank you.

898
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,270
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

899
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,476
I wasn't strong enough.

900
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,077
But I promise I won't fail again.

901
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,555
I miss you...

902
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,711
so much.

903
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:19,960
R2? What are you doing here?

904
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,798
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

905
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,752
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

906
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,149
<i>Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out. </i>

907
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:37,430
<i>Retransmit this message
to Coruscant. </i>

908
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,876
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett... </i>

909
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,036
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis. </i>

910
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,630
<i>The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here... </i>

911
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,671
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray... </i>

912
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,109
<i>is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala. </i>

913
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,275
<i>The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance... </i>

914
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:00,914
<i>have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming-</i>

915
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:02,996
<i>Wait. </i>

916
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:17,837
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

917
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,631
I agree.

918
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,149
<i>We will deal with Count Dooku. </i>

919
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,670
<i>The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are. </i>

920
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,394
<i>Protect the senator at all costs. </i>

921
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,953
<i>That is your first priority. </i>

922
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:35,277
Understood, Master.

923
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:37,310
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

924
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,351
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

925
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:44,470
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

926
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,476
If he's still alive.

927
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:50,833
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

928
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,349
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

929
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,034
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

930
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:01,231
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

931
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:03,475
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

932
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,189
<i>If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along. </i>

933
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:15,117
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

934
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,797
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

935
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,796
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

936
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,150
The debate is over.

937
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,113
Now we need that clone army.

938
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,037
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

939
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:41,469
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

940
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,271
before the separatists attack.

941
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:45,197
This is a crisis.

942
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:48,278
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

943
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:51,358
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

944
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,750
But what senator would have
the courage...

945
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,314
to propose such a radical amendment?

946
01:26:56,439 --> 01:27:00,353
If only Senator Amidala were here.

947
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,631
Traitor.

948
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,157
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

949
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:28,235
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

950
01:27:28,359 --> 01:27:30,828
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

951
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,427
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

952
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,836
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

953
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,430
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

954
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,189
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

955
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:46,628
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

956
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,512
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

957
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,436
Do you know him?

958
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,993
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

959
01:27:54,119 --> 01:27:55,951
The Geonosians don't trust them.

960
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:58,832
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

961
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,912
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

962
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,914
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

963
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,555
I wish he were still alive.

964
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,554
I could use his help right now.

965
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,756
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

966
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,233
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

967
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:27,793
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

968
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,876
just as you were once his.

969
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,916
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

970
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:35,917
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

971
01:28:36,039 --> 01:28:38,679
- The truth?
- The truth.

972
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,990
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

973
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:50,076
of the dark lord of the Sith?

974
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,918
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

975
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:57,113
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

976
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,634
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

977
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,150
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

978
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,752
I don't believe you.

979
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,109
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

980
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:13,311
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

981
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,835
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

982
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,917
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

983
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,836
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

984
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,787
and together we will destroy the Sith!

985
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:33,675
I will never join you, Dooku.

986
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,597
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

987
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:55,872
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

988
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,514
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

989
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,757
Senators, "dellow felagates":

990
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,713
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

991
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,354
mesa propose that the senate...

992
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,949
give immediately emergency powers...

993
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:16,594
to the supreme chancellor.

994
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,555
Palpatine! Palpatine!

995
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,636
Order! We shall have order!

996
01:30:30,279 --> 01:30:33,430
It is with great reluctance...

997
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,551
that I have agreed to this calling.

998
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,667
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

999
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,590
The power you give me...

1000
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:48,032
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1001
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:56,956
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1002
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:01,278
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1003
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:04,994
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1004
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:08,117
It is done, then.

1005
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:16,715
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1006
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,548
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1007
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,109
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1008
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,876
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1009
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,956
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1010
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,676
That'll do.

1011
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,557
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1012
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,671
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1013
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,596
As a member of the senate...

1014
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,439
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1015
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,676
Don't worry.

1016
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,114
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1017
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,752
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1018
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,676
they would have asked for it.

1019
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,792
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behaviour.

1020
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,676
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1021
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,148
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1022
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,396
"What does that mean?"

1023
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,113
That means I am in charge here!

1024
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:09,797
Where are you going now?

1025
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,275
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1026
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,231
Idiot!

1027
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,032
Please wait.

1028
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,631
Do you know where you're going?

1029
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,318
Wait.

1030
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,637
Oh, my goodness!

1031
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,238
Shut me down!

1032
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:54,197
Machines making machines.

1033
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:55,719
How perverse!

1034
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,993
Calm down, R2!

1035
01:34:58,119 --> 01:35:00,475
I almost fell.

1036
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,476
You'll get your chance-

1037
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:06,152
I'm scrap.

1038
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,475
It's a nightmare!

1039
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,077
I want to go home!

1040
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,356
What did I do to deserve this?

1041
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,796
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1042
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,194
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1043
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,033
Oh, no!

1044
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:12,637
Uh-oh.

1045
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:17,997
I'm so confused.

1046
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:10,912
Not again!

1047
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:13,117
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1048
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,233
Don't move, Jedi!

1049
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:24,792
Take him away.

1050
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:44,792
Don't be afraid.

1051
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:48,390
I'm not afraid to die.

1052
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:56,998
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1053
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,673
What are you talking about?

1054
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:04,076
I love you.

1055
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,596
You love me?

1056
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,997
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1057
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,557
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1058
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:25,278
and that it would destroy our lives.

1059
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,310
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1060
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:34,992
I truly...

1061
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,269
deeply love you...

1062
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:41,908
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1063
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,234
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1064
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:42,271
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1065
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,356
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1066
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:48,759
Good job.

1067
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,511
Settle down. Settle down.

1068
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:10,908
Let the executions begin.

1069
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:45,158
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1070
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,069
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1071
01:42:12,199 --> 01:42:14,235
She seems to be on top of things.

1072
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,278
She can't do that!

1073
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:18,230
Shoot her... or something!

1074
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,193
Jump!

1075
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:01,710
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1076
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,398
Jango! Finish her off!

1077
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,591
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1078
01:45:36,199 --> 01:45:37,599
Master Windu.

1079
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,914
How pleasant of you to join us.

1080
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:41,951
This party's over.

1081
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,149
Brave...

1082
01:45:57,279 --> 01:45:59,510
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1083
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,391
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1084
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,750
I don't think so.

1085
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,233
We'll see.

1086
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:44,868
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1087
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,354
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1088
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:27,550
There's been some terrible mistake!

1089
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,274
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1090
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:55,992
Die, Jedi dogs!

1091
01:48:56,119 --> 01:48:57,792
Oh! What did I say?

1092
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:09,671
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1093
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,917
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1094
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,155
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1095
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:41,957
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1096
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:01,550
R2, what are you doing here?

1097
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,913
What are you doing?

1098
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:08,554
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1099
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,351
My neck!

1100
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,471
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1101
01:50:20,279 --> 01:50:22,235
I'm quite beside myself.

1102
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,671
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1103
01:50:35,079 --> 01:50:37,469
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1104
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:00,877
Master Windu...

1105
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,115
<i>you have fought gallantly... </i>

1106
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:08,118
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1107
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,228
Now...

1108
01:51:12,199 --> 01:51:14,475
it is finished.

1109
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,351
Surrender...

1110
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,194
and your lives will be spared.

1111
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:22,997
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1112
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:24,109
Then...

1113
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,511
I'm sorry, old friend.

1114
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,113
Look!

1115
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:54,427
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1116
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,557
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1117
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,636
If Dooku escapes...

1118
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,309
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1119
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,431
Hold on!

1120
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,676
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1121
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,909
Good call, my young Padawan.

1122
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,795
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1123
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,911
That doesn't seem possible.

1124
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:48,588
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1125
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,952
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1126
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:53,911
There are too many.

1127
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:57,479
Our communications have been jammed.

1128
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:08,158
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1129
01:54:08,279 --> 01:54:09,507
Yes, sir.

1130
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:18,474
Sir...

1131
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,113
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1132
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:25,230
To the forward command centre
take me.

1133
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:50,238
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1134
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,389
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1135
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,271
Very good.

1136
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,478
Very good.

1137
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,511
This is not looking good at all!

1138
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,877
We must get the starships
back into space.

1139
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,554
We have to order a retreat.

1140
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,909
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1141
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:53,234
to get away with this treachery.

1142
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:56,471
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1143
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:00,479
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1144
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,873
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1145
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,309
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1146
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:16,833
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1147
01:57:09,159 --> 01:57:13,711
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1148
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,591
Yes, sir.

1149
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,029
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1150
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,918
Look over there!

1151
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:04,555
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1152
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,476
We're out of rockets, sir.

1153
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,319
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1154
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:13,314
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1155
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,307
Put the ship down!

1156
01:58:38,439 --> 01:58:40,237
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1157
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:42,032
Follow that speeder!

1158
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,109
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1159
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:53,550
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1160
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,557
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1161
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,829
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1162
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,032
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1163
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:04,673
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1164
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:11,070
She would do her duty.

1165
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,676
The droid army is in full retreat.

1166
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:24,757
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1167
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,631
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1168
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,351
We'll take him together.

1169
01:59:55,479 --> 01:59:57,356
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1170
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:08,555
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1171
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,511
Now... back down.

1172
02:00:16,119 --> 02:00:17,872
I don't think so.

1173
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:32,753
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1174
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,837
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1175
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:40,429
Surely you can do better.

1176
02:00:51,159 --> 02:00:52,957
Are you all right?

1177
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:54,671
Uh-huh.

1178
02:00:55,279 --> 02:00:57,430
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1179
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,073
No.

1180
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:02,555
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1181
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,556
Get a transport. Hurry!

1182
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,668
Right away.

1183
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,551
Brave of you, boy.

1184
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,916
<i>But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson. </i>

1185
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:36,552
I am a slow learner.

1186
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:38,152
Master Yoda.

1187
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:41,192
Count Dooku.

1188
02:02:41,319 --> 02:02:44,516
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1189
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,358
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1190
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,797
The dark side I sense in you.

1191
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,592
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1192
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,238
Even you.

1193
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,912
Much to learn you still have.

1194
02:03:44,039 --> 02:03:47,077
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1195
02:03:47,199 --> 02:03:49,350
by our knowledge of the Force...

1196
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:53,787
but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1197
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,952
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1198
02:04:37,079 --> 02:04:38,752
This is just the beginning.

1199
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,034
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1200
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:10,993
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1201
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,029
You have done well.

1202
02:07:15,479 --> 02:07:17,390
I have good news for you, my lord.

1203
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,752
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1204
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:24,913
Everything is going as planned.

1205
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:38,268
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1206
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,711
It doesn't feel right.

1207
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:43,872
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1208
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:46,797
Lies, deceit...

1209
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,515
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1210
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,993
Nevertheless. .

1211
02:07:52,119 --> 02:07:54,759
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1212
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:57,076
I agree.

1213
02:07:58,159 --> 02:07:59,957
Where is your apprentice?

1214
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:03,788
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1215
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,751
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1216
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:11,076
Victory?

1217
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,194
