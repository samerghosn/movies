1
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:13,663
(narrator reading)

2
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:36,977
(cackling)

3
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,820
That's general grievous.
After him.

4
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,485
General grievous
to count dooku,

5
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,689
<i>All is going</i> <i>according to plan.</i>

6
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,528
Excellent.
Our plan is going perfectly.

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,063
I just said that.

8
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,467
<i>Well, I wanted to say it, too.</i>

9
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:12,547
Narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, at the jedi temple academy,</i>

10
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,555
<i>Master yoda instructs his padawans in the holocron vault</i>

11
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:18,962
<i>Unaware of</i>
<i>the peril that awaits.</i>

12
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,471
Attention to the hologram, pay.

13
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:28,446
The skills of a famous jedi who a padawan like you once was

14
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:29,615
You will see.

15
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:30,718
Who is it, master?

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,890
I bet it's a great warrior.

17
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,026
Only the greatest warrior
of all.

18
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,564
Anakin skywalker, yes.

19
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,704
We are actually
related in a way.

20
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,942
He constructed me, you know?

21
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:45,748
Yes, never fail to remind us
of that, do you?

22
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:48,019
Now, learn and watch.

23
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:54,766
C-3po: There he is.

24
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:57,170
My hero, master ani.

25
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,174
Ooh!

26
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:02,147
Such style. What courage!

27
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,785
<i>Save me. I can't</i>
<i>afford to be smithereens.</i>

28
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,720
(laughing)

29
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,190
Thank you.
That's quite enough.

30
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,527
You can turn that
off now, master yoda.

31
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,194
(gasps)

32
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,600
Huh.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,642
Master yoda?

34
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:19,548
Bene: Master, I sense
something troubles you.

35
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,888
A disturbance,
I feel in the force.

36
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,026
Growing, the power
of the dark side is.

37
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,127
A new threat, I detect.

38
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,266
What threat?

39
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:32,808
Know not, I do.
But very powerful, this feeling is.

40
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,284
Do what you wish
with the lightsabers,

41
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:41,125
All I care about are the kyber crystals within them.

42
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,794
Are you ready, general?

43
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,164
<i>I was born ready.</i>

44
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:46,937
Then launch your attack.

45
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,204
<i>What, you mean now?</i>

46
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:50,810
No, a week from now!

47
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:54,017
(sighs) incompetence.
Okay. Palpatine time.

48
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:01,131
Master yoda,
thank goodness I found you.

49
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,904
We've received a distress call
from obi-wan kenobi.

50
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,640
He's under attack. You...

51
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:07,043
(beeping)

52
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,212
Sorry. I have to take this.

53
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,221
What now?

54
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,889
<i>When you said,</i>
<i>"a week from now",</i>

55
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:16,629
<i>Did you mean...</i>
I was being sarcastic!

56
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,368
(beeping)
hold on.

57
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,737
Yoda, sorry to cut...

58
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,340
<i>Still me.</i>

59
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:25,748
What are you waiting for?
Attack! Now!

60
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,283
(muttering)

61
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:28,152
(groans)

62
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,193
Yoda, general
kenobi is on alderaan.

63
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,231
<i>You must rescue him at once.</i>

64
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,770
<i>The destiny of</i>
<i>the republic is at stake.</i>

65
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:39,742
Then rescue him, I will.

66
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:41,813
My padawans, leave you, I must.

67
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:43,048
We wanna help, too.

68
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,752
Take us with you.

69
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:45,721
Too dangerous, this mission is.

70
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:47,691
Padawans: Aww!

71
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,860
Your substitute teacher,
3-poc is.

72
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,797
Me?

73
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,434
(padawans groan)
the odd numbered problems

74
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,839
On page 46 do.

75
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,275
All work, show.

76
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,348
A rescue mission,
I must launch.

77
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,823
All the best men, I need.
(gasps)

78
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,727
You too, that means.
(artoo beeps)

79
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:08,966
(whimpers)

80
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:13,476
Mace windu reporting
for service, master.

81
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:15,011
Clone trooper:
And I'm with you, bro.

82
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:18,385
Wait. All us jedi
have to call you master,

83
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,022
But he gets to use "bro"?

84
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,392
How I roll, that is.

85
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,830
Outtie, we are.

86
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,783
(chuckles)

87
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:36,455
C-3po: <i> Master yoda did not say</i>
<i>you could have class outside.</i>

88
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:38,959
<i>I wasn't fabricated yesterday,</i>
<i>you know. Now turn to page...</i>

89
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:40,797
(grievous cackles)
<i>hey, you can't come in here.</i>

90
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,068
(blasting)

91
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,506
(grunts)
I mean, make yourself at home.

92
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,325
There's alderaan.
I only hope we're not too late.

93
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,028
Hmm...

94
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,265
General kenobi,
master yoda this is.

95
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:01,138
Answering your
call for help, we are.

96
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,273
Obi-wan:
<i>I didn't call for help.</i>

97
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,879
I'm on vacation down here.

98
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,284
A mystery, this is.

99
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,554
Mystery solved.

100
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:12,995
Ah! It's a trap.

101
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,430
Well, duh.

102
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:20,175
(grunts)

103
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,880
(cackling)

104
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,949
Give me your lightsabers.

105
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:29,059
Ah! Oh! I surrender to you in my capacity as acting teacher.

106
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:32,133
I mean,
I am temporarily in charge.

107
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:35,172
I don't teach acting, per se.

108
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:37,944
Mind you, I've always wanted
to give acting a go.

109
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,949
Nothing big of course,
character parts probably.

110
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,985
Silence!
Of course, not another word.

111
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,556
So long, kiddies.

112
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,929
Why did he have to say that?

113
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,065
Attack.
Attack.

114
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,257
Lost, this battle is.

115
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:07,103
And awkward, this moment is.

116
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,206
Retreat to coruscant, we must.
Ackbar: <i> Yes, sir.</i>

117
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,449
Making the jump to light speed
in three, two, one...

118
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:15,753
(groans)
gets better and better, this day does.

119
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,294
(all scream)

120
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,499
Padawan:
Give us back our stuff, you bad robot.

121
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:26,140
Don't poke my eyes.
Those are my only original parts.

122
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:37,095
(grievous cackling)

123
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,801
Uncouth creature.
Complete lack of etiquette.

124
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:42,406
At least he only
snatched your lightsabers.

125
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,377
And now we have
to get them back.

126
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,080
I'll start the bus.
Wait.

127
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:49,688
No, I forbid you to
board that vehicle.

128
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,790
Let's go, people.

129
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,193
Whoa!

130
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,796
I forbid you to lift off.

131
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,532
Lifting off.

132
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:56,736
I forbid you to cheer.

133
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:59,274
(cheering)

134
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:00,776
I am definitely
putting in for overtime.

135
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:03,781
(screaming)

136
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,437
Ooh... Mmm!

137
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,506
Like this place, I do.

138
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:18,411
Live here someday, I could.

139
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:22,152
(sighs) cuckoo.

140
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:24,825
C-3po:
You're wasting your time on this wild sith chase.

141
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:30,236
The odds of finding your lightsabers
are 15-trillion-975 to 1.

142
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,874
They're on tatooine. I feel it.
C-3po: What?

143
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,444
They're near the dune sea.

144
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,448
(cheering)

145
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,155
You can't feel that. Who do you think you are?
A jedi...

146
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:41,591
Oh, right.

147
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,328
I feel it, too.

148
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,164
Might I enquire
just how you plan

149
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,367
On getting halfway
across the galaxy

150
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:47,904
In a bus?

151
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,574
I've made a few modifications.

152
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:52,614
Well, unless those
modifications include...

153
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,216
Hyper drive engines?

154
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,295
Pretty cool, huh?

155
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:03,903
Totally awesome.

156
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:08,946
I hope someone gets
our distress signal.

157
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:12,987
I can't believe we were betrayed today.
Who could've done that to us?

158
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:16,695
A secret sith lord
among us, there is.

159
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,966
Tell us his identity,
the forest will.

160
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,757
Nothing, I got.

161
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,961
Me neither.

162
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:33,830
(whimpers)

163
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,737
C-3po:
I don't wish to be negative,

164
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:40,375
But do you think the force will lead you to your lightsabers

165
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:42,879
Before I melt
into a golden goo?

166
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,984
Oh, I don't understand.

167
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:48,457
My every feeling tells me our lightsabers are very close.

168
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,298
(groaning)

169
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:56,375
(chuckling)

170
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:59,245
General grievous gave that slimy slug our lightsabers.

171
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,083
And we're gonna get them back.

172
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:02,719
I was afraid he'd say that.

173
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,659
Could master plo
koon be the sith lord?

174
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,763
Him? Never.

175
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:08,898
(beeping and whistling)

176
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:10,869
Both: Huh?

177
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,106
Kit fisto?

178
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:14,977
How about master matta?

179
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,615
Not sure who
that even is, I am.

180
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,587
(whistles)
yoda: Hmm?

181
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:23,695
Chancellor palpatine.
Chancellor palpatine.

182
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,570
Yes! We can ask him who he thinks the sith lord is.

183
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,140
Brilliant idea, that is.

184
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:33,614
Man: <i> Hands up, trespassers.</i>

185
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:34,751
Hmm...

186
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,956
<i>This is a restricted planet.</i>

187
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:44,971
<i>You have some</i>
<i>nerve coming here.</i>

188
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:54,556
Just kidding.
I got your distress call.

189
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:57,563
The name's calrissian.
Lindo calrissian.

190
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,435
And this is my son, lando.

191
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:01,471
How's it going, fellas?

192
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:04,042
Welcome aboard
the <i> millennium falcon.</i>

193
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:07,048
The finest traveling night club in the galaxy.

194
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,082
Night club?

195
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,788
(disco music playing)

196
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,927
Yoda: Happening, this ship is.

197
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:16,500
Lindo: (chuckles)
would you care for a refreshing beverage?

198
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,906
Yoda: Worse ways to travel,
there are.

199
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,241
(artoo beeps)

200
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,585
This could be
a terrible mistake.

201
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:27,590
Just say what we wrote.
You'll be great.

202
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,761
(gasps)

203
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,633
Oh...
(speaking foreign language)

204
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:36,274
Jabba the hutt
is an over-pumped inflatable

205
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:40,717
Who smells like
a tauntaun's laundry basket.

206
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,286
Oh!

207
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,189
(speaking foreign language)

208
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,828
You heard me, lumpy head.
(growls)

209
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,532
And you, sir,

210
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,067
Do not have
anywhere near the physique

211
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,538
To pull off the shirtless look.

212
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,872
(grunting angrily)

213
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,644
You did not go there.

214
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:57,917
(roars)

215
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,621
(screaming)

216
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:01,925
Your plan is going perfectly.

217
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,865
Malakili:
You're going down, goldie.

218
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:10,776
(chuckles) this is
gonna be so easy.

219
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:11,843
(gasps)

220
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:15,752
(all gasp)

221
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,692
There they are.

222
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,854
(imitating lightsaber sounds)

223
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,630
Careful, bobby.
Whoa!

224
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,031
(roars)

225
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,236
Time to go.

226
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:44,810
Hold it.
You kids are rancor food.

227
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:47,280
That's what you think.
Padawans, assemble.

228
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:52,892
Huh?
Huh?

229
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:54,095
The kyber crystals are gone.

230
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,031
Get them.

231
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,372
(speaking foreign language)

232
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,117
Sorry, ian.
Both: Huh?

233
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,059
(gasps)

234
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,935
I'm free. I'm free.

235
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:15,871
Let's get out of here.

236
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,113
(roars)

237
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,020
I don't think there's anything
in our workbook about this.

238
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:26,059
This isn't nearly as
much fun as it looks.

239
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,963
Go get 'em, rancor!

240
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,503
You are a good boy.

241
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:34,309
Now sit.

242
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:35,980
(rancor panting)

243
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,082
Hop on.

244
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:42,258
I do hope you remember where
we parked the bus, because I don't.

245
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,197
Malakili: What have they
done to my baby?

246
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,902
They've ruined him.

247
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,409
(comforting in
foreign language)

248
00:12:57,054 --> 00:13:00,796
Dooku: We have retrieved the kyber crystals
from the padawans' lightsabers

249
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:03,902
And have combined them back
into one all-powerful crystal.

250
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:10,915
Now we are ready to create
your new weapons, my master.

251
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,287
<i>Excellent work, count dooku.</i>

252
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:14,455
(coughing)

253
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:20,100
<i>And you, general grievous.</i>

254
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,871
Did you think I coughed because

255
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,373
I was mad at you
for not praising me?

256
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,177
I was just coughing.

257
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,883
I cough all the time.
(coughing)

258
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:31,056
See?
<i>Just get to work!</i>

259
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,324
(disco music playing)

260
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:45,283
<i>Master yoda,</i>
<i>we've had a dreadful time.</i>

261
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,421
<i>We barely escaped</i>
<i>from tatooine and...</i>

262
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:50,662
<i>Wait a minute, you're not yoda.</i>
<i>What have you done with yoda?</i>

263
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,334
<i>Have you kidnapped him?</i>
<i>You beast.</i>

264
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:56,940
I think this gent could use a refreshing beverage.

265
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,612
3-poc,
why go to tatooine, did you?

266
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:02,451
<i>Master yoda, you're safe.</i>

267
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,122
<i>Are you at some kind of party?</i>

268
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:07,461
Uh...
My question first, answer.

269
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:09,565
Well, it's rather
a long story, but...

270
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,104
A coughing robot
took our lightsabers

271
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:13,941
<i>So we had to get them back</i>
<i>from the worm guy's house,</i>

272
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,279
But somebody stole the crystals so now they don't work.

273
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,116
(gasps)

274
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,355
Well, I wouldn't have put it
quite like that, but yes.

275
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,525
<i>That just about covers it.</i>

276
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,130
Oh, well, the way the cookie crumbles, that is.

277
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,635
Back to coruscant, go now.
(chuckles)

278
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,305
But...
<i>Heard me, you did.</i>

279
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:32,210
To coruscant, go.
Fine, everything is.

280
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:34,183
<i>Dory-hunky. Bye-bye.</i>

281
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,621
The lightsaber crystals.

282
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:40,393
Know of their power,
only count dooku would.

283
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,733
This means just one thing.

284
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:46,438
Dooku plans to use the kyber crystals to make sith clones.

285
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,579
To kamino, we must go at once.
Take us there, can you?

286
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:51,348
It's all good, greenie.

287
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,271
Nothing can stop us now.

288
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:20,140
Lindo: <i> Good luck, guys.</i>

289
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:22,378
Lando, punch it.

290
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,116
Consider it punched, papa bear.

291
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:28,689
Lindo:
<i>May the funk be with you.</i>

292
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,097
Man, that family
knows how to live.

293
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,534
Agreed.

294
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:36,338
Now, stop dooku, we must.

295
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:41,515
(groans)

296
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,224
Wear shoes, I really should.

297
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,574
Dooku: Yes.

298
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:58,617
Arise, my sith-enhanced clones.

299
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:00,486
Fast so not, dooku.

300
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,258
Master yoda.

301
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:07,434
So, we meet again. Again.

302
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:09,905
Failed, your evil plot is.

303
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:11,576
(cackling)

304
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,453
We think failed, it is not.

305
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,627
Talk like that, only I do.

306
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,938
(high-pitched screaming)

307
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,779
Always lose, evil will.

308
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,786
Feel the righteous
power of the jedi.

309
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,922
Not finished yet, I was.

310
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,567
Purple lightsaber.

311
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:41,970
Nice.

312
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,841
Hey. Thanks for noticing.

313
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,009
Green, what's wrong with?

314
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:52,959
(grunts)

315
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,334
Dooku: My cloning crystal.

316
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,397
Ended,
your evil quest is, dooku.

317
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,567
In your face, dark side.

318
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,907
The jedi have
an ally more powerful

319
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:18,910
Than all your stolen
crystals put together.

320
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,883
And that's
the power of goodness.

321
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,996
(chuckles) yeah.
You're darn right

322
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,866
You should be in awe,
because...

323
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:32,338
Uh-oh.

324
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,545
I am ready to fight

325
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,551
For the sith.

326
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:40,721
Clone, attack.

327
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,065
(artoo screams)

328
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,373
My, I sense artoo is in danger.

329
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,044
We have to save them.

330
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,680
You don't have jedi powers.

331
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:55,917
No, but I do have wi-fi.

332
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,455
Now turn this heap around.

333
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:03,165
Ah. You have done well,
my creation.

334
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,771
But I have more of you to make.

335
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,473
Rebuild my cloning room.

336
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:08,878
Yes, my master.

337
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:14,623
That guy's good.
Yoda: Wrong.

338
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,957
Bad, he is.

339
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,194
You know what I mean.

340
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,131
(coughing)

341
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,711
(laughing)

342
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:43,880
(coughing)

343
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,524
(creaking)

344
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:53,699
My joints.
They're rusting in the rain.

345
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,772
Should've paid extra
for the undercoating package.

346
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,099
Blaster fire, eat.

347
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,715
Not good, this is.

348
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:24,761
Can someone please
get me an oil can?

349
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,337
Ah! I'm back in business.

350
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,007
Finish them.

351
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,210
Yes, my lord.

352
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,919
I said finish them. Now.

353
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,857
Yes, master.

354
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,198
C-3po:
<i>Step away from the jedi.</i>

355
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,703
Threepio. My padawans.

356
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:06,746
A bus full of children?
I'm terrified.

357
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,118
We made a few modifications.

358
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,156
Well, unless those
modifications include...

359
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:13,692
Giant laser cannons?

360
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,266
Uh... Oopsie.

361
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:24,715
No!

362
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,937
The crystal. Still in
the cloning room, it is.

363
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:37,873
Not anymore. Look.

364
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:41,014
(cheering)

365
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,495
Go. Run away.

366
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:53,138
Count dooku and I will hunt you down.
Right, dooku?

367
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,744
Sorry, only room for two.

368
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,486
Dooku? But I
thought we were buddies.

369
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:17,052
Save the republic,
you padawans did.

370
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:18,823
(sniffles)

371
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,163
Proud of you, I am.

372
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,536
But master yoda,
the sith clone survived.

373
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:28,543
And dangerous, he is.
But find him, I will.

374
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,280
A promise, that is.

375
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:37,861
Dooku: Lord sidious.

376
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,134
Allow me to present
our most powerful new weapon.

377
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,051
Sith clone number 14.

378
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:52,857
Jek.
At your command, master.

379
00:21:52,859 --> 00:22:00,105
Excellent. You and I are going to lay waste
to the galaxy together.

380
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,410
(cackling)

381
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:11,462
I made it.
Don't worry. I'm fine.

382
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,933
Oh, wonderful.

383
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:16,605
Yes, isn't it?
I'm happy to see you, too.

384
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,174
Sarcastic.
Sarcastic.

385
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:19,411
Oh, right.
