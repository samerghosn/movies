1
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:40,859
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,545
They shut down the main reactor.

3
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:44,126
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,123
This is madness.

5
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,156
We're doomed.

6
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:03,058
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,022
What's that?

8
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,776
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,262
At last!

10
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,060
Where have you been?

11
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,302
They're heading in this direction.

12
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:07,146
What are we going to do?

13
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:08,939
We'll be sent to
the spice mines of Kessel ...

14
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,466
smashed into who knows what!

15
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,380
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

16
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:28,581
~ The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer. ~

17
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,221
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

18
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:34,021
What have you done with those plans?

19
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:36,867
We intercepted no transmissions.

20
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,659
This is a consular ship.

21
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,778
We're on a diplomatic mission.

22
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,024
If this is a consular ship ...

23
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:45,264
where is the ambassador?

24
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,858
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans ...

25
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:54,865
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

26
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,387
There's one. Set for stun.

27
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,420
She'll be all right.

28
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,345
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

29
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,459
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

30
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,226
You'll be deactivated for sure.

31
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:26,422
Don't you call me
a mindless philosopher ...

32
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:27,617
you overweight glob of grease!

33
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,305
Now come out before
somebody sees you.

34
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:33,379
Secret mission?
What plans?

35
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:34,735
What are you talking about?

36
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,266
I'm not getting in there.

37
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:40,704
I'm going to regret this.

38
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,187
There goes another one.

39
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:51,343
Hold your fire.
There's no life forms.

40
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:53,060
It must have short-circuited.

41
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:57,340
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

42
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:59,264
Are you sure this thing is safe?

43
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,343
Oh.

44
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:21,064
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

45
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,418
The Imperial Senate will
not sit still for this.

46
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:24,617
When they hear you've
attacked a diplomatic ...

47
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:26,146
Don't act so surprised,
Your Highness.

48
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,622
You weren't on any
mercy mission this time.

49
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:32,661
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

50
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,507
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

51
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,266
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:39,026
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate ...

53
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,500
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

54
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,346
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

55
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:44,980
Take her away!

56
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,459
Holding her is dangerous.

57
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:52,067
If word of this gets out ...

58
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:53,906
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

59
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,495
I've traced the rebel spies to her.

60
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,187
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

61
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,583
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

62
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,935
Leave that to me.

63
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,581
Send a distress signal ...

64
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,858
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.

65
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,307
Lord Vader,
the battle station plans ...

66
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,543
are not aboard this ship ...

67
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,021
and no transmissions were made.

68
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:13,536
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting ...

69
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:15,146
but no life forms were aboard.

70
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,906
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

71
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:21,622
Send a detachment down to retrieve
them ... See to it personally, Commander.

72
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,137
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

73
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,302
Yes, sir.

74
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,904
How did we get into this mess?

75
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,587
I really don't know how.

76
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:45,221
We seem to be made to suffer.

77
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:46,621
It's our lot in life.

78
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:51,820
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

79
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,825
My joints are almost frozen.

80
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:02,022
What a desolate place this is!

81
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,779
Where do you think you're going?

82
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,500
Well, I'm not going that way.

83
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:11,140
It's much too rocky.

84
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:13,019
This way is much easier.

85
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:14,979
What makes you think ...

86
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,904
there are settlements over there?

87
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,826
Don't get technical with me.

88
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:23,065
What mission?
What are you talking about?

89
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,341
I've just about had enough of you.

90
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,787
Go that way.

91
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:30,705
You'll be malfunctioning within a day ...

92
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:32,341
you nearsighted scrap pile.

93
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,697
And don't let me catch you
following me begging for help ...

94
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:36,226
because you won't get it.

95
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,340
No more adventures.

96
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,345
I'm not going that way.

97
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,986
That malfunctioning little twerp.

98
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:29,099
This is all his fault.

99
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,788
He tricked me into going this way ...

100
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,705
but he'll do no better.

101
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,865
Wait! What's that?

102
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:40,307
A transport.

103
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:42,019
I'm saved!

104
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,786
Over here!

105
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:44,897
Hey!

106
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,620
Hey!

107
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:50,104
Help! Please help!

108
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,581
R2?

109
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:19,337
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

110
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,375
Someone was in the pod.

111
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:56,067
The tracks go off in this direction.

112
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,019
Look, sir, droids.

113
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,581
We stopped.

114
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:15,299
Wake up! Wake up!

115
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,904
We're doomed.

116
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,418
Do you think they'll melt us down?

117
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:47,544
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

118
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:49,225
Will this never end?

119
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:29,826
All right, fine. Let's go.

120
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,984
Luke! Luke!

121
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,264
Luke, tell Uncle
if he gets a translator ...

122
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,059
be sure it speaks Bocce.

123
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,576
Doesn't look like we have much
of a choice, but I'll remind him.

124
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,581
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

125
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,663
No, not that one.

126
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,856
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

127
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,307
Protocol? Why, it's
my primary function, sir.

128
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:05,782
I am well-versed in all the customs ...

129
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,465
I have no need for a protocol droid.

130
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:09,067
Of course you haven't, sir.

131
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:10,336
Not in an environment such as this.

132
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:11,695
That is why I have
been programmed ...

133
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:13,864
What I really need is
a droid who understands ...

134
00:17:13,988 --> 00:17:15,785
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

135
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:19,058
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters ...

136
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:19,827
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

137
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:20,384
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

138
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,066
Can you speak Bocce?

139
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:24,622
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me ...

140
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:25,976
Yeah, all right. Shut up.
I'll take this one.

141
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:27,336
Luke!

142
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,818
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

143
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,063
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

144
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:34,176
But I was going into Tosche Station ...

145
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,626
to pick up some power converters.

146
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,146
You can waste time
with your friends ...

147
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:38,666
when your chores are done.

148
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,664
Now come on. Get to it.

149
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,824
All right. Come on.

150
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,378
And the red one. Come on.

151
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,936
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

152
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:09,616
Uncle Owen!

153
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:11,067
Yeah?

154
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:13,781
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

155
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,182
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

156
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,980
Excuse me, sir ...

157
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:23,417
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

158
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:25,742
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

159
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,142
What about that blue one?

160
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,498
We'll take that one.

161
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:30,777
Take this away.

162
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,182
You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.

163
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,026
He really is in first-class condition.

164
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,297
I've worked with him before.

165
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:36,223
Here he comes.

166
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,227
O.K. Let's go.

167
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,099
Now, don't you forget this.

168
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:44,900
Why I should stick
my neck out for you ...

169
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:46,858
is quite beyond my capacity.

170
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:54,145
Thank the maker!

171
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,179
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

172
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:59,778
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination ...

173
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:00,896
I can barely move.

174
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:02,017
It just isn't fair.

175
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:03,626
Oh, Biggs is right.

176
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:05,942
I'm never gonna get out of here.

177
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,944
Is there anything I might do to help?

178
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,376
No. Not unless you can alter time ...

179
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,782
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

180
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,421
I don't think so, sir.

181
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:15,821
I'm only a droid ...

182
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,300
and not very knowledgeable
about such things ...

183
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:19,066
not on this planet, anyway.

184
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:22,419
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

185
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,823
Well, if there's
a bright center to the universe ...

186
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:27,257
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

187
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:28,457
I see, sir.

188
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:30,226
You can call me Luke.

189
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,666
I see, Sir Luke.

190
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:32,936
Ha ha.

191
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,261
Just Luke.

192
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:37,903
Oh ... And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

193
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:40,302
This is my counterpart ... R2-D2.

194
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:41,576
Hello.

195
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,943
You got a lot of carbon scoring.

196
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,023
Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.

197
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,705
With all we've been through ...

198
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,500
sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are ...

199
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,947
what with the rebellion and all.

200
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,865
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!

201
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,943
That's how we came
to be in your service ...

202
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,386
if you take my meaning, sir.

203
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:58,576
Have you been in many battles?

204
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,935
Several, I think.

205
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,500
Actually, there's not much to tell.

206
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,380
I'm not much more
than an interpreter ...

207
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,259
and not very good at telling stories.

208
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,617
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

209
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,625
Well, my little friend ...

210
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:12,421
you got something jammed
in here real good.

211
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:13,866
Were you on a Starcruiser or ...

212
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:17,219
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

213
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:19,304
What's this?

214
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,338
"What is what"?
He asked you a question.

215
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:22,377
What is that?

216
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:23,826
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

217
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,983
You're my only hope.

218
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:31,185
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

219
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:32,945
You're my only hope.

220
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:37,186
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

221
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:39,616
Old data. Pay it no mind.

222
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:42,022
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

223
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:45,345
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

224
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:47,742
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

225
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,506
A person of some importance, I believe.

226
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:50,663
Our captain was attached ...

227
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:51,903
Is there any more
to this recording?

228
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,186
Behave yourself, R2.

229
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,026
You're going to get us into trouble.

230
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:59,787
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

231
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:05,699
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi ...

232
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,227
a resident of these parts ...

233
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,066
and it's a private message for him.

234
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,065
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.

235
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,065
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

236
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,586
But with all
we've been through ...

237
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,619
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

238
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:20,740
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

239
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,382
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

240
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,305
I don't know any Obi-Wan ...

241
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:28,659
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

242
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,460
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

243
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:31,941
Help me,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

244
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,467
I wonder who she is.

245
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:34,576
Sounds like she's in trouble.

246
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,505
I better play back the whole thing.

247
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:40,423
He says the restraining bolt ...

248
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:43,107
has short-circuited
his recording system.

249
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,901
He suggests that if you remove the bolt ...

250
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:48,222
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.

251
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,623
Oh, yeah. Well ...

252
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,057
I guess you're too small
to run away on me ...

253
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,336
if I take this off.

254
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:55,423
OK ...

255
00:21:57,907 --> 00:21:59,739
There you go.

256
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,778
Wait a minute.
Where'd she go?

257
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:04,262
Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

258
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,423
"What message"?

259
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:07,617
The one you've just been playing!

260
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:09,659
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

261
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,778
Luke! Luke!

262
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,260
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

263
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:14,787
I'm sorry, sir ...

264
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:17,580
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

265
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,266
Here. See what you can do with him.

266
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:20,945
I'll be right back.

267
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:26,176
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.

268
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:29,624
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

269
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,978
No, I don't like you, either.

270
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:41,459
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

271
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:44,056
What makes you think that?

272
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:46,497
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

273
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:49,461
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

274
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:53,583
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

275
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,060
Do you know what
he's talking about?

276
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:56,143
Mm-mm.

277
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:59,226
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

278
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,019
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

279
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,378
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead ...

280
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,906
and have its memory erased.

281
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,904
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

282
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:12,102
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

283
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:13,217
He won't.

284
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:15,623
I don't think he exists any more.

285
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:18,022
He died about the same time
as your father.

286
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,342
He knew my father?

287
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,105
I told you to forget it.

288
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:25,425
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

289
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:27,378
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge ...

290
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,259
working on those condensers.

291
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:30,376
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:34,217
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

293
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:37,896
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement ...

294
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:41,099
about me staying on another season?

295
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,298
And if these new droids
do work out ...

296
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:45,259
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

297
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:48,027
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

298
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:49,865
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

299
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:51,898
Harvest is when I need you the most.

300
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:53,939
It's only one season more.

301
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,580
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest ...

302
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,221
that I'll be able
to hire more hands ...

303
00:23:57,347 --> 00:24:00,145
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

304
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:01,905
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

305
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:03,700
But it's a whole 'nother year!

306
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,181
Look, it's only one more season.

307
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,298
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

308
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:08,304
Where are you going?

309
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:09,576
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

310
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,425
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

311
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:13,378
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

312
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:14,736
Most of his friends have gone.

313
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,858
It means so much to him.

314
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,660
I'll make it up to him next year.

315
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:19,742
I promise.

316
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:23,098
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

317
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,138
He has too much of his father in him.

318
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:27,223
That's what I'm afraid of.

319
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:14,385
Ooh!

320
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:15,861
What are you doing
hiding back there?

321
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:19,138
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

322
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,987
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

323
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:23,586
Kept babbling on about his mission.

324
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,266
Oh, no.

325
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,580
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

326
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,096
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

327
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:40,105
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

328
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:41,626
How could I be so stupid?

329
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,863
He's nowhere in sight.

330
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,261
Blast it!

331
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:46,697
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

332
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,420
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.

333
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,503
We'll have to wait until morning.

334
00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:51,777
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

335
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:54,182
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.

336
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,707
Boy, am I gonna get it.

337
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:58,547
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

338
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,897
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

339
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:03,346
Come on.

340
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:11,656
Luke?

341
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:13,982
Luke!

342
00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:16,701
Luke!

343
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:24,383
Have you seen Luke this morning?

344
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:26,419
He said he had some things to do
before he started today ...

345
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,776
so he left early.

346
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,260
Did he take those
two new droids with him?

347
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,787
I think so.

348
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:33,375
Well, he better have those units
in the south range ...

349
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,863
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.

350
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:37,786
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

351
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:39,340
Dead ahead.

352
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,346
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

353
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,381
Hey, whoa! Where do
you think you're going?

354
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:08,420
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

355
00:27:08,548 --> 00:27:11,425
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

356
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,142
And don't talk to me
of your mission, either.

357
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:15,461
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you ...

358
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:16,941
into a million pieces right here!

359
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,058
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

360
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,538
What's wrong with him now?

361
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,817
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

362
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:28,623
Sandpeople, or worse.

363
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,545
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

364
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,702
Come on!

365
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,858
Well, there are
two Banthas down there ...

366
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,865
but I don't see any ...
Wait a second.

367
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,307
They're Sandpeople, all right.

368
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:43,067
I can see one of them now.

369
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,425
Hello, there.

370
00:28:57,748 --> 00:29:00,865
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

371
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,143
Oh, don't worry.
He'll be all right.

372
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:13,500
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

373
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,222
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

374
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:20,816
Ben?

375
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:22,381
Ben Kenobi?

376
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,384
Boy, am I glad to see you.

377
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:27,385
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be traveled lightly.

378
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,459
Tell me, young Luke ...

379
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:34,340
what brings you out this far?

380
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,059
This little droid.

381
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,547
I think he's searching
for his former master ...

382
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,898
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

383
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:44,858
He claims to be the property ...

384
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,500
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

385
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:47,742
Is he a relative of yours?

386
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:50,143
Do you know who
he's talking about?

387
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:52,304
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

388
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,897
Obi-Wan.

389
00:29:56,028 --> 00:30:00,738
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

390
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,176
A long time.

391
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:05,502
I think my uncle knows him.

392
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:07,060
He said he was dead.

393
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,905
Oh, he's not dead.

394
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,096
Not yet.

395
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:11,580
You know him?

396
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,461
Well, of course I know him.
He's me.

397
00:30:16,468 --> 00:30:20,176
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan ...

398
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,616
since, oh, before you were born.

399
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:24,465
Well, then the droid
does belong to you.

400
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,182
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

401
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,057
Very interesting.

402
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:34,267
I think we better get indoors.

403
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:36,742
The Sandpeople are easily startled ...

404
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:40,098
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

405
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,181
3PO.

406
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:55,741
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

407
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,701
Can you stand?

408
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:00,307
We've got to get out of here before
the Sandpeople return.

409
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:02,817
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

410
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,508
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

411
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:06,946
I'm done for.

412
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,740
No, you're not.

413
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,856
What kind of talk is that?

414
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,546
Quickly. They're on the move.

415
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:18,144
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.

416
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:19,940
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.

417
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,819
That's what your uncle told you.

418
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,665
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

419
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:24,903
Thought he should
have stayed here ...

420
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,779
and not gotten involved.

421
00:31:26,907 --> 00:31:28,739
You fought in the Clone Wars?

422
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,621
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight ...

423
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:32,976
the same as your father.

424
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,140
I wish I'd known him.

425
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:40,896
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy ...

426
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:42,507
and a cunning warrior.

427
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:43,503
I understand you've become ...

428
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:46,221
quite a good pilot yourself.

429
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:49,101
And he was a good friend.

430
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:51,263
Which reminds me ...

431
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,981
I have something here for you.

432
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,787
Your father wanted you to have this ...

433
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:00,227
when you were old enough ...

434
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:02,304
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.

435
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:03,906
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan ...

436
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:05,904
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade ...

437
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:07,700
like your father did.

438
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:09,546
Sir, if you'll not be needing me ...

439
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,577
I'll close down for a while.

440
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,299
Sure. Go ahead.

441
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,380
What is it?

442
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:18,146
It's your father's lightsaber.

443
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:21,384
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

444
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:24,978
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

445
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:30,943
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

446
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,183
For over a thousand generations ...

447
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:35,105
the Jedi knights were the guardians ...

448
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:38,140
of peace and justice
in the old Republic ...

449
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,941
before the dark times ...

450
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,580
before the Empire.

451
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:47,336
How did my father die?

452
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:51,539
A young Jedi named Darth Vader ...

453
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,660
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil ...

454
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:58,622
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

455
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,662
He betrayed and
murdered your father.

456
00:33:02,788 --> 00:33:06,541
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

457
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:11,344
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

458
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:12,901
The Force?

459
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:16,259
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.

460
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:20,267
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

461
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:22,140
It surrounds us, penetrates us ...

462
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,223
it binds the galaxy together.

463
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:34,340
Now let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend ...

464
00:33:34,468 --> 00:33:36,298
and where you come from.

465
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:37,941
I saw part of a message he was ...

466
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,979
I seem to have found it.

467
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:44,020
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

468
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,422
Now he begs you to help him ...

469
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:47,663
in his struggle against the Empire.

470
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:50,426
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.

471
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,424
But my ship has fallen under attack ...

472
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:54,663
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

473
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:56,425
I have placed information ...

474
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,105
vital to the survival
of the rebellion ...

475
00:33:58,228 --> 00:33:59,980
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.

476
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:01,826
My father will know
how to retrieve it.

477
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:03,506
You must see this droid ...

478
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,061
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

479
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:07,826
This is our most desperate hour.

480
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:11,860
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

481
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:27,822
You must learn
the ways of the Force ...

482
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:30,063
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.

483
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:32,496
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

484
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:34,027
I've got to get home.

485
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:35,422
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

486
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:38,186
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

487
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:41,300
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

488
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:46,507
I can't get involved.

489
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,902
I've got work to do.

490
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:51,461
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it ...

491
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,659
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

492
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,824
It's all such a long way from here.

493
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:58,824
That's your uncle talking.

494
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:00,097
My uncle.

495
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,617
How am I ever gonna explain this?

496
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:04,420
Learn about the Force, Luke.

497
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,257
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

498
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:17,222
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

499
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:21,135
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

500
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:30,543
Until this battle station
is fully operational ...

501
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:32,021
we are vulnerable.

502
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:34,103
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

503
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:36,105
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

504
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:38,503
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander ...

505
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:40,697
not to this battle station.

506
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:43,422
The rebellion will
continue to gain support ...

507
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:45,139
in the Imperial Senate ...

508
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,260
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

509
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,867
I have just received word ...

510
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:52,422
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

511
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,981
The last remnants
of the old Republic ...

512
00:35:55,108 --> 00:35:56,460
have been swept away.

513
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,179
That's impossible.

514
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,458
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

515
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:03,340
The regional governors
now have direct control ...

516
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,106
over their territories.

517
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:09,106
Fear will keep
the local systems in line ...

518
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:10,547
fear of this battle station.

519
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,420
And what of the rebellion?

520
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,344
If the rebels have obtained ...

521
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,661
a complete technical readout
of this station ...

522
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,380
it is possible, however unlikely ...

523
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,702
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

524
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:23,867
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

525
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:26,297
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station ...

526
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:27,702
would be a useless gesture ...

527
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:30,057
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

528
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,623
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

529
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:35,943
I suggest we use it.

530
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,420
Don't be too proud ...

531
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,664
of this technological terror
you've constructed.

532
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:43,018
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant ...

533
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:45,297
next to the power of the Force.

534
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:48,704
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

535
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:51,626
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion ...

536
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:54,103
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes ...

537
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:56,105
or given you
clairvoyance enough ...

538
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:58,344
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre ...

539
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,786
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

540
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:11,135
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

541
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:12,780
As you wish.

542
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,824
This bickering is pointless.

543
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:21,498
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress ...

544
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:24,300
by the time this station
is operational.

545
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:26,657
We will then crush the rebellion ...

546
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:28,141
with one swift stroke.

547
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,579
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.

548
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,346
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

549
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,456
It's just, I've never heard of them ...

550
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:40,498
hitting anything this big before.

551
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:41,617
They didn't ...

552
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:44,103
but we are meant to think they did.

553
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,025
These tracks are side-by-side.

554
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:48,217
Sandpeople always ride single file ...

555
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:50,144
to hide their numbers.

556
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,463
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

557
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:55,898
And these blast points,
too accurate ...

558
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:57,302
for Sandpeople.

559
00:37:57,427 --> 00:38:00,704
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

560
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:03,864
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

561
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:10,297
If they traced the robots here ...

562
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:11,577
they may have learned
who they sold them to ...

563
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,619
and that would lead
them back ... home!

564
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,226
Wait, Luke!

565
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:17,224
It's too dangerous!

566
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,501
Uncle Owen!

567
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:43,936
Aunt Beru!

568
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:45,342
Uncle Owen!

569
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:33,786
And now, Your Highness ...

570
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,704
we will discuss the location ...

571
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,978
of your hidden rebel base.

572
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:20,824
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke ...

573
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,427
had you been there.

574
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,186
You'd have been killed, too ...

575
00:40:24,307 --> 00:40:27,744
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

576
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:31,382
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.

577
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,179
There's nothing for me here now.

578
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,423
I want to learn
the ways of the Force ...

579
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:36,981
and become a Jedi
like my father.

580
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:54,306
Mos Eisley spaceport.

581
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:59,422
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

582
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:01,425
We must be cautious.

583
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:43,304
How long have you
had these droids?

584
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:44,577
Three or four seasons.

585
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,936
They're up for sale
if you want them.

586
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,820
Let me see your identification.

587
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:51,099
You don't need to see
his identification.

588
00:41:51,228 --> 00:41:53,458
We don't need to see
his identification.

589
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:55,818
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

590
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,701
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

591
00:41:58,827 --> 00:42:01,103
He can go about his business.

592
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,503
You can go about your business.

593
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:04,538
Move along.

594
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:05,817
Move along.

595
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,063
Move along.

596
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:25,536
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

597
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,023
Go on, go on.

598
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,623
I can't understand how
we got by those troops.

599
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:33,067
I thought we were dead.

600
00:42:33,188 --> 00:42:35,782
The Force can have
a strong influence ...

601
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:37,306
on the weak-minded.

602
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:41,740
Do you really think we're
gonna find a pilot here ...

603
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:43,347
that'll take us to Alderaan?

604
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:46,266
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here ...

605
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:47,706
only watch your step.

606
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:49,465
This place can be a little rough.

607
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,579
I'm ready for anything.

608
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,427
Come along, R2.

609
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:47,739
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.

610
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:48,744
What?

611
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,380
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

612
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:51,577
We don't want them here.

613
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,777
Why don't you wait
out by the speeder?

614
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:53,896
We don't want any trouble.

615
00:43:54,027 --> 00:43:55,824
I heartily agree with you, sir.

616
00:44:03,947 --> 00:44:05,063
Uh ...

617
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:06,416
I'll have one of those.

618
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:42,146
He doesn't like you.

619
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:43,940
I'm sorry.

620
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:46,536
I don't like you, either.

621
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:48,385
You just watch yourself.

622
00:44:48,507 --> 00:44:49,623
We're wanted men.

623
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:52,864
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

624
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:54,387
I'll be careful.

625
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:55,657
You'll be dead!

626
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:57,585
This little one's not worth the effort.

627
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,858
Come, let me get you something.

628
00:45:06,228 --> 00:45:08,344
Aah!

629
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:27,260
I'm all right.

630
00:45:28,387 --> 00:45:30,663
Chewbacca here is first mate ...

631
00:45:30,788 --> 00:45:33,666
on a ship that might suit us.

632
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:39,858
I don't like the look of this.

633
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:57,626
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

634
00:45:57,748 --> 00:46:00,945
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

635
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:03,262
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

636
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:06,141
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?

637
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,623
Should I have?

638
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:11,820
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

639
00:46:13,668 --> 00:46:15,784
I've outrun imperial starships.

640
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:17,864
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

641
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:20,023
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

642
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:23,983
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

643
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:25,666
What's the cargo?

644
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:28,746
Only passengers ...
myself, the boy ...

645
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:30,300
two droids ...

646
00:46:30,427 --> 00:46:33,226
and no questions asked.

647
00:46:33,347 --> 00:46:36,226
What is it, some kind
of local trouble?

648
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:39,306
Let's just say we'd like to avoid ...

649
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:41,259
any imperial entanglements.

650
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:44,983
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

651
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:47,302
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

652
00:46:49,027 --> 00:46:50,746
10,000, all in advance.

653
00:46:52,347 --> 00:46:53,576
10,000?

654
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:57,302
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!

655
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:59,543
But who's gonna fly it,
kid, you?

656
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:01,623
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

657
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,023
We don't have
to sit here and listen ...

658
00:47:04,148 --> 00:47:07,106
We can pay you 2,000 now ...

659
00:47:07,228 --> 00:47:10,106
plus 15 when
we reach Alderaan.

660
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,025
Seventeen, huh?

661
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:17,695
O.K. You guys got
yourselves a ship.

662
00:47:17,827 --> 00:47:19,021
We'll leave as soon
as you're ready.

663
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:20,182
Docking Bay 94.

664
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:21,422
Ninety-four.

665
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:25,217
Looks like somebody's
beginning to take an interest ...

666
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:27,623
in your handiwork.

667
00:47:27,748 --> 00:47:29,784
All right.
We'll check it out.

668
00:47:41,188 --> 00:47:42,507
17,000!

669
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:44,106
Those guys must really
be desperate.

670
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,184
This could really save my neck.

671
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:48,822
Get back to the ship,
get it ready.

672
00:47:48,947 --> 00:47:50,460
You'll have to sell your speeder.

673
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,784
That's O.K. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

674
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:58,139
Yes, Greedo.

675
00:47:58,268 --> 00:47:59,382
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

676
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,385
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

677
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:16,378
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

678
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,461
I don't have it with me.

679
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:23,179
Tell Jabba ...

680
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:32,425
Even I get boarded sometimes.

681
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:34,503
Do you think I had a choice?

682
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:40,623
Over my dead body.

683
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:47,215
I'll bet you have.

684
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:02,264
Sorry about the mess.

685
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:14,498
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

686
00:49:14,628 --> 00:49:17,539
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

687
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:19,465
The final checkout is completed.

688
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,067
All systems are operational.

689
00:49:21,188 --> 00:49:22,985
What course shall we set?

690
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:24,666
Perhaps she would respond ...

691
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:26,585
to an alternative
form of persuasion.

692
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:28,027
What do you mean?

693
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:29,945
I think it is time
we demonstrated ...

694
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,706
the full power of this station.

695
00:49:31,827 --> 00:49:33,260
Set your course for Alderaan.

696
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,706
With pleasure.

697
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:37,023
Lock the door, R2.

698
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:41,378
Check this side of the street.

699
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:47,664
The door's locked.
Move on to the next.

700
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:55,306
I would much rather have
gone with Master Luke ...

701
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:56,827
than stay here with you.

702
00:49:56,947 --> 00:49:59,143
I don't know what
all this trouble is about ...

703
00:49:59,268 --> 00:50:00,860
but I'm sure
it must be your fault.

704
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:03,141
You watch your language.

705
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:08,099
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

706
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:09,706
Look at this.

707
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:11,739
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.

708
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:13,266
It'll be enough.

709
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:37,306
Right here, Jabba.

710
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:40,141
I've been waitin' for you.

711
00:50:43,228 --> 00:50:45,219
You didn't think
I was gonna run, did you?

712
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:58,987
Look, Jabba, next time you want to
talk to me, come see me yourself.

713
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:00,335
Don't send one of these twerps.

714
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:17,139
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

715
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:20,583
You think I had a choice?

716
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:22,380
But I got a nice, easy charter.

717
00:51:22,507 --> 00:51:24,702
I'll pay ya back,
plus a little extra.

718
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:26,659
I just need a little more time.

719
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:36,458
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

720
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:50,222
Jabba ... you're a wonderful human being.

721
00:51:58,668 --> 00:52:00,623
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting ...

722
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:02,021
we ought to do well.

723
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:26,824
What a piece of junk!

724
00:52:26,947 --> 00:52:29,063
She'll make.5 past light speed.

725
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,586
She may not look like much ...

726
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,266
but she's got it
where it counts, kid.

727
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:34,947
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.

728
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,422
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board ...

729
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:38,900
we'll get outta here.

730
00:52:43,347 --> 00:52:44,496
Hello, sir.

731
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:54,621
Which way?

732
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:58,418
All right, men,
load your weapons.

733
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:02,422
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

734
00:53:11,347 --> 00:53:12,985
Chewie, get us out of here!

735
00:53:14,628 --> 00:53:18,461
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

736
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,822
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

737
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:38,858
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought.

738
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:40,501
Try and hold 'em off.

739
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:42,186
Angle the deflector shields
while I make the calculations ...

740
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:43,137
for the jump to light speed.

741
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:54,626
Stay sharp.
There's two more comin' in.

742
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,420
They're gonna try
and cut us off.

743
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:58,266
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

744
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:00,184
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

745
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:01,581
We'll be safe enough ...

746
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,539
once we make the jump
to hyperspace.

747
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:05,465
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

748
00:54:09,427 --> 00:54:11,259
Here's where the fun begins.

749
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:13,139
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

750
00:54:13,268 --> 00:54:15,827
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

751
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:17,585
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

752
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:20,744
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

753
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:21,856
Without precise calculations ...

754
00:54:21,987 --> 00:54:23,023
we'd fly right through a star ...

755
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:24,547
or bounce too close
to a supernova ...

756
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:26,579
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

757
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:27,663
What's that flashing?

758
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:28,538
We're losing a deflector shield.

759
00:54:28,668 --> 00:54:29,987
Go strap yourselves in.

760
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:31,860
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

761
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:54,302
We've entered the Alderaan system.

762
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:55,577
Governor Tarkin.

763
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,061
I should have expected ...

764
00:54:57,188 --> 00:54:58,985
to find you holding Vader's leash.

765
00:54:59,108 --> 00:55:00,586
I recognized your foul stench ...

766
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,585
when I was brought on board.

767
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,824
Charming to the last.

768
00:55:05,947 --> 00:55:08,461
You don't know
how hard I found it ...

769
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:10,465
signing the order
to terminate your life.

770
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:11,702
I'm surprised you had the courage ...

771
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:13,226
to take the responsibility yourself.

772
00:55:13,347 --> 00:55:16,260
Princess Leia,
before your execution ...

773
00:55:16,387 --> 00:55:17,980
I would like you to be my guest ...

774
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:21,418
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

775
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:24,505
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

776
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,936
The more you tighten
your grip, Tarkin ...

777
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:29,661
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

778
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:32,621
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

779
00:55:32,748 --> 00:55:35,023
In a way,
you have determined ...

780
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:37,867
the choice of the planet
that will be destroyed first.

781
00:55:37,987 --> 00:55:39,739
Since you are reluctant ...

782
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,666
to provide us with the location
of the rebel base ...

783
00:55:42,788 --> 00:55:45,541
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power ...

784
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:48,545
on your home planet of Alderaan.

785
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:49,782
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

786
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:51,306
We have no weapons.
You can't possibly ...

787
00:55:51,427 --> 00:55:53,338
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

788
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:55,856
Then name the system.

789
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:00,864
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

790
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:03,547
Where is the rebel base?

791
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,018
Dantooine.

792
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:10,501
They're on Dantooine.

793
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:12,902
There. You see, Lord Vader?

794
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:14,380
She can be reasonable.

795
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:16,226
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

796
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:17,746
What?

797
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,141
You're far too trusting.

798
00:56:19,268 --> 00:56:20,666
Dantooine is too remote ...

799
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:23,177
to make an effective demonstration,
but don't worry.

800
00:56:23,307 --> 00:56:26,061
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

801
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:27,222
No!

802
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,463
Commence primary ignition.

803
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:55,824
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

804
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:58,222
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force ...

805
00:56:58,347 --> 00:56:59,780
as if millions of voices ...

806
00:56:59,907 --> 00:57:01,704
suddenly cried out in terror ...

807
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,306
and were suddenly silenced.

808
00:57:03,427 --> 00:57:06,067
I fear something terrible
has happened.

809
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,987
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

810
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:14,581
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

811
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,585
I told you I'd outrun them.

812
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,423
Don't everybody thank me at once.

813
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:26,826
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 02:00 hours.

814
00:57:34,027 --> 00:57:35,746
Now be careful, R2.

815
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:44,947
Argh!

816
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:46,739
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

817
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:49,541
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

818
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:51,898
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

819
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:54,940
That's 'cause a droid don't pull
people's arms out of their sockets ...

820
00:57:55,068 --> 00:57:56,387
when they lose.

821
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,463
Wookiees are known to do that.

822
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,146
Grrr ...

823
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,623
I see your point, sir.

824
00:58:02,748 --> 00:58:04,067
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

825
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:05,586
Let the Wookiee win.

826
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,097
Argh!

827
00:58:22,788 --> 00:58:26,780
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

828
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:28,818
You mean it controls your actions?

829
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:31,746
Partially, but it also
obeys your commands.

830
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:38,980
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match ...

831
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:40,699
for a good blaster
at your side, kid.

832
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:43,023
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

833
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:46,264
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

834
00:58:46,387 --> 00:58:47,867
I've seen a lot of strange stuff ...

835
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:50,182
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe ...

836
00:58:50,307 --> 00:58:53,617
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

837
00:58:53,748 --> 00:58:57,661
There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

838
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:01,576
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

839
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,460
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

840
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,385
This time, let go
your conscious self ...

841
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:11,304
and act on instinct.

842
00:59:11,427 --> 00:59:14,579
With the blast shield down,
I can't even see.

843
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,027
How am I supposed to fight?

844
00:59:16,148 --> 00:59:17,057
Your eyes can deceive you.

845
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:18,222
Don't trust them.

846
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:29,463
Stretch out with your feelings.

847
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:45,384
You see? You can do it.

848
00:59:45,507 --> 00:59:47,065
I call it luck.

849
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:49,655
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

850
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:52,063
Look, good against remotes
is one thing.

851
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,940
Good against the living,
that's something else.

852
00:59:56,347 --> 00:59:57,905
Looks like we're coming
up on Alderaan.

853
01:00:01,108 --> 01:00:02,335
You know, I did feel something.

854
01:00:02,467 --> 01:00:03,583
I could almost see the remote.

855
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,583
That's good.

856
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,460
You've taken your first step ...

857
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:08,306
into a larger world.

858
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:13,657
Yes?

859
01:00:13,788 --> 01:00:16,460
Our scout ships have
reached Dantooine.

860
01:00:16,588 --> 01:00:18,385
They found the remains
of a rebel base ...

861
01:00:18,507 --> 01:00:20,737
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

862
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,257
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

863
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,221
She lied. She lied to us!

864
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:29,942
I told you she would never ...

865
01:00:30,068 --> 01:00:32,342
consciously betray the rebellion.

866
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,344
Terminate her immediately.

867
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:38,456
Stand by, Chewie.
Here we go.

868
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:39,907
Cut in the sublight engines.

869
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:43,666
What the ...

870
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,505
Arrghh arrgh!

871
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:48,902
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

872
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:50,177
Some kind of asteroid collision.

873
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:51,184
It's not on any of the charts.

874
01:00:51,307 --> 01:00:52,501
What's going on?

875
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:54,777
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

876
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:56,101
What do you mean?
Where is it?

877
01:00:56,228 --> 01:00:57,422
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.

878
01:00:57,547 --> 01:00:58,867
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.

879
01:00:58,987 --> 01:00:59,864
What? How?

880
01:00:59,987 --> 01:01:01,545
Destroyed by the Empire.

881
01:01:01,668 --> 01:01:03,862
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

882
01:01:03,987 --> 01:01:05,262
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than ...

883
01:01:07,188 --> 01:01:08,905
There's another ship coming in.

884
01:01:09,027 --> 01:01:09,938
Maybe they know what happened.

885
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:11,217
It's an imperial fighter.

886
01:01:12,827 --> 01:01:13,862
It followed us!

887
01:01:13,987 --> 01:01:15,898
No. It's a short-range fighter.

888
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:17,938
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

889
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:22,739
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

890
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:23,744
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.

891
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:24,777
Not if I can help it.

892
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:25,896
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

893
01:01:26,027 --> 01:01:26,858
It would be as well to let it go.

894
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:27,864
It's too far out of range.

895
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:29,137
Not for long.

896
01:01:31,947 --> 01:01:35,907
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

897
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,541
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

898
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:40,226
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough ...

899
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:41,416
to tell anybody about us.

900
01:01:43,827 --> 01:01:45,545
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

901
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,181
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

902
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,619
That's no moon.

903
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:53,146
It's a space station.

904
01:01:53,268 --> 01:01:54,985
It's too big to be a space station.

905
01:01:58,188 --> 01:02:00,496
I have a very bad feeling about this.

906
01:02:00,628 --> 01:02:02,300
Turn the ship around.

907
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,498
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!

908
01:02:04,628 --> 01:02:06,744
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

909
01:02:10,788 --> 01:02:13,143
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!

910
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:17,065
Why are we still
moving towards it?!

911
01:02:17,188 --> 01:02:18,905
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

912
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,585
There's got to be
something you can do!

913
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,027
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.

914
01:02:22,148 --> 01:02:23,297
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

915
01:02:23,427 --> 01:02:24,860
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

916
01:02:29,228 --> 01:02:30,456
You can't win ...

917
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:32,623
but there are alternatives
to fighting.

918
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:50,617
Clear Bay 327.

919
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:52,978
We are opening
the magnetic field.

920
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:08,177
To your stations!

921
01:03:08,307 --> 01:03:09,536
Come with me.

922
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:14,786
~ Close all outboard shields. ~

923
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,784
~ Close all outboard shields. ~

924
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:19,177
Yes?

925
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:20,661
~ We've captured a freighter  ... ~

926
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:22,016
~ entering the remains
of the Alderaan system. ~

927
01:03:22,148 --> 01:03:23,786
~ Its markings match
those of a ship  ... ~

928
01:03:23,907 --> 01:03:26,217
~ that blasted its way
out of Mos Eisley. ~

929
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:29,704
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

930
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:32,626
She may yet be of some use to us.

931
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,976
~ Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge. ~

932
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,664
~ 316, report to control. ~

933
01:03:47,628 --> 01:03:49,505
There's no one on board, sir.

934
01:03:49,628 --> 01:03:52,222
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

935
01:03:52,347 --> 01:03:54,144
It must be a decoy, sir.

936
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:55,666
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

937
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:56,617
Did you find any droids?

938
01:03:56,748 --> 01:03:57,577
No, sir.

939
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,539
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

940
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:01,101
Send a scanning crew aboard.

941
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:02,945
I want every part
of this ship checked.

942
01:04:03,068 --> 01:04:03,978
Yes, sir.

943
01:04:04,108 --> 01:04:05,427
I sense something ...

944
01:04:05,547 --> 01:04:08,380
a presence I've not felt since ...

945
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,427
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

946
01:04:12,547 --> 01:04:14,186
I want every part
of this ship checked.

947
01:04:22,907 --> 01:04:24,784
There's no one here.

948
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:34,985
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

949
01:04:35,108 --> 01:04:36,460
I use them for smuggling.

950
01:04:36,588 --> 01:04:38,146
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

951
01:04:38,268 --> 01:04:39,541
This is ridiculous.

952
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:40,862
Even if I could take off ...

953
01:04:40,987 --> 01:04:42,306
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

954
01:04:42,427 --> 01:04:43,780
Leave that to me.

955
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:46,547
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

956
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:47,896
Who's the more foolish ...

957
01:04:48,027 --> 01:04:49,938
the fool or the fool
who follows him?

958
01:04:50,068 --> 01:04:51,467
Argh!

959
01:04:58,387 --> 01:04:59,706
The ship's all yours.

960
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:01,625
If the scanners pick up anything ...

961
01:05:01,748 --> 01:05:03,545
report it immediately.

962
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:05,385
All right, let's go.

963
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:21,067
Hey, down there!

964
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:24,983
Could you give us a hand
with this?

965
01:05:33,188 --> 01:05:36,021
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

966
01:05:36,148 --> 01:05:38,342
TK-421, do you copy?

967
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:51,860
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.

968
01:05:51,987 --> 01:05:53,739
I'll see what I can do.

969
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,179
Grrr!

970
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:12,306
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight ...

971
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,862
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

972
01:06:14,987 --> 01:06:16,420
Bring them on!

973
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:17,617
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

974
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:19,625
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

975
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:22,387
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

976
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,748
He says he's found
the main controls ...

977
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:37,143
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.

978
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:39,304
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

979
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:41,987
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor ...

980
01:06:42,108 --> 01:06:43,460
in seven locations.

981
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:45,021
A power loss
at one of the terminals ...

982
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:47,581
will allow the ship to leave.

983
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:50,427
I don't think you boys can help.

984
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:52,186
I must go alone.

985
01:06:52,307 --> 01:06:53,820
Whatever you say.

986
01:06:53,947 --> 01:06:55,585
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

987
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:57,106
I want to go with you.

988
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:59,378
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

989
01:06:59,507 --> 01:07:01,021
They must be delivered safely ...

990
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:04,025
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

991
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:08,027
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

992
01:07:11,108 --> 01:07:14,737
The Force will be with you always.

993
01:07:21,847 --> 01:07:23,804
Argh argh argh!

994
01:07:23,927 --> 01:07:25,407
You said it, Chewie.

995
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:28,804
Where did you dig up
that old fossil?

996
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,724
Ben is a great man.

997
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:33,237
Yeah, great at getting us
into trouble.

998
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:34,641
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

999
01:07:34,768 --> 01:07:36,041
Well, anything's better
than just hangin' around ...

1000
01:07:36,168 --> 01:07:37,282
waiting for 'em to pick us up.

1001
01:07:37,407 --> 01:07:38,237
Who do you think ...

1002
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:40,806
What is it?

1003
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,884
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

1004
01:07:43,007 --> 01:07:45,237
He says "I've found her"
and keeps repeating "She's here."

1005
01:07:45,367 --> 01:07:47,961
Well, who ... who has he found?

1006
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:48,963
Princess Leia.

1007
01:07:49,088 --> 01:07:50,679
The princess?
She's here?!

1008
01:07:50,807 --> 01:07:51,684
Princess?

1009
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:53,001
Where? Where is she?

1010
01:07:53,128 --> 01:07:54,322
Princess? What's going on?

1011
01:07:58,887 --> 01:08:02,197
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

1012
01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:09,364
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

1013
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:10,443
Oh, no!

1014
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:11,887
We've got to do something!

1015
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:13,487
What are you talking about?

1016
01:08:13,608 --> 01:08:14,757
The droids belong to her.

1017
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:15,717
She's the one in the message.

1018
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:16,917
We got to help her.

1019
01:08:17,047 --> 01:08:18,197
Now look, don't get
any funny ideas.

1020
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,396
The old man wants us
to wait right here.

1021
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,846
But he didn't know
she was here.

1022
01:08:20,967 --> 01:08:22,958
Just find a way back into that
detention block.

1023
01:08:23,087 --> 01:08:23,997
I'm not going anywhere.

1024
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:25,162
They're going to execute her.

1025
01:08:25,287 --> 01:08:26,686
Look, a few minutes ago, you said ...

1026
01:08:26,807 --> 01:08:27,717
you didn't want to just wait here
to be captured.

1027
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:28,802
Now all you want to do is stay?

1028
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:30,520
Marching into the detention area ...

1029
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,716
is not what I had in mind.

1030
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:32,837
But they're gonna kill her!

1031
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,525
Better her than me.

1032
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:43,242
She's rich.

1033
01:08:43,368 --> 01:08:45,676
Argh!

1034
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:46,922
Rich?

1035
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:48,560
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

1036
01:08:48,688 --> 01:08:51,565
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be ...

1037
01:08:51,688 --> 01:08:52,802
What?

1038
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:54,280
Well, more well
than you can imagine.

1039
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:56,682
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

1040
01:08:56,807 --> 01:08:57,796
You'll get it.

1041
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:58,917
I better.

1042
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:00,400
You will.

1043
01:09:00,528 --> 01:09:01,961
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

1044
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:03,077
All right.

1045
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:04,037
What's your plan?

1046
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,395
Um ...

1047
01:09:05,528 --> 01:09:08,917
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

1048
01:09:09,047 --> 01:09:10,925
O.K.

1049
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:13,083
Now ... I'm gonna
put these on you.

1050
01:09:13,207 --> 01:09:14,162
Grrr!

1051
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:18,042
O.K. Han, you ... you put those on.

1052
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,203
Don't worry, Chewie.

1053
01:09:19,328 --> 01:09:20,726
I think I know
what he has in mind.

1054
01:09:20,847 --> 01:09:23,520
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking ...

1055
01:09:23,648 --> 01:09:26,287
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

1056
01:09:26,448 --> 01:09:27,846
Lock the door.

1057
01:09:27,967 --> 01:09:30,083
And hope they don't have blasters.

1058
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,845
That isn't very reassuring.

1059
01:09:37,368 --> 01:09:38,356
Grrr!

1060
01:09:51,528 --> 01:09:52,846
~ 517 to scanner control. ~

1061
01:09:52,967 --> 01:09:56,118
~ 517 to scanner control. ~

1062
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,484
~ 316, report to control. ~

1063
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:07,082
~ 53 to upper bay door. ~

1064
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:09,721
~ 53 to upper bay door. ~

1065
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:23,398
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

1066
01:10:52,408 --> 01:10:54,921
This is not gonna work.

1067
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:56,117
Why didn't you say so before?

1068
01:10:56,247 --> 01:10:58,125
I did say so before.

1069
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,765
Where are you taking this ... thing?

1070
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:18,481
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

1071
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,997
I wasn't notified.

1072
01:11:21,127 --> 01:11:23,163
I'll have to clear it.

1073
01:11:28,087 --> 01:11:29,237
Argh!

1074
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,595
Look out! He's loose!

1075
01:11:30,728 --> 01:11:31,557
He'll tear us all apart!

1076
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:32,916
I'll get him!

1077
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:56,203
Look out!

1078
01:12:02,207 --> 01:12:03,037
Arrgh!

1079
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:08,483
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

1080
01:12:08,608 --> 01:12:09,926
Here it is ... 2187.

1081
01:12:10,047 --> 01:12:12,481
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.

1082
01:12:15,328 --> 01:12:17,603
Uh ... Uh, everything's
under control.

1083
01:12:17,728 --> 01:12:18,877
Situation normal.

1084
01:12:19,007 --> 01:12:20,157
What happened?

1085
01:12:20,287 --> 01:12:22,563
Had a slight weapons malfunction ...

1086
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:24,804
but, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now.

1087
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:27,567
We're fine ... We're all fine
here now. Thank you.

1088
01:12:27,688 --> 01:12:28,802
How are you?

1089
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,725
We're sending a squad up.

1090
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,167
Uh, negative, negative!

1091
01:12:32,287 --> 01:12:34,756
We have a ... a reactor leak
here, uh, now.

1092
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:35,877
Give us a few minutes
to lock it down.

1093
01:12:36,007 --> 01:12:37,760
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

1094
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,481
Who is this? What's your
operating number?

1095
01:12:40,608 --> 01:12:41,676
Uh ...

1096
01:12:42,847 --> 01:12:43,962
Boring conversation anyway.

1097
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:46,806
Luke! We're gonna have company!

1098
01:12:59,648 --> 01:13:02,037
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

1099
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:02,997
Huh?

1100
01:13:03,127 --> 01:13:04,606
Oh, the uniform.

1101
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:08,158
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

1102
01:13:08,287 --> 01:13:09,640
You're who?

1103
01:13:09,768 --> 01:13:10,837
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

1104
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:12,002
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

1105
01:13:12,127 --> 01:13:13,243
Ben Kenobi?!
Where is he?

1106
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:14,278
Come on!

1107
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:17,362
He is here.

1108
01:13:17,488 --> 01:13:19,717
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

1109
01:13:19,847 --> 01:13:20,997
What makes you think so?

1110
01:13:21,127 --> 01:13:23,561
A tremor in the Force.

1111
01:13:23,688 --> 01:13:24,756
The last time I felt it ...

1112
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:26,923
was in the presence
of my old master.

1113
01:13:27,047 --> 01:13:29,403
Surely he must be dead by now.

1114
01:13:29,528 --> 01:13:32,247
Don't underestimate the Force.

1115
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:34,164
The Jedi are extinct.

1116
01:13:34,287 --> 01:13:36,404
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

1117
01:13:36,528 --> 01:13:39,804
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

1118
01:13:39,927 --> 01:13:41,360
Yes.

1119
01:13:41,488 --> 01:13:42,443
We have an emergency alert ...

1120
01:13:42,568 --> 01:13:45,082
in Detention Block AA-23.

1121
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:46,277
The princess?

1122
01:13:46,408 --> 01:13:47,636
Put all sections on alert.

1123
01:13:47,768 --> 01:13:49,167
Obi-Wan is here.

1124
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:51,198
The Force is with him.

1125
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:52,317
If you're right ...

1126
01:13:52,448 --> 01:13:54,244
he must not be
allowed to escape.

1127
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:55,801
Escape is not his plan.

1128
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:57,520
I must face him alone.

1129
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:05,797
Argh!

1130
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:07,918
Get behind me!
Get behind me!

1131
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:19,922
Watch your left.

1132
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:21,527
They went down the cell bay.

1133
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:25,480
Can't get out that way.

1134
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,121
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

1135
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:31,399
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

1136
01:14:31,528 --> 01:14:32,846
C-3PO, C-3PO!

1137
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:34,162
Yes, sir?

1138
01:14:34,287 --> 01:14:35,926
Are there any other ways
out of the cell bay?

1139
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:37,685
We've been cut off!

1140
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:41,923
What was that?
I didn't copy.

1141
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,244
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1142
01:14:45,368 --> 01:14:47,086
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

1143
01:14:47,207 --> 01:14:50,041
All other information
on your level is restricted.

1144
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:51,600
Open up in there!

1145
01:14:51,728 --> 01:14:53,479
Open up in there!

1146
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:55,199
Oh, no!

1147
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:56,806
There isn't any other way out!

1148
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:00,605
Argh!

1149
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:04,323
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what?!

1150
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:06,086
This is some rescue!

1151
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:07,800
You came in here, and you didn't
have a plan for getting out?

1152
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:09,805
He's the brains, sweetheart!

1153
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:11,042
Well, I didn't ...

1154
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:13,603
What the hell are you doing?

1155
01:15:13,728 --> 01:15:15,957
Somebody has to save our skins.

1156
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:19,800
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

1157
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:28,000
- Get in there!
- Arrgh!

1158
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,846
Get in there, you big furry oaf!

1159
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:32,082
I don't care what you smell.

1160
01:15:32,207 --> 01:15:34,881
Get in there, and
don't worry about it.

1161
01:15:37,448 --> 01:15:38,846
Wonderful girl!

1162
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:41,764
Either I'm going to kill her ...

1163
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:43,957
or I'm beginning to like her.

1164
01:15:45,448 --> 01:15:48,042
Get in there!

1165
01:15:50,887 --> 01:15:52,844
Aah!

1166
01:15:54,608 --> 01:15:55,643
Ah!

1167
01:15:55,768 --> 01:15:57,201
Argh!

1168
01:15:59,007 --> 01:16:01,646
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

1169
01:16:01,768 --> 01:16:05,123
What an incredible smell
you've discovered!

1170
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:09,797
Let's get out of here.

1171
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:11,122
Get away from there.

1172
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:12,158
No, wait!

1173
01:16:18,648 --> 01:16:19,524
Will you forget it?!
I already tried it!

1174
01:16:19,648 --> 01:16:21,081
It's magnetically sealed.

1175
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:23,163
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

1176
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,118
Absolutely, Your Worship.

1177
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,443
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

1178
01:16:27,568 --> 01:16:29,001
Ya know, it's not
gonna take 'em long ...

1179
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,560
to figure out
what happened to us!

1180
01:16:30,688 --> 01:16:32,484
It could be worse.

1181
01:16:32,608 --> 01:16:33,518
Woorr!

1182
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:37,282
It's worse.

1183
01:16:37,408 --> 01:16:38,841
There's something alive in here.

1184
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:40,287
That's your imagination.

1185
01:16:40,408 --> 01:16:43,081
Something just moved past my leg.

1186
01:16:44,728 --> 01:16:46,684
Look! Did you see that?

1187
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:47,637
What?

1188
01:16:47,768 --> 01:16:49,405
Grrr!

1189
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:07,997
Woorr!

1190
01:17:08,127 --> 01:17:08,957
Kid!

1191
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:09,917
Luke!

1192
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:11,400
Luke!

1193
01:17:11,528 --> 01:17:12,438
Luke!

1194
01:17:13,608 --> 01:17:14,676
Luke!

1195
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:19,203
Aah!

1196
01:17:19,328 --> 01:17:20,238
Woorr!

1197
01:17:20,368 --> 01:17:23,724
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

1198
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:26,157
Blast it!
My gun's jammed.

1199
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:27,845
Where?

1200
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:28,877
Anywhere!

1201
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:37,403
Luke, Luke!

1202
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,725
Help him!

1203
01:18:01,847 --> 01:18:02,882
What happened?

1204
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,042
I don't know.

1205
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:06,283
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

1206
01:18:12,328 --> 01:18:15,877
I got a bad feeling about this.

1207
01:18:16,007 --> 01:18:18,123
Grrr!

1208
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:20,997
The walls are moving!

1209
01:18:21,127 --> 01:18:22,355
Don't just stand there!

1210
01:18:22,488 --> 01:18:24,842
Try and brace it with something.

1211
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:31,645
Grrr!

1212
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:33,167
Help me!

1213
01:18:45,328 --> 01:18:46,317
Wait a minute!

1214
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:50,600
3PO!

1215
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:52,957
Come in, 3PO!

1216
01:18:53,087 --> 01:18:54,520
3PO!

1217
01:18:54,648 --> 01:18:56,399
Where could he be?

1218
01:19:00,927 --> 01:19:02,805
Take over. See to him.

1219
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:07,118
Look, there.

1220
01:19:08,448 --> 01:19:09,766
They're madmen.

1221
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:11,082
They're heading for the prison level.

1222
01:19:11,207 --> 01:19:12,640
If you hurry, you might catch them.

1223
01:19:12,768 --> 01:19:14,167
Follow me.

1224
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:20,083
You stand guard.

1225
01:19:23,807 --> 01:19:25,207
Come on.

1226
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,167
Oh!

1227
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:36,798
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

1228
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:40,203
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him
down to maintenance.

1229
01:19:40,328 --> 01:19:41,726
All right.

1230
01:19:53,207 --> 01:19:54,037
3PO!

1231
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:55,442
Come in, 3PO!

1232
01:19:55,568 --> 01:19:56,921
3PO!

1233
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,367
Get on top!

1234
01:19:58,488 --> 01:19:59,556
I can't.

1235
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:02,440
Where could he be?! 3PO!

1236
01:20:02,568 --> 01:20:04,524
3PO, will you come in!

1237
01:20:04,648 --> 01:20:05,966
They aren't here.

1238
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:07,237
Something must have
happened to them.

1239
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:08,686
See if they've been captured.

1240
01:20:08,807 --> 01:20:09,762
Hurry.

1241
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:14,600
One thing's for sure ...

1242
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:16,081
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

1243
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:20,639
Get on top of it.

1244
01:20:20,768 --> 01:20:21,802
I'm trying.

1245
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:28,319
Thank goodness they haven't found them.

1246
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,403
Where could they be?

1247
01:20:31,847 --> 01:20:33,327
"Use the comlink"?

1248
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:36,007
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

1249
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,115
Are you there, sir?

1250
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:42,920
3PO!

1251
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,037
We've had some problems.

1252
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:45,237
Will you shut up
and listen to me?!

1253
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:47,086
Shut down all
the garbage mashers ...

1254
01:20:47,207 --> 01:20:48,083
on the detention level, will ya?!

1255
01:20:48,207 --> 01:20:49,765
Do you copy!?

1256
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:53,163
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1257
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:55,721
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1258
01:20:55,847 --> 01:20:57,485
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

1259
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,323
What?

1260
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,881
Ha ha!

1261
01:21:13,927 --> 01:21:15,918
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2!

1262
01:21:16,047 --> 01:21:17,560
Curse my metal body!

1263
01:21:17,688 --> 01:21:21,396
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.

1264
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:23,006
We're all right! You did great!

1265
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:25,436
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch ...

1266
01:21:25,568 --> 01:21:27,604
on unit number ...
Where are we?

1267
01:21:27,728 --> 01:21:30,925
3263827!

1268
01:22:13,488 --> 01:22:16,365
If we can just avoid
any more female advice ...

1269
01:22:16,488 --> 01:22:18,604
we ought to be able
to get outta here.

1270
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:20,127
Well, let's get moving.

1271
01:22:20,247 --> 01:22:21,158
Grrr!

1272
01:22:21,287 --> 01:22:23,085
Where are you going?

1273
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:24,197
Aw ...

1274
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:25,680
No, wait! They'll hear!

1275
01:22:26,887 --> 01:22:28,640
Come here, you big coward.

1276
01:22:28,768 --> 01:22:29,677
Chewie, come here.

1277
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:31,082
Listen ...

1278
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:33,676
I don't know who you are
or where you came from ...

1279
01:22:33,807 --> 01:22:36,605
but from now on, you do
as I tell you, OK?

1280
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:38,559
Look, Your Worshipfulness ...

1281
01:22:38,688 --> 01:22:40,484
let's get one thing straight.

1282
01:22:40,608 --> 01:22:43,280
I take orders from
just one person ... me.

1283
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:45,319
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1284
01:22:45,448 --> 01:22:48,564
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

1285
01:22:48,688 --> 01:22:51,680
No reward is worth this.

1286
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:02,478
Give me regular reports, please.

1287
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:03,643
Right.

1288
01:23:05,768 --> 01:23:07,087
Do you know what's going on?

1289
01:23:07,207 --> 01:23:08,880
Maybe it's another drill.

1290
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:15,280
You seen that new VT-16?

1291
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:17,637
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1292
01:23:17,768 --> 01:23:19,759
They say it's ... it's quite a thing to see ...

1293
01:23:19,887 --> 01:23:21,878
What was that?

1294
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:23,487
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.

1295
01:23:23,608 --> 01:23:24,518
Don't worry about it.

1296
01:23:29,847 --> 01:23:30,677
There she is.

1297
01:23:30,807 --> 01:23:31,957
C-3PO? Do you copy?

1298
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:32,997
Yes, sir.

1299
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:34,958
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

1300
01:23:35,087 --> 01:23:37,283
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1301
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,761
We're right above you.
Stand by.

1302
01:23:40,887 --> 01:23:42,479
You came in that thing?

1303
01:23:42,608 --> 01:23:43,596
You're braver than I thought.

1304
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:44,956
Nice! Come on.

1305
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:49,797
It's them!

1306
01:23:49,927 --> 01:23:50,837
Blast them!

1307
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:52,882
Get back to the ship!

1308
01:23:53,007 --> 01:23:54,360
Where are you going?
Come back!

1309
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:55,443
He certainly has courage.

1310
01:23:55,568 --> 01:23:56,841
What good will it do us ...

1311
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:59,037
if he gets himself killed?
Come on.

1312
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,604
Aah!

1313
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:06,198
Aah!

1314
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:22,877
Whoop!

1315
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:25,521
I think we took a wrong turn.

1316
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:30,557
There's no lock.

1317
01:24:34,448 --> 01:24:35,641
That oughta hold them
for a while.

1318
01:24:35,768 --> 01:24:37,167
Quick! We've got to get across.

1319
01:24:37,287 --> 01:24:38,926
Find the controls
that extend the bridge.

1320
01:24:39,047 --> 01:24:40,367
I think I just blasted it.

1321
01:24:40,488 --> 01:24:42,206
They're coming through!

1322
01:25:03,648 --> 01:25:04,603
Here, hold this.

1323
01:25:20,807 --> 01:25:21,877
Here they come.

1324
01:25:31,648 --> 01:25:33,365
For luck.

1325
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:41,805
We think they may be splitting up.

1326
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:45,045
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1327
01:25:58,047 --> 01:25:59,082
Where could they be?

1328
01:26:03,768 --> 01:26:05,564
Close the blast doors!

1329
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:14,764
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

1330
01:26:32,408 --> 01:26:34,682
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1331
01:26:34,807 --> 01:26:36,240
We meet again at last.

1332
01:26:36,368 --> 01:26:39,326
The circle is now complete.

1333
01:26:39,448 --> 01:26:41,802
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1334
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:43,884
Now I am the master.

1335
01:26:44,007 --> 01:26:46,805
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1336
01:27:05,408 --> 01:27:07,557
Your powers are weak, old man.

1337
01:27:07,688 --> 01:27:09,201
You can't win, Darth.

1338
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:11,204
If you strike me down ...

1339
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:14,524
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1340
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:23,606
You should not have come back.

1341
01:27:48,328 --> 01:27:50,887
Didn't we just leave this party?

1342
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:53,556
What kept you?

1343
01:27:53,688 --> 01:27:54,564
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1344
01:27:54,688 --> 01:27:55,676
The ship all right?

1345
01:27:55,807 --> 01:27:57,445
It seems OK,
if we can get to it.

1346
01:27:57,568 --> 01:27:59,286
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1347
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:14,356
Look!

1348
01:28:17,847 --> 01:28:19,600
Come on, R2, we're going.

1349
01:28:21,408 --> 01:28:22,396
Now's our chance! Go!

1350
01:28:26,127 --> 01:28:27,037
Ben?

1351
01:28:41,967 --> 01:28:43,605
No!

1352
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,198
Come on!

1353
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,396
Come on!

1354
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:54,926
Come on!

1355
01:28:55,047 --> 01:28:56,117
Luke, it's too late!

1356
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,920
Blast the door, kid!

1357
01:29:07,287 --> 01:29:09,438
• Run, Luke, run! •

1358
01:29:11,488 --> 01:29:14,207
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission ...

1359
01:29:14,328 --> 01:29:16,796
or this is gonna be a real short trip.
O.K. Hit it!

1360
01:29:26,847 --> 01:29:28,645
Aargh!

1361
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:48,198
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1362
01:29:48,328 --> 01:29:49,920
Hold them off.

1363
01:29:50,047 --> 01:29:53,563
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1364
01:30:00,847 --> 01:30:03,203
I can't believe he's gone.

1365
01:30:05,768 --> 01:30:08,122
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1366
01:30:08,247 --> 01:30:11,001
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1367
01:30:26,528 --> 01:30:29,405
You in, kid?
OK, stay sharp.

1368
01:30:39,847 --> 01:30:40,917
Here they come.

1369
01:30:58,207 --> 01:30:59,960
They're coming in too fast!

1370
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,046
We've lost the lateral controls!

1371
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:11,318
Don't worry.
She'll hold together.

1372
01:31:12,807 --> 01:31:14,685
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1373
01:31:31,047 --> 01:31:31,957
Ha ha!

1374
01:31:35,967 --> 01:31:37,447
Got him! I got him!

1375
01:31:37,568 --> 01:31:39,717
Great, kid!
Don't get cocky.

1376
01:31:41,087 --> 01:31:42,645
There's still two more
of them out there!

1377
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:16,520
That's it! We did it!

1378
01:32:16,648 --> 01:32:18,684
We did it!

1379
01:32:18,807 --> 01:32:21,162
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

1380
01:32:28,807 --> 01:32:30,127
Are they away?

1381
01:32:30,247 --> 01:32:33,159
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1382
01:32:33,287 --> 01:32:37,439
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1383
01:32:37,568 --> 01:32:40,127
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1384
01:32:40,247 --> 01:32:41,920
This had better work.

1385
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:44,688
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1386
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:47,765
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1387
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:50,037
That doesn't sound too hard.

1388
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:51,395
They let us go.

1389
01:32:51,528 --> 01:32:52,721
It's the only explanation ...

1390
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:54,327
for the ease of our escape.

1391
01:32:54,448 --> 01:32:55,483
Easy? You call that easy?

1392
01:32:55,608 --> 01:32:56,518
They're tracking us.

1393
01:32:56,648 --> 01:32:58,239
Not this ship, sister.

1394
01:32:58,368 --> 01:33:01,882
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

1395
01:33:02,007 --> 01:33:03,565
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1396
01:33:03,688 --> 01:33:06,440
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1397
01:33:06,568 --> 01:33:09,002
I only hope that
when the data's analyzed ...

1398
01:33:09,127 --> 01:33:10,640
a weakness can be found.

1399
01:33:10,768 --> 01:33:12,201
It's not over yet.

1400
01:33:12,328 --> 01:33:13,966
It is for me, sister.

1401
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:15,725
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution ...

1402
01:33:15,847 --> 01:33:17,600
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1403
01:33:17,728 --> 01:33:18,877
I expect to be well paid.

1404
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:20,122
I'm in it for the money.

1405
01:33:20,247 --> 01:33:22,125
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1406
01:33:22,247 --> 01:33:23,761
If money is all that you love ...

1407
01:33:23,887 --> 01:33:26,243
then that's what you'll receive.

1408
01:33:28,207 --> 01:33:30,038
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1409
01:33:30,167 --> 01:33:32,283
I wonder if he really cares
about anything ...

1410
01:33:32,408 --> 01:33:33,841
or anybody.

1411
01:33:33,967 --> 01:33:35,367
I care.

1412
01:33:41,648 --> 01:33:44,037
So ...

1413
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:45,600
what do you think of her, Han?

1414
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:47,479
I'm trying not to, kid.

1415
01:33:47,608 --> 01:33:49,564
Good.

1416
01:33:52,807 --> 01:33:55,640
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1417
01:33:57,688 --> 01:33:59,006
I don't know.
What do you think?

1418
01:33:59,127 --> 01:34:00,560
You think a princess
and a guy like me ...

1419
01:34:00,688 --> 01:34:02,359
No!

1420
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:47,637
You're safe.

1421
01:34:47,768 --> 01:34:48,962
When we heard about Alderaan ...

1422
01:34:49,087 --> 01:34:50,203
we feared the worst.

1423
01:34:50,328 --> 01:34:51,920
We have no time
for sorrows, Commander.

1424
01:34:52,047 --> 01:34:53,765
You must use the information
in this R2 unit ...

1425
01:34:53,887 --> 01:34:54,764
to help plan the attack.

1426
01:34:54,887 --> 01:34:56,287
It's our only hope.

1427
01:35:17,207 --> 01:35:18,402
Yes.

1428
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,881
We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1429
01:35:20,007 --> 01:35:21,805
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.

1430
01:35:21,927 --> 01:35:24,362
We are preparing
to orbit the planet.

1431
01:35:32,688 --> 01:35:34,644
The battle station
is heavily shielded ...

1432
01:35:34,768 --> 01:35:36,485
and carries a firepower ...

1433
01:35:36,608 --> 01:35:38,439
greater than half the starfleet.

1434
01:35:38,568 --> 01:35:42,685
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1435
01:35:42,807 --> 01:35:47,836
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1436
01:35:47,967 --> 01:35:50,083
Pardon me for asking, sir ...

1437
01:35:50,207 --> 01:35:52,961
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?

1438
01:35:53,087 --> 01:35:56,444
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter ...

1439
01:35:56,568 --> 01:35:57,523
to be any threat ...

1440
01:35:57,648 --> 01:36:00,287
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1441
01:36:00,408 --> 01:36:03,319
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia ...

1442
01:36:03,448 --> 01:36:06,564
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1443
01:36:06,688 --> 01:36:09,282
The approach will not be easy.

1444
01:36:09,408 --> 01:36:12,399
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench ...

1445
01:36:12,528 --> 01:36:15,725
and skim the surface
to this point.

1446
01:36:15,847 --> 01:36:18,442
The target area
is only 2 meters wide.

1447
01:36:18,568 --> 01:36:20,604
It's a small thermal exhaust port ...

1448
01:36:20,728 --> 01:36:23,117
right below the main port.

1449
01:36:23,247 --> 01:36:26,239
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1450
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,881
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction ...

1451
01:36:29,007 --> 01:36:31,123
which should destroy the station.

1452
01:36:31,247 --> 01:36:34,684
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1453
01:36:34,807 --> 01:36:36,036
The shaft is ray-shielded ...

1454
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,805
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1455
01:36:37,927 --> 01:36:40,283
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1456
01:36:40,408 --> 01:36:43,684
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1457
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:46,082
They're not much bigger
than 2 meters.

1458
01:36:46,207 --> 01:36:49,439
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1459
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:59,523
~ Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity. ~

1460
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,479
~ The moon with the rebel base  ... ~

1461
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:03,802
~ will be in range in 30 minutes. ~

1462
01:37:03,927 --> 01:37:06,122
This will be a day long remembered.

1463
01:37:06,247 --> 01:37:08,556
It has seen the end of Kenobi ...

1464
01:37:08,688 --> 01:37:13,045
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1465
01:37:16,448 --> 01:37:19,645
All flight crews, man your stations.

1466
01:37:19,768 --> 01:37:22,520
All flight crews, man your stations.

1467
01:37:24,847 --> 01:37:27,805
So ... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1468
01:37:27,927 --> 01:37:29,327
That's right. Yeah.

1469
01:37:29,448 --> 01:37:32,997
I got some old debts I got
to pay off with this stuff.

1470
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:34,765
And even if I didn't ...

1471
01:37:34,887 --> 01:37:37,402
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?

1472
01:37:37,528 --> 01:37:39,086
Why don't you come with us?

1473
01:37:39,207 --> 01:37:40,960
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1474
01:37:41,087 --> 01:37:43,841
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1475
01:37:43,967 --> 01:37:45,195
You know what's about to happen ...

1476
01:37:45,328 --> 01:37:46,555
what they're up against.

1477
01:37:46,688 --> 01:37:47,802
They could use
a good pilot like you.

1478
01:37:47,927 --> 01:37:49,327
You're turning
your back on them.

1479
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:51,722
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1480
01:37:51,847 --> 01:37:53,645
Besides, attacking
that battle station ...

1481
01:37:53,768 --> 01:37:54,756
ain't my idea of courage.

1482
01:37:54,887 --> 01:37:57,560
It's more like ... suicide.

1483
01:37:58,887 --> 01:37:59,764
All right.

1484
01:37:59,887 --> 01:38:02,037
Take care of yourself, Han.

1485
01:38:02,167 --> 01:38:04,601
I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

1486
01:38:04,728 --> 01:38:06,002
Hey, Luke.

1487
01:38:09,167 --> 01:38:11,476
May the Force be with you.

1488
01:38:14,328 --> 01:38:15,238
Argh!

1489
01:38:15,368 --> 01:38:17,563
Argh!

1490
01:38:17,688 --> 01:38:18,916
What are you looking at?

1491
01:38:19,047 --> 01:38:20,765
I know what I'm doing.

1492
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:28,283
All pilots to your stations.

1493
01:38:28,408 --> 01:38:30,284
All pilots to your stations.

1494
01:38:35,328 --> 01:38:36,680
What's wrong?

1495
01:38:36,807 --> 01:38:38,240
Oh, it's Han.

1496
01:38:38,368 --> 01:38:40,484
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1497
01:38:40,608 --> 01:38:42,121
He's got to follow his own path.

1498
01:38:42,247 --> 01:38:44,000
No one can choose it for him.

1499
01:38:44,127 --> 01:38:48,041
I only wish Ben were here.

1500
01:38:55,087 --> 01:38:56,965
Open main launch tubes.

1501
01:38:58,007 --> 01:38:59,805
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

1502
01:39:00,007 --> 01:39:00,884
Hey, Luke!

1503
01:39:01,007 --> 01:39:01,997
Biggs!

1504
01:39:02,127 --> 01:39:03,765
I don't believe it.
How are you?

1505
01:39:03,887 --> 01:39:04,717
Great.

1506
01:39:04,847 --> 01:39:05,802
Hey, coming up?

1507
01:39:05,927 --> 01:39:07,122
I'll be right up there with you ...

1508
01:39:07,247 --> 01:39:08,840
and have I got stories to tell you.

1509
01:39:08,967 --> 01:39:12,085
Are you sure
you can handle this ship?

1510
01:39:12,207 --> 01:39:14,768
Sir, Luke is
the best bush pilot ...

1511
01:39:14,887 --> 01:39:16,445
in the outer-rim territories.

1512
01:39:16,568 --> 01:39:17,603
You'll do all right.

1513
01:39:17,728 --> 01:39:18,956
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1514
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:20,600
I gotta get aboard.

1515
01:39:20,728 --> 01:39:21,877
We'll hear all your stories when
we get back, all right?

1516
01:39:22,007 --> 01:39:22,884
All right.

1517
01:39:23,007 --> 01:39:23,997
Hey, Biggs.

1518
01:39:24,127 --> 01:39:25,447
I told you I'd make it someday.

1519
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,398
It'll be like old times, Luke.

1520
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:28,166
They'll never stop us.

1521
01:39:31,207 --> 01:39:32,845
Hey, this R2 unit of yours
seems a bit beat up.

1522
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:33,957
You want a new one?

1523
01:39:34,087 --> 01:39:35,645
Not on your life.

1524
01:39:35,768 --> 01:39:37,087
That little droid and I have
been through a lot together.

1525
01:39:37,207 --> 01:39:38,118
You OK, R2?

1526
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:42,002
Good.

1527
01:39:42,127 --> 01:39:45,279
Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.

1528
01:39:45,408 --> 01:39:47,876
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1529
01:39:50,087 --> 01:39:51,998
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1530
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:42,400
• Luke, the Force will be with you. •

1531
01:40:52,488 --> 01:40:53,886
~ Standby alert. ~

1532
01:40:54,007 --> 01:40:56,123
~ Death Star approaching. ~

1533
01:40:56,247 --> 01:40:59,239
~ Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes. ~

1534
01:41:11,847 --> 01:41:12,997
All wings report in.

1535
01:41:13,127 --> 01:41:13,957
Red 10 standing by.

1536
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:15,077
Red Seven standing by.

1537
01:41:15,207 --> 01:41:16,197
Red Three standing by.

1538
01:41:16,328 --> 01:41:17,476
Red Six standing by.

1539
01:41:17,608 --> 01:41:18,926
Red Nine standing by.

1540
01:41:19,047 --> 01:41:19,957
Red Two standing by.

1541
01:41:20,087 --> 01:41:20,997
Red 11 standing by.

1542
01:41:21,127 --> 01:41:22,880
Red Five standing by.

1543
01:41:24,247 --> 01:41:26,045
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1544
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,965
We're passing through
the magnetic field.

1545
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:33,203
Hold tight.

1546
01:41:33,328 --> 01:41:36,319
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.

1547
01:41:39,207 --> 01:41:40,880
Look at the size of that thing!

1548
01:41:41,007 --> 01:41:43,475
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1549
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:47,722
This is it, boys.

1550
01:41:47,847 --> 01:41:49,360
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1551
01:41:49,488 --> 01:41:50,603
I copy, Gold Leader.

1552
01:41:50,728 --> 01:41:52,161
We're starting for
the target shaft now.

1553
01:41:52,287 --> 01:41:53,243
We're in position.

1554
01:41:53,368 --> 01:41:54,403
I'm going to cut across the axis ...

1555
01:41:54,528 --> 01:41:55,643
and try and draw their fire.

1556
01:42:09,488 --> 01:42:11,046
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.

1557
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,600
I see it. Stay low.

1558
01:42:19,768 --> 01:42:21,201
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1559
01:42:25,528 --> 01:42:26,563
Luke, pull up!

1560
01:42:28,207 --> 01:42:29,197
Are you all right?

1561
01:42:29,328 --> 01:42:30,396
I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.

1562
01:42:36,087 --> 01:42:37,645
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader ...

1563
01:42:37,768 --> 01:42:38,722
but they're so small ...

1564
01:42:38,847 --> 01:42:39,962
they're evading our turbolasers.

1565
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:41,840
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1566
01:42:41,967 --> 01:42:43,878
Get the crews to their fighters.

1567
01:42:46,408 --> 01:42:48,478
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming ...

1568
01:42:48,608 --> 01:42:50,404
from the right side
of that deflection tower.

1569
01:42:50,528 --> 01:42:51,483
I'm on it.

1570
01:42:51,608 --> 01:42:53,439
I'm going in.
Cover me, Porkins.

1571
01:42:53,568 --> 01:42:54,761
I'm right with you,
Red Three.

1572
01:43:00,927 --> 01:43:02,122
I've got a problem here.

1573
01:43:02,247 --> 01:43:03,043
Eject.

1574
01:43:03,167 --> 01:43:04,043
I can hold it.

1575
01:43:04,167 --> 01:43:04,997
Pull up!

1576
01:43:05,127 --> 01:43:07,721
No, I'm all ... Aah!

1577
01:43:10,127 --> 01:43:12,118
~ The rebel base
will be in firing range ... ~

1578
01:43:12,247 --> 01:43:13,680
~ in seven minutes. ~

1579
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:19,367
• Luke, trust your feelings. •

1580
01:43:26,847 --> 01:43:30,681
Squad leaders, we've
picked up a new group of signals.

1581
01:43:30,807 --> 01:43:32,365
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1582
01:43:32,488 --> 01:43:34,079
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1583
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:35,277
Pick up your visual scanning.

1584
01:43:35,408 --> 01:43:36,318
Here they come.

1585
01:43:39,448 --> 01:43:41,086
Watch it. You've got one
on your tail.

1586
01:43:46,247 --> 01:43:47,158
I'm hit!

1587
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:49,523
You've picked one up!
Watch it!

1588
01:43:49,648 --> 01:43:50,921
I can't see it!

1589
01:43:52,807 --> 01:43:54,445
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him!

1590
01:43:56,127 --> 01:43:57,037
I'll be right there.

1591
01:44:08,728 --> 01:44:10,524
Several fighters have broken off ...

1592
01:44:10,648 --> 01:44:13,002
from the main group.
Come with me.

1593
01:44:15,847 --> 01:44:18,237
Fall in! Fall in!

1594
01:44:18,368 --> 01:44:19,278
Watch your back, Luke.

1595
01:44:19,408 --> 01:44:20,318
Watch your back.

1596
01:44:20,448 --> 01:44:21,641
Fighters above you, coming in.

1597
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:28,762
I'm hit, but not bad.

1598
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:30,207
R2, see what you can do with it.

1599
01:44:30,328 --> 01:44:32,398
Hang on back there.

1600
01:44:32,528 --> 01:44:34,962
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1601
01:44:35,087 --> 01:44:36,520
There's a heavy fire zone.

1602
01:44:36,648 --> 01:44:37,444
Red Five, where are you?

1603
01:44:37,568 --> 01:44:38,921
I can't shake him!

1604
01:44:42,847 --> 01:44:44,247
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1605
01:44:47,368 --> 01:44:48,926
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1606
01:44:55,688 --> 01:44:56,676
Thanks, Wedge.

1607
01:44:56,807 --> 01:44:58,957
Good shooting,
Wedge. Red Leader ...

1608
01:44:59,087 --> 01:45:00,203
this is Gold Leader.

1609
01:45:00,328 --> 01:45:01,396
We're starting our attack run.

1610
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:05,523
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.

1611
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:09,917
Stay in attack formation.

1612
01:45:10,047 --> 01:45:12,801
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1613
01:45:18,408 --> 01:45:19,556
Switch all power ...

1614
01:45:19,688 --> 01:45:22,042
to front deflector screen.

1615
01:45:22,167 --> 01:45:23,567
Switch all power ...

1616
01:45:23,688 --> 01:45:25,519
to front deflector screen.

1617
01:45:29,127 --> 01:45:30,765
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1618
01:45:30,887 --> 01:45:32,002
Say about 20 guns ...

1619
01:45:32,127 --> 01:45:33,958
some on the surface,
some on the towers.

1620
01:45:34,087 --> 01:45:36,806
~ Death Star will be in range
in five minutes. ~

1621
01:45:38,847 --> 01:45:41,725
Switch to targeting computer.

1622
01:45:44,127 --> 01:45:46,038
Computer locked. Getting a signal.

1623
01:45:48,007 --> 01:45:50,363
The guns! They've stopped!

1624
01:45:52,007 --> 01:45:53,327
Stabilize your rear deflectors.

1625
01:45:53,448 --> 01:45:55,086
Watch for enemy fighters.

1626
01:45:55,207 --> 01:45:56,880
They're coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1627
01:45:58,807 --> 01:46:00,844
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1628
01:46:00,967 --> 01:46:02,195
Yes, sir.

1629
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:17,157
It's no good.
I can't maneuver.

1630
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:18,277
Stay on target.

1631
01:46:18,408 --> 01:46:19,238
We're too close.

1632
01:46:19,368 --> 01:46:20,356
Stay on target.

1633
01:46:22,087 --> 01:46:22,997
Loosen up!

1634
01:46:25,967 --> 01:46:28,606
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1635
01:46:28,728 --> 01:46:29,921
I copy, Gold Leader.

1636
01:46:30,047 --> 01:46:30,957
They came from behind.

1637
01:46:35,488 --> 01:46:37,284
We've analyzed their attack, sir ...

1638
01:46:37,408 --> 01:46:39,682
and there is a danger.

1639
01:46:39,807 --> 01:46:42,117
Should I have your
ship standing by?

1640
01:46:42,247 --> 01:46:45,001
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1641
01:46:45,127 --> 01:46:46,765
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1642
01:46:46,887 --> 01:46:49,448
~ Rebel base, three minutes
and closing. ~

1643
01:46:49,568 --> 01:46:51,922
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1644
01:46:52,047 --> 01:46:53,367
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1645
01:46:53,488 --> 01:46:55,557
This is Red Two flying toward you.

1646
01:46:55,688 --> 01:46:57,484
Red Three standing by.

1647
01:46:57,608 --> 01:46:59,087
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1648
01:46:59,207 --> 01:47:00,606
Keep half your group
out of range ...

1649
01:47:00,728 --> 01:47:01,956
for the next run.

1650
01:47:02,087 --> 01:47:04,363
Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.

1651
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:07,639
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1652
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:16,886
This is it!

1653
01:47:21,287 --> 01:47:23,279
We should be able to see it by now.

1654
01:47:24,927 --> 01:47:26,600
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1655
01:47:28,247 --> 01:47:29,475
There's too much interference.

1656
01:47:29,608 --> 01:47:30,643
Red Five, can you see them
from where you are?

1657
01:47:30,768 --> 01:47:32,564
No sign of any ...
Wait. Coming in.35.

1658
01:47:32,688 --> 01:47:33,597
I see them.

1659
01:47:35,087 --> 01:47:36,122
I'm in range.

1660
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:38,278
Target's coming up.

1661
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:43,524
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1662
01:47:43,648 --> 01:47:45,842
Close up formation.

1663
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:49,238
Almost there.

1664
01:47:57,967 --> 01:47:59,798
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.

1665
01:48:00,007 --> 01:48:01,077
Almost there.

1666
01:48:02,448 --> 01:48:04,006
I can't hold them.

1667
01:48:05,247 --> 01:48:06,840
Aah!

1668
01:48:11,927 --> 01:48:13,327
It's away!

1669
01:48:17,007 --> 01:48:18,440
It's a hit!

1670
01:48:18,568 --> 01:48:20,524
Negative, negative.
It didn't go in.

1671
01:48:20,648 --> 01:48:23,162
It just impacted on the surface.

1672
01:48:29,448 --> 01:48:30,961
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1673
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:33,283
Turn to .05.
We'll cover for you.

1674
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,717
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1675
01:48:36,847 --> 01:48:38,997
Get set up for your attack run.

1676
01:48:43,448 --> 01:48:45,006
Aah!

1677
01:48:51,287 --> 01:48:54,279
~ Rebel base,
one minute and closing. ~

1678
01:48:54,408 --> 01:48:56,524
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1679
01:48:56,648 --> 01:48:58,365
We're going in full throttle.

1680
01:48:58,488 --> 01:48:59,806
That ought to keep those
fighters off our back.

1681
01:49:00,007 --> 01:49:01,918
Right with you, boss.

1682
01:49:02,047 --> 01:49:04,198
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1683
01:49:04,328 --> 01:49:06,238
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1684
01:49:13,287 --> 01:49:15,404
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1685
01:49:15,528 --> 01:49:16,516
My scope shows the tower ...

1686
01:49:16,648 --> 01:49:17,966
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1687
01:49:18,087 --> 01:49:19,487
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1688
01:49:22,807 --> 01:49:24,719
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1689
01:49:24,847 --> 01:49:26,042
What about that tower?

1690
01:49:26,167 --> 01:49:27,237
You worry about those fighters!

1691
01:49:27,368 --> 01:49:28,483
I'll worry about the tower!

1692
01:49:33,887 --> 01:49:36,720
R2, that stabilizer's
broken loose again.

1693
01:49:36,847 --> 01:49:38,076
See if you can't lock it down.

1694
01:49:46,448 --> 01:49:48,564
Fighters coming in.3.

1695
01:49:56,287 --> 01:49:58,596
I'm hit!
I can't stay with you!

1696
01:49:58,728 --> 01:50:00,957
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

1697
01:50:01,087 --> 01:50:01,997
Sorry.

1698
01:50:03,207 --> 01:50:04,880
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1699
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,167
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time.

1700
01:50:09,287 --> 01:50:10,403
We can't hold them.

1701
01:50:13,887 --> 01:50:15,162
R2, try and increase the power.

1702
01:50:21,648 --> 01:50:22,762
Hurry up, Luke!

1703
01:50:22,887 --> 01:50:24,320
Quick! Quick!

1704
01:50:31,568 --> 01:50:33,957
~ Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing. ~

1705
01:50:34,087 --> 01:50:35,122
I'm on the leader.

1706
01:50:38,488 --> 01:50:39,806
Hang on, R2.

1707
01:50:54,728 --> 01:50:56,922
• Use the Force, Luke. •

1708
01:50:59,688 --> 01:51:01,599
• Let go, Luke. •

1709
01:51:03,648 --> 01:51:05,842
The Force is strong with this one.

1710
01:51:05,967 --> 01:51:07,480
• Luke, trust me. •

1711
01:51:12,807 --> 01:51:14,082
His computer's off.

1712
01:51:14,207 --> 01:51:16,005
Luke, you switched off
your targeting computer!

1713
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:17,640
What's wrong?

1714
01:51:17,768 --> 01:51:19,326
Nothing. I'm all right.

1715
01:51:31,728 --> 01:51:32,877
I've lost R2!

1716
01:51:34,408 --> 01:51:37,127
~ The Death Star
has cleared the planet. ~

1717
01:51:37,247 --> 01:51:39,921
~ The Death Star
has cleared the planet. ~

1718
01:51:40,047 --> 01:51:41,605
~ Rebel base in range. ~

1719
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:44,082
You may fire when ready.

1720
01:51:44,207 --> 01:51:46,323
~ Commence primary ignition. ~

1721
01:51:58,927 --> 01:52:00,485
I have you now.

1722
01:52:02,728 --> 01:52:03,762
What?

1723
01:52:03,887 --> 01:52:04,797
Yahoo!

1724
01:52:06,568 --> 01:52:07,841
Look out!

1725
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:16,400
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1726
01:52:22,967 --> 01:52:24,320
~ Stand by. ~

1727
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,646
~ Stand by. ~

1728
01:52:38,847 --> 01:52:39,677
Great shot, kid!

1729
01:52:39,807 --> 01:52:41,877
That was one in a million!

1730
01:52:42,007 --> 01:52:46,319
• Remember, the Force
will be with you — always. •

1731
01:53:04,007 --> 01:53:05,407
Luke!

1732
01:53:09,207 --> 01:53:10,527
Hey! Hey!

1733
01:53:10,648 --> 01:53:12,319
I knew you'd come back.
I just knew it.

1734
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,676
Well, I wasn't going to let you
get all the credit ...

1735
01:53:13,807 --> 01:53:15,036
and take all the reward.

1736
01:53:15,167 --> 01:53:17,601
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1737
01:53:17,728 --> 01:53:18,842
Oh, no!

1738
01:53:18,967 --> 01:53:21,277
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1739
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,639
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1740
01:53:24,768 --> 01:53:26,485
We'll get to work
on him right away.

1741
01:53:26,608 --> 01:53:27,881
You must repair him.

1742
01:53:28,007 --> 01:53:29,805
Sir, if any of my circuits
or gears will help ...

1743
01:53:29,927 --> 01:53:30,757
I'll gladly donate them.

1744
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:31,957
He'll be all right.

1745
01:54:05,047 --> 01:54:06,527
Argh!

1746
01:55:06,488 --> 01:55:08,956
Argh!

1747
01:55:15,488 --> 01:55:18,207
Argh!
