1
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,348
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:35,395
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,228
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,646
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:41,939
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,319
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,737
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:17,852
Inform the commander that
Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,060
Sir.

10
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,935
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,350
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,973
I'm here to put you back
on schedule.

13
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,145
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:10,693
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,986
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:21,076
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,411
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:27,665
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,425
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:37,298
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,891
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,305
I hope so, Commander,
for your sake.

23
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,307
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:07,706
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:11,622
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:16,045
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,464
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,473
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:36,028
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,284
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:49,038
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,540
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:20,189
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,944
We'd better go.

35
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:34,629
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,507
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,920
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:45,012
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,720
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:57,435
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,528
Oh, my!

42
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,607
Oh, no.

43
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,165
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:19,007
We bring a message
to your master,Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,925
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,384
What gift?

47
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:48,112
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:01,706
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:07,550
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,209
Good morning.

51
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:51,720
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,441
Greetings, Exalted One.

53
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,856
Allow me to introduce myself.

54
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:09,855
I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.

55
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:13,328
I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...

56
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,118
and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.

57
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:21,033
I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.

58
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,461
With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...

59
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,301
which will be mutually beneficial...

60
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:32,096
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.

61
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,389
As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...

62
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,261
these two droids.

63
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,269
What did he say?

64
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:44,932
Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.

65
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:48,816
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,202
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,663
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:06,000
We're doomed.

69
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:13,092
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:18,011
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,802
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,475
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,075
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:45,072
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,751
How horrid!

76
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:18,986
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:21,739
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,779
I am C-3PO...

79
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,658
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,286
Well, yes.

81
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:29,908
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:33,663
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

83
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:36,421
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:39,885
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,804
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,509
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,229
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,518
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,986
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:00,570
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,865
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,455
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:13,870
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:16,710
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:48,696
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:46,278
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:48,649
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:56,952
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:05,541
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:07,996
Yes?

101
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,225
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,927
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:25,022
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,809
"50,000. No less. "

105
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,451
What did I say?

106
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,461
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,754
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,605
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,360
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:29,629
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,913
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,096
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,672
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:34,430
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,972
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:44,568
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:47,981
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,911
Who are you?

119
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,373
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,875
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:10,337
What's that?

122
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:14,972
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,221
Hey,Jabba.

124
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:25,192
Look,Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:28,190
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:32,022
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,868
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:40,449
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,079
Look...

130
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,423
Take him away.

131
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,296
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,919
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,009
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:05,105
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,474
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:11,236
I'm sure.

137
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,112
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:33,176
Chewie?

139
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:36,927
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,464
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:44,471
What's going on?

142
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,603
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:52,269
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:56,029
AJedi knight?

145
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:00,692
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,040
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,461
I'm all right.

148
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,425
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,598
No bargain.

150
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,189
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:21,448
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,319
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,462
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,001
Master.

155
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,179
Luke Skywalker,Jedi knight.

156
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:48,552
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,476
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:53,355
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:57,144
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:03,525
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,108
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:18,244
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,538
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:23,628
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,593
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:30,678
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:35,012
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:39,726
There will be no bargain,
young Jedi.

169
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:44,480
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:18,135
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:09,144
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:13,486
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,372
Han.

174
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:36,125
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,665
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,471
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,088
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,186
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:53,147
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:56,311
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,069
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,064
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,527
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,951
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,279
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:13,284
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,503
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,131
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,884
You should have bargained,Jabba.

190
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,180
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

191
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,442
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,690
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,740
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,703
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

195
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,118
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,574
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,740
Great.

198
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:49,217
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,421
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,476
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,640
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,727
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,520
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,050
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,300
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:39,759
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:43,894
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:53,451
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:56,199
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,121
Right?

211
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,493
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,703
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,963
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:39,403
Put him in.

215
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,313
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:16,740
Help!

217
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:25,704
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,257
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:34,413
Lando.

220
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:43,845
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:47,306
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,505
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,014
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,570
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:03,543
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:14,266
Gently, now.

227
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:16,438
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:29,746
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,873
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,992
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,668
A little higher!

232
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,831
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,510
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,923
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,431
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,474
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,052
Beast!

238
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:02,269
Get the gun!

239
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:03,648
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,744
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,079
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:23,757
Come on.

243
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:34,262
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:15,550
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:18,304
Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.

246
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,106
- I will.
- Luke, thanks.

247
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:24,481
Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.

248
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,606
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,282
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,373
to an old friend.

251
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:36,012
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:45,978
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:49,264
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,235
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,110
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:02,532
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:05,996
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:10,538
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,960
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,760
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:20,632
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:26,264
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:54,539
That face you make...

264
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:58,170
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,045
No, of course not.

266
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:03,096
I do.

267
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:08,182
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:12,846
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:14,940
Old and weak.

270
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:21,523
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,483
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,498
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:35,746
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:39,005
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:41,802
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,056
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,139
but not that strong.

278
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:55,976
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,570
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:05,905
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:09,701
But I need your help.

282
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:12,996
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,248
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:18,496
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:23,873
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:32,469
Not yet.

287
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:34,594
One thing remains...

288
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:40,059
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,987
Then... Only then...
A Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,864
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:54,998
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:01,159
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,789
Rest I need.

294
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,338
Yes.

295
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:10,094
Rest.

296
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:13,972
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:20,472
Your father he is.

298
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,318
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:32,452
Yes.

300
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:36,576
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,994
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:43,833
Unfortunate that I know
the truth?

303
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,244
No.

304
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:52,382
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:55,050
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:59,641
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:03,273
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:09,987
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:16,778
But beware.

310
00:43:16,913 --> 00:43:20,447
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,204
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,661
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:27,797 --> 00:43:31,547
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

314
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,552
Do not...

315
00:43:43,646 --> 00:43:48,143
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:52,686
or suffer your father's fate
you will.

317
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,199
When gone am I...

318
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,164
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,751
The Force runs strong in
your family.

320
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,842
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,481
There is...

322
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:32,311
another...

323
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:40,820
Skywalker.

324
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:43,512
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:49,800
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:49,936 --> 00:45:52,096
Yoda will always be with you.

327
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,389
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:04,074
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:08,068
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:13,710
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:17,751
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,375
When that happened...

333
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:22,675
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,128
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:28,092
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:30,681
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:34,677
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:34,813 --> 00:46:37,731
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:41,231
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:43,775
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:46,065
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,818
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:53,903
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:57,956
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:58,088 --> 00:46:59,367
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,213
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:05,092
He's more machine now
than man...

348
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:07,175
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:11,137
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:13,175
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:16,561
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:19,476
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:25,820
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:29,108
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:32,532
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:34,581 --> 00:47:37,155
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:40,041
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,081
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:46,797
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:49,382
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:53,213
if Anakin were to have
any offspring...

362
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:55,887
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:56,018 --> 00:48:01,309
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,809
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,114 --> 00:48:11,985
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,490
They do you credit...

367
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:17,704
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:42,856
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:46,067
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:49,063
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:52,150
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:54,405
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,286 --> 00:48:57,242
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:59,163
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:10,460
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,126
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,385
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,306
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,675
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:24,766
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,391
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:28,398
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:30,565
But most important of all...

384
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:33,396
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,653
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:35,782 --> 00:49:38,239
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,581
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:47,454
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:52,711
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:58,298
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:58,431 --> 00:50:01,929
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:50:03,226 --> 00:50:05,516
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:09,264
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:18,652
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:23,990
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,123 --> 00:50:27,039
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:30,121
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:36,007
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,414
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:41,010
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,847
General Madine.

402
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:46,809
We have stolen a small
imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:51,148
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:56,067
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:57,440
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,860
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,992
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:07,036
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:10,284
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:16,702
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,750
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,391
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:31,139
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:34,728
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:53,367
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:55,043
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,585
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,039
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,175 --> 00:52:03,168
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,302 --> 00:52:07,003
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,307 --> 00:52:09,719
All right?

422
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:11,132
Right.

423
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:20,599
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,894
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:25,820
Good luck.

426
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:27,445
You too.

427
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:38,543
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:44,833
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:57,103
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,231 --> 00:53:00,681
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:05,192
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:08,655
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:10,989
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:15,329
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:28,251
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,059
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:51,483
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:59,072
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:04,503
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,623
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:11,672
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,594
Your work here is finished,
my friend.

443
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:16,391
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:16,516 --> 00:54:18,425
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,195
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:42,125
We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.

447
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,494
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

448
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:57,222
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

449
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:00,052
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:03,184
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:06,472
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:10,016
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,152 --> 00:55:11,978
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:14,318
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:18,989
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:22,702
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,835
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:30,713 --> 00:55:33,003
Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?

459
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,050
Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.

460
00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:41,885
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:44,925
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:47,018
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,101
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,237 --> 00:55:56,525
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:59,407
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,001
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:12,956
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:15,378
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:18,465
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:22,219
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,143
Shuttle Tydirium...

472
00:56:28,269 --> 00:56:30,643
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.

473
00:56:30,773 --> 00:56:33,061
Follow your present course.

474
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:35,682
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,983
No problem.

476
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,434
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:31,322
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,458
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,297 --> 00:57:39,585
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:42,385
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,885
Hey...

482
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,291
it's me.

483
00:58:10,913 --> 00:58:12,905
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:14,534
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:32,056
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:35,389
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:40,731
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:49,487
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:59:01,128 --> 00:59:02,706
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,634
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,172
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,842
General Solo,
somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:20,313
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:23,606
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:26,235
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,407
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,581
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:35,458
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,088
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:01,864 --> 01:03:03,739
Cut it out.

501
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,666
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:33,396
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:37,686
Trouble is,
I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:40,690
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:43,652
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:47,739
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:51,985
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,211
That's right.

509
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,842
Come on.

510
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,447
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,532
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,623
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,465
What is it?

514
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,369
Freeze!

515
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,713
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,137 --> 01:05:36,925
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:42,891
What the...

518
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,528
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:47,411
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:49,128 --> 01:06:53,873
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,467 --> 01:06:57,175
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:58,722 --> 01:07:00,927
My son is with them.

523
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:07,226
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:08,688 --> 01:07:11,181
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:17,983
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:20,867
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:25,239
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:28,373
He will come to me?

529
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,952
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:37,132
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,259 --> 01:07:41,172
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:43,514
As you wish.

533
01:08:05,077 --> 01:08:06,489
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,960
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:13,085 --> 01:08:14,994
And I found this.

536
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:20,882
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:24,929
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:29,894 --> 01:08:31,009
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,515
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:52,532
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,248
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:01,256
Nice work.

543
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:04,877
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:07,087
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:10,389
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:12,225
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:09:12,353 --> 01:09:13,810
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:23,398
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:25,523
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:08,448 --> 01:10:11,367
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:15,913 --> 01:10:17,029
Hey!

552
01:10:17,164 --> 01:10:19,621
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:25,882 --> 01:10:28,337
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:32,052
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:38,100
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:11,835
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,381
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:13,512 --> 01:11:16,298
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

559
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:18,055
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:19,268 --> 01:11:21,344
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:24,515
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

562
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:28,184
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:36,985
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,989
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,372
Proper?

566
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,119
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:46,497
Why, you...

568
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,213
My mistake.

569
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,887
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,417
Hey.

571
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:48,057
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

572
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,662
What did he say?

573
01:13:10,793 --> 01:13:13,118
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:13,253 --> 01:13:16,753
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:36,648
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:38,520
These are my friends.

577
01:13:41,615 --> 01:13:45,827
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:03,636 --> 01:14:06,804
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:10,846
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:12,935
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

581
01:14:13,063 --> 01:14:15,435
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

582
01:14:15,565 --> 01:14:17,108
Tell them.

583
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:35,117
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:35,252 --> 01:14:36,828
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:36,962 --> 01:14:38,242
Wait.

586
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:48,761
What's happening?

587
01:14:54,186 --> 01:14:55,895
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:56,023 --> 01:14:57,564
Somebody!

589
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:59,018
Somebody help!

590
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:01,854
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,975
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:47,322 --> 01:15:48,981
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:50,242 --> 01:15:52,198
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:01,251
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:05,078
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:07,259 --> 01:16:08,717
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:11,845 --> 01:16:13,588
...Death Star.

598
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,842
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:26,314
Yes, R2, I was just
coming to that.

600
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:30,775
Master Luke...

601
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:41,072
...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.

602
01:16:43,752 --> 01:16:44,832
...Vader!

603
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,125
Han Solo...

604
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,759
...carbon.

605
01:16:52,345 --> 01:16:53,590
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:15,242 --> 01:17:18,077
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:31,841 --> 01:17:34,511
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:37,802
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:51,898
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:57,533 --> 01:18:00,735
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:00,869 --> 01:18:02,827
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:04,579
Ask him.

613
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,914
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:08,043 --> 01:18:09,952
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:11,462 --> 01:18:13,670
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:18,050
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:23,423
Leia, do you remember
your mother...

618
01:18:23,559 --> 01:18:25,597
Your real mother?

619
01:18:25,726 --> 01:18:29,226
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:29,355 --> 01:18:31,265
What do you remember?

621
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:33,972
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,688
Tell me.

623
01:18:37,405 --> 01:18:40,440
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:40,574 --> 01:18:43,195
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:48,158
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:50,747
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,787
I never knew her.

628
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:57,747
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,465
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:08,103 --> 01:19:09,810
How do you know?

631
01:19:09,936 --> 01:19:11,845
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:12,898 --> 01:19:16,149
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:16,277 --> 01:19:18,150
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:21,730
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:25,737
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:30,748 --> 01:19:32,622
He's my father.

637
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:38,213
Your father?

638
01:19:39,507 --> 01:19:43,506
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:46,471
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:19:46,597 --> 01:19:48,092
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:52,720
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,846
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,807
You have that power too.

644
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,274
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:04,908 --> 01:20:07,149
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,612
My father has it.

647
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:13,912
I have it.

648
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,369
And...

649
01:20:16,668 --> 01:20:19,042
my sister has it.

650
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,463
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,353
I know.

652
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:39,814
Somehow...

653
01:20:41,527 --> 01:20:43,104
I've always known.

654
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:45,194
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:49,731
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:53,202
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:56,579
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:56,707 --> 01:20:58,666
You've always been strong.

659
01:20:59,962 --> 01:21:02,251
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:06,082
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:08,210
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:08,345 --> 01:21:11,463
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,681
I have to try.

664
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:35,112
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:36,913 --> 01:21:40,199
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:41,586 --> 01:21:43,210
Nothing?

667
01:21:45,006 --> 01:21:46,914
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:52,095 --> 01:21:54,253
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,512
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:16,369 --> 01:22:17,994
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:21,707 --> 01:22:23,416
Hold me.

672
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,595
This is the rebel that surrendered to us.

673
01:23:18,722 --> 01:23:21,640
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:24,471
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:25,561 --> 01:23:28,266
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:30,275 --> 01:23:31,984
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:34,020
Leave us.

678
01:23:34,154 --> 01:23:37,819
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:39,283 --> 01:23:41,028
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:42,871 --> 01:23:44,993
The emperor has been
expecting you.

681
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:47,786
I know, Father.

682
01:23:49,295 --> 01:23:51,618
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:52,796 --> 01:23:56,296
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:56,426 --> 01:23:59,628
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,181
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:03,975 --> 01:24:05,599
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:05,726 --> 01:24:08,347
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:12,317 --> 01:24:14,523
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:24:15,569 --> 01:24:18,108
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:25,371 --> 01:24:28,408
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:24:32,045 --> 01:24:34,997
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:40,219 --> 01:24:44,797
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,512
Come with me.

694
01:24:53,606 --> 01:24:56,478
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:57,778 --> 01:25:02,570
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:05,451
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:09,952
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:11,332 --> 01:25:13,905
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:14,043 --> 01:25:17,828
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:17,965 --> 01:25:20,585
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:21,842 --> 01:25:25,259
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:28,475 --> 01:25:32,804
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:32,938 --> 01:25:36,555
He is your master now.

704
01:25:40,612 --> 01:25:43,019
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,939
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:30,068
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:34,569
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:37,826
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:46,176 --> 01:26:47,800
What's he saying?

710
01:26:47,926 --> 01:26:51,261
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,859
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:14,746 --> 01:27:16,703
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:17,914 --> 01:27:20,369
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:23,753 --> 01:27:25,711
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,377
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:33,836
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:35,806 --> 01:27:39,507
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,601
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:01,207 --> 01:28:03,329
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:11,717 --> 01:28:14,671
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:22,685
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:25,302
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,930
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:29,277 --> 01:28:31,067
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:31,194 --> 01:28:33,318
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:40,784
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:48,086 --> 01:28:50,328
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:02,225 --> 01:29:05,261
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:05,395 --> 01:29:07,850
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:09,983 --> 01:29:12,189
I have decided that we shall
stay here.

731
01:29:42,356 --> 01:29:43,351
Hey!

732
01:30:47,203 --> 01:30:49,989
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:50,122 --> 01:30:52,448
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:55,458
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:31:00,925 --> 01:31:02,798
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:10,225 --> 01:31:13,677
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:13,813 --> 01:31:18,889
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:19,025 --> 01:31:21,481
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:21,612 --> 01:31:23,734
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:24,614 --> 01:31:28,363
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:30,494 --> 01:31:34,576
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:40,128
about a great many things.

743
01:31:41,841 --> 01:31:43,465
His lightsabre.

744
01:31:43,591 --> 01:31:47,256
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

745
01:31:48,054 --> 01:31:50,462
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:50,599 --> 01:31:55,390
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,355
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,520
You're wrong.

749
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:03,734
Soon I'll be dead,
and you with me.

750
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:11,493
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:13,738
Yes.

752
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:18,996
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:23,039
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:23,172 --> 01:32:26,292
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:32,426
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:36,476 --> 01:32:41,934
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:42,065 --> 01:32:45,269
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:45,402 --> 01:32:49,731
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:54,149
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:54,286 --> 01:32:57,701
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:57,831 --> 01:33:01,876
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:02,002 --> 01:33:06,248
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:08,759 --> 01:33:12,506
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:12,636 --> 01:33:17,844
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:22,725
All right!

766
01:33:22,855 --> 01:33:24,350
Up! Move!

767
01:33:24,483 --> 01:33:25,940
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:30,445 --> 01:33:32,070
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:34,072
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:38,027
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:40,164 --> 01:33:41,992
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:44,877 --> 01:33:46,585
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,881
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,551
Freeze!

775
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:58,887
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:18,577 --> 01:34:21,945
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:22,081 --> 01:34:25,247
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:28,248
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:34,046
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:37,637 --> 01:34:40,639
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield, up or down.

781
01:34:42,307 --> 01:34:44,978
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

782
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,597
if we're coming.

783
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:51,229
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:53,435
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:55,728
Pull up! All craft pull up!

786
01:35:00,243 --> 01:35:04,193
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:08,792
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:10,412
It's a trap.

789
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:15,962
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:20,756
There's too many.

791
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:27,467
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:28,634
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:33,560
Come, boy.

794
01:35:34,443 --> 01:35:36,399
See for yourself.

795
01:35:39,073 --> 01:35:44,279
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:48,243
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:55,828
You want this...

798
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,505
don't you?

799
01:35:58,632 --> 01:36:03,128
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,088
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:06,224 --> 01:36:07,967
Use it.

802
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,059
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:10,186 --> 01:36:12,060
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:14,725
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:15,774 --> 01:36:20,899
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

806
01:36:27,494 --> 01:36:29,533
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:30,622 --> 01:36:32,746
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,912
You, like your father...

809
01:36:37,046 --> 01:36:38,671
are now...

810
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,213
mine.

811
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:01,685
All right, move it.

812
01:37:09,702 --> 01:37:11,327
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:12,287 --> 01:37:14,447
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:17,832
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:25,467 --> 01:37:29,761
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:29,889 --> 01:37:31,217
Freeze.

817
01:37:31,349 --> 01:37:32,463
Don't move.

818
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,510
We surrender.

819
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:42,056
The code's changed.

820
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,557
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:44,688 --> 01:39:46,680
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,771
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,354
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,695
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:55,823 --> 01:40:00,034
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,822
Come back!

827
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,854
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:29,981 --> 01:40:32,899
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:36,154 --> 01:40:37,898
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:39,738
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,827
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,037
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:08,510
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:14,858
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:14,984 --> 01:41:18,152
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:18,279 --> 01:41:21,564
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:21,698 --> 01:41:23,608
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:25,328 --> 01:41:29,408
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:32,791
your friends have failed.

840
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,958
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:41:36,088 --> 01:41:41,426
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:42,595 --> 01:41:45,132
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:52,145 --> 01:41:53,854
Fire.

844
01:42:00,488 --> 01:42:03,025
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:06,315
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:06,451 --> 01:42:08,278
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:08,412 --> 01:42:10,488
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:12,828
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:12,957 --> 01:42:15,710
We have no choice,
General Calrissian.

850
01:42:15,836 --> 01:42:19,122
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:19,256 --> 01:42:22,956
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:41,778 --> 01:42:43,189
We're coming.

853
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:50,404
Come on.

854
01:42:54,207 --> 01:42:55,582
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:01,631 --> 01:43:02,579
My goodness!

856
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:10,671
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:16,389
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,979
I'll cover you.

859
01:43:59,563 --> 01:44:02,018
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:04,853
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:04,984 --> 01:44:08,399
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:08,529 --> 01:44:11,150
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:11,282 --> 01:44:13,524
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:16,453 --> 01:44:17,783
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:21,876 --> 01:44:23,453
I'm hit!

866
01:44:28,632 --> 01:44:30,791
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:30,926 --> 01:44:34,970
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:37,265 --> 01:44:39,673
There is no escape...

869
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,431
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:44,649 --> 01:44:47,104
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:48,984 --> 01:44:51,820
as will your friends.

872
01:44:55,451 --> 01:44:56,730
Good.

873
01:44:57,744 --> 01:45:00,994
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:06,247
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:06,377 --> 01:45:09,497
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:09,631 --> 01:45:14,127
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:53,423 --> 01:45:55,463
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:50,612
I think I got it.

879
01:47:50,747 --> 01:47:51,992
I got it!

880
01:47:59,297 --> 01:48:00,578
Are you all right?

881
01:48:00,716 --> 01:48:02,588
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:02,716 --> 01:48:03,997
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:04,135 --> 01:48:05,628
Don't move.

884
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:12,805
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:12,935 --> 01:48:14,264
Hands up.

886
01:48:15,396 --> 01:48:16,594
Stand up.

887
01:48:26,448 --> 01:48:27,908
Stay back.

888
01:48:35,832 --> 01:48:38,537
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:38,668 --> 01:48:40,496
No, wait.

890
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:42,207
I got an idea.

891
01:48:53,516 --> 01:48:55,011
Good.

892
01:48:55,144 --> 01:48:58,927
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:48:59,064 --> 01:49:01,768
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:07,447 --> 01:49:11,029
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:14,496 --> 01:49:16,868
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:33,756
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:49:58,706 --> 01:50:01,113
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:04,369
I feel the good in you,
the conflict.

899
01:50:04,502 --> 01:50:06,958
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:09,341 --> 01:50:11,298
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:11,426 --> 01:50:13,384
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

902
01:50:13,511 --> 01:50:18,055
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:18,182 --> 01:50:20,010
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:20,143 --> 01:50:22,716
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:34,198 --> 01:50:35,396
Good.

906
01:50:35,533 --> 01:50:36,944
Good.

907
01:50:45,626 --> 01:50:49,244
- Watch out. Squad at. 06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:51,173 --> 01:50:52,585
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:59,304
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:01,091
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:05,645 --> 01:51:07,104
It's over, Commander.

912
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:09,556
The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.

913
01:51:09,692 --> 01:51:12,229
We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.

914
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:15,277
Send three squads to help.

915
01:51:15,405 --> 01:51:17,363
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:31,546 --> 01:51:32,957
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:50,524 --> 01:51:53,310
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:54,569 --> 01:51:56,479
I will not fight you.

919
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:03,027
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:04,621 --> 01:52:08,666
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

921
01:52:09,708 --> 01:52:11,417
Yes.

922
01:52:11,545 --> 01:52:13,501
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:13,628 --> 01:52:16,167
Your feelings for them
are strong...

924
01:52:16,298 --> 01:52:18,171
especially for...

925
01:52:20,345 --> 01:52:22,005
sister.

926
01:52:23,264 --> 01:52:27,594
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:27,726 --> 01:52:31,426
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:31,564 --> 01:52:35,644
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:35,775 --> 01:52:40,154
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:41,657 --> 01:52:45,440
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:45,577 --> 01:52:48,364
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:48,497 --> 01:52:49,409
Never!

933
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:36,751
Good!

934
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:43,795
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:45,094 --> 01:53:49,970
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:53:50,099 --> 01:53:54,179
and take your father's place
at my side.

937
01:54:09,243 --> 01:54:10,572
Never.

938
01:54:13,622 --> 01:54:15,779
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,587
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:21,713 --> 01:54:23,671
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:23,798 --> 01:54:25,838
like my father before me.

942
01:54:33,432 --> 01:54:36,885
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:54:37,104 --> 01:54:38,976
Move! Move!

944
01:54:51,618 --> 01:54:55,484
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:55,622 --> 01:54:59,369
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,408
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:08,551 --> 01:55:11,171
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:11,302 --> 01:55:14,636
you will be destroyed.

949
01:55:21,814 --> 01:55:23,391
Young fool.

950
01:55:24,484 --> 01:55:27,186
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:29,193
do you understand.

952
01:55:42,417 --> 01:55:48,171
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:55,841
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:01,435 --> 01:56:03,262
Father, please!

955
01:56:18,578 --> 01:56:20,735
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:22,873 --> 01:56:24,701
you will die.

957
01:56:51,069 --> 01:56:52,394
No.

958
01:56:54,728 --> 01:56:57,007
No!

959
01:57:47,756 --> 01:57:49,215
I'm going in.

960
01:57:52,386 --> 01:57:53,585
Here goes nothing.

961
01:58:00,685 --> 01:58:04,552
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

962
01:58:06,774 --> 01:58:10,225
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

963
01:58:25,917 --> 01:58:27,911
Split up and head back
to the surface.

964
01:58:28,046 --> 01:58:31,212
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

965
01:58:31,341 --> 01:58:32,289
Copy, Gold Leader.

966
01:58:42,601 --> 01:58:44,179
That was too close.

967
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:50,349
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

968
01:58:50,484 --> 01:58:53,520
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Star Destroyer.

969
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:01,783
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

970
01:59:01,912 --> 01:59:04,913
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

971
01:59:07,417 --> 01:59:09,161
Intensify forward firepower!

972
01:59:11,003 --> 01:59:12,202
Too late!

973
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:01,167
Help me take this mask off.

974
02:00:01,304 --> 02:00:03,177
But you'll die.

975
02:00:04,056 --> 02:00:07,555
Nothing can stop that now.

976
02:00:08,644 --> 02:00:10,269
Just for once...

977
02:00:11,229 --> 02:00:12,854
let me...

978
02:00:12,981 --> 02:00:16,432
look on you with my own eyes.

979
02:00:52,686 --> 02:00:57,064
Now go, my son.

980
02:00:58,777 --> 02:01:00,188
Leave me.

981
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:03,734
No. You're coming with me.

982
02:01:03,864 --> 02:01:06,190
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

983
02:01:07,076 --> 02:01:10,777
You already have, Luke.

984
02:01:11,956 --> 02:01:13,829
You were right.

985
02:01:14,626 --> 02:01:16,951
You were right about me.

986
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,671
Tell your sister...

987
02:01:21,715 --> 02:01:23,921
you were right.

988
02:01:31,016 --> 02:01:32,095
Father.

989
02:01:36,438 --> 02:01:37,766
I won't leave you.

990
02:02:03,215 --> 02:02:04,211
There it is.

991
02:02:07,176 --> 02:02:09,548
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

992
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:12,965
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

993
02:02:32,202 --> 02:02:35,322
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

994
02:03:22,542 --> 02:03:24,202
They did it!

995
02:03:32,677 --> 02:03:35,085
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

996
02:03:36,847 --> 02:03:38,675
He wasn't.

997
02:03:38,807 --> 02:03:40,467
I can feel it.

998
02:03:45,148 --> 02:03:46,725
You love him.

999
02:03:50,152 --> 02:03:51,563
Don't you?

1000
02:03:51,695 --> 02:03:53,154
Yes.

1001
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,985
All right. I understand.

1002
02:03:56,117 --> 02:03:57,492
Fine.

1003
02:03:58,536 --> 02:04:00,328
When he comes back...

1004
02:04:01,413 --> 02:04:03,158
I won't get in the way.

1005
02:04:05,876 --> 02:04:07,833
It's not like that at all.

1006
02:04:11,548 --> 02:04:13,873
He's my brother.

1007
02:05:55,484 --> 02:05:57,109
Wesa free!
