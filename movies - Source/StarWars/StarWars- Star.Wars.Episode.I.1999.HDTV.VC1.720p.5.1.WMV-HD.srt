1
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,233
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:03,492
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:06,406
With all due respect...

4
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,743
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,750
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:14,962
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

7
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:19,170
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:44,281
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,286
This way, please.

10
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,456
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,463
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,918
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,096
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,228
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,270
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,772
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:19,022
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,991
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,110
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,163
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,199
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,038
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,296
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,260
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,675
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,762
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,718
I knew it.

28
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,096
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:55,526
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,229
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:00,199
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,277
Send a droid.

33
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,622
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:13,039
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,294
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:28,100
What is it?

37
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,898
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:34,557
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:39,485
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:44,911
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,576
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:51,406
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,832
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,252
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:58,874
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,754
Kill them immediately.

47
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:05,182
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,851
Captain, look!

49
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,355
Shields...

50
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,733
Sorry.

51
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,362
Dioxis.

52
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,819
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:30,625
Destroy what's left of them.

54
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,132
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:44,216
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:46,843
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,149
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,233
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,742
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:06,822
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,660
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,749
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:14,415
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,386
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,183
That will hold them.

66
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,365
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,406
This is impossible!

68
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,755
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,084
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:07,891
They have shield generators!

71
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:12,057
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,726
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:20,524
Sir!

74
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:23,326
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:34,795
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,218
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:42,427
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:44,096
Let's split up.

79
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:47,425
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,386
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:54,024
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,600
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:59,812
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,355
At last we are getting results.

85
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:06,744
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:09,956
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

87
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,783
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

88
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,459
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:19,293
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

90
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:22,129
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,502
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,012
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:29,134
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:31,973
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

95
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:36,149
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,768
You assume too much.

97
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,279
We will see.

98
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,904
- She's right. The senate will never-
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,990
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:53,452
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,715
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,004
How could that be true?

103
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:09,469
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:13,350
It must-handiwork-
negotiate-ambassadors...

105
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:16,102
- nobody would-
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:18,107
What's happening?

107
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,110
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:25,066
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:27,490
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:31,405
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,376
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,706
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:40,165
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,966
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,173
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,431
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:53,720
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:33,269
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

119
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,520
and there is no trace of theJedi.

120
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,400
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:40,982
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:45,442
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

123
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,048
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,878
Get down!

125
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:16,768
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,437
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,610
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,364
I spake.

129
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,615
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:28,614
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,783
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,993
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,998
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,039
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,134
You saved my again.

136
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,140
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:53,807
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,308
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:02,317
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:05,652
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,159
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:11,080
Can you take us there?

143
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,416
On second thought, no.

144
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:16,033
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:18,293
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:22,371
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,595
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:28,759
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:31,894
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,769
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,472
If they find us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,153
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,990
Oh.

154
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:47,193
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:49,653
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:58,245
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,254
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:04,510
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:07,971
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:20,808
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:09,034
So good bein home!

162
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:28,003
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,466
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

164
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:32,475
Mesa back.

165
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:35,520
Noah gain, Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

166
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,269
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

167
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:45,650
How wude.

168
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,700
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:01,379
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,384
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:10,096
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,013
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,062
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:20,318
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:22,732
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:25,734
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,783
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,280
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:37,207
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,875
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,498
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:45,422
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,389
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,600
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:56,436
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,438
Now...

187
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,359
go.

188
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,726
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,903
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,990
A transport, I hope.

191
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:09,193
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:12,947
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,245
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:20,461
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:24,212
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:26,301
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:31,467
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

198
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:36,513
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:38,816
I saved his life.

200
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:41,433
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt."

201
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:45,403
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,857
Binks...

203
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:51,942
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

204
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:00,538
Begone wit him!

205
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:05,589
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:08,839
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:12,093
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:33,115
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:36,499
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:41,667
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,592
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:03,737
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,903
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,819
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,161
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:33,017
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,608
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:50,743
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

219
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:55,282
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

220
00:18:55,416 --> 00:19:00,125
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:03,210
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

222
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,792
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

223
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,801
Yes, my lord.

224
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:13,135
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,765
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:25,978
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:28,903
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,819
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,577
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,788
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,595
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,673
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:54,765
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:58,351
Power's back.

235
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:00,558
Monster's back!

236
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,152
Relax.

237
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,743
You overdid it.

238
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:30,553
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:32,592
Oh, boy.

240
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,005
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,808
Ah, victory.

242
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,480
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,990
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,288
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:44,587
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:48,167
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:52,432
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,676
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,435
Process them.

250
00:21:57,564 --> 00:21:59,355
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,106
Roger, roger.

252
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,204
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,959
Get their weapons.

254
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,038
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,048
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,051
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,007
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,512
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,720
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,186
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,239
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,900
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,073
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,911
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,082
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,753
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,002
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,089
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,174
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:50,675
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,260
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:57,340
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,353
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,731
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,315
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:08,154
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,159
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,292
I'll deal with that.

279
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,789
Halt.

280
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:28,586
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,297
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,633
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:36,387
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,429
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:45,101
Come on. Move!

286
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:51,441
Go!

287
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,305
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:26,269
Hello, boyos.

289
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,243
There's the blockade.

290
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,298
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:56,385
How wude!

292
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,981
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:11,444
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:14,865
The shields are gone.

295
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:24,333
The power's back!

296
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:30,586
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,295
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,601
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,607
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,898
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,694
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,572
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,578
How can you be sure?

304
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,616
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,538
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:04,959
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,962
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,169
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:11,378
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:18,853
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

311
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,597
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:26,896
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,943
I want that treaty signed.

314
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:32,114
My lord...

315
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:34,781
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:37,118
It's out of our range.

317
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:39,490
Not for a Sith.

318
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,958
This is my apprentice...

319
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:43,996
Darth Maul.

320
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:48,625
He will find your lost ship.

321
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:55,260
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:57,431
Now there are two of them.

323
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,561
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:09,395
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:12,402
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:15,867
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,663
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,203
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,416
Padmé.

330
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,092
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:33,177
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:36,517
Continue, Captain.

333
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,306
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,191
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:47,651
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,353
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,407
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,538
Hello.

339
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:01,619
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:04,205
I'm Padmé.

341
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:07,332
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

342
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:09,455
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:15,345
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:19,140

00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:38,747
- That's it-Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:42,953
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,017
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,605
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,855
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:11,028
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:19,528
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,161
Wait!

356
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:23,663
Wait.

357
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,961
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,842
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:36,048
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,307
The queen wishes it.

361
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,345
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,977
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,626
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:07,621
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:09,631
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,048
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,087
Like us.

368
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:18,220
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:21,311
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,733
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,334
Good day to you.

372
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,381
What do you want?

373
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:50,592
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:54,762
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:57,388
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:59,391
My droid has a readout of what I need.

377
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,682
What took you so long?

378
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,900
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,778
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:12,154
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:14,155
We'll find what you need.

382
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:18,371
Don't touch anything.

383
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:31,586
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,420
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:38,426
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,133
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

387
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:45,604
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:49,566
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:53,990
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:58,067
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:00,493
How long have you been here?

392
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:04,622
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:07,458
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:10,294
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:12,218
You're a slave?

396
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:16,472
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,347
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:34,325
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:36,193
Hit the nose.

400
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:44,409
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:33:44,545 --> 00:33:47,165
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:50,797
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,845
Saying of which...

404
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:56,344
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:33:56,473 --> 00:33:58,512
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:00,469
Republic credits?

407
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:03,520
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:06,767
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

409
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:10,519
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

410
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:12,481
No, they won't!

411
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:16,778
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:21,159
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:25,369
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:30,047
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:41,179
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,813
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

417
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:51,983
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,940
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,876
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,914
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,958
Clean the racks.

422
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:12,420
Then you can go home.

423
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:14,344
Yippee!

424
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:22,766
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

425
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:24,769
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:27,934
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

427
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,393
not in the amount
you're talking about.

428
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,447
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:34,949
I'll check back later.

430
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,403
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:40,371
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:42,952
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,250
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

434
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,929
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,813
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,443
Oops.

437
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:19,827
Is this yours?

438
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:21,699
Who, mesa...

439
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:28,001
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,123
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:33,791
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:37,795
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

443
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:40,969
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:44,521
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

445
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:48,768
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,693
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,693
He picked a fight with a Dug...

448
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:55,313
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:59,032
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:03,159
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,168
Thanks, my young friend.

452
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:09,335
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,422
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:22,054
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:25,887
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

456
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:27,815
We'll be right there.

457
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,398
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:39,108
- Here.
- Thank you.

459
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,577
My bones are aching.

460
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:47,251
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,215
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,914
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,423
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:37:55,554 --> 00:37:59,422
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:02,014
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:17,940
Mom!

467
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:21,777
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:24,286
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:27,952
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,460
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,547
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

472
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,603
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

473
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:47,012
He's wonderful.

474
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,983
You really like him?

475
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,027
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:38:57,452 --> 00:38:58,731
Where is everybody?

477
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,032
Whoops.

478
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,411
Oh, hello.

479
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:07,827
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:09,835
How might I serve you?

481
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,751
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:16,418
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:20,344
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:23,679
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:27,847
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:31,019
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:36,858
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:41,786
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,875
The death toll is catastrophic.

490
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:51,378
We must bow to their wishes.

491
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:53,547
You must contact me.

492
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:56,346
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:58,463
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,637
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:07,719
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

496
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:10,313
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,081
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,998
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

499
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,003
Move against the Jedi first.

500
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,835
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,842
to sign the treaty.

502
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:38,128
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

503
00:40:38,264 --> 00:40:40,672
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:43,679
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

505
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,184
They will be no match for you.

506
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,067
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:59,159
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:02,786
- Any attempt to escape-
- And they blow you up!

509
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,284
How wude!

510
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,824
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,835
The Republic's antislavery laws...

512
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,289
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:14,583
We must survive on our own.

514
00:41:15,594 --> 00:41:17,088
Xcuse me.

515
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,719
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:23,643
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:26,474
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:29,146
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:32,277
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

520
00:41:33,405 --> 00:41:34,780
Don't do that again.

521
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:42,818
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:48,663
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

523
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:51,666
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

524
00:41:51,798 --> 00:41:54,918
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

525
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:56,677
I don't think so.

526
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:58,961
No one can kill a Jedi.

527
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:01,846
I wish that were so.

528
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:04,014
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

529
00:42:04,144 --> 00:42:07,311
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,773
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:15,231
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,871
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,998
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,117
on a very important mission.

535
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:31,289
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:35,041
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,507
I can help.
I can fix anything.

538
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:41,134
I believe you can.

539
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:44,054
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,891
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:50,556
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,987
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,360
Podracing.

544
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,407
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,405
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,827
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,914
You could enter my pod.

548
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,914
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,920
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,255
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

551
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,963
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:19,586
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,846
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:25,510
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,934
Anakin.

556
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,815
Your mother's right.

557
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,027
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,190
No.

559
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:46,914
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,626
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,668
We'll find some other way.

562
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,594
There is no other way.

563
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:06,054
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:08,811
He was meant to help you.

565
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,244
Are you sure about this?

566
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,994
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:29,164
The queen will not approve.

568
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,168
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:33,922
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,672
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,427
How can you do this?

572
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:42,840
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:44:42,976 --> 00:44:45,134
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:47,353
Not bad!

575
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:50,434
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:53,851
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:56,478
What would the boy ride?

578
00:44:56,614 --> 00:45:00,148
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

579
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:02,610
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,371
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:07,867
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:11,458
That you did.

583
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:14,376
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:17,000
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:18,797
The fastest ever built.

586
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:24,054
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:29,554
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,065
and I supply the boy.

589
00:45:31,193 --> 00:45:35,059
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:37,070
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,820
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:41,990
If we win...

593
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:45,905
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

594
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:49,244
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

595
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:53,123
Either way, you win.

596
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,257
Deal!

597
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:09,724
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:20,615
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,447
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,117
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

601
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,619
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,710
And...

603
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,711
there's something about this boy.

604
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:42,880
You should be very proud of your son.

605
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:45,967
He gives without any thought
of reward.

606
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,974
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,186
He has...

608
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:53,065
He has special powers.

609
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:56,061
Yes.

610
00:46:56,197 --> 00:46:58,818
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,737
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:03,742
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:06,659
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:10,161
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:16,336
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,210
Who was his father?

617
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:22,840
There was no father.

618
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,643
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:31,012
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:34,483
Can you help him?

621
00:47:34,612 --> 00:47:36,485
I don't know.

622
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:42,610
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:57,632
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:03,302
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:06,387
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:08,228
With this?

627
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:11,106
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:14,436
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,728
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:20,148
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,081
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,663
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:36,173
Okay.

634
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:42,425
My tongue is fat.

635
00:48:42,556 --> 00:48:45,641
My tongue-Wrench.

636
00:48:45,768 --> 00:48:48,438
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,443
I'm stuck.

638
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,567
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:03,244
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:05,447
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:07,786
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,956
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:12,291
My mouth.

644
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:13,750
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:21,128
My tongue is fat.

646
00:49:21,264 --> 00:49:24,217
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:28,474
Thank you.

648
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,014
Go.

649
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:48,155
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:49:58,802 --> 00:50:01,293
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:05,344
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:07,349
Most of them.

653
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:09,434
Has anyone been to 'em all?

654
00:50:11,148 --> 00:50:12,347
Not likely.

655
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,690
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

656
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:19,277
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:22,159
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:25,155
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:28,704
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:30,376
Go on.

661
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:32,458
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:34,460
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,210
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

664
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,048
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:43,889
Wait a minute.

666
00:50:45,601 --> 00:50:47,557
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:50:50,523 --> 00:50:53,143
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:55,148
Over 20,000.

669
00:50:55,277 --> 00:50:58,896
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

670
00:50:59,032 --> 00:51:00,822
No Jedi has.

671
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:02,989
What does that mean?

672
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:05,494
I'm not sure.

673
00:52:15,443 --> 00:52:18,313
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:20,190
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:52:20,324 --> 00:52:22,565
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:24,492
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:28,664
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:32,159
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:35,414
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:52:35,547 --> 00:52:38,003
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:40,257
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:52:40,387 --> 00:52:43,590
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:47,467
Oh, no!

684
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,474
Why do you think that?

685
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:55,481
He always wins!

686
00:52:57,487 --> 00:52:59,943
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:04,487
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:53:05,246 --> 00:53:08,579
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,581
the boy and his mother.

690
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,409
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:17,081
The boy, then.

692
00:53:23,306 --> 00:53:25,797
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:29,349
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:32,514
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:33,762
Red...

696
00:53:35,193 --> 00:53:36,817
his mother.

697
00:53:46,538 --> 00:53:48,945
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,206
but you won't win the race!

699
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:53,411
So it makes little difference!

700
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:08,132
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:14,389
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:15,900
Good morning.

703
00:54:18,028 --> 00:54:20,780
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:26,864
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:30,365
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:31,579
Do what?

707
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,746
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,623
You've never won a race?

709
00:54:36,757 --> 00:54:39,460
Well, not exactly.

710
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:41,585
Not even finished?

711
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:44,175
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:46,344
Of course you will.

713
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:17,831
That's absolutely right.

714
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:23,007
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:55:23,137 --> 00:55:26,755
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:55:28,853 --> 00:55:31,688
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

717
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,815
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

718
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,157
Sebulba!

719
00:55:54,586 --> 00:55:57,670
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:55:57,798 --> 00:55:59,791
Mawhonic!

721
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,050
A hearty hello...

722
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:06,880
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

723
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:12,896
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

724
00:56:13,023 --> 00:56:17,601
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

725
00:56:20,947 --> 00:56:23,235
And hoping for a big win today...

726
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:27,778
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

727
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:35,918
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

728
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:37,327
a local boy.

729
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,291
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:04,074
Be safe.

731
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:06,525
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,389
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:27,755
you slave scum.

734
00:57:27,891 --> 00:57:31,141
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:33,643
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:40,442
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:42,195
Right.

738
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:48,949
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:52,829
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,583
I will.

741
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:56,918
May the Force be with you.

742
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:07,882
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:22,523
Welcome.

744
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,740
Begin the race!

745
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:40,463
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

746
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:43,550
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

747
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:48,050
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

748
00:58:48,184 --> 00:58:51,054
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

749
00:58:51,186 --> 00:58:53,393
You should too.

750
00:58:53,523 --> 00:58:55,599
You assume too much.

751
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:58,766
Start your engines.

752
00:59:38,068 --> 00:59:41,402
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
01:00:01,425 --> 01:00:02,706
Oh, no!

754
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:11,635
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
01:00:22,114 --> 01:00:26,324
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

756
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:29,192
Come on, Ani!

757
01:00:35,628 --> 01:00:37,204
And there goes Skywalker!

758
01:00:37,338 --> 01:00:38,795
Go, Ani, go!

759
01:00:38,922 --> 01:00:41,045
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

760
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:58,085
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

761
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:00,501
on the canyon dune turn.

762
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,427
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,382
Oh, no!

764
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,056
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,519
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,728
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

767
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,025
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,121
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:25,612
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:27,500
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:05:34,561 --> 01:05:36,269
Here he comes!

772
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:39,516
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

773
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,141
followed closely by Skywalker!

774
01:05:42,278 --> 01:05:43,143
Go, Ani!

775
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:12,507
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:35,581
It's Skywalker!

777
01:06:36,543 --> 01:06:37,871
Sebulba!

778
01:06:38,003 --> 01:06:42,250
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

779
01:06:42,382 --> 01:06:44,125
Did he crash-ed?

780
01:07:25,092 --> 01:07:28,295
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

781
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:22,978
He's catching Sebulba!

782
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:26,604
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

783
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:59,351
That little human being
is out of his mind!

784
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:01,645
They're side by side!

785
01:09:30,305 --> 01:09:32,179
- Yippee!
- Yay!

786
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:38,104
I can't believe it.

787
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,140
The crowds are going nuts!

788
01:09:49,076 --> 01:09:51,114
Yay, Ani!

789
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:55,489
Mom, I did it! Yay!

790
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,882
Good going, Ani!

791
01:10:12,265 --> 01:10:14,222
We owe you everything, Ani.

792
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:18,976
It's so wonderful, Ani.

793
01:10:19,106 --> 01:10:21,810
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

794
01:10:21,943 --> 01:10:24,149
I'm so very proud of you.

795
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:36,496
You!

796
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,912
You swindled me.

797
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:42,828
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

798
01:10:42,965 --> 01:10:44,837
I lost everything.

799
01:10:44,966 --> 01:10:48,501
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

800
01:10:48,636 --> 01:10:51,091
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

801
01:10:51,222 --> 01:10:54,306
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

802
01:10:54,435 --> 01:10:57,720
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

803
01:11:00,483 --> 01:11:03,934
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

804
01:11:04,069 --> 01:11:06,560
I'm sure they can settle this.

805
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,947
Take him.

806
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:17,947
Hidoe!

807
01:11:19,586 --> 01:11:21,662
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

808
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:22,827
I'm going back.

809
01:11:22,963 --> 01:11:25,039
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

810
01:11:25,175 --> 01:11:28,626
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

811
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:32,547
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

812
01:11:32,682 --> 01:11:34,555
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

813
01:11:34,685 --> 01:11:37,222
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

814
01:11:37,354 --> 01:11:39,511
Come on. Hup!

815
01:11:44,153 --> 01:11:46,025
Hey. These are yours.

816
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:49,277
Yes!

817
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:53,577
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

818
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:56,076
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

819
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:59,161
- And he has been freed.
- What?

820
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:01,085
You're no longer a slave.

821
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:04,914
Did you hear that?

822
01:12:05,716 --> 01:12:08,171
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

823
01:12:09,054 --> 01:12:10,962
You are free.

824
01:12:14,559 --> 01:12:16,016
Will you take him with you?

825
01:12:16,144 --> 01:12:17,768
Is he to become a Jedi?

826
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:20,434
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

827
01:12:21,274 --> 01:12:22,935
Nothing happens by accident.

828
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:26,601
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

829
01:12:26,738 --> 01:12:28,149
Anakin...

830
01:12:30,074 --> 01:12:33,359
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

831
01:12:33,496 --> 01:12:36,365
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

832
01:12:36,498 --> 01:12:39,664
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

833
01:12:40,502 --> 01:12:42,626
Can I go, Mom?

834
01:12:43,588 --> 01:12:45,248
Anakin...

835
01:12:45,382 --> 01:12:48,300
this path has been placed
before you.

836
01:12:48,427 --> 01:12:50,882
The choice is yours alone.

837
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:56,431
I wanna do it.

838
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,228
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

839
01:13:07,863 --> 01:13:09,440
What about Mom?

840
01:13:12,578 --> 01:13:14,451
Is she free too?

841
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:18,078
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

842
01:13:19,126 --> 01:13:21,082
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

843
01:13:29,095 --> 01:13:32,427
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

844
01:13:32,556 --> 01:13:34,929
It is time for you to let go.

845
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,182
I don't want things to change.

846
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,685
But you can't stop the change...

847
01:13:40,814 --> 01:13:43,899
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

848
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,895
I love you.

849
01:13:52,577 --> 01:13:54,449
Now hurry.

850
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:01,377
Thank you.

851
01:14:01,502 --> 01:14:04,420
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

852
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,168
Will you be all right?

853
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:11,095
Yeah.

854
01:14:16,143 --> 01:14:17,720
Hello, Master Anakin.

855
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:19,930
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

856
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:22,435
and I'm going away in a starship.

857
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:25,484
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

858
01:14:25,612 --> 01:14:29,823
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

859
01:14:29,948 --> 01:14:33,068
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

860
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:35,242
give you coverings and all.

861
01:14:35,372 --> 01:14:36,996
I'm gonna miss working on you.

862
01:14:37,122 --> 01:14:39,578
You've been a great pal.

863
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,329
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

864
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,161
Sell me?

865
01:14:44,297 --> 01:14:45,921
Bye.

866
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,423
Oh, my.

867
01:15:12,076 --> 01:15:14,282
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

868
01:15:18,582 --> 01:15:20,574
Will I ever see you again?

869
01:15:22,045 --> 01:15:24,914
What does your heart tell you?

870
01:15:26,257 --> 01:15:28,167
I hope so.

871
01:15:28,926 --> 01:15:30,800
Yes.

872
01:15:30,929 --> 01:15:32,506
I guess.

873
01:15:33,556 --> 01:15:36,130
Then we will
see each other again.

874
01:15:38,854 --> 01:15:41,640
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

875
01:15:41,774 --> 01:15:43,481
I promise.

876
01:15:51,742 --> 01:15:54,695
Now, be brave...

877
01:15:55,496 --> 01:15:57,488
and don't look back.

878
01:15:58,291 --> 01:16:00,163
Don't look back.

879
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:45,833
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

880
01:16:45,965 --> 01:16:47,707
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

881
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:51,126
Go!

882
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,088
Tell them to take off!

883
01:17:06,694 --> 01:17:08,153
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

884
01:17:09,448 --> 01:17:10,823
Take off.

885
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:13,275
Over there. Fly low.

886
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:37,891
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

887
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:39,560
What was it?

888
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:41,430
I'm not sure...

889
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:44,101
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

890
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,730
My guess is
it was after the queen.

891
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:49,351
What are we gonna do about it?

892
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:52,948
We shall be patient.

893
01:17:53,076 --> 01:17:54,189
Anakin Skywalker...

894
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:56,118
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

895
01:17:58,539 --> 01:18:01,078
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

896
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:12,590
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

897
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,712
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

898
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:16,971
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

899
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,591
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

900
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:22,729
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

901
01:18:22,856 --> 01:18:24,729
Take him away.

902
01:18:28,195 --> 01:18:30,650
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

903
01:18:30,782 --> 01:18:33,319
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

904
01:18:33,451 --> 01:18:36,072
They will not
stay hidden for long.

905
01:18:47,131 --> 01:18:49,836
The death toll is catastrophic.

906
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:52,588
We must bow to their wishes.

907
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,926
You must contact me.

908
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:10,979
You all right?

909
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:13,942
It's very cold.

910
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:24,668
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

911
01:19:24,796 --> 01:19:27,167
A little too warm for my taste.

912
01:19:27,298 --> 01:19:29,539
Space is cold.

913
01:19:29,676 --> 01:19:31,798
You seem sad.

914
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:35,212
The queen is worried.

915
01:19:35,349 --> 01:19:37,756
Her people are suffering, dying.

916
01:19:37,893 --> 01:19:41,391
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

917
01:19:42,855 --> 01:19:45,144
I'm not sure what'll happen.

918
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:48,649
I made this for you...

919
01:19:50,155 --> 01:19:52,029
so you'd remember me.

920
01:19:52,742 --> 01:19:55,411
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

921
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:58,371
It'll bring you good fortune.

922
01:19:58,497 --> 01:20:00,371
It's beautiful.

923
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,872
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

924
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:09,917
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

925
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:12,588
but my caring for you will remain.

926
01:20:15,306 --> 01:20:18,426
I care for you, too, only I...

927
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,717
Miss your mother.

928
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:43,368
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

929
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:45,244
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

930
01:20:45,378 --> 01:20:48,628
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

931
01:21:18,122 --> 01:21:21,158
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

932
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:24,244
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

933
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:26,832
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

934
01:21:26,963 --> 01:21:29,585
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

935
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:31,673
Welcome, Your Highness.

936
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:33,841
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

937
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,429
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

938
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:39,055
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

939
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:42,600
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

940
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:46,856
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

941
01:21:46,984 --> 01:21:48,858
There is a question
of procedure...

942
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,478
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

943
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:54,481
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

944
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,404
The situation has become
much more complicated.

945
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:05,077
Ani, come on.

946
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:19,011
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

947
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,310
Pitty hot.

948
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:53,336
There is no civility,
only politics.

949
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:58,505
The Republic
is not what it once was.

950
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:03,884
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

951
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:08,105
There is no interest
in the common good.

952
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:10,609
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

953
01:23:10,738 --> 01:23:13,442
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

954
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:16,278
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

955
01:23:16,411 --> 01:23:18,283
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

956
01:23:18,412 --> 01:23:20,618
the chancellor
has little real power.

957
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:24,614
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

958
01:23:24,752 --> 01:23:28,501
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

959
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:32,127
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

960
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,466
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

961
01:23:34,595 --> 01:23:36,753
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

962
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:38,716
and give us justice.

963
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,104
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

964
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:47,722
He has been
our strongest supporter.

965
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:53,067
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

966
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:56,532
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

967
01:23:57,453 --> 01:23:59,529
Our people are dying, Senator.

968
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:03,332
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

969
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,949
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

970
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:08,578
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

971
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:11,206
for the time being.

972
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:15,045
That is something I cannot do.

973
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:24,967
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

974
01:24:25,106 --> 01:24:29,020
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

975
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:30,527
Impossible.

976
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:33,323
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

977
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:37,612
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

978
01:24:38,621 --> 01:24:40,827
Hard to see, the dark side is.

979
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:43,826
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

980
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:47,162
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

981
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:48,956
May the Force be with you.

982
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,467
Master Qui-Gon.

983
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:57,136
More to say have you?

984
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:01,140
With your permission, my master...

985
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:05,688
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

986
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:08,807
A vergence, you say.

987
01:25:08,944 --> 01:25:11,067
Located around a person?

988
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,440
A boy.

989
01:25:12,572 --> 01:25:15,063
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

990
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,990
I have seen in a life-form.

991
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,988
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

992
01:25:21,707 --> 01:25:25,573
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

993
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:28,501
You believe it's this boy?

994
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:31,203
- I don't presume to-
- But you do.

995
01:25:31,966 --> 01:25:33,923
Revealed your opinion is.

996
01:25:34,052 --> 01:25:36,091
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

997
01:25:38,224 --> 01:25:41,426
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

998
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,932
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

999
01:25:44,063 --> 01:25:46,304
I have no doubt of that.

1000
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:55,028
Bring him before us, then.

1001
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:08,001
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1002
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,707
Let him in.

1003
01:26:12,926 --> 01:26:16,792
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

1004
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,591
Who is it?

1005
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:22,391
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1006
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,310
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1007
01:26:24,438 --> 01:26:26,310
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1008
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:28,680
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:33,359
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1010
01:26:34,448 --> 01:26:38,067
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:40,234
Thank you, Your Highness.

1012
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:58,341
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:27:05,146 --> 01:27:08,515
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1014
01:27:09,652 --> 01:27:12,024
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:27:12,154 --> 01:27:15,653
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:27:15,783 --> 01:27:18,783
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1017
01:27:18,911 --> 01:27:20,903
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1018
01:27:21,788 --> 01:27:23,198
This is outrageous!

1019
01:27:23,332 --> 01:27:25,871
I object
to the senator's statements.

1020
01:27:26,002 --> 01:27:30,046
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1021
01:27:30,172 --> 01:27:34,039
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1022
01:27:34,176 --> 01:27:36,168
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1023
01:27:36,304 --> 01:27:38,176
who speaks on our behalf.

1024
01:27:44,186 --> 01:27:46,938
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1025
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:50,145
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1026
01:27:50,277 --> 01:27:53,146
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1027
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:56,814
I object!
There is no proof!

1028
01:27:56,951 --> 01:27:58,823
This is incredible.

1029
01:27:58,953 --> 01:28:02,902
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1030
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:04,319
The Congress of Malastare...

1031
01:28:04,457 --> 01:28:07,458
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1032
01:28:07,587 --> 01:28:09,626
A commission must be appointed.

1033
01:28:09,756 --> 01:28:12,247
- The point-
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1034
01:28:12,382 --> 01:28:14,006
Enter the bureaucrat.

1035
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:16,756
The true rulers of the Republic.

1036
01:28:16,887 --> 01:28:21,051
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1037
01:28:21,184 --> 01:28:25,395
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1038
01:28:26,981 --> 01:28:29,270
The point is conceded.

1039
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,021
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1040
01:28:32,154 --> 01:28:34,940
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1041
01:28:35,073 --> 01:28:36,945
I will not defer.

1042
01:28:37,076 --> 01:28:40,574
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1043
01:28:40,703 --> 01:28:43,704
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1044
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:46,502
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1045
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:51,787
If this body
is not capable of action...

1046
01:28:51,923 --> 01:28:53,962
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1047
01:28:57,387 --> 01:28:59,594
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1048
01:28:59,724 --> 01:29:01,716
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1049
01:29:08,774 --> 01:29:10,932
Vote now! Vote now!

1050
01:29:14,738 --> 01:29:16,648
Order!

1051
01:29:16,783 --> 01:29:19,653
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1052
01:29:19,786 --> 01:29:21,658
a strong chancellor...

1053
01:29:21,787 --> 01:29:24,704
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1054
01:29:26,417 --> 01:29:30,664
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1055
01:29:30,797 --> 01:29:33,917
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1056
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:36,755
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1057
01:29:36,886 --> 01:29:39,591
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1058
01:29:41,516 --> 01:29:45,265
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1059
01:29:45,395 --> 01:29:47,435
They will not go along
with you this time.

1060
01:29:48,942 --> 01:29:51,515
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1061
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:56,198
A ship.

1062
01:29:57,826 --> 01:29:59,783
A cup.

1063
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:01,702
A ship.

1064
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,288
A speeder.

1065
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,748
How feel you?

1066
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:16,002
Cold, sir.

1067
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,837
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1068
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:23,636
See through you we can.

1069
01:30:23,769 --> 01:30:25,641
Be mindful of your feelings.

1070
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:28,521
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1071
01:30:30,193 --> 01:30:31,603
I miss her.

1072
01:30:32,862 --> 01:30:35,317
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1073
01:30:35,448 --> 01:30:37,570
What has that got to do
with anything?

1074
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:40,024
Everything.

1075
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:43,197
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1076
01:30:43,331 --> 01:30:46,201
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1077
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:49,667
Hate leads to suffering.

1078
01:30:56,219 --> 01:30:59,136
I sense much fear in you.

1079
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:15,438
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1080
01:31:15,573 --> 01:31:16,900
I don't know.

1081
01:31:18,242 --> 01:31:20,114
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1082
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:24,618
I hope not.

1083
01:31:25,416 --> 01:31:27,622
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1084
01:31:27,752 --> 01:31:29,625
Wesa warriors.

1085
01:31:29,753 --> 01:31:33,003
Wesa got a grand army.

1086
01:31:33,132 --> 01:31:36,336
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1087
01:31:36,469 --> 01:31:37,796
Your Highness?

1088
01:31:40,474 --> 01:31:42,596
Your Highness...

1089
01:31:42,725 --> 01:31:45,810
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1090
01:31:45,938 --> 01:31:47,313
as supreme chancellor.

1091
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:51,305
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1092
01:31:51,443 --> 01:31:55,819
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1093
01:31:55,948 --> 01:31:57,608
Who else has been nominated?

1094
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:02,034
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1095
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:07,073
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1096
01:32:08,795 --> 01:32:10,787
I will be chancellor.

1097
01:32:10,921 --> 01:32:13,494
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1098
01:32:13,632 --> 01:32:16,836
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1099
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:18,842
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1100
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:22,506
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1101
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:28,095
Senator, this is your arena.

1102
01:32:28,481 --> 01:32:30,390
I feel I must return to mine.

1103
01:32:33,654 --> 01:32:35,942
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1104
01:32:36,073 --> 01:32:36,938
Go back?

1105
01:32:37,073 --> 01:32:40,028
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1106
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,532
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1107
01:32:42,662 --> 01:32:45,449
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1108
01:32:45,582 --> 01:32:47,159
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1109
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:49,581
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1110
01:32:49,712 --> 01:32:51,585
Stay here where it's safe.

1111
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:56,256
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1112
01:32:57,011 --> 01:33:01,139
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1113
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:13,431
The Force is strong with him.

1114
01:33:13,569 --> 01:33:15,479
He is to be trained, then?

1115
01:33:17,615 --> 01:33:19,988
No, he will not be trained.

1116
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:21,778
No?

1117
01:33:23,829 --> 01:33:25,868
He is too old.

1118
01:33:25,998 --> 01:33:29,783
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1119
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:34,497
Clouded this boy's future is.

1120
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,545
I will train him, then.

1121
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:45,726
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1122
01:33:45,853 --> 01:33:48,770
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1123
01:33:48,898 --> 01:33:51,270
Impossible to take on a second.

1124
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,060
The code forbids it.

1125
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:56,563
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1126
01:33:56,698 --> 01:34:00,315
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1127
01:34:01,328 --> 01:34:03,948
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1128
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:05,787
but he is capable.

1129
01:34:05,916 --> 01:34:07,908
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1130
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:14,287
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1131
01:34:14,423 --> 01:34:16,997
Now is not the time for this.

1132
01:34:17,802 --> 01:34:19,760
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1133
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:22,556
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1134
01:34:22,682 --> 01:34:25,886
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1135
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,307
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1136
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:32,815
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1137
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:35,653
This is the clue we need...

1138
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:38,353
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1139
01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:41,280
May the Force be with you.

1140
01:34:54,466 --> 01:34:57,336
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1141
01:34:57,469 --> 01:34:59,341
From your point of view.

1142
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:02,840
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1143
01:35:02,975 --> 01:35:05,845
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1144
01:35:05,978 --> 01:35:08,350
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1145
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:11,396
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1146
01:35:17,073 --> 01:35:20,820
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1147
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:23,158
You won't be, Ani.

1148
01:35:23,287 --> 01:35:25,195
I'm not allowed to train you...

1149
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:27,369
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1150
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,576
Always remember:

1151
01:35:30,502 --> 01:35:33,123
Your focus determines your reality.

1152
01:35:33,256 --> 01:35:36,837
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1153
01:35:36,967 --> 01:35:38,342
Master, sir...

1154
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:42,051
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1155
01:35:42,181 --> 01:35:45,680
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?

1156
01:35:46,978 --> 01:35:49,350
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1157
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,721
that resides
within all living cells.

1158
01:35:53,193 --> 01:35:56,063
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1159
01:35:56,195 --> 01:35:59,646
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1160
01:35:59,783 --> 01:36:03,649
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1161
01:36:03,787 --> 01:36:06,658
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1162
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,578
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1163
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:11,582
They continually speak to us...

1164
01:36:11,712 --> 01:36:14,381
telling us the will of the Force.

1165
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:16,582
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1166
01:36:16,717 --> 01:36:18,591
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1167
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,592
I don't understand.

1168
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:24,220
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1169
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:32,019
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1170
01:36:32,734 --> 01:36:34,144
I welcome your help.

1171
01:36:34,277 --> 01:36:37,976
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1172
01:36:38,114 --> 01:36:41,115
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1173
01:36:41,243 --> 01:36:44,113
Wesa goin' home!

1174
01:36:44,246 --> 01:36:46,118
Come on, R2.

1175
01:36:56,384 --> 01:36:58,756
Is the planet secure?

1176
01:36:58,886 --> 01:37:02,752
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1177
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:05,974
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1178
01:37:06,101 --> 01:37:09,268
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1179
01:37:09,396 --> 01:37:12,314
things stay as they are.

1180
01:37:12,442 --> 01:37:15,940
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1181
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:17,944
Yes, my lord.

1182
01:37:18,073 --> 01:37:19,945
A Sith here?

1183
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:27,827
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1184
01:37:27,957 --> 01:37:30,329
And those two control the pitch?

1185
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,792
You catch on pretty quick.

1186
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:35,664
As soon as we land...

1187
01:37:35,798 --> 01:37:38,420
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1188
01:37:38,551 --> 01:37:39,582
I agree.

1189
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,470
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1190
01:37:42,597 --> 01:37:45,052
I will take back what's ours.

1191
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:48,009
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1192
01:37:48,145 --> 01:37:50,018
We have no army.

1193
01:37:50,148 --> 01:37:51,523
And I can only protect you.

1194
01:37:51,649 --> 01:37:53,688
I can't fight a war for you.

1195
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:55,766
Jar Jar Binks.

1196
01:37:56,695 --> 01:37:58,854
Mesa, Your Highness?

1197
01:37:58,989 --> 01:38:01,907
Yes. I need your help.

1198
01:38:07,164 --> 01:38:09,371
I have one battleship on my scope.

1199
01:38:09,501 --> 01:38:11,539
It's a droid control ship.

1200
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,876
They've probably spotted us.

1201
01:38:14,006 --> 01:38:15,713
We haven't much time.

1202
01:38:27,435 --> 01:38:30,104
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1203
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:31,511
Good.

1204
01:38:31,649 --> 01:38:33,890
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1205
01:38:34,025 --> 01:38:35,649
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1206
01:38:37,738 --> 01:38:40,063
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1207
01:38:41,868 --> 01:38:44,952
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1208
01:38:45,078 --> 01:38:48,779
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1209
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:53,994
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1210
01:38:55,172 --> 01:38:57,046
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1211
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,179
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1212
01:39:01,887 --> 01:39:05,220
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1213
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:20,610
Desa nobody dare!

1214
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,899
The Gungan city is deserted!

1215
01:39:23,034 --> 01:39:25,573
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1216
01:39:25,704 --> 01:39:28,788
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1217
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:31,240
More likely they were wiped out.

1218
01:39:31,377 --> 01:39:34,412
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1219
01:39:34,546 --> 01:39:37,962
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1220
01:39:38,092 --> 01:39:40,962
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1221
01:39:59,323 --> 01:40:02,904
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1222
01:40:09,582 --> 01:40:12,916
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1223
01:40:13,712 --> 01:40:16,119
Jar Jar Binks.

1224
01:40:16,631 --> 01:40:19,881
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1225
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:22,757
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1226
01:40:23,597 --> 01:40:26,005
I come before you in peace.

1227
01:40:26,141 --> 01:40:28,976
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1228
01:40:29,104 --> 01:40:32,270
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1229
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:36,099
Yousa all bombad.

1230
01:40:36,987 --> 01:40:39,822
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1231
01:40:39,948 --> 01:40:41,323
Your Honour.

1232
01:40:43,493 --> 01:40:46,447
Whosa dis?

1233
01:40:46,579 --> 01:40:48,786
I am Queen Amidala.

1234
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:52,036
This is my decoy...

1235
01:40:52,168 --> 01:40:55,787
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1236
01:40:55,922 --> 01:41:00,216
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1237
01:41:00,344 --> 01:41:02,881
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1238
01:41:03,014 --> 01:41:05,551
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1239
01:41:07,351 --> 01:41:10,518
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1240
01:41:10,646 --> 01:41:13,896
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1241
01:41:14,024 --> 01:41:16,230
I ask you to help us.

1242
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:19,064
No, I beg you to help us.

1243
01:41:19,197 --> 01:41:21,569
We are your humble servants.

1244
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,614
Our fate is in your hands.

1245
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:49,095
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1246
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:55,478
Mesa lika dis!

1247
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:57,391
Maybe...

1248
01:41:57,528 --> 01:42:00,065
wesa...

1249
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:02,070
being friends.

1250
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,582
We've sent our patrols.

1251
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:16,162
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1252
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:18,456
It won't be long, my lord.

1253
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:21,711
This is
an unexpected move for her.

1254
01:42:21,845 --> 01:42:23,837
It's too aggressive.

1255
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,378
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1256
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:29,055
Let them make the first move.

1257
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,059
Yes, my master.

1258
01:42:34,608 --> 01:42:36,268
Deysa comin!

1259
01:42:36,402 --> 01:42:37,729
All right!

1260
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:43,032
They're here!

1261
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:44,533
Good. They made it.

1262
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:51,792
Yousa doen grand.

1263
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:55,002
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1264
01:42:55,130 --> 01:42:57,002
Oh, no, no, no.

1265
01:42:57,131 --> 01:43:00,086
So, wesa make you...

1266
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:02,708
bombad general.

1267
01:43:02,845 --> 01:43:04,256
General?

1268
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:08,809
Captain.

1269
01:43:08,935 --> 01:43:11,509
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1270
01:43:11,646 --> 01:43:13,520
Almost everyone's in camps.

1271
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:16,851
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1272
01:43:16,985 --> 01:43:19,524
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1273
01:43:19,654 --> 01:43:22,524
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1274
01:43:22,658 --> 01:43:24,318
and much stronger.

1275
01:43:25,619 --> 01:43:28,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1276
01:43:28,831 --> 01:43:31,037
The battle is a diversion.

1277
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:34,037
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1278
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:35,712
R2.

1279
01:43:36,838 --> 01:43:40,289
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1280
01:43:40,426 --> 01:43:42,134
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1281
01:43:42,261 --> 01:43:45,345
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1282
01:43:45,472 --> 01:43:48,390
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1283
01:43:49,144 --> 01:43:51,930
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1284
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,724
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1285
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:56,015
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1286
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:58,641
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1287
01:43:58,779 --> 01:44:01,067
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1288
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:05,907
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1289
01:44:06,036 --> 01:44:09,320
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1290
01:44:09,457 --> 01:44:12,576
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1291
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,582
We will send
what pilots we have...

1292
01:44:14,712 --> 01:44:17,747
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1293
01:44:17,881 --> 01:44:20,917
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1294
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:24,171
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1295
01:44:24,305 --> 01:44:25,929
There's an even bigger danger.

1296
01:44:26,056 --> 01:44:27,930
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1297
01:44:28,059 --> 01:44:30,265
he will return
with another droid army.

1298
01:44:30,395 --> 01:44:33,597
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1299
01:44:33,731 --> 01:44:35,640
Everything depends on it.

1300
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:43,609
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1301
01:44:43,742 --> 01:44:45,698
We are sending all troops...

1302
01:44:45,827 --> 01:44:48,697
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1303
01:44:48,831 --> 01:44:51,452
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1304
01:44:51,582 --> 01:44:54,121
This will work to our advantage.

1305
01:44:54,252 --> 01:44:57,039
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1306
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,547
Wipe them out.

1307
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,132
All of them.

1308
01:45:34,043 --> 01:45:35,418
Halt!

1309
01:45:38,881 --> 01:45:41,122
Starting up the shield.

1310
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:11,863
Open fire.

1311
01:46:27,975 --> 01:46:31,177
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1312
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:33,220
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1313
01:46:49,204 --> 01:46:51,243
Roger, roger.

1314
01:46:59,298 --> 01:47:02,417
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1315
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:05,006
This is too close.

1316
01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:13,350
Ani, find cover.

1317
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:15,768
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1318
01:48:14,542 --> 01:48:15,657
Fighters straight ahead.

1319
01:48:15,795 --> 01:48:16,908
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1320
01:48:17,046 --> 01:48:18,243
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:28,010
Cease fire.

1322
01:48:35,564 --> 01:48:37,971
Steady. Steady.

1323
01:49:11,101 --> 01:49:14,305
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:49:30,831 --> 01:49:32,739
Ouch time.

1325
01:49:46,846 --> 01:49:47,926
Fire!

1326
01:50:10,204 --> 01:50:12,030
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1327
01:50:12,164 --> 01:50:13,622
Red group! Blue group!

1328
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:15,541
Everybody, this way!

1329
01:50:15,668 --> 01:50:17,707
Hey, wait for me!

1330
01:50:17,837 --> 01:50:20,210
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1331
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:22,332
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1332
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:37,724
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1333
01:50:57,921 --> 01:50:59,829
We gotta do something, R2.

1334
01:51:22,654 --> 01:51:25,655
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1335
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:32,155
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1336
01:51:33,164 --> 01:51:35,615
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1337
01:51:37,837 --> 01:51:38,784
Yeah!

1338
01:51:44,176 --> 01:51:45,671
Let's go!

1339
01:51:46,762 --> 01:51:49,003
It's on automatic pilot.

1340
01:51:58,108 --> 01:51:59,980
Try to override it.

1341
01:53:00,046 --> 01:53:01,956
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1342
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,922
Look, there they are.

1343
01:53:10,056 --> 01:53:12,429
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1344
01:53:29,452 --> 01:53:32,073
Dumb droid. Take that!

1345
01:53:32,204 --> 01:53:34,113
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1346
01:53:34,248 --> 01:53:35,411
Get off!

1347
01:53:45,469 --> 01:53:47,841
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1348
01:53:57,148 --> 01:53:58,807
This is tense!

1349
01:54:01,109 --> 01:54:03,101
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1350
01:54:03,237 --> 01:54:05,109
It's gonna get us both killed.

1351
01:54:06,783 --> 01:54:09,189
You did it, R2!

1352
01:54:09,327 --> 01:54:10,524
Let's go left.

1353
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:16,863
Go back?

1354
01:54:17,002 --> 01:54:21,296
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1355
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:30,635
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1356
01:54:36,313 --> 01:54:38,850
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1357
01:54:45,698 --> 01:54:46,693
Go!

1358
01:54:51,537 --> 01:54:53,244
Ascension guns!

1359
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,043
Retreat! Retreat!

1360
01:57:02,797 --> 01:57:04,707
Dis is nutsen.

1361
01:57:14,601 --> 01:57:16,559
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1362
01:57:37,292 --> 01:57:39,698
Give me a lift!

1363
01:57:46,969 --> 01:57:48,546
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1364
01:57:48,679 --> 01:57:50,587
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1365
01:57:50,722 --> 01:57:52,680
Here. Taken dis one.

1366
01:58:09,117 --> 01:58:10,195
Jar Jar!

1367
01:58:10,326 --> 01:58:12,283
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1368
01:58:22,463 --> 01:58:25,251
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1369
01:58:38,188 --> 01:58:40,310
We're hit, R2!

1370
01:58:53,537 --> 01:58:56,492
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1371
01:59:03,715 --> 01:59:05,256
Everything's overheated.

1372
01:59:06,717 --> 01:59:08,675
Oops. This is not good.

1373
02:00:21,127 --> 02:00:23,333
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1374
02:00:23,463 --> 02:00:25,337
Mesa think of something.

1375
02:00:25,466 --> 02:00:26,841
Hands up.

1376
02:00:26,967 --> 02:00:29,837
My give up. My give up.

1377
02:00:38,563 --> 02:00:41,681
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1378
02:00:41,815 --> 02:00:43,689
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1379
02:00:43,818 --> 02:00:45,690
this pointless debate in the senate.

1380
02:00:45,819 --> 02:00:47,563
Viceroy!

1381
02:00:47,697 --> 02:00:49,605
Your occupation here has ended.

1382
02:00:51,201 --> 02:00:54,569
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1383
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:02,627
Captain!

1384
02:01:11,889 --> 02:01:13,927
Jam the doors.

1385
02:01:17,395 --> 02:01:20,265
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1386
02:02:23,462 --> 02:02:25,953
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1387
02:02:29,261 --> 02:02:30,292
Take this!

1388
02:02:32,305 --> 02:02:33,384
And this!

1389
02:02:41,273 --> 02:02:43,015
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1390
02:02:43,149 --> 02:02:44,975
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1391
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:46,484
Impossible!

1392
02:02:46,612 --> 02:02:48,484
Nothing can get through our shield.

1393
02:02:49,782 --> 02:02:51,573
Let's get outta here.

1394
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:02,246
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1395
02:03:05,297 --> 02:03:06,875
We didn't hit it.

1396
02:03:09,969 --> 02:03:12,007
Now, this is Podracing.

1397
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:15,347
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1398
02:03:36,747 --> 02:03:38,204
What the...

1399
02:03:38,332 --> 02:03:40,537
Was'n they doing?

1400
02:03:40,667 --> 02:03:44,250
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1401
02:03:45,965 --> 02:03:48,289
They all broke-ed.

1402
02:04:36,725 --> 02:04:40,095
No, it's too late.

1403
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:42,516
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1404
02:04:43,815 --> 02:04:45,689
Promise...

1405
02:04:45,819 --> 02:04:48,356
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1406
02:04:48,488 --> 02:04:50,029
Yes, Master.

1407
02:04:54,118 --> 02:04:56,692
He is the chosen one.

1408
02:04:56,829 --> 02:05:00,033
He will bring balance.

1409
02:05:01,251 --> 02:05:02,661
Train him.

1410
02:05:30,198 --> 02:05:31,988
Now, Viceroy...

1411
02:05:32,115 --> 02:05:35,532
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1412
02:05:37,287 --> 02:05:40,573
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1413
02:05:54,305 --> 02:05:57,840
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1414
02:05:57,976 --> 02:05:59,850
And you, young Skywalker.

1415
02:06:00,645 --> 02:06:03,930
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1416
02:06:10,488 --> 02:06:13,027
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1417
02:06:13,158 --> 02:06:16,574
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1418
02:06:16,703 --> 02:06:19,076
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1419
02:06:19,207 --> 02:06:23,121
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1420
02:06:28,173 --> 02:06:32,586
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1421
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:37,430
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1422
02:06:37,559 --> 02:06:39,431
I do not.

1423
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:41,636
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1424
02:06:44,565 --> 02:06:47,234
The chosen one the boy may be.

1425
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,984
Nevertheless...

1426
02:06:49,113 --> 02:06:51,983
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1427
02:06:52,115 --> 02:06:56,243
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1428
02:06:56,369 --> 02:06:58,279
I will train Anakin.

1429
02:07:00,541 --> 02:07:02,865
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1430
02:07:03,002 --> 02:07:05,457
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1431
02:07:05,587 --> 02:07:07,497
Need that you do not.

1432
02:07:09,759 --> 02:07:13,009
Agree with you the council does.

1433
02:07:14,139 --> 02:07:17,423
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1434
02:07:45,253 --> 02:07:46,997
What will happen to me now?

1435
02:07:47,131 --> 02:07:50,167
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1436
02:07:50,301 --> 02:07:53,716
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1437
02:08:03,148 --> 02:08:06,516
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1438
02:08:06,650 --> 02:08:09,105
Always two there are.

1439
02:08:09,237 --> 02:08:12,439
No more, no less.

1440
02:08:12,573 --> 02:08:15,490
A master and an apprentice.

1441
02:08:15,618 --> 02:08:17,161
But which was destroyed?

1442
02:08:17,287 --> 02:08:20,240
The master or the apprentice?

1443
02:08:44,899 --> 02:08:46,938
Hidoe, everybody!

1444
02:09:33,574 --> 02:09:35,484
Peace!
