Sandwich was accepted with little rust and other materials, but I'll be fine

00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:17,061
By the way, when you told me that your sister has the hour you want something more from this potency

502
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:21,960
, It's six Mnm year-old anyway did not come down them a lot

503
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,945
Oakmenk tell me about New York? - I probably will not do -

504
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,759
This is the best dangle - Can you tell me about the Avengers?

505
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,942
Give me more space

506
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:37,161
What is the official story here? What happened?

507
00:49:37,985 --> 00:49:41,418
I think it is for a man who lives (nearby, named (Davis

508
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:45,206
Got a lot of medals in the army

509
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:49,594

00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:02,175
(Including (Davis - yes -

513
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:11,800
Does not seem logical

514
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:16,690
Six dead, and there are only five shades

515
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:22,411
Yes, but people say that shadows signs to indicate the entry of persons Paradise

516
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:28,411
So the man who made the bomb went to hell because there is a shadow

517
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:31,913
So they are only five - and you believe this -

518
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:34,911
This is what is said

519
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:41,016

Is this issue bother you? - Yes, a little bit -

525
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:07,719
Can I pick up my breath? -, There are bad people in Rose Hills - Need a plastic bag to throw them?

526
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:08,632

To make him take responsibility for accidental explosions

747
01:17:58,742 --> 01:17:59,082

Is that why Ttardini? - Do not you remember? -

01:21:30,823 --> 01:21:34,162
Entered the lobby, if you understand what I mean

787
01:21:34,703 --> 01:21:37,083
I want to know what happened to the first mouse

788
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:42,722

بفضلك I as Tauveta, is not it? Adair from behind the curtain

792
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,283
Because when you give them the evil face

793
01:22:01,342 --> 01:22:04,403
(Bin Laden), (Gaddafi), (Mandarin)

794
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,802
People become a target - Try something else -

795
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:12,403
Citizen you met him - yes, genius actor -

796
01:22:13,182 --> 01:22:15,844
I know that sometimes overused, but this is not entirely my fault

01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:18,003
Is a theater actor

798
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:21,363
Say things do not even know its meaning

799
01:22:22,462 --> 01:22:26,362
In any case meant is that since the fall of the man with the hammer from the sky

800
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,043
No longer of interest to the nuances

801
01:22:29,863 --> 01:22:30,922
What's the next step in your world?

802
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:35,764

At this moment decides to accept the body (Ackstrimsst) or not

01:22:57,144 --> 01:23:00,563
I think it will not be accepted and Séajmha

806
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,603
But until it reaches this stage they are in unbearable pain

807
01:23:05,822 --> 01:23:09,802
We did not talk about your gift after

813
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:37,643
If you died, O (Killian) What will happen to your soldiers and your product?

814
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:41,283
I would not do this - what will happen to you if your temperature increased too? -

815
01:23:55,302 --> 01:23:59,203
The good news is, the high position just became empty

, No, that you're in a relationship with me will be fine

1039
01:55:19,783 --> 01:55:21,203
But I think that I can help in this

1040
01:55:21,703 --> 01:55:25,684
I think this happened to me 20 years ago and I was drunk, I think I could make you better

1041
01:55:27,341 --> 01:55:28,443
So things are fixed

1042
01:55:30,182 --> 01:55:31,882
All Anhravatk?

1043
01:55:32,783 --> 01:55:34,523
سأهتم this

1044
01:55:35,023 --> 01:55:40,523
(Jarvis) - goes well sir, you want something else? -

1045
01:55:41,023 --> 01:55:41,523
You know ماعليك the do

1046
01:55:42,023 --> 01:55:44,703
Protocol "clean slate" sir?

1047
01:55:45,384 --> 01:55:48,002
flap this, It's Christmas, yeah, yeah

1048
01:56:25,422 --> 01:56:27,122
Is that good yet, do you like it?

1049
01:56:27,703 --> 01:56:29,203
This is wonderful

1050
01:56:39,063 --> 01:56:43,483
So with Christmas morning my trip ended

1051
01:56:48,382 --> 01:56:52,162
I started with something pure, something exciting

1052
01:56:53,342 --> 01:56:55,603
Then comes the errors

1053
01:56:56,863 --> 01:56:58,283
Concessions

1054
01:57:05,063 --> 01:57:06,922
We make Xiatinna

1055
01:57:12,984 --> 01:57:14,682
It's great seeing you

1056
01:59:43,662 --> 01:59:46,283
(As promised dealt with what happened (Piper

1057
01:59:47,462 --> 01:59:48,483
Then I thought to myself,

1058
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:50,483
Why do I stand here?

1059
01:59:55,262 --> 01:59:57,363
Of course, some people think that progress at risk

1060
01:59:58,462 --> 02:00:01,363
But did not live any of these fools with an open mind is full of shrapnel

1061
02:00:02,423 --> 02:00:04,323
And now I'm also

1062
02:00:06,341 --> 02:00:09,202
I'll tell you, this is the best Kulaiolh years ago

1063
02:00:32,943 --> 02:00:36,203
Not Bad - not -

1064
02:01:11,943 --> 02:01:17,842
Potato gun, "friend"

1065
02:01:52,944 --> 02:01:55,363
If you want to finish this brief

1066
02:01:56,622 --> 02:02:01,243
I think I'm going to say Deri was never for the purpose of distraction or hobby

1067
02:02:03,064 --> 02:02:04,483
But it was for protection

1068
02:02:06,502 --> 02:02:10,402
And now I'm a different man

1069
02:02:20,543 --> 02:02:21,523
You can take over the house

1070
02:02:22,422 --> 02:02:23,362
Or Khaddaa and My Games

1071
02:02:25,143 --> 02:02:26,043
But the only thing that will not take

1072
02:02:30,502 --> 02:02:31,804
(I (Ironman

1073
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,146
