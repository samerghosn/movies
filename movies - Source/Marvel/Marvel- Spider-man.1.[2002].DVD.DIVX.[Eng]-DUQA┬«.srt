00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,516
<i>Who am I? You sure you want to know?</i>

3
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,836
<i>The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

4
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,514
<i>If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...</i>

5
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,997
<i>...if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

6
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,877
<i>...somebody lied.</i>

7
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,156
<i>But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...</i>

8
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,673
<i>...is all about a girl.</i>

9
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,798
<i>That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

10
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,918
<i>The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.</i>

11
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,639
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.</i>

12
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,711
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

13
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,468
<i>Hey! Stop the bus!</i>

14
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,555
<i>That's me.</i>

15
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,557
<i>Tell him to stop! Please!</i>

16
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,908
<i>Stop!</i>

17
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,235
<i>Hey! Stop the bus!</i>

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,358
<i>Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.</i>

19
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,713
<i>Catch a cab, Parker!</i>

20
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,673
<i>Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

21
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,108
<i>What a geek!</i>

22
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,799
<i>- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.</i>

23
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,473
<i>Would you date him?</i>

24
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,755
<i>Midtown High seniors.</i>

25
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,468
<i>No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.</i>

26
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,069
<i>Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.</i>

27
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,557
<i>We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.</i>

28
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,875
<i>So behave accordingly.</i>

29
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,951
<i>Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.</i>

30
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,718
<i>Come on, stay together.</i>

31
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,677
<i>Proceed up the steps
and into the building.</i>

32
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,711
<i>- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.</i>

33
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,314
<i>- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.</i>

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,675
<i>- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?</i>

35
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,598
<i>The entrance is right there.</i>

36
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,309
<i>Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.</i>

37
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,750
<i>I should trade my car for a Jetta...</i>

38
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,593
<i>...because you flunked out
of private school?</i>

39
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,792
<i>- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.</i>

40
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,591
<i>- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.</i>

41
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,028
<i>It's just...</i>

42
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,598
<i>Just what, Harry?</i>

43
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,233
<i>Forget it.</i>

44
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,394
<i>Pete!</i>

45
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,189
<i>- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?</i>

46
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,156
<i>- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.</i>

47
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,867
<i>- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.</i>

48
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,389
<i>- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.</i>

49
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,358
<i>I'm something of a scientist myself.</i>

50
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,557
<i>I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.</i>

51
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,632
<i>- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.</i>

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,990
<i>Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.</i>

53
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:01,516
<i>- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!</i>

54
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,194
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.</i>

55
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,795
<i>- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.</i>

56
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,836
<i>I think he wants to adopt you.</i>

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,512
<i>There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.</i>

58
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,348
<i>They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.</i>

59
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,595
<i>That's amazing!</i>

60
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,514
<i>This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.</i>

61
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,795
<i>It's unreal.</i>

62
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,632
<i>Arachnids from all three
groups possess...</i>

63
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,196
<i>...varying strengths
to help them search for food.</i>

64
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,439
<i>For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...</i>

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,593
<i>...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.</i>

66
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,432
<i>For the school paper?</i>

67
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,550
<i>Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...</i>

68
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,557
<i>...genus Kukulcania.</i>

69
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,951
<i>Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...</i>

70
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,187
<i>...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.</i>

71
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,231
<i>- Leave him alone.
- Or what?</i>

72
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,278
<i>Or his father will fire your father.</i>

73
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,910
<i>What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?</i>

74
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,468
<i>What is going on?</i>

75
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,598
<i>The next person who talks
will fail this course.</i>

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,711
<i>- This spider...
- Let's go.</i>

77
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,872
<i>...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...</i>

78
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,435
<i>...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.</i>

79
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,670
<i>- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.</i>

80
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,552
<i>A spider-sense.</i>

81
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,752
<i>Hey, look at that spider.</i>

82
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,151
<i>Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.</i>

83
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,230
<i>It's a defense mechanism.</i>

84
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,550
<i>Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?</i>

85
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,869
<i>Who wouldn't?</i>

86
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,715
<i>Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...</i>

87
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,077
<i>- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.</i>

88
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,831
<i>With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.</i>

89
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,555
<i>- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.</i>

90
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,079
<i>I love them!</i>

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,192
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,829
<i>You know, spiders can change
their color...</i>

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,675
<i>...to blend into their environment.
- Really?</i>

94
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,798
<i>- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.</i>

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,230
<i>- transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

96
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,391
<i>...combining the genetic
information from all three...</i>

97
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,031
<i>...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

98
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,633
<i>There's 14.</i>

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,399
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

100
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,994
<i>- One's missing.
- Yeah.</i>

101
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,313
<i>I guess the researchers
are working on that one.</i>

102
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,316
<i>Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?</i>

103
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,393
<i>You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.</i>

104
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,231
<i>Let's talk about listening.</i>

105
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,073
<i>I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...</i>

106
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,076
<i>...but at Midtown High...</i>

107
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,794
<i>Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.</i>

108
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,359
<i>- Sure.
- Great.</i>

109
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,754
<i>Where do you want me?
Over here?</i>

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,234
<i>Yeah, that's great.</i>

111
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,231
<i>Don't make me look ugly.</i>

112
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,351
<i>That's impossible.</i>

113
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,514
<i>Perfect.</i>

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,438
<i>- Is that good?
- Great.</i>

115
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,078
<i>That's great.</i>

116
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,350
<i>M.J., let's go!</i>

117
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>Wait. Thanks!</i>

118
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,879
<i>Parker, let's do it.</i>

119
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,230
<i>We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.</i>

120
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,834
<i>I've already seen the glider.</i>

121
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,196
<i>That's not what I'm here for.</i>

122
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,960
<i>General Slocum, good to see you again.</i>

123
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,830
<i>Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.</i>

124
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,831
<i>- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.</i>

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,389
<i>Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.</i>

126
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,875
<i>I want the report on human
performance enhancers.</i>

127
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,351
<i>We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.</i>

128
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,317
<i>- Excellent.
- Any side effects?</i>

129
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,514
<i>Once.</i>

130
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,240
<i>All the tests since
have been successful.</i>

131
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,995
<i>In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?</i>

132
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,389
<i>Violence, aggression...</i>

133
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,234
<i>...and insanity.</i>

134
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,038
<i>- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.</i>

135
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,955
<i>Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...</i>

136
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,918
<i>...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?</i>

137
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,715
<i>We need to take the whole line
back to formula.</i>

138
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,229
<i>- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.</i>

139
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,111
<i>I'll be frank with you.</i>

140
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,990
<i>I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.</i>

141
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,798
<i>The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...</i>

142
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,758
<i>...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.</i>

143
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,834
<i>- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...</i>

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,913
<i>...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...</i>

145
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,357
<i>...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.</i>

146
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,672
<i>Gentlemen. Ladies.</i>

147
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,759
<i>And the Lord said, "Let there be light. "
And voilŕ! There is light.</i>

148
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,990
<i>Forty soft, glowing watts of it.</i>

149
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,789
<i>Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.</i>

150
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,428
<i>I'm already on my ass, May.</i>

151
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,912
<i>When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...</i>

152
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,673
<i>...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.</i>

153
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,110
<i>Hand me that dish. The green one.</i>

154
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,999
<i>The corporation is downsizing
the people...</i>

155
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,236
<i>...and upsizing their profits.</i>

156
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,278
<i>Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.</i>

157
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,038
<i>Well, let's look
in the paper and see.</i>

158
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,793
<i>There are the want ads.
What do we got here?</i>

159
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,518
<i>Computer...</i>

160
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,315
<i>Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.</i>

161
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,075
<i>My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.</i>

162
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,433
<i>I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.</i>

163
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,393
<i>I love you. And Peter loves you.</i>

164
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,756
<i>You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.</i>

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,231
<i>We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.</i>

166
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,437
<i>Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.</i>

167
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,073
<i>How you doing? How was the field trip?</i>

168
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,958
<i>I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.</i>

169
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,509
<i>- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.</i>

170
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,989
<i>Did you get some pictures, Peter?</i>

171
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,519
<i>I gotta crash. Everything's fine.</i>

172
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,393
<i>What's that all about?</i>

173
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,915
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

174
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,517
<i>...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,631
<i>...combining the genetic
information from all three...</i>

176
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,436
<i>...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

177
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,107
<i>Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.</i>

178
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,476
<i>The data just doesn't justify
this test.</i>

179
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,154
<i>Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.</i>

180
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,436
<i>Don't be a coward.</i>

181
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,347
<i>Risks are part of laboratory science.</i>

182
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,109
<i>Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.</i>

183
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,674
<i>- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?</i>

184
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,152
<i>In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.</i>

185
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
<i>Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.</i>

186
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,679
<i>- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?</i>

187
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,434
<i>It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.</i>

188
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,831
<i>40,000 years of evolution...</i>

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,595
<i>...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.</i>

190
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,153
<i>Oh, that's cold.</i>

191
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,433
<i>Norman?</i>

192
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,988
<i>Norman!</i>

193
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,553
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,352
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

195
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,672
<i>Oh, my God! Norman!</i>

196
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,957
<i>Back to formula?</i>

197
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,593
<i>Weird.</i>

198
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,398
<i>- Peter?
- Yeah?</i>

199
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,271
<i>Are you all right?</i>

200
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,677
<i>I'm fine.</i>

201
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,471
<i>- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?</i>

202
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,270
<i>Yep. Big change.</i>

203
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,273
<i>- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.</i>

204
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,239
<i>Okay.</i>

205
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,388
<i>- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.</i>

206
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,193
<i>- I got better.
- See?</i>

207
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,590
<i>- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?</i>

208
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,275
<i>Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.</i>

209
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,113
<i>Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.</i>

210
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,310
<i>And don't start up with me.</i>

211
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,355
<i>Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.</i>

212
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,828
<i>You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!</i>

213
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,435
<i>- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?</i>

214
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,711
<i>Hi, M.J.</i>

215
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,992
<i>Hey, M.J.</i>

216
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,596
<i>I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.</i>

217
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,957
<i>And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?</i>

218
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,387
<i>I got the car. Hop in.</i>

219
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,313
<i>Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.</i>

220
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,194
<i>I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.</i>

221
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,634
<i>Or not.</i>

222
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,473
<i>Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!</i>

223
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,394
<i>- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!</i>

224
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,357
<i>Tell him to stop.</i>

225
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,911
<i>- Check him out!
- Dork!</i>

226
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,673
<i>Dad!</i>

227
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,916
<i>Dad, are you all right?</i>

228
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,948
<i>Harry.</i>

229
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,070
<i>What are you doing on the floor?</i>

230
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,513
<i>I don't know.</i>

231
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,549
<i>Have you been there all night?</i>

232
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,673
<i>Last night I was...</i>

233
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,114
<i>What?</i>

234
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,628
<i>- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?</i>

235
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,432
<i>Sir, I asked her to wait.</i>

236
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,751
<i>- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.</i>

237
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,909
<i>What?</i>

238
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,516
<i>They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.</i>

239
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,911
<i>- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...</i>

240
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,990
<i>- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.</i>

241
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,558
<i>Wow! Great reflexes!</i>

242
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,470
<i>- Thanks.
- No problem.</i>

243
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,273
<i>Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.</i>

244
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,592
<i>You just get contacts?</i>

245
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,150
<i>Well, see you.</i>

246
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,596
<i>- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.</i>

247
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,358
<i>Did you see that?</i>

248
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,471
<i>Parker?</i>

249
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,348
<i>- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?</i>

250
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,397
<i>- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.</i>

251
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,193
<i>- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.</i>

252
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,635
<i>- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.</i>

253
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,034
<i>Help him, Harry.</i>

254
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,232
<i>How'd he do that?</i>

255
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,473
<i>Which one?</i>

256
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,959
<i>He's all yours, man.</i>

257
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,478
<i>Flash, get up!</i>

258
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,031
<i>Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.</i>

259
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,313
<i>That was amazing.</i>

260
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,111
<i>I'm out of here. Come on.</i>

261
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,989
<i>Go, web!</i>

262
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,077
<i>Fly.</i>

263
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,590
<i>Up, up and away, web.</i>

264
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,472
<i>Shazam!</i>

265
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,233
<i>Go! Go!</i>

266
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,152
<i>Go, web, go!</i>

267
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,592
<i>Tallyho.</i>

268
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,188
<i>- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?</i>

269
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,594
<i>Bring me some beer.</i>

270
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,233
<i>- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...</i>

271
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,833
<i>- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!</i>

272
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,230
<i>You're as stupid as your mother.</i>

273
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,513
<i>Where's she going?
Where you going?</i>

274
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,757
<i>The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.</i>

275
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,111
<i>- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.</i>

276
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,278
<i>- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!</i>

277
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,868
<i>- Were you listening to that?
- No.</i>

278
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,317
<i>Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.</i>

279
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,118
<i>I guess you can always hear us.</i>

280
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,474
<i>Everybody shouts.</i>

281
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,955
<i>Your aunt and uncle don't.</i>

282
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,554
<i>Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.</i>

283
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,959
<i>Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...</i>

284
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,758
<i>You really freaked us out.</i>

285
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,109
<i>I'm sorry. Is he okay?</i>

286
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,188
<i>He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.</i>

287
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,231
<i>So where are you going
after you graduate?</i>

288
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,994
<i>I wanna move into the city.</i>

289
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,476
<i>And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.</i>

290
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,358
<i>Work my way through college.</i>

291
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,594
<i>What about you?</i>

292
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,671
<i>Headed for the city too.</i>

293
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,509
<i>Can't wait to get out of here.</i>

294
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,073
<i>I wanna...</i>

295
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,712
<i>What?</i>

296
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,589
<i>No, come on. Try me.</i>

297
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,913
<i>I wanna...</i>

298
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,273
<i>...act...</i>

299
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,833
<i>...on-stage.</i>

300
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,152
<i>Really?</i>

301
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,589
<i>Oh, that's perfect.</i>

302
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,314
<i>You were awesome
in all the school plays.</i>

303
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,392
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

304
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,877
<i>I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.</i>

305
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,476
<i>Peter, that was first grade.</i>

306
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,393
<i>Well...</i>

307
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,353
<i>...even so.</i>

308
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:20,151
<i>Sometimes...</i>

309
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,551
<i>...you know people.</i>

310
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,115
<i>You can just see what's coming.</i>

311
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,719
<i>What do you see coming for you?</i>

312
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,791
<i>I don't know.</i>

313
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,510
<i>Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.</i>

314
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,758
<i>And what for me?</i>

315
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,193
<i>For you?</i>

316
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,199
<i>You're gonna light up Broadway.</i>

317
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,913
<i>You know...</i>

318
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,634
<i>...you're taller than you look.</i>

319
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,278
<i>I hunch.</i>

320
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,873
<i>Don't.</i>

321
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,670
<i>Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.</i>

322
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,948
<i>Come on.</i>

323
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,273
<i>I gotta go.</i>

324
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,194
<i>Bye.</i>

325
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,400
<i>- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.</i>

326
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,471
<i>- Look at it!
- Hop in.</i>

327
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,789
<i>Oh, my God. What a cool car!</i>

328
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,552
<i>Pretty tight, huh?</i>

329
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,112
<i>Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.</i>

330
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,993
<i>Cool car.</i>

331
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,875
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

332
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,594
<i>I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.</i>

333
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,275
<i>Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.</i>

334
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,550
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

335
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,317
<i>Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.</i>

336
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,039
<i>Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.</i>

337
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,756
<i>I just don't know anymore.</i>

338
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,594
<i>I'm going to the library.
See you later.</i>

339
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,030
<i>- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.</i>

340
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,317
<i>No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.</i>

341
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,230
<i>- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.</i>

342
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,597
<i>- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.</i>

343
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,589
<i>What do we have to talk about?
Why now?</i>

344
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,638
<i>We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.</i>

345
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,589
<i>You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.</i>

346
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,719
<i>- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.</i>

347
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,752
<i>- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?</i>

348
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,837
<i>No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...</i>

349
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,356
<i>You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.</i>

350
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,471
<i>No. Not exactly.</i>

351
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,394
<i>These are the years
when a man changes...</i>

352
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,394
<i>...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.</i>

353
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,518
<i>Just be careful who you change into.</i>

354
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,311
<i>This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.</i>

355
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,434
<i>But just because you can
beat him up...</i>

356
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,030
<i>...doesn't give you the right to.</i>

357
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,708
<i>Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

358
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,070
<i>Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?</i>

359
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,516
<i>Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.</i>

360
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,838
<i>I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.</i>

361
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,719
<i>Then stop pretending to be!</i>

362
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,833
<i>Right.</i>

363
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,556
<i>I'll pick you up here at 10.</i>

364
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,117
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

365
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,518
<i>- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?</i>

366
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,596
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

367
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,117
<i>...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.</i>

368
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,594
<i>For $3000...</i>

369
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,230
<i>...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...</i>

370
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,916
<i>...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?</i>

371
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,391
<i>Who?</i>

372
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,436
<i>I know who.</i>

373
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:09,235
<i>The Flying Dutchman!</i>

374
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,958
<i>Next.</i>

375
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,911
<i>There's no featherweight
division here. Next.</i>

376
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,831
<i>No, no. Sign me up.</i>

377
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,516
<i>Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...</i>

378
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,713
<i>...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?</i>

379
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,911
<i>And you're participating
under your own free will?</i>

380
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,958
<i>Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.</i>

381
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,590
<i>Told you! Told you!</i>

382
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,518
<i>Winner!</i>

383
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,869
<i>Next victim!</i>

384
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,432
<i>Are you ready for more?</i>

385
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,956
<i>Bone Saw is ready!</i>

386
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,751
<i>Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?</i>

387
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,476
<i>If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...</i>

388
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,918
<i>...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...</i>

389
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,637
<i>- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.</i>

390
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,474
<i>That's it? That's the best you got?</i>

391
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,675
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.</i>

392
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,152
<i>The sum of $3000 will be paid to...</i>

393
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,436
<i>...the terrifying, the deadly...</i>

394
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:24,751
<i>...the amazing Spider-Man!</i>

395
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,554
<i>- It's "The Human Spider. "
- Get out there.</i>

396
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:32,632
<i>- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.</i>

397
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,474
<i>Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.</i>

398
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,675
<i>I hope you brought your mommy.</i>

399
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,913
<i>- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.</i>

400
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,355
<i>I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.</i>

401
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,795
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

402
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,557
<i>Oh, my legs!</i>

403
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:56,233
<i>Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.</i>

404
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,311
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

405
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,672
<i>Cage! Cage! Cage!</i>

406
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,989
<i>Cage!</i>

407
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,358
<i>Hello? Guys?</i>

408
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,114
<i>Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?</i>

409
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,918
<i>This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!</i>

410
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,429
<i>Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!</i>

411
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,358
<i>Hey, freak show!</i>

412
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:38,074
<i>You're going nowhere.</i>

413
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,514
<i>I got you for three minutes.</i>

414
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,875
<i>Three minutes of playtime.</i>

415
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,550
<i>- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.</i>

416
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,639
<i>That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?</i>

417
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,559
<i>Finish him off!</i>

418
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,918
<i>Smash him!</i>

419
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,472
<i>- Hit him!
- Harder!</i>

420
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,630
<i>Kick his spider ass!</i>

421
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,675
<i>Hit him!</i>

422
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,277
<i>One, two, three!</i>

423
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,152
<i>That's it! That's it!
Winner!</i>

424
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,188
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!</i>

425
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,472
<i>Now get out of here.</i>

426
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,759
<i>A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.</i>

427
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,235
<i>Well, check it again, webhead.</i>

428
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,108
<i>It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.</i>

429
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,550
<i>For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.</i>

430
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,039
<i>I need that money.</i>

431
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,438
<i>I missed the part
where that's my problem.</i>

432
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,396
<i>- Hey, what the hell..?
- Put the money in the bag.</i>

433
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,434
<i>Hurry up!</i>

434
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,510
<i>Hey! He stole the gate!</i>

435
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,556
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

436
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,273
<i>Stop him! He's got my money!</i>

437
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,673
<i>Thanks.</i>

438
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,155
<i>What's wrong with you?
You let him go!</i>

439
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,469
<i>Cut him off and call the cops!</i>

440
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:05,518
<i>You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.</i>

441
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,911
<i>I missed the part
where that's my problem.</i>

442
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,358
<i>- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?</i>

443
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,878
<i>Old dude, man.</i>

444
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,072
<i>Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!</i>

445
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,958
<i>- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.</i>

446
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,311
<i>- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.</i>

447
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,552
<i>- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!</i>

448
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,153
<i>- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.</i>

449
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,670
<i>We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.</i>

450
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,199
<i>Uncle Ben?</i>

451
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,512
<i>Uncle Ben.</i>

452
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,393
<i>Uncle Ben?</i>

453
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,313
<i>Peter.</i>

454
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,878
<i>I'm here, Uncle Ben.</i>

455
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,429
<i>Peter.</i>

456
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:41,431
<i>They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.</i>

457
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:46,155
<i>We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.</i>

458
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,670
<i>Get a unit to the rear!</i>

459
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,079
<i>I got the back!</i>

460
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,753
<i>Who's there?</i>

461
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,952
<i>Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!</i>

462
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,431
<i>What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?</i>

463
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,032
<i>Answer me!</i>

464
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,514
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

465
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,398
<i>Thanks.</i>

466
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,949
<i>See you.</i>

467
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,070
<i>Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

468
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,400
<i>Oh, no. My God.</i>

469
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,748
<i>Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!</i>

470
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,592
<i>- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.</i>

471
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,112
<i>Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.</i>

472
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,478
<i>Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.</i>

473
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:09,550
<i>- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?</i>

474
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:11,914
<i>Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.</i>

475
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,278
<i>Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?</i>

476
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,193
<i>Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.</i>

477
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,351
<i>Preflight complete. Mark.</i>

478
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,833
<i>An unidentified object
is closing fast.</i>

479
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,034
<i>What's that?</i>

480
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,632
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

481
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,398
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

482
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,998
<i>- Say "chess. "
- Chess!</i>

483
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,277
<i>Peter!</i>

484
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,836
<i>Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.</i>

485
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,356
<i>Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.</i>

486
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,998
<i>- Great!
- You made it.</i>

487
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,836
<i>It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.</i>

488
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,269
<i>- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.</i>

489
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,148
<i>Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.</i>

490
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,788
<i>Yeah.</i>

491
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:19,871
<i>I know this has been
a difficult time for you...</i>

492
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,157
<i>...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.</i>

493
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,838
<i>Commencement:</i>

494
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,958
<i>The end of one thing,
the start of something new.</i>

495
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,235
<i>I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.</i>

496
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,876
<i>You know what? Whatever.</i>

497
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,798
<i>Your loss.</i>

498
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,869
<i>You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.</i>

499
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,715
<i>And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.</i>

500
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,190
<i>Can I fix you something?</i>

501
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,793
<i>No, thanks.</i>

502
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,835
<i>I missed him a lot today.</i>

503
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,753
<i>I know.</i>

504
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,192
<i>I miss him too.</i>

505
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,110
<i>But he was there.</i>

506
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:08,153
<i>I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.</i>

507
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,150
<i>He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.</i>

508
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,831
<i>You loved him...</i>

509
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,590
<i>...and he loved you.</i>

510
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,954
<i>He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.</i>

511
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,429
<i>How you were meant for great things.</i>

512
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,190
<i>You won't disappoint him.</i>

513
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,353
<i>With great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

514
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,592
<i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>

515
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,393
<i>Hurry up!</i>

516
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,875
<i>He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.</i>

517
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,112
<i>I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.</i>

518
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,679
<i>Bobby. Get a load of this!</i>

519
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:53,793
<i>He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.</i>

520
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,039
<i>I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.</i>

521
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:00,713
<i>The guy protects us,
protects the people.</i>

522
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,518
<i>Some kind of freakyloo or something.</i>

523
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,635
<i>He stinks and I don't like him.</i>

524
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,833
<i>Don't move, lady!</i>

525
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,239
<i>Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.</i>

526
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,476
<i>Those tights and that tight little...</i>

527
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,836
<i>Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug</i>

528
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:27,635
<i>But we should all just give him
One big hug</i>

529
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,231
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

530
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,355
<i>"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.</i>

531
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,360
<i>A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?</i>

532
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:44,800
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

533
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,789
<i>- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.</i>

534
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,438
<i>- Well?
- He's news.</i>

535
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,028
<i>- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.</i>

536
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,034
<i>- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.</i>

537
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:01,193
<i>Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.</i>

538
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,148
<i>He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!</i>

539
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,992
<i>Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?</i>

540
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,072
<i>She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.</i>

541
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:13,594
<i>- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:</i>

542
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,434
<i>We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...</i>

543
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,637
<i>- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?</i>

544
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,949
<i>Every copy.</i>

545
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,155
<i>Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.</i>

546
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,117
<i>- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.</i>

547
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,871
<i>- That can't be done.
- Get out!</i>

548
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,715
<i>We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.</i>

549
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,916
<i>Aw, what is he, shy?</i>

550
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,914
<i>If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.</i>

551
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,356
<i>On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider-Man picture. "</i>

552
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,829
<i>He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!</i>

553
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,152
<i>Buzz off.</i>

554
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,672
<i>- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!</i>

555
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,996
<i>- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?</i>

556
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,028
<i>- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?</i>

557
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:17,188
<i>Yeah.</i>

558
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,108
<i>I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.</i>

559
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,394
<i>That's great.</i>

560
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,032
<i>- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!</i>

561
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:27,757
<i>Your drawer was short $6!</i>

562
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,434
<i>Next time, I'll take it
from your check.</i>

563
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,108
<i>Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!</i>

564
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,514
<i>Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.</i>

565
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,639
<i>It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.</i>

566
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,958
<i>Some dream, huh?</i>

567
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,313
<i>It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.</i>

568
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,152
<i>- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?</i>

569
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,951
<i>Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?</i>

570
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,873
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

571
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,077
<i>I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.</i>

572
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,472
<i>- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.</i>

573
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,952
<i>You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.</i>

574
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,231
<i>No, I guess not.</i>

575
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,552
<i>Thanks, Pete.</i>

576
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,751
<i>We should catch up sometime.</i>

577
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,233
<i>Let's get some lunch some evening.</i>

578
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,751
<i>I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.</i>

579
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,554
<i>- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.</i>

580
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:43,914
<i>I won't.</i>

581
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,672
<i>I won't tell Harry.</i>

582
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:00,875
<i>Timing's perfect. Hey.</i>

583
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,231
<i>Five new contracts. It'll be great.</i>

584
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,873
<i>Norman's making his weekly inspection.</i>

585
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:11,789
<i>Spent half of it on the phone.</i>

586
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,876
<i>Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.</i>

587
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:18,907
<i>Are you all right?</i>

588
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:24,556
<i>You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.</i>

589
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,632
<i>I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.</i>

590
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,278
<i>You were late again?</i>

591
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,668
<i>I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?</i>

592
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,034
<i>Around.</i>

593
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,838
<i>Peter Parker.</i>

594
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,548
<i>- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?</i>

595
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:43,677
<i>- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.</i>

596
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:45,632
<i>When do I get to meet her?</i>

597
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,951
<i>Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.</i>

598
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,836
<i>Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?</i>

599
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,759
<i>Dad, maybe you can help him out.</i>

600
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,072
<i>- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.</i>

601
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,358
<i>I couldn't accept it. I like to earn
what I get. I'll find work.</i>

602
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,117
<i>I respect that.</i>

603
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,835
<i>You want to make it on your own.</i>

604
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,753
<i>That's great.</i>

605
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,829
<i>What other skills do you have?</i>

606
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,076
<i>I was thinking about photography.</i>

607
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,114
<i>Hello.</i>

608
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,155
<i>Let's go! Move it!</i>

609
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,871
<i>Watch the street!</i>

610
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:44,998
<i>Cheese!</i>

611
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:54,788
<i>They're crap.</i>

612
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,833
<i>Crap, crap. Megacrap.</i>

613
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,077
<i>- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.</i>

614
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,952
<i>Take them somewhere else.</i>

615
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,273
<i>- Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
- We'll put a rug there.</i>

616
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:09,516
<i>Sit down. Give me that.</i>

617
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:13,474
<i>Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.</i>

618
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:15,869
<i>- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?</i>

619
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,231
<i>"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos. "</i>

620
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,391
<i>- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...</i>

621
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,159
<i>...I'll make up the headlines. Okay?</i>

622
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,231
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Goody.</i>

623
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,036
<i>Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.</i>

624
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,152
<i>- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.</i>

625
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,918
<i>Best thing for you.</i>

626
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,237
<i>You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.</i>

627
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,273
<i>But I never said you have a job. Meat.</i>

628
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,557
<i>I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.</i>

629
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,228
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

630
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,715
<i>Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.</i>

631
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,751
<i>- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.</i>

632
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,599
<i>I'm Peter Parker.</i>

633
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,070
<i>I'm a photographer.</i>

634
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,273
<i>Yes. I can see that.</i>

635
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,431
<i>As of today...</i>

636
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:20,434
<i>...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...</i>

637
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:24,911
<i>...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.</i>

638
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,798
<i>In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...</i>

639
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,996
<i>...costs are down, revenues are up...</i>

640
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:33,958
<i>...and our stock
has never been higher.</i>

641
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:38,351
<i>Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.</i>

642
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:40,353
<i>What?</i>

643
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,474
<i>Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.</i>

644
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:48,358
<i>They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.</i>

645
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,635
<i>Why wasn't I told?</i>

646
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,713
<i>They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.</i>

647
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,195
<i>The deal is off if you come with it.</i>

648
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,635
<i>The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.</i>

649
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,717
<i>You can't do this to me.</i>

650
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,954
<i>I started this company.</i>

651
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,268
<i>You know how much I sacrificed?!</i>

652
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,193
<i>- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.</i>

653
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,554
<i>We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.</i>

654
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,152
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

655
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:28,155
<i>You're out, Norman.</i>

656
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:39,072
<i>Am I?</i>

657
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,358
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

658
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,670
<i>M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?</i>

659
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:32,195
<i>Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.</i>

660
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,717
<i>Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.</i>

661
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:39,514
<i>I think you're beautiful.</i>

662
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,916
<i>I forgot my drink inside.</i>

663
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:06,755
<i>- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.</i>

664
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,748
<i>- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.</i>

665
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,668
<i>- What is that?
- Must be new this year.</i>

666
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,588
<i>What is that?</i>

667
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,590
<i>That's our glider!</i>

668
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,958
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

669
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:14,552
<i>Code three!</i>

670
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,989
<i>- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!</i>

671
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:41,030
<i>Harry! Help me! Harry!</i>

672
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,431
<i>Out, am I?</i>

673
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,871
<i>- Mary Jane!
- Harry!</i>

674
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,597
<i>Hello, my dear.</i>

675
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,311
<i>It's Spider-Man!</i>

676
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,237
<i>- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!</i>

677
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,829
<i>Somebody help him!</i>

678
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:22,996
<i>No!</i>

679
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,438
<i>Mommy!</i>

680
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,237
<i>- Hold it!
- I surrender.</i>

681
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,188
<i>- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!</i>

682
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,954
<i>Impressive.</i>

683
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:05,550
<i>- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!</i>

684
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,869
<i>Hold on!</i>

685
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,429
<i>Watch out!</i>

686
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,829
<i>We'll meet again, Spider-Man!</i>

687
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,039
<i>Well, beats taking the subway.</i>

688
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,356
<i>Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.</i>

689
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:36,588
<i>Wait.</i>

690
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,954
<i>Who are you?</i>

691
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:40,588
<i>- You know who I am.
- I do?</i>

692
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,313
<i>Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.</i>

693
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,268
<i>Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?</i>

694
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,914
<i>No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.</i>

695
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:05,152
<i>No, I'm gonna come...</i>

696
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,755
<i>All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?</i>

697
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,793
<i>And we'll go and have breakfast and...</i>

698
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,155
<i>...I want to buy you something.</i>

699
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,516
<i>Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.</i>

700
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,034
<i>Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?</i>

701
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,034
<i>All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.</i>

702
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:28,872
<i>Don't let the bedbugs...</i>

703
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,231
<i>She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.</i>

704
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,350
<i>Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.</i>

705
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,199
<i>But you should know
I'm crazy about her.</i>

706
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:49,271
<i>It's just, you know,
you never made a move.</i>

707
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,752
<i>You're right.</i>

708
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,073
<i>I didn't.</i>

709
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,229
<i>I'm gonna get some rest.</i>

710
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,590
<i>I'm gonna stay up for a while.</i>

711
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,311
<i>What was that thing?</i>

712
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,154
<i>I don't know.</i>

713
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,751
<i>Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.</i>

714
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,100
<i>Somebody there?</i>

715
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:31,792
<i>Somebody.</i>

716
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:34,559
<i>Who said that?</i>

717
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,396
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

718
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,319
<i>You've known all along.</i>

719
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:48,479
<i>Where are you?</i>

720
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,519
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

721
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:00,872
<i>I'm right here.</i>

722
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,470
<i>I don't understand.</i>

723
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,476
<i>Did you think it was coincidence?</i>

724
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,109
<i>So many good things,
all happening for you.</i>

725
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:15,795
<i>All for you. Norman.</i>

726
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,592
<i>What do you want?</i>

727
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:22,076
<i>To say what you won't.</i>

728
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,793
<i>To do what you can't.</i>

729
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,350
<i>To remove those in your way.</i>

730
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,037
<i>The board members.</i>

731
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:37,599
<i>You killed them.</i>

732
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,238
<i>We killed them.</i>

733
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,548
<i>We?</i>

734
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,238
<i>Remember?</i>

735
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:44,960
<i>Your little accident
in the laboratory.</i>

736
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,478
<i>The performance enhancers.</i>

737
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,713
<i>Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.</i>

738
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,548
<i>Bringing you
what you've always wanted:</i>

739
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,472
<i>Power beyond your wildest dreams.</i>

740
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,029
<i>And it's only the beginning.</i>

741
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,631
<i>There's only one who can stop us.</i>

742
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:12,631
<i>Or imagine if he joined us.</i>

743
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,311
<i>Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.</i>

744
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,676
<i>The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.</i>

745
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,717
<i>- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...</i>

746
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,471
<i>- Hoffman!
- Yeah?</i>

I want a quarter every time it's said.</i>

748
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:35,635
<i>How about "Green Meanie"?</i>

749
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,552
<i>Spider-Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.</i>

750
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,949
<i>It is not. I resent that.</i>

751
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,838

01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,712
<i>I trust my barber.</i>

754
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,953
<i>Are you his lawyer?</i>

755
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:54,711
<i>Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...</i>

756
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,912
<i>Jameson, you slime.</i>

757
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,270
<i>Who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?</i>

758
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,278
<i>- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!</i>

759
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:14,318
<i>- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.</i>

760
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:17,278
<i>- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.</i>

761
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:19,630
<i>Set him down, tough guy.</i>

762
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,270
<i>- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!</i>

763
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:26,948
<i>Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.</i>

764
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:29,515
<i>Sleep...</i>

765
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:47,234
<i>Wake up, little spider. Wake up.</i>

766
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:51,631
<i>No, you're not dead yet.</i>

767
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,909
<i>Just paralyzed...</i>

768
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:55,957
<i>...temporarily.</i>

769
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,877
<i>You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.</i>

770
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:02,640
<i>You and I are not so different.</i>

771
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:06,516
<i>I'm not like you. You're a murderer.</i>

772
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,472
<i>Well, to each his own.</i>

773
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,472
<i>I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.</i>

774
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:17,556
<i>And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.</i>

775
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,877
<i>But the one thing they love
more than a hero...</i>

776
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:24,515
<i>...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.</i>

777
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,037
<i>In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

778
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:30,229
<i>Why bother?</i>

779
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:34,956
<i>- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.</i>

780
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,238
<i>There are eight million people
in this city.</i>

781
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:42,557
<i>And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...</i>

782
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,547
<i>...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.</i>

783
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,073
<i>You, me...</i>

784
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,470
<i>...we're exceptional.</i>

785
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,190
<i>I could squash you like a bug
right now.</i>

786
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:58,914
<i>But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.</i>

787
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:02,515
<i>Imagine what we could
accomplish together.</i>

788
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,359
<i>What we could create.</i>

789
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,831
<i>Or we could destroy.</i>

790
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,787
<i>Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...</i>

791
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,676
<i>...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?</i>

792
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,353
<i>Think about it, hero.</i>

793
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,960
<i>In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

794
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,279
<i>It's me again.</i>

795
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,993
<i>How was your audition?</i>

796
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,078
<i>- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...</i>

797
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,117
<i>...told my aunt, told me.</i>

798
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,833
<i>So you just came by?</i>

799
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:01,510
<i>I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.</i>

800
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:06,070
<i>I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...</i>

801
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:07,752
<i>So how'd it go?</i>

802
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,307
<i>They said I needed acting lessons.</i>

803
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,074
<i>A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.</i>

804
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:21,359
<i>Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.</i>

805
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,631
<i>I'd like a cheeseburger.</i>

806
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:28,390
<i>Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.</i>

807
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,153
<i>Come with us.</i>

808
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:32,958
<i>No, thanks. How's it going with?</i>

809
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,189
<i>Never mind.
That's none of my business.</i>

810
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,113
<i>It's not?</i>

811
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:42,072
<i>Why so interested?</i>

812
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,153
<i>I'm not.</i>

813
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:45,719
<i>You're not?</i>

814
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:49,918
<i>- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.</i>

815
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,877
<i>Why would you be?</i>

816
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,909
<i>I, that's a...</i>

817
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:57,552
<i>I don't know.</i>

818
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,399
<i>Sorry you won't come with us.</i>

819
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,636
<i>I'd better run, tiger.</i>

820
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,911
<i>Hey, check it out, man.</i>

821
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:18,671
<i>Come on, man.</i>

822
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,197
<i>Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!</i>

823
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:43,759
<i>Get off me!</i>

824
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,113
<i>Wait!</i>

825
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,034
<i>You have a knack
for getting in trouble.</i>

826
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:28,398
<i>You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.</i>

827
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,396
<i>I was in the neighborhood.</i>

828
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:34,713
<i>You are amazing.</i>

829
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,234
<i>Some people don't think so.</i>

830
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:42,158
<i>- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.</i>

831
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,952
<i>Do I get to say thank you this time?</i>

832
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,233
<i>Wait.</i>

833
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:56,435
<i>Let me in! My baby's in there!</i>

834
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,636
<i>- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!</i>

835
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,155
<i>- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!</i>

836
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:03,634
<i>Look! Up there!</i>

837
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,712
<i>Save my baby, please!</i>

838
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:35,548
<i>No!</i>

839
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,833
<i>- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!</i>

840
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,637
<i>God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.</i>

841
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,511
<i>Don't let him get away!</i>

842
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,837
<i>Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.</i>

843
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,197
<i>Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!</i>

844
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,873
<i>I'm going.</i>

845
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,391
<i>- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.</i>

846
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,868
<i>Go! Go!</i>

847
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:18,078
<i>Where are you?</i>

848
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:21,552
<i>Where are you?</i>

849
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,994
<i>I'm gonna get you out of here!</i>

850
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:32,912
<i>It's okay.</i>

851
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,148
<i>You're pathetically predictable.</i>

852
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:44,150
<i>Like a moth to the flame.</i>

853
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,354
<i>What about my generous proposal?</i>

854
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:51,078
<i>Are you in or are you out?</i>

855
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:56,957
<i>- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.</i>

856
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:58,792
<i>Oh, great.</i>

857
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,552
<i>No one says no to me!</i>

858
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,876
<i>- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.</i>

859
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:52,474
<i>He's here.</i>

860
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:54,672
<i>Are you ready?</i>

861
01:21:56,439 --> 01:21:59,000
<i>Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

862
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,158
<i>Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.</i>

863
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:05,636
<i>Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.</i>

864
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,474
<i>Who is this lovely young lady?</i>

865
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,757
<i>I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.</i>

866
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,520
<i>I've been looking forward
to meeting you.</i>

867
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:19,269
<i>- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?</i>

868
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,715
<i>He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.</i>

869
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:30,676
<i>Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.</i>

870
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,993
<i>Peter?</i>

871
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,358
<i>Is that you?</i>

872
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,592
<i>How strange. There's nobody here.</i>

873
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,078
<i>- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.</i>

874
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:37,873
<i>- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!</i>

875
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:39,712
<i>It's a jungle out there.</i>

876
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,634
<i>Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.</i>

877
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:46,798
<i>Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...</i>

878
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,472
<i>...and we can say grace.</i>

879
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,551
<i>Here we go.</i>

880
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,470
<i>- There we are.
- It looks delicious.</i>

881
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:08,314
<i>Will you do the honors?</i>

882
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,636
<i>Why, Peter, you're bleeding.</i>

883
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:30,479
<i>I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.</i>

884
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,118
<i>Well, let me see.</i>

885
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:33,752
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

886
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,309
<i>- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.</i>

887
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:39,471
<i>I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.</i>

888
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:44,753
<i>This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.</i>

889
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,637
<i>How did you say that happened?</i>

890
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:50,677
<i>Bike messenger.</i>

891
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,756
<i>Knocked me down.</i>

892
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,435
<i>- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?</i>

893
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:05,551
<i>Something has come to my attention.</i>

894
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,953
<i>Are you all right?</i>

895
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:10,515
<i>I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.</i>

896
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:13,395
<i>- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!</i>

897
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:19,109
<i>I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?</i>

898
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:20,912
<i>I've got to go.</i>

899
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:25,198
<i>- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.</i>

900
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:29,188
<i>Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?</i>

901
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:32,318
<i>- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.</i>

902
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:37,679
<i>They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.</i>

903
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,073
<i>You're wrong, Dad.</i>

904
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,671
<i>A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:</i>

905
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,548
<i>Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.</i>

906
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,953
<i>Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.</i>

907
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,993
<i>- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.</i>

908
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:05,908
<i>That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.</i>

909
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,390
<i>Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!</i>

910
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,152
<i>Harry Osborn!</i>

911
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,155
<i>I'm sorry, Aunt May.</i>

912
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,197
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

913
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:22,351
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

914
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,833
<i>I can't.</i>

915
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,877
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

916
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:29,270
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

917
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:32,587
<i>What do I do?</i>

918
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,712
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

919
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,792
<i>Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.</i>

920
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:41,268
<i>Yes?</i>

921
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,270
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

922
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,387
<i>But how?</i>

923
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,717
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

924
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,034
<i>Tell me how!</i>

925
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,270
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

926
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,431
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

927
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:01,595
<i>Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

928
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,632
<i>...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

929
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,555
<i>Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...</i>

930
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,434
<i>Deliver us!</i>

931
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,958
<i>Finish it!</i>

932
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,993
<i>- Finish it!
- From evil!</i>

933
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:31,550
<i>Two milligrams IV.</i>

934
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:34,474
<i>Get the BP.</i>

935
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,315
<i>Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?</i>

936
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,793
<i>You have to leave.</i>

937
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,597
<i>- What happened?
- Those eyes!</i>

938
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,672
<i>Those horrible yellow eyes!</i>

939
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:52,753
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

940
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,432
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

941
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,354
<i>- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.</i>

942
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,079
<i>She's been sleeping all day.</i>

943
01:28:46,039 --> 01:28:48,679
<i>- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.</i>

944
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,478
<i>How are you?
You okay about the other night?</i>

945
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:59,189
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.</i>

946
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:02,233
<i>- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.</i>

947
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,750
<i>I haven't called him back.</i>

948
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,398
<i>The fact is...</i>

949
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,238
<i>...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?</i>

950
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:14,515
<i>At least I think I am.</i>

951
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:19,032
<i>- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.</i>

952
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:22,317
<i>Would I know his name, this guy?</i>

953
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,273
<i>You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.</i>

954
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:26,759
<i>Trust me.</i>

955
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,194
<i>It's funny.</i>

956
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:33,908
<i>He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.</i>

957
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:37,310
<i>- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.</i>

958
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,353
<i>No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.</i>

959
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,677
<i>But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?</i>

960
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,637
<i>Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.</i>

961
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,398
<i>I know him a little bit.</i>

962
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,353
<i>I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.</i>

963
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,551
<i>- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.</i>

964
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,279
<i>What'd he say?</i>

965
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,113
<i>I said...</i>

966
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:04,278
<i>He asked me what I thought about you.</i>

967
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:07,115
<i>And what did you say?</i>

968
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,712
<i>I said, "Spider-Man. "</i>

969
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:16,716
<i>I said, "The great thing about M.J...</i>

970
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,399
<i>...is...</i>

971
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:22,396
<i>...when you look in her eyes...</i>

972
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,912
<i>...and she's looking back in yours...</i>

973
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,757
<i>...everything feels...</i>

974
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,671
<i>...not quite normal.</i>

975
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,597
<i>Because you feel...</i>

976
01:30:38,119 --> 01:30:39,677
<i>...stronger...</i>

977
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:44,630
<i>...and weaker at the same time.</i>

978
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,676
<i>You feel excited...</i>

979
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,475
<i>...and at the same time...</i>

980
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:52,637
<i>...terrified.</i>

981
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,997
<i>The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...</i>

982
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:03,829
<i>...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.</i>

983
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:08,237
<i>It's as if you've...</i>

984
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,877
<i>...reached the unreachable...</i>

985
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:15,993
<i>...and you weren't ready for it. "</i>

986
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:20,992
<i>You said that?</i>

987
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,989
<i>Well, something like that.</i>

988
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:07,912
<i>Dad?</i>

989
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:15,030
<i>Dad, is that you?</i>

990
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:22,792
<i>What is it?</i>

991
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,750
<i>You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.</i>

992
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,314
<i>She's in love with Peter.</i>

993
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,318
<i>- Parker?
- Yeah.</i>

994
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:38,471
<i>And how does he feel about her?</i>

995
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,274
<i>He's loved her since the 4th grade.</i>

996
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:48,228
<i>He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.</i>

997
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:52,712
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

998
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:58,390
<i>I haven't always been there for you,
have I?</i>

999
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:03,152
<i>You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.</i>

1000
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:05,072
<i>That's no excuse.</i>

1001
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:07,757
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

1002
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,956
<i>I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.</i>

1003
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:16,237
<i>I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.</i>

1004
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,518
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

1005
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,113
<i>Wake up.</i>

1006
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:35,912
<i>Go home, dear.</i>

1007
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:37,394
<i>You look awful.</i>

1008
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,795
<i>- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.</i>

1009
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,157
<i>- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.</i>

1010
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:45,913
<i>- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.</i>

1011
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:51,393
<i>College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.</i>

1012
01:33:52,119 --> 01:33:53,792
<i>A smile. Finally.</i>

1013
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,112
<i>Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.</i>

1014
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:00,475
<i>You were supposed to be asleep.</i>

1015
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:05,831
<i>You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.</i>

1016
01:34:06,039 --> 01:34:09,873
<i>When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...</i>

1017
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:16,076
<i>...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"</i>

1018
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:19,670
<i>- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.</i>

1019
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,878
<i>Well, Harry's in love with her.</i>

1020
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:28,675
<i>- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?</i>

1021
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,270
<i>- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.</i>

1022
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:36,471
<i>You're so mysterious all the time.</i>

1023
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,359
<i>Tell me, would it be so dangerous...</i>

1024
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:43,347
<i>...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?</i>

1025
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,109
<i>Everybody else knows.</i>

1026
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,148
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

1027
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,068
<i>But...</i>

1028
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,030
<i>Come on, pick up.</i>

1029
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:04,350
<i>- Hey M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1030
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:07,315
<i>M.J., it's Peter. You there?</i>

1031
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,319
<i>Hello? You there?</i>

1032
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,112
<i>I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?</i>

1033
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:16,632
<i>All right, well...</i>

1034
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:18,029
<i>Don't...</i>

1035
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,916
<i>Don't go up any dark alleys.</i>

1036
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:22,552
<i>Hello?</i>

1037
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,429
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

1038
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,311
<i>Where is she?</i>

1039
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,271
<i>- What is that?
- That's cool!</i>

1040
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:20,917
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout</i>

1041
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:25,073
<i>Down came the goblin
And took the spider out</i>

1042
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,872
<i>Goblin, what have you done?</i>

1043
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,309
<i>Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.</i>

1044
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,271
<i>Because you never know...</i>

1045
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:33,990
<i>...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:</i>

1046
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:37,594
<i>Let die the woman you love...</i>

1047
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:46,588
<i>...or suffer the little children.</i>

1048
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,269
<i>- Spider-Man!
- Save us!</i>

1049
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,954
<i>Save us!</i>

1050
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,707
<i>Make your choice, Spider-Man...</i>

1051
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,150
<i>...and see how a hero is rewarded.</i>

1052
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:02,310
<i>Don't do it, Goblin!</i>

1053
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:05,278
<i>We are who we choose to be.</i>

1054
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,158
<i>- Now, choose!
- No!</i>

1055
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,193
<i>Everybody stay still!</i>

1056
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:47,547
<i>Ahoy up there!</i>

1057
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,552
<i>We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.</i>

1058
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,719
<i>- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.</i>

1059
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,313
<i>- I can't.
- Yes, you can!</i>

1060
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:11,112
<i>M.J., you can do it. You have to.</i>

1061
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,792
<i>Trust me.</i>

1062
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:17,914
<i>Hold on tight and go quickly.</i>

1063
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:24,036
<i>- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.</i>

1064
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,832
<i>Hang on, Mary Jane!</i>

1065
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,634
<i>- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!</i>

1066
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:08,192
<i>It's time to die.</i>

1067
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,595
<i>- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!</i>

1068
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,036
<i>Leave Spider-Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?</i>

1069
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:26,036
<i>You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!</i>

1070
01:40:26,199 --> 01:40:29,590
<i>You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!</i>

1071
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,318
<i>Spider-Man, watch out!</i>

1072
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:17,953
<i>Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.</i>

1073
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,354
<i>I offered you friendship...</i>

1074
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,317
<i>...and you spat in my face.</i>

1075
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:15,835
<i>You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.</i>

1076
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,197
<i>Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...</i>

1077
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:20,952
<i>...would have been quick.</i>

1078
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:24,395
<i>But now that you've really
pissed me off...</i>

1079
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:29,315
<i>...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.</i>

1080
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,676
<i>M.J. and I...</i>

1081
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:39,631
<i>...we're gonna have a hell of a time.</i>

1082
01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:32,719
<i>Peter, stop!</i>

1083
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,234
<i>Stop! It's me.</i>

1084
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,273
<i>Mr. Osborn.</i>

1085
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:46,918
<i>Thank God for you.</i>

1086
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,350
<i>You killed those people
on that balcony.</i>

1087
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,431
<i>The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!</i>

1088
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,271
<i>Don't let him take me again.</i>

1089
01:43:54,439 --> 01:43:56,395
<i>I beg you. Protect me.</i>

1090
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,996
<i>You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.</i>

1091
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:01,592
<i>But not you.</i>

1092
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:06,028
<i>I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.</i>

1093
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,230
<i>I would never hurt you.</i>

1094
01:44:08,439 --> 01:44:10,270
<i>I knew from the beginning...</i>

1095
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:13,278
<i>...if anything ever happened to me...</i>

1096
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:15,475
<i>...it was you I could count on.</i>

1097
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:18,871
<i>You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.</i>

1098
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:21,192
<i>Thank God for you.</i>

1099
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,512
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

1100
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,916
<i>Believe in me
as I believed in you.</i>

1101
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:31,953
<i>I've been like a father to you.</i>

1102
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:35,032
<i>Be a son to me now.</i>

1103
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,556
<i>I have a father.</i>

1104
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:41,668
<i>His name was Ben Parker.</i>

1105
01:44:43,479 --> 01:44:44,878
<i>Godspeed, Spider-Man.</i>

1106
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:04,472
<i>Peter.</i>

1107
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,471
<i>Don't tell Harry.</i>

1108
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,518
<i>What have you done?</i>

1109
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,193
<i>What have you done?!</i>

1110
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:11,155
<i>I'm so sorry, Harry.</i>

1111
01:46:12,039 --> 01:46:15,032
<i>I know what it's like
to lose a father.</i>

1112
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:20,270
<i>I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.</i>

1113
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,994
<i>One day Spider-Man will pay.</i>

1114
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,792
<i>I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.</i>

1115
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,351
<i>Thank God for you, Peter.</i>

1116
01:46:36,039 --> 01:46:38,395
<i>You're the only family I have.</i>

1117
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,114
<i>No matter what I do...</i>

1118
01:47:04,279 --> 01:47:07,271
<i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>

1119
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,515
<i>...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1120
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,029
<i>You must miss him so much.</i>

1121
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,872
<i>It's been so hard without him.</i>

1122
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,432
<i>There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.</i>

1123
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:36,877
<i>When I was up there...</i>

1124
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,273
<i>...and I thought I was gonna die...</i>

1125
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,515
<i>...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.</i>

1126
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,832
<i>And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.</i>

1127
01:47:51,239 --> 01:47:53,548
<i>It was you, Pete.</i>

1128
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:56,197
<i>I kept thinking:</i>

1129
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,273
<i>"I hope I make it through this...</i>

1130
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:04,877
<i>...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time. "</i>

1131
01:48:06,199 --> 01:48:07,632
<i>Really?</i>

1132
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,551
<i>There's only one man
who's always been there for me...</i>

1133
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,636
<i>...who makes me feel...</i>

1134
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:20,628
<i>...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.</i>

1135
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,271
<i>That I'm just...</i>

1136
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,353
<i>...me.</i>

1137
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:29,230
<i>And that's okay.</i>

1138
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:32,759
<i>The truth is...</i>

1139
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,518
<i>...I love you.</i>

1140
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,390
<i>I love you so much, Peter.</i>

1141
01:49:00,279 --> 01:49:04,831
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1142
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,831
<i>I can't...</i>

1143
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,359
<i>You can't what?</i>

1144
01:49:11,439 --> 01:49:12,838
<i>Tell you...</i>

1145
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:18,631
<i>...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.</i>

1146
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:23,434
<i>Yeah. There's so much to tell.</i>

1147
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:26,197
<i>I want you to know...</i>

1148
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:29,159
<i>...that I will always be there
for you.</i>

1149
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,148
<i>I will always be there
to take care of you.</i>

1150
01:49:34,119 --> 01:49:36,030
<i>I promise you that.</i>

1151
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:41,395
<i>I will always be your friend.</i>

1152
01:49:44,199 --> 01:49:45,997
<i>Only a friend...</i>

1153
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,319
<i>...Peter Parker?</i>

1154
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:53,118
<i>That's all I have to give.</i>

1155
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:20,960
<i>Whatever life holds in store for me...</i>

1156
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,872
<i>...I will never forget these words:</i>

1157
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:28,914
<i>"With great power
