1
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:32,374
The Tesseract has awakened.

2
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,039
It is on a little
world, a human world.

3
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:42,130
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:48,140
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,762
He is ready to lead

6
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:58,401
and our force, our
Chitauri, will follow.

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,445
A world will be his.

8
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:05,733
The universe, yours.

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:11,531
And the humans, what
can they do but burn?

10
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,174
All personnel,

11
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,597
the evacuation order
has been confirmed.

12
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,000
Proceed to your designated vehicles
immediately for forced evacuation

13
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,500
This is not a drill

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,998
Emergency personnel

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,498
Proceed to your designated
vehicles for on site evacuation

16
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,001
How bad is it?

17
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,293
That's the problem, sir.
We don't know.

18
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,971
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

19
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,973
NASA didn't authorize
Selvig to go to test phase.

20
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,388
He wasn't testing it. He
wasn't even in the room.

21
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,555
Spontaneous event.

22
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,639
It just turned itself on?

23
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,149
Where are the energy levels now?

24
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,526
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

25
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,731
How long to get everyone out?

26
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,479
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

27
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,943
Do better.

28
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,859
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

29
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,277
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,864
If we can't control the
Tesseract's energy,

31
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,408
there may not be a
minimum safe distance.

32
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,582
I need you to make sure

33
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,377
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

34
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,587
Sir, is that really a
priority right now?

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,497
Until such time as
the world ends,

36
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,457
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

37
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,006
Clear out the tech below.

38
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,263
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

39
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,843
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,427
With me.

41
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,427
Talk to me, Doctor.

42
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,852
Director.

43
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,733
Is there anything we
know for certain?

44
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,145
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,155
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

46
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:12,658
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

47
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,115
I assume you pulled the plug.

48
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,995
She's an energy source.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,370
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

50
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,574
If she reaches peak level..

51
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,211
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

52
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,793
But we don't have the harness.

53
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,963
My calculations are
far from complete.

54
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,301
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,927
Nothing harmful, low
levels of gamma radiation.

56
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,680
That can be harmful.

57
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,599
Where's Agent Barton?

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,473
The Hawk?

59
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,974
Up in his nest, as usual.

60
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,649
Agent Barton, report.

61
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:46,692
I gave you this detail

62
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,360
so you could keep a
close eye on things.

63
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,984
Well, I see better
from a distance.

64
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,865
Have you seen anything that
might set this thing off?

65
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,742
Doctor, it's spiking again.

66
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,323
No one's come or gone.

67
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,158
And Selvig's clean.

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,493
No contacts, no IMs.

69
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,709
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

70
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,205
"At this end"?

71
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,295
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

72
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,294
Doors open from both sides.

73
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,506
Not yet.

74
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,454
Sir, please put down the spear.

75
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,829
You have heart.

76
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,149
Please don't.

77
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,908
I still need that.

78
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,821
This doesn't have
to get any messier.

79
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,079
Of course it does.

80
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,040
I've come too far
for anything else.

81
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,836
I am Loki, of Asgard

82
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,165
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

83
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,834
Loki.

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,627
Brother of Thor.

85
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,966
We have no quarrel
with your people.

86
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,137
An ant has no quarrel
with a boot.

87
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,509
Are you planning to step on us?

88
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,105
I come with glad tidings

89
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,021
of a world made free.

90
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,608
Free from what?

91
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,939
Freedom.

92
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,064
Freedom is life's great lie.

93
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,776
Once you accept that,
in your heart,

94
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,081
you will know peace.

95
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,119
Yeah, you say "peace,"

96
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,207
I kind of think you
mean the other thing.

97
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,874
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,461
This place is about to blow

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,963
and drop a hundred
feet of rock on us.

100
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,720
He means to bury us.

101
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,050
Like the pharaohs of old.

102
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,302
He's right. The portal is
collapsing in on itself.

103
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,560
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

104
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:49,886
Well, then.

105
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,744
I need these vehicles.

106
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,913
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

107
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,500
Hill!

108
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,622
Do you copy?

109
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,129
Barton has turned.

110
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,941
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

111
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,683
Okay, let's go. No, leave it.
Go!

112
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,198
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

113
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,668
Director?

114
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,427
Director Fury, do you copy?

115
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,096
The Tesseract is with
a hostile force.

116
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,427
I have men down. Hill?

117
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,014
A lot of men still under.

118
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,928
I don't know how many survivors.

119
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,312
Sound a general call.

120
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,018
I want every living
soul not working rescue

121
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,099
looking for that briefcase.

122
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,274
Roger that.

123
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,812
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

124
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,697
As of right now,

125
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,158
we are at war.

126
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,452
What do we do?

127
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,777
This is not how I wanted
this evening to go.

128
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,658
I know how you wanted
this evening to go.

129
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,863
Believe me

130
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,994
this is better.

131
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,875
Who are you working for?

132
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,831
Lermentov, yes?

133
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,456
Does he think

134
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,337
we have to go through him

135
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,335
to move our cargo?

136
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,386
I thought General Solohob is in
charge of the export business.

137
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,759
Solohob

138
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,013
a bagman, a front.

139
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,644
Your outdated information
betrays you.

140
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,815
The famous Black Widow

141
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,821
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

142
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,870
You really think I'm pretty?

143
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,833
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

144
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,710
to move the tanks.

145
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,299
Tell him he is out.

146
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,344
Well..

147
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,802
you may have
to write it down.

148
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,395
It's for her.

149
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,158
You listen carefully

150
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,532
You're at 1-14 Silensky
Plaza, 3rd floor.

151
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,038
We have an F-22 exactly
eight miles out.

152
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,991
Put the woman on the phone
or I will blow up the block

153
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,168
before you can make the lobby.

154
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,923
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding'? I'm working.

155
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,258
This takes precedence.

156
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm in the middle of
an interrogation.

157
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,008
This moron is giving
me everything.

158
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,061
I don't give everything.

159
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:07,889
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

160
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:08,972
Natasha..

161
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,067
Barton's been compromised.

162
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,315
Let me put you on hold.

163
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,024
Where is Barton now?

164
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,488
- We don't know.
- But he's alive?

165
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,528
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

166
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,998
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

167
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,333
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.

168
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,667
I've got Stark. You
get the big guy.

169
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,688
Who are you?

170
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:41,315
Get out!

171
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,947
There is sickness here!

172
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,027
You're a doctor.

173
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,080
My father's not waking up!

174
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,783
He has a fever and he's moaning

175
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,038
but his eyes won't open.

176
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,118
Slow down.

177
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,662
My father..

178
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,331
Like them?

179
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,633
Please.

180
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,125
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

181
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,626
You know, for a man

182
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:35,999
who's supposed to
be avoiding stress

183
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,253
you picked a hell of
a place to settle.

184
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,336
Avoiding stress
isn't the secret.

185
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,755
Then what is it? Yoga?

186
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,518
You brought me to the
edge of the city. Smart.

187
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,148
I assume the whole
place is surrounded.

188
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,977
Just you and me.

189
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,278
And your actress buddy?

190
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,187
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

191
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:04,109
I did.

192
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:05,365
Who are you?

193
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,442
Natasha Romanoff.

194
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,364
Are you here to kill
me, Ms. Romanoff?

195
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,125
Because that's not going
to work out for everyone.

196
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,623
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

197
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,039
S.H.I.E.L.D.

198
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
How did they find me?

199
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,547
We never lost you, Doctor.

200
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,090
We've kept our distance.

201
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,887
Even helped keep some
other interested parties

202
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,089
off your scent.

203
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,721
Why?

204
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,222
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

205
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,729
But now we need you to come in.

206
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,598
What if I say no?

207
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,025
I'll persuade you.

208
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,691
And what if the
other guy says no?

209
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,030
You've been more than a
year without an incident.

210
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,490
I don't think you want
to break that streak.

211
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,663
Well, I don't every
time get what I want.

212
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,627
Doctor, we're facing a
potential global catastrophe.

213
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,584
Well, those I actively
try to avoid.

214
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:06,259
This

215
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,547
is the Tesseract.

216
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,515
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

217
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:16,511
What does Fury want
me to do, swallow it?

218
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,266
He wants you to find it.
It's been taken.

219
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,528
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

220
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,656
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

221
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,317
If there was, that's
where I'd be.

222
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:33,161
So, Fury isn't
after the monster?

223
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,867
Not that he's told me.

224
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,250
And he tells you everything?

225
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,493
Talk to Fury. He
needs you on this.

226
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,749
He needs me in a cage?

227
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:41,795
No one's going to
put you in a..

228
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,712
Stop lying to me!

229
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,590
I'm sorry. That was mean.

230
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,722
I just wanted to
see what you'd do.

231
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,886
Why don't we do
this the easy way

232
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,349
where you don't use that

233
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:02,232
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

234
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,567
Okay?

235
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,895
Natasha?

236
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,617
Stand down.

237
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,121
We're good here.

238
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,250
"Just you and me."

239
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,247
This is out of line, Director.

240
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,882
You're dealing with
forces you can't control.

241
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,752
You ever been in a war, Councilman?
In a firefight?

242
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,763
Did you feel an
overabundance of control?

243
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,347
You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?

244
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:40,099
Not Asgard. Loki.

245
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:43,105
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?

246
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,273
His brother.

247
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,317
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

248
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,603
but he's worlds away.

249
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,613
We can't depend on
him to help, either.

250
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,690
It's up to us.

251
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,447
Which is why you should
be focusing on Phase 2.

252
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:54,780
It was designed for
exactly this..

253
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,954
Phase 2 isn't ready.
Our enemy is.

254
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,124
We need a response team.

255
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:02,454
The Avengers Initiative
was shut down.

256
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,461
This isn't about the Avengers.

257
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,959
We've seen the list.

258
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,375
You're running the world's
greatest covert security network

259
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,130
and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race

260
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,548
to a handful of freaks.

261
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,595
I'm not leaving
anything to anyone.

262
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,676
We need a response team.

263
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,968
These people may be
isolated, unbalanced even

264
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:23,230
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

265
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:24,973
You believe?

266
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,486
War isn't won by
sentiment, Director.

267
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,819
No, it's won by soldiers.

268
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,798
There's not enough time.

269
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,674
I got to put her in the water!

270
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,018
You won't be alone.

271
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,020
Oh, my God.

272
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:05,855
This guy is still alive!

273
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,628
Trouble sleeping?

274
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,386
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

275
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,805
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

276
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,769
When I went under, the
world was at war.

277
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,481
I wake up, they say we won.

278
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,730
They didn't say what we lost.

279
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,700
We've made some
mistakes along the way.

280
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,736
Some, very recently.

281
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:02,821
Are you here with
a mission, sir?

282
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,951
I am.

283
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,452
Trying to get me
back in the world?

284
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,622
Trying to save it.

285
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,587
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

286
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,548
Howard Stark fished
that out of the ocean

287
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,798
when he was looking for you.

288
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,971
He thought what we think.

289
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,394
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

290
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:28,730
That's something the
world sorely needs.

291
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:31,691
Who took it from you?

292
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,318
He's called Loki.

293
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,775
He's not from around here.

294
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,699
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

295
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:40,026
if you're in.

296
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,661
The world has gotten
even stranger

297
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,903
than you already know.

298
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,999
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

299
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,288
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

300
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,709
There's a debriefing packet

301
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,211
waiting for you back
at your apartment.

302
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,344
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

303
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:00,845
that we ought to know now?

304
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,473
You should have left
it in the ocean.

305
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,044
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

306
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,586
You disconnected the
transmission lines?

307
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,760
Are we off the grid?

308
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:44,009
Stark Tower is about
to become a beacon

309
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,473
of self-sustaining clean energy.

310
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,809
Well, assuming the arc
reactor takes over

311
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,182
and it actually works.

312
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,813
I assume.

313
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,013
Light her up.

314
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,854
How does it look?

315
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,694
Like Christmas,
but with more me.

316
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,483
We've got to go wider on the
public awareness campaign.

317
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,659
You need to do some press.

318
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,326
I'm in DC tomorrow,

319
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,904
I'm working on the zoning for
the next three buildings.

320
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,207
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

321
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,866
Enjoy the moment.

322
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,951
Get in here and I will.

323
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,461
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D.
is on the line.

324
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,047
I'm not in.

325
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,046
I'm actually out.

326
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:32,895
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

327
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,523
Grow a spine, Jarvis.
I got a date.

328
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,316
Levels are holding
steady, I think.

329
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,701
Of course they are. I
was directly involved.

330
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:47,076
Which brings me to
my next question.

331
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:49,241
How does it feel to be a genius?

332
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,657
Well, I really wouldn't
know, now would I?

333
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:56,375
What do you mean? All
this came from you.

334
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,915
No, all this came from that.

335
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,501
Give yourself some credit.
Please.

336
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,719
Stark Tower is your baby.

337
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:07,006
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

338
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,632
12%?

339
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,973
An argument can be made for 15.

340
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,852
12%? My baby?

341
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,683
Well, I did do all
the heavy lifting.

342
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:15,263
Literally, I lifted
the heavy things.

343
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,192
And, sorry, but the
security snafu?

344
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,769
That was on you.

345
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,819
- My private elevator..
- You mean our elevator?

346
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,865
It was teeming
with sweaty workmen.

347
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,446
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

348
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,236
in some subtle way
later, aren't I?

349
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,284
It's not going to
be that subtle.

350
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,743
I'll tell you what.

351
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:35,203
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

352
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,748
On the lease.

353
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,042
Call your mom. Can
you bunk over?

354
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,501
Sir, the telephone.

355
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,134
I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.

356
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,010
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

357
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,673
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

358
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:50,965
- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.

359
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,097
Then leave it urgently.

360
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:55,807
Security breach. It's on you.

361
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,598
- Mr. Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

362
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,682
"Phil"?

363
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:00,855
I can't stay.

364
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,436
His first name is "Agent."

365
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,192
Come on in. We're celebrating.

366
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,114
Which is why he can't stay.

367
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,483
We need you to look this
over as soon as possible.

368
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,696
I don't like being
handed things.

369
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,156
That's fine, because I
love to be handed things.

370
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,696
So, let's trade.

371
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,786
Thank you.

372
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,044
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

373
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:20,119
every other Thursday.

374
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,497
This isn't a consultation.

375
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,672
Is this about the Avengers?

376
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,171
Which I know nothing about.

377
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,883
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

378
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,297
And I didn't even qualify.

379
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:30,380
I didn't know that either.

380
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,721
Apparently I'm volatile,
self-obsessed,

381
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,926
don't play well with others.

382
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,391
That I did know.

383
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,188
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

384
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,685
Whatever. Ms. Potts,
got a second?

385
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:41,849
Half a mo.

386
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,278
You know, I thought we
were having a moment.

387
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,988
I was having 12% of a moment.

388
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,947
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

389
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,115
How would you know if it's..
Why is he "Phil"?

390
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,079
What is all this?

391
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,869
This is

392
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,496
this.

393
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,962
I'm going to take the
jet to DC tonight.

394
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,172
Tomorrow.

395
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,724
You have homework. You
have a lot of homework.

396
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,768
Well, what if I didn't?

397
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,762
- If you didn't?
- Yeah.

398
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,147
You mean when you've finished?

399
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,523
Well, then..

400
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,737
Square deal. Fly safe.

401
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,367
Work hard.

402
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,998
So, any chance you're
driving by LaGuardia?

403
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,960
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

404
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,085
I want to hear

405
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,916
about the cellist. Is
that still a thing?

406
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,258
She moved back to Portland.

407
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,136
What? Boo!

408
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,022
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

409
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,405
So, this Dr. Banner was trying to
replicate the serum they used on me?

410
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,156
A lot of people were.

411
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,784
You were the world's
first superhero.

412
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,450
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

413
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,780
Erskine's original formula.

414
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,083
Didn't really go
his way, did it?

415
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,201
Not so much.

416
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,961
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

417
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,462
He's like a smart person.

418
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,885
I gotta say.

419
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,472
It's an honour to
meet you officially.

420
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:39,142
I've sort of met you. I mean,

421
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,810
I watched you while
you were sleeping.

422
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,144
I mean, I was present

423
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,644
while you were unconscious
from the ice.

424
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,113
You know, it's really
just a huge honour

425
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,940
to have you on board this..

426
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:55,445
I hope I'm the man for the job.

427
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,532
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

428
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,664
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

429
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,325
I had a little design input.

430
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,743
The uniform?

431
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,496
Aren't the stars and
stripes a little

432
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,835
old-fashioned?

433
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,759
With everything that's happening

434
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,507
and the things that are
about to come to light,

435
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:18,965
people might just need a
little old-fashioned.

436
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,711
The Chitauri grow restless.

437
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,627
Let them gird themselves.

438
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,384
I will lead them in
the glorious battle.

439
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,555
Battle?

440
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,803
Against the meagre
might of Earth?

441
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,847
Glorious, not lengthy.

442
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,894
If your force is as
formidable as you claim.

443
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:13,311
You question us?

444
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,902
You question him,

445
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,526
he who put the scepter
in your hand?

446
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,411
Who gave you ancient
knowledge and new purpose

447
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,826
when you were cast
out, defeated?

448
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,828
I was a king!

449
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,244
The rightful king of Asgard,

450
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,415
betrayed.

451
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,920
Your ambition is little

452
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,751
and born of childish need.

453
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,217
We look beyond the Earth

454
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:42,132
to the greater worlds the
Tesseract will unveil.

455
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,093
You don't have the
Tesseract yet.

456
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:47,804
I don't threaten.

457
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,192
But until I open the doors,

458
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,026
until your force is
mine to command,

459
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,573
you are but words.

460
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,737
You will have your
war, Asgardian.

461
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,536
If you fail,

462
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,961
if the Tesseract
is kept from us,

463
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,500
there will be no
realm, no barren moon,

464
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:20,010
no crevice where he
cannot find you.

465
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,345
You think you know pain?

466
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:29,934
He will make you long for
something sweet as pain.

467
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,468
Stow the captain's gear.

468
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,590
Yes, sir.

469
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,261
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

470
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,768
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

471
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:08,926
They need you on the bridge.

472
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,557
They're starting the face-trace.

473
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,846
See you there.

474
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,436
It was quite the buzz around
here, finding you in the ice.

475
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,605
I thought Coulson
was gonna swoon.

476
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,695
Did he ask you to sign his Captain
America trading cards yet?

477
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,111
Trading cards?

478
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,278
They're vintage.
He's very proud.

479
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,539
Dr. Banner.

480
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,542
Yeah, hi.

481
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,287
They told me you
would be coming.

482
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:36,712
Word is, you can find the Cube.

483
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,673
Is that the only word on me?

484
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,258
Only word I care about.

485
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,472
It must be strange for
you, all of this.

486
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,976
Well, this is actually
kind of familiar.

487
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,724
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

488
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,894
It's going to get a
little hard to breathe.

489
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,396
Flight crew, secure the deck.

490
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,775
Is this a submarine?

491
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,317
Really?

492
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,247
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container'?

493
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:38,642
No, no, this is much worse.

494
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,516
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

495
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,802
Increase collective to 8.0 %.

496
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,525
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

497
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,144
Increase output to capacity.

498
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,443
Power plant performing
at capacity.

499
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,152
We are clear.

500
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,817
All engines operating.

501
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:33,659
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

502
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:36,490
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

503
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,826
Let's vanish.

504
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,166
Engage retro-reflection panels.

505
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,228
Reflection panels engaged.

506
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,393
Gentlemen.

507
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:12,530
Doctor, thank you for coming.

508
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,739
Thanks for asking nicely.

509
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,375
So, how long am I staying?

510
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,335
Once we get our hands
on the Tesseract,

511
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,663
you're in the wind.

512
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,623
Where are you with that?

513
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,548
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

514
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,626
camera on the planet.

515
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,211
Cell phones, laptops..

516
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,052
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

517
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,429
That's still not gonna
find them in time.

518
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:36,599
You have to narrow your field.

519
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,766
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

520
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:40,893
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

521
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,807
Tell them to put the
spectrometers on the roof

522
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,233
and calibrate them
for gamma rays.

523
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,521
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

524
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:50,280
At least we could rule
out a few places.

525
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,567
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

526
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,947
Agent Romanoff,

527
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,155
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

528
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,494
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

529
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,083
Put it over there.

530
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,168
Where did you find
all these people?

531
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,175
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

532
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,922
Is this the stuff you need?

533
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,086
Yeah, iridium.

534
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,844
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

535
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,679
It's very hard to get hold of.

536
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,559
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

537
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,056
Well, I didn't know.

538
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,429
Hey!

539
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,724
The Tesseract has
shown me so much.

540
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,192
It's more than knowledge.
It's truth.

541
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,268
I know.

542
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,903
What did it show
you, Agent Barton?

543
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,449
My next target.

544
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,525
Tell me what you need.

545
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,072
I need a distraction.

546
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,291
And an eyeball.

547
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,545
I mean, if it's not
too much trouble.

548
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,717
No, no. It's fine.

549
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,635
It's a vintage set.

550
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,096
It took me a couple of
years to collect them all.

551
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:02,728
Near mint.

552
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,309
Slight foxing around
the edges, but..

553
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,894
We got a hit. A 67% match.

554
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,940
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

555
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,311
Location?

556
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,489
Stuttgart, Germany.
28 Konigstrasse.

557
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:15,820
He's not exactly hiding.

558
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,992
Captain,

559
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,485
You're up

560
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,271
Kneel before me.

561
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,032
I said

562
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,989
kneel!

563
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:17,961
Is not this simpler?

564
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,719
Is this not your natural state?

565
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,226
It's the unspoken
truth of humanity,

566
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,806
that you crave subjugation.

567
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,146
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

568
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,777
in a mad scramble for power,

569
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,197
for identity.

570
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,199
You were made to be ruled.

571
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,112
In the end,

572
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,657
you will always kneel.

573
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,048
Not to men like you.

574
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,007
There are no men like me.

575
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,840
There are always men like you.

576
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,884
Look to your elder, people.

577
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:13,599
Let him be an example.

578
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,155
You know, the last
time I was in Germany,

579
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:26,568
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

580
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,235
we ended up disagreeing.

581
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,076
The soldier.

582
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,536
The man out of time.

583
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:35,251
I'm not the one
who's out of time.

584
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,253
Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.

585
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,521
Kneel.

586
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:04,820
Not today!

587
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,157
The guy's all over the place.

588
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,036
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

589
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,092
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

590
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,309
Good move.

591
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,362
Mr. Stark.

592
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,197
Captain.

593
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:56,036
Is he saying anything?

594
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,199
Not a word.

595
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,585
Just get him here.
We're low on time.

596
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,581
I don't like it.

597
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,000
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

598
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,842
I don't remember it
being that easy.

599
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:09,594
This guy packs a wallop.

600
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,384
Still, you are pretty
spry for an older fellow.

601
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,929
What's your thing, Pilates?

602
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,010
What?

603
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,266
It's like calisthenics.

604
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,347
You might have missed
a couple of things

605
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,103
doing time as a Capsicle.

606
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,853
Fury didn't tell me he
was calling you in.

607
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,739
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

608
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,733
Where's this coming from?

609
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,286
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

610
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:40,041
I'm not overly fond
of what follows.

611
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,061
What are you doing?

612
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,659
And now there's that guy.

613
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,615
Another Asgardian?

614
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:17,655
- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

615
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,449
If he frees Loki or kills
him, the Tesseract's lost.

616
00:44:20,615 --> 00:44:22,367
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

617
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,829
I have a plan. Attack.

618
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,677
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

619
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,009
I don't see how I can.

620
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,675
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

621
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,601
There's only one God, ma'am.

622
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:41,099
And I'm pretty sure he
doesn't dress like that.

623
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,778
Where is the Tesseract?

624
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,454
I missed you, too.

625
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,119
Do I look to be
in a gaming mood?

626
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,117
You should thank me.

627
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,954
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

628
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,873
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

629
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,211
to your precious Earth?

630
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,721
I thought you dead.

631
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,766
Did you mourn?

632
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,969
We all did. Our father..

633
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,188
Your father.

634
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,186
He did tell you my true
parentage, did he not?

635
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:33,985
We were raised together.

636
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,822
We played together,
we fought together.

637
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,534
Do you remember none of that?

638
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:40,695
I remember a shadow.

639
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:44,875
Living in the shade
of your greatness.

640
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,583
I remember you tossing
me into an abyss.

641
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,710
I, who was, and should be, king!

642
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:53,007
So you take the world I
love as a recompense

643
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,007
for your imagined slights?

644
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:58,264
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

645
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,974
And you're doing a
marvelous job with that.

646
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,726
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

647
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,648
while you idly fret.

648
00:46:07,722 --> 00:46:09,942
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

649
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,398
You think yourself above them?

650
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,771
Well, yes.

651
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,440
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

652
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,362
A throne would suit you ill.

653
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,367
I've seen worlds you've
never known about!

654
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,831
I have grown,
Odinson, in my exile.

655
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,373
I have seen the true
power of the Tesseract,

656
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,632
and when I wield it..

657
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,552
Who showed you this power?

658
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,967
Who controls the would-be king?

659
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,056
- I am a king!
- Not here!

660
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,512
You give up the Tesseract!

661
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,219
You give up this
poisonous dream!

662
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,056
You come home.

663
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,150
I don't have it.

664
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:59,362
You need the Cube
to bring me home.

665
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,443
But I've sent it off,
I know not where.

666
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:04,701
You listen well, brother.

667
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,536
I'm listening.

668
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,385
Do not touch me again.

669
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,179
Then don't take my stuff.

670
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:22,597
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

671
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,467
Shakespeare in the Park?

672
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,101
Doth Mother know you
wear-eth her drapes?

673
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,271
This is beyond you, metal man.

674
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,231
Loki will face
Asgardian justice.

675
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,148
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
Until then,

676
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,525
stay out of the way.

677
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,911
Tourist.

678
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:50,208
Okay.

679
00:48:20,146 --> 00:48:23,150
Power at 400% capacity.

680
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,568
How about that?

681
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,217
Hey!

682
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,179
That's enough.

683
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,518
Now, I don't know what
you plan on doing here.

684
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,146
I've come here to put an
end to Loki's schemes.

685
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:40,693
Then prove it. Put
that hammer down.

686
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:41,769
Yeah.. No.

687
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,489
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

688
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:47,400
You want me to put
the hammer down?

689
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:16,688
Are we done, here?

690
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,523
In case it's unclear,

691
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,032
if you try to escape,

692
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,204
if you so much as
scratch that glass,

693
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,717
it's 30,000 feet straight
down in a steel trap.

694
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,673
You get how that works?

695
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,346
Ant, boot.

696
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:39,182
It's an impressive cage.

697
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,684
Not built, I think, for me.

698
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,190
Built for something a
lot stronger than you.

699
00:51:45,893 --> 00:51:47,862
Oh, I've heard.

700
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:49,739
A mindless beast.

701
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,360
Makes play he's still a man.

702
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,947
How desperate are you,

703
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,242
that you call on such lost
creatures to defend you?

704
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,536
How desperate am I?

705
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,829
You threaten my world with war.

706
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,168
You steal a force you
can't hope to control.

707
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:10,177
You talk about peace, and
you kill because it's fun.

708
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,385
You have made me very desperate.

709
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,298
You might not be
glad that you did.

710
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,063
It burns you to
have come so close.

711
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,900
To have the Tesseract,
to have power,

712
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:29,233
unlimited power.

713
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,398
And for what?

714
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,612
A warm light for all
mankind to share.

715
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,199
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

716
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,507
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

717
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,467
He really grows on
you, doesn't he?

718
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,599
Loki's gonna drag this out.

719
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,264
So, Thor, what's his play?

720
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,059
He has an army
called the Chitauri.

721
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,150
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

722
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:12,690
He means to lead them
against your people.

723
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,483
They will win him the Earth,

724
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:16,409
in return, I suspect,
for the Tesseract.

725
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,320
An army

726
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,239
from outer space.

727
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,829
So, he's building
another portal.

728
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,288
That's what he needs
Erik Selvig for.

729
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,369
Selvig?

730
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,041
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

731
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,378
Loki has him under
some kind of spell,

732
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:32,003
along with one of ours.

733
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,840
I want to know why
Loki let us take him.

734
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:35,262
He's not leading
an army from here.

735
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,139
I don't think we should
be focusing on Loki.

736
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,173
That guy's brain is
a bag full of cats.

737
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,510
You could smell crazy on him.

738
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,431
Have care how you speak.

739
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,976
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

740
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,597
And he is my brother.

741
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:48,688
He killed 80 people in two days.

742
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,643
He's adopted.

743
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,197
I think it's about
the mechanics.

744
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,356
Iridium.. What do they
need the iridium for?

745
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:56,483
It's a stabilizing agent.

746
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,034
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

747
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,699
I'll fly you to Portland.

748
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,489
Keep love alive.

749
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,577
It means the portal won't
collapse on itself

750
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,579
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

751
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,043
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

752
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,501
Also, it means the
portal can open as wide

753
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:14,168
and stay open as
long, as Loki wants.

754
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,836
Raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

755
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,764
That man is playing Galaga.

756
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:24,387
He thought we wouldn't
notice, but we did.

757
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,556
How does Fury even see these?

758
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,686
He turns.

759
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,856
Sounds exhausting.

760
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,103
The rest of the raw materials,

761
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,068
Agent Barton can get his
hands on pretty easily.

762
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,699
The only major component
he still needs

763
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:41,362
is a power source of
high-energy density.

764
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:44,657
Something to
kick-start the Cube.

765
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,751
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

766
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,918
Last night.

767
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:52,922
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

768
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,128
Am I the only one who
did the reading?

769
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,090
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

770
00:54:57,251 --> 00:55:00,050
He would have to heat the
Cube to 120-million Kelvin

771
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,715
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

772
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,135
Unless Selvig has figured
out how to stabilize

773
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,427
the quantum tunneling effect.

774
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:06,811
Well, if he could do that,

775
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,356
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

776
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,900
Finally, someone who
speaks English.

777
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,936
Is that what just happened?

778
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,275
It's good to meet
you, Dr. Banner.

779
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,567
Your work on anti electron
collisions is unparalleled.

780
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,576
And I'm a huge fan of the
way you lose control

781
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,612
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

782
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,414
Thanks.

783
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:29,076
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

784
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,585
I was hoping you might join him.

785
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,744
I would start with
that stick of his.

786
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,045
It may be magical,

787
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,588
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

788
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,588
I don't know about that, but
it is powered by the Cube.

789
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,711
And I would like to
know how Loki used it

790
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,592
to turn two of the
sharpest men I know

791
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,423
into his personal
flying monkeys.

792
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,300
Monkeys? I do not understand.

793
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,393
I do.

794
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,097
I understood that reference.

795
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,643
Shall we play, Doctor?

796
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,436
This way, sir.

797
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,126
The gamma readings are
definitely consistent

798
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,083
with Selvig's reports
of the Tesseract.

799
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,376
But it's going to take
weeks to process.

800
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,791
If we bypass their mainframe

801
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,170
and direct route to
the Homer cluster,

802
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,461
we can clock this at
around 600 teraflops.

803
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:24,630
All I packed was a toothbrush.

804
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,304
You know, you should come
by Stark Tower sometime.

805
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,469
Top ten floors, all R&D.

806
00:56:29,802 --> 00:56:31,304
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

807
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,065
Thanks, but the last
time I was in New York,

808
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,818
I kind of broke Harlem.

809
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,820
Well, I promise a
stress-free environment.

810
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,822
No tension, no surprises.

811
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,737
- Hey!
- Nothing?

812
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,905
Are you nuts?

813
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:45,985
Jury's out.

814
00:56:46,193 --> 00:56:47,411
You really have got a
lid on it, haven't you?

815
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,487
What's your secret?

816
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,081
Mellow jazz, bongo
drums, huge bag of weed?

817
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,157
Is everything a joke to you?

818
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,617
Funny things are.

819
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,577
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

820
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,958
isn't funny.

821
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,039
No of fence, Doc.

822
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:58,748
It's all right, I
wouldn't have come aboard

823
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,710
if I couldn't handle
pointy things.

824
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,170
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

825
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:06,222
And you need to focus on
the problem, Mr. Stark.

826
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,675
Do you think I'm not?

827
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,768
Why did Fury call us in? Why now?
Why not before?

828
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,561
What isn't he telling us?

829
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,184
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

830
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,148
You think Fury's
hiding something?

831
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,648
He's a spy. Captain,
he's "the" spy.

832
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,570
His secrets have secrets.

833
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,193
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

834
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,860
I just want to finish
my work here, and..

835
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,527
Doctor?

836
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,456
"A warm light for all mankind."

837
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,538
Loki's jab at Fury
about the Cube.

838
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,998
I heard it.

839
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,425
I think that was meant for you.

840
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,338
Even if Barton didn't tell
Loki about the tower,

841
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,467
it was still all over the news.

842
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,641
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

843
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,101
building in New York?

844
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:56,181
It's powered by an arc reactor, a
self-sustaining energy source.

845
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,766
That building will run
itself for, what, a year?

846
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,693
It's just the prototype.

847
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,646
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

848
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,485
That's what he's getting at.

849
00:58:04,563 --> 00:58:07,237
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring
him in on the Tesseract project?

850
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,199
What are they doing in
the energy business

851
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,574
in the first place?

852
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,740
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

853
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:15,833
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

854
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,876
I'm sorry. Did you say..

855
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,079
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

856
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,005
In a few hours, I'll
know every dirty secret

857
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,333
S.H.I.E.L.D. has
ever tried to hide.

858
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,382
Blueberry?

859
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,210
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

860
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,172
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence'?

861
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,132
Historically, not awesome.

862
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,512
I think Loki's trying
to wind us up.

863
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,219
This is a man who
means to start a war

864
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,769
and if we don't stay
focused, he'll succeed.

865
00:58:37,054 --> 00:58:39,557
We have orders. We
should follow them.

866
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,943
Following's not really my style.

867
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,733
And you're all about
style, aren't you?

868
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,905
Of the people in this room,

869
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,655
which one is, A, wearing
a spangly outfit,

870
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,905
and, B, not of use?

871
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:54,282
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

872
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:58,083
Just find the Cube.

873
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:12,965
That's the guy my dad
never shut up about?

874
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,436
I'm wondering if they shouldn't
have kept him on ice.

875
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,931
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

876
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,856
He does have the jump on us.

877
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:23,684
What he's got is an
Acme dynamite kit.

878
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,612
It's going to blow
up in his face.

879
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:27,815
And I'm going to be
there when it does.

880
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,487
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

881
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,744
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

882
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,083
You see, I don't get
a suit of armour.

883
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,583
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

884
00:59:42,661 --> 00:59:44,164
It's a nightmare.

885
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,376
I've got a cluster of
shrapnel trying every second

886
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,507
to crawl its way into my heart.

887
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,679
This stops it.

888
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,927
This little circle of
light, it's part of me now,

889
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,847
not just armour.

890
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,934
It's a terrible privilege.

891
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,682
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

892
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,766
It's different.

893
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:07,612
Hey, I read all about
your accident.

894
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:10,907
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

895
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,693
So you're saying
that the Hulk..

896
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,284
The other guy saved my life?

897
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,952
That's nice.

898
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,711
It's a nice sentiment.
Saved it for what?

899
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,880
I guess we'll find out.

900
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,425
You may not enjoy that.

901
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,503
And you just might.

902
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,110
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

903
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,987
we moved Jane Foster.

904
01:01:35,065 --> 01:01:37,489
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromso.

905
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:41,164
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

906
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,085
Handsome fee, private
plane, very remote.

907
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:46,876
She'll be safe.

908
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:48,454
Thank you.

909
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,090
It's no accident, Loki
taking Erik Selvig.

910
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,715
I dread what he plans
for him once he's done.

911
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:56,967
Erik is a good man.

912
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,094
He talks about you a lot.

913
01:02:00,132 --> 01:02:02,135
You changed his life.

914
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:05,726
You changed everything
around here.

915
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:07,978
They were better as they were.

916
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:10,686
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

917
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:14,523
but we come here, battling
like bilge snipe.

918
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,483
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

919
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,318
You know, huge,
scaly, big antlers.

920
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,246
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

921
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,244
Well, they are repulsive.

922
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,835
And they trample
everything in their path.

923
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,760
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

924
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,094
and your people paid the price.

925
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,184
And now, again.

926
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,181
In my youth, I courted war.

927
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,981
War hasn't started yet.

928
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,903
You think you could
make Loki tell us

929
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,277
where the Tesseract is?

930
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,701
I do not know. Loki's
mind is far afield.

931
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:04,532
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

932
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,456
There's no pain would
prise his need from him.

933
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,079
A lot of guys think that

934
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,413
until the pain starts.

935
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,458
What are you asking me to do?

936
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,045
I'm asking, what are
you prepared to do?

937
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:20,213
Loki is a prisoner.

938
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,806
Then why do I feel like he's
the only person on this boat

939
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,259
that wants to be here?

940
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,237
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

941
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,909
But you figured I'd come.

942
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,074
After.

943
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:48,574
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

944
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:52,378
you would appear as a
friend, as a balm.

945
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,838
And I would cooperate.

946
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,958
I want to know what you've
done to Agent Barton.

947
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,050
I would say I've
expanded his mind.

948
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,757
And once you've won,

949
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,599
once you're king
of the mountain,

950
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,559
what happens to his mind?

951
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,391
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

952
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:16,311
Love is for children.
I owe him a debt.

953
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,115
Tell me.

954
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,913
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D..
I..

955
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:36,210
Well, I made a name for myself.

956
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,384
I have a very
specific skill set.

957
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,884
I didn't care who I
used it for, or on.

958
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,429
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
radar in a bad way.

959
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,771
Agent Barton was
sent to kill me.

960
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,141
He made a different call.

961
01:04:56,266 --> 01:04:59,146
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

962
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:00,983
Not let you out.

963
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,987
No, but I like this.

964
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,195
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

965
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,581
Regimes fall every day.

966
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:12,034
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

967
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,164
Or I was.

968
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,163
And what are you now?

969
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,791
It's really not
that complicated.

970
01:05:19,873 --> 01:05:24,003
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

971
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,340
Can you?

972
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,686
Can you wipe out that much red?

973
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,351
Dreykov's daughter,

974
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:37,891
Sao Paulo,

975
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,237
the hospital fire?

976
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,608
Barton told me everything.

977
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,570
Your ledger is dripping.
It's gushing red

978
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,492
and you think saving a man no
more virtuous than yourself

979
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,949
will change anything?

980
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,784
This is the basest
sentimentality.

981
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,121
This is a child at prayer.

982
01:05:57,202 --> 01:05:58,375
Pathetic!

983
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,958
You lie and kill

984
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,135
in the service of
liars and killers.

985
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,222
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

986
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,221
something that makes
up for the horrors.

987
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,815
But they are part of you.

988
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,485
And they will never go away.

989
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,820
I won't touch Barton, not
until I make him kill you.

990
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,152
Slowly, intimately,

991
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:30,702
in every way he knows you fear.

992
01:06:30,777 --> 01:06:33,621
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

993
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:37,494
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

994
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:40,413
This is my bargain,
you mewling quim.

995
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,920
You're a monster.

996
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,586
Oh, no.

997
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:49,760
You brought the monster.

998
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,427
So, Banner.

999
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:56,599
That's your play.

1000
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,847
What?

1001
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,474
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1002
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:02,105
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way.

1003
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,277
Send Thor as well.

1004
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,313
Thank you

1005
01:07:06,563 --> 01:07:08,782
for your cooperation.

1006
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,708
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1007
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,378
Kind of been wondering the
same thing about you.

1008
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,380
You're supposed to be
locating the Tesseract.

1009
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:23,751
We are. The model's locked

1010
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,503
and we're sweeping for
the signature now.

1011
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,880
When we get a hit,

1012
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,461
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1013
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:33,050
Yeah, then you get your Cube back.
No muss, no fuss.

1014
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,179
What is "Phase 2"?

1015
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,389
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1016
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,269
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1017
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,063
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1018
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,440
This does not mean
that we're making..

1019
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:46,521
I'm sorry, Nick.

1020
01:07:46,603 --> 01:07:48,981
What were you lying?

1021
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,362
I was wrong, Director.

1022
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,574
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1023
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,652
Did you know about this?

1024
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,659
You want to think about
removing yourself

1025
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,862
from this environment, Doctor?

1026
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,824
I was in Calcutta. I was
pretty well removed.

1027
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,458
Loki is manipulating you.

1028
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,036
And you've been doing
what, exactly?

1029
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,666
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1030
01:08:02,744 --> 01:08:03,996
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1031
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,456
because suddenly you
get a little twitchy.

1032
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,380
I'd like to know
why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1033
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:11,088
is using the Tesseract to build
weapons of mass destruction.

1034
01:08:11,795 --> 01:08:12,967
Because of him.

1035
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,840
Me?

1036
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,597
Last year, Earth had a
visitor from another planet

1037
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:21,898
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1038
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,100
We learned that not
only are we not alone

1039
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,939
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1040
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,149
My people want nothing but
peace with your planet.

1041
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:32,404
But you're not the only
people out there, are you'?

1042
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,359
And you're not the only threat.

1043
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,530
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1044
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,539
that can't be controlled.

1045
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,912
Like you controlled the Cube?

1046
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,288
Your work with the Tesseract

1047
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,962
is what drew Loki to
it, and his allies.

1048
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,506
It is a signal to all the realms

1049
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,300
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1050
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,466
A higher form?

1051
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:51,668
You forced our hand.

1052
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:52,753
We had to come up
with something.

1053
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:53,837
A nuclear deterrent.

1054
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,015
Because that always calms
everything right down.

1055
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,512
Remind me again how you
made your fortune, Stark.

1056
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,765
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep..

1057
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,771
Hold on. How is
this now about me?

1058
01:09:02,846 --> 01:09:03,972
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1059
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,024
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1060
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,024
Excuse me, did we come to your
planet and blow stuff up?

1061
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,979
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1062
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,610
Are you boys really that naive?

1063
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:14,613
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors
potential threats.

1064
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,034
Captain America's
on threat watch?

1065
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:17,110
We all are.

1066
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,697
Wait, you're on that list?

1067
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,372
Are you above or
below angry bees?

1068
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,621
Stark, so help me God, if you
make one more wisecrack..

1069
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:23,997
Threat! Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

1070
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,579
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1071
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,890
Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.

1072
01:09:36,963 --> 01:09:39,182
I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.

1073
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:41,351
What is your haul? Over.

1074
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:43,850
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1075
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,690
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1076
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,367
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1077
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,860
I mean, what are we, a team?

1078
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,993
No, we're a chemical
mixture that makes chaos.

1079
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,789
We're a time bomb.

1080
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,038
You need to step away.

1081
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,994
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1082
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,206
You know damn well why.
Back off!

1083
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:11,541
I'm starting to want
you to make me.

1084
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:15,253
Yeah. Big man in a
suit of armour.

1085
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,671
Take that off, what are you?

1086
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,261
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1087
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,220
I know guys with none of
that worth ten of you.

1088
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:24,394
I've seen the footage.

1089
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:26,639
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1090
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,234
You're not the guy to
make the sacrifice play,

1091
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,737
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1092
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,902
I think I would
just cut the wire.

1093
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:40,028
Always a way out.

1094
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,408
You may not be a threat

1095
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,329
but you better stop
pretending to be a hero.

1096
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:46,037
A hero? Like you?

1097
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,211
You're a laboratory
experiment, Rogers.

1098
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,711
Everything special about
you came out of a bottle.

1099
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,783
Put on the suit. Let's
go a few rounds.

1100
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,530
You people are so
petty and tiny.

1101
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,663
Yeah, this is a team.

1102
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:26,865
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1103
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:27,996
Dr. Banner back to his..

1104
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:29,832
Where? You rented my room.

1105
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,787
The cell was just in case..

1106
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,289
In case you needed to kill me.

1107
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,046
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1108
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,969
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1109
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:46,427
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1110
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,387
So I moved on.

1111
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,064
I focused on helping other people.
I was good.

1112
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,563
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1113
01:11:53,725 --> 01:11:54,898
and put everyone here at risk.

1114
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,396
You want to know my
secret, Agent Romanoff?

1115
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,073
You want to know
how I stay calm?

1116
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,077
Dr. Banner,

1117
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,323
put down the scepter.

1118
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:16,381
Got it.

1119
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:17,962
Sorry, kids,

1120
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,926
you don't get to see my
party trick after all.

1121
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:21,091
You located the Tesseract?

1122
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:22,212
I could get there fastest.

1123
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,474
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1124
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:25,890
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1125
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:27,055
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1126
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:28,435
I'm not afraid to
hit an old man.

1127
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,511
Put on the suit.

1128
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:33,934
Oh, my God.

1129
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:50,699
Put on the suit.

1130
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,126
Yeah.

1131
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,622
All hands to stations.

1132
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,469
- Hill!
- External detonation.

1133
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,966
Number three engine is down.

1134
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,046
We've been hit.

1135
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,382
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1136
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,466
Talk to me.

1137
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,268
Turbine looks mostly intact

1138
01:13:09,342 --> 01:13:11,265
but it's impossible to get
out there to make repairs

1139
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,813
while we're in the air.

1140
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,483
If we lose one more
engine, we won't be.

1141
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,605
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1142
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,153
- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.

1143
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,649
Coulson, initiate defensive
lockdown in the detention section

1144
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,823
then get to the armory.

1145
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,988
Romanoff?

1146
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,993
We're okay.

1147
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:33,913
We're okay, right?

1148
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:47,966
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1149
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,766
Detention, wait for
cameras to go dark.

1150
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:51,719
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1151
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,975
Let's go, Level 4.

1152
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:58,475
Engine three. I'll
meet you there.

1153
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,076
Doctor?

1154
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,029
Bruce?

1155
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,122
You got to fight it. This
is just what Loki wants.

1156
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,623
We're going to be okay.
Listen to me.

1157
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,703
Are you hurt?

1158
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:24,176
We're going to be okay.
All right?

1159
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:27,386
I swear on my life, I
will get you out of this.

1160
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,844
You will walk away
and never ever..

1161
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:30,765
Your life?

1162
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,234
Bruce

1163
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:28,615
Bring the carrier about to
a 1-8-0, heading south!

1164
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,533
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1165
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,615
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1166
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,279
Is the sun coming up?

1167
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,289
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1168
01:15:37,615 --> 01:15:39,118
Get us over water.

1169
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,250
One more turbine goes
down, and we drop.

1170
01:15:43,788 --> 01:15:45,131
Thanks.

1171
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:49,636
Stark!

1172
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,015
Stark, I'm here!

1173
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,307
Good.

1174
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:58,850
Let's see what we've got.

1175
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,555
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1176
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:01,724
back online

1177
01:16:01,806 --> 01:16:03,354
before I can access the rotors,

1178
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,027
work on dislodging the debris.

1179
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,148
I need you to get to that
engine control panel

1180
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,944
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.

1181
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,832
What does it look like in there?

1182
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:30,051
It seems to run on some
form of electricity.

1183
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,929
Well, you're not wrong.

1184
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,662
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1185
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,783
Try to think!

1186
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:51,792
Okay, the relays are intact.

1187
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,259
What's our next move?

1188
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:54,632
Even if I clear the rotors,

1189
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,885
this thing won't re-engage
without a jump.

1190
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:58,261
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1191
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,184
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1192
01:18:00,466 --> 01:18:02,515
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1193
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,938
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could..

1194
01:18:04,095 --> 01:18:05,268
Speak English!

1195
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,811
You see that red lever?

1196
01:18:09,225 --> 01:18:11,194
It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.

1197
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,109
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1198
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:07,412
We need full evac on
the lower hangar bay.

1199
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,962
Grenade!

1200
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:28,434
We've got a perimeter breach!

1201
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,608
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D.
gear.

1202
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,810
Call-outs at every junction.

1203
01:19:40,024 --> 01:19:42,278
We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.

1204
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,863
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1205
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,038
Sir, the Hulk will
tear this place apart!

1206
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,203
Get his attention.

1207
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:52,755
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1208
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,172
Don't get too close.

1209
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:55,373
Copy

1210
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:08,850
Target acquired.

1211
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,064
Target engaged.

1212
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,247
Target angry, target angry!

1213
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:37,902
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell..

1214
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,710
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1215
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,307
We are in an
uncontrolled descent.

1216
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:11,100
Sir, we've lost all
power in engine one.

1217
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:13,679
It's Barton. He took
out our systems.

1218
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:16,265
He's headed for the
detention level.

1219
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:18,350
Does anybody copy?

1220
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,690
This is Agent Romanoff.

1221
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,271
I copy

1222
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,659
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1223
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,238
Yeah, I noticed.

1224
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,350
No!

1225
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,530
Are you ever not going
to fall for that?

1226
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,122
The humans think us immortal.

1227
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,750
Should we test that?

1228
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:02,462
Move away, please.

1229
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,467
You like this?

1230
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,631
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1231
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,139
Even I don't know what it does.

1232
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,431
Do you want to find out?

1233
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:21,640
No!

1234
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,844
Natasha?

1235
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:06,166
You're going to lose.

1236
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:09,255
Am I?

1237
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,215
It's in your nature.

1238
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,715
Your heroes are scattered.

1239
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:21,552
Your floating fortress
falls from the sky.

1240
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:22,931
Where is my disadvantage?

1241
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,771
You lack conviction.

1242
01:26:26,722 --> 01:26:27,770
I don't think I'm..

1243
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,283
So, that's what it does.

1244
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,115
All hands to crash
stations immediately.

1245
01:27:08,931 --> 01:27:09,932
Captain, hit the lever.

1246
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,944
I need a minute here!

1247
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,395
Lever

1248
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,479
Now!

1249
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:28,788
Help!

1250
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,783
Sorry, boss.

1251
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:07,411
The god rabbited.

1252
01:28:07,698 --> 01:28:09,201
Just stay awake.

1253
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:10,752
Eyes on me.

1254
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,412
No, I'm clocking out here.

1255
01:28:12,703 --> 01:28:13,876
Not an option.

1256
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,208
It's okay, boss.

1257
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:21,179
This was never gonna work

1258
01:28:21,253 --> 01:28:22,426
if they didn't have something

1259
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:25,350
to..

1260
01:28:54,537 --> 01:28:56,414
Agent Coulson is down.

1261
01:28:57,748 --> 01:28:59,501
A medical team is on its
way to your location.

1262
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,086
They're here.

1263
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,929
They called it.

1264
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,820
These were in Phil
Coulson's jacket.

1265
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,326
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1266
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,668
We're dead in the air up here.

1267
01:29:34,743 --> 01:29:37,872
Our communications, the
location of the Cube,

1268
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,421
Banner, Thor..

1269
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,628
I got nothing for you.

1270
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,636
I lost my one good eye.

1271
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:52,604
Maybe I had that coming.

1272
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,234
Yes.

1273
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,735
We were going to build an
arsenal with the Tesseract.

1274
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,072
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1275
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:09,279
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1276
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:17,333
There was an idea,
Stark knows this,

1277
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:22,588
called the Avengers Initiative.

1278
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,925
The idea was to bring
together a group

1279
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:28,597
of remarkable people

1280
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,185
to see if they could
become something more.

1281
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:37,515
To see if they could work
together when we needed them to,

1282
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:40,981
to fight the battles
that we never could.

1283
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:48,865
Phil Coulson died still
believing in that idea.

1284
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:52,872
In heroes.

1285
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,498
Well,

1286
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,051
It's an old-fashioned notion.

1287
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:28,615
You fell out of the sky.

1288
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,082
Did I hurt anybody?

1289
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:47,511
There's nobody around
here to get hurt.

1290
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,930
You did scare the hell out
of some pigeons, though.

1291
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:52,847
Lucky.

1292
01:31:52,923 --> 01:31:54,266
Or just good aim.

1293
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,972
You were awake when you fell.

1294
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,101
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1295
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,938
Right through the ceiling.

1296
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:06,238
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1297
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:07,484
Here.

1298
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:11,033
Didn't think those would fit
you until you shrunk down

1299
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:13,612
to a regular-size feller.

1300
01:32:15,904 --> 01:32:17,247
Thank you.

1301
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,162
Are you an alien?

1302
01:32:19,783 --> 01:32:21,001
What?

1303
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:22,662
From outer space, an alien.

1304
01:32:23,203 --> 01:32:24,251
No.

1305
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:27,796
Well, then, son, you've
got a condition.

1306
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,972
Clint. You're going
to be all right.

1307
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:46,649
You know that?

1308
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:49,314
Is that what you know?

1309
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:54,654
I've got no window.

1310
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:56,658
I have to flush him out.

1311
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,573
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1312
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,078
You don't understand.

1313
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:06,164
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1314
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:11,462
Pull you out and stuff
something else in?

1315
01:33:14,546 --> 01:33:16,720
Do you know what it's
like to be unmade?

1316
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,682
You know that I do.

1317
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:29,233
Why am I back?

1318
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:32,069
How did you get him out?

1319
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,867
Cognitive recalibration.

1320
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:37,658
I hit you really
hard on the head.

1321
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:38,863
Thanks.

1322
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:44,872
Natasha..

1323
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:46,662
How many agents did I..

1324
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,292
Don't.

1325
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:50,634
Don't do that to
yourself, Clint.

1326
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,086
This is Loki.

1327
01:33:53,418 --> 01:33:55,796
This is monsters and magic,

1328
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,256
and nothing we were
ever trained for.

1329
01:33:57,422 --> 01:33:58,970
Loki, did he get away?

1330
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,051
Yeah.

1331
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,770
I don't suppose you know where.

1332
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,896
I didn't need to know.

1333
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,725
I didn't ask.

1334
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,230
He's going to make his
play soon, though.

1335
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:13,652
Today.

1336
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,024
We got to stop him.

1337
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:16,993
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1338
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,036
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1339
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:21,907
Well,

1340
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:25,747
if I put an arrow through
Loki's eye socket,

1341
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:28,587
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1342
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:32,751
Now you sound like you.

1343
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,920
But you don't.

1344
01:34:37,087 --> 01:34:39,966
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1345
01:34:40,048 --> 01:34:44,805
Now you want to wade into a war.
Why?

1346
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:48,557
What did Loki do to you?

1347
01:34:49,266 --> 01:34:51,735
He didn't. I just..

1348
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:56,987
Natasha.

1349
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,115
I've been compromised.

1350
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:06,037
I got red in my ledger.

1351
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:10,497
I would like to wipe it out.

1352
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,064
Was he married?

1353
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,560
No.

1354
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,942
There was a cellist, I think.

1355
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:36,948
I'm sorry.

1356
01:35:37,606 --> 01:35:39,029
He seemed like a good man.

1357
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:41,698
He was an idiot.

1358
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,872
Why? For believing?

1359
01:35:44,154 --> 01:35:45,577
For taking on Loki alone.

1360
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,408
He was doing his job.

1361
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,836
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1362
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,002
He should have..

1363
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,831
Sometimes there isn't
a way out, Tony.

1364
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:55,257
Right, I've heard that before.

1365
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:56,505
Is this the first time
you lost a soldier?

1366
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,461
We are not soldiers.

1367
01:36:03,173 --> 01:36:04,766
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1368
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,268
Neither am I.

1369
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,596
He's got the same blood on
his hands that Loki does.

1370
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,101
But right now, we got
to put that behind us

1371
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,182
and get this done.

1372
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:13,393
Loki needs a power source.

1373
01:36:13,475 --> 01:36:14,443
If we can put together a list..

1374
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:15,520
He made it personal.

1375
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:16,854
That's not the point.

1376
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:19,444
That is the point.
That's Loki's point.

1377
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,322
He hit us all right where we live.
Why?

1378
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:22,739
To tear us apart.

1379
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,695
Yeah, divide and
conquer is great

1380
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,282
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1381
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:28,957
That's what he wants.

1382
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,286
He wants to beat us, he
wants to be seen doing it.

1383
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,543
He wants an audience.

1384
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:35,211
Right. I caught his
act in Stuttgart.

1385
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:38,293
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1386
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,970
And Loki, he's a
full-tilt diva, right?

1387
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,637
He wants flowers,
he wants parades.

1388
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:46,217
He wants a monument built to the
skies with his name plastered..

1389
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,557
Son of a bitch.

1390
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:01,524
Time to go.

1391
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:03,484
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1392
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:04,702
Can you fly one of those jets?

1393
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,529
I can.

1394
01:37:11,283 --> 01:37:12,409
You got a suit?

1395
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:13,618
Yeah.

1396
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,162
Then suit up.

1397
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,150
Hey, you guys aren't
authorized to be in here.

1398
01:37:44,274 --> 01:37:46,448
Son, just don't.

1399
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:49,912
Sir.

1400
01:37:49,988 --> 01:37:50,989
Agent Hill.

1401
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,333
Those cards,

1402
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:59,457
they were in Coulson's
locker not in his jacket.

1403
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,587
They needed the push.

1404
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,139
We have an unauthorized
departure from Bay 6.

1405
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,262
They found him.

1406
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:18,060
Get our communications back
up, whatever you have to do.

1407
01:38:18,141 --> 01:38:20,270
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1408
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,743
Sir, I've turned off
the arc reactor

1409
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,707
but the device is already
self-sustaining.

1410
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:42,007
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

1411
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:43,587
It's too late!

1412
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,212
She can't stop now.

1413
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,600
She wants to show us something!

1414
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:52,970
A new universe.

1415
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,390
Okay.

1416
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,779
The barrier is pure energy.

1417
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:05,481
It's unbreachable.

1418
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:07,658
Yeah, I got that.

1419
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:09,573
Plan B

1420
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:13,114
Sir, the Mark 7 is not
ready for deployment.

1421
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,291
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1422
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:37,938
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1423
01:39:39,222 --> 01:39:41,520
Actually, I'm planning
to threaten you.

1424
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:43,152
You should have left
your armour on for that.

1425
01:39:43,435 --> 01:39:44,904
Yeah.

1426
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,150
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1427
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:48,448
and you've got the
glow stick of destiny.

1428
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,737
Would you like a drink?

1429
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,036
Stalling me won't
change anything.

1430
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:55,497
No, no. Threatening.

1431
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:56,664
No drink? Are you sure?

1432
01:39:57,073 --> 01:39:58,621
I'm having one.

1433
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:03,590
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1434
01:40:04,414 --> 01:40:05,541
What have I to fear?

1435
01:40:05,957 --> 01:40:07,426
The Avengers.

1436
01:40:09,753 --> 01:40:12,131
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1437
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:13,887
"Earth's mightiest
heroes" type thing.

1438
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:15,559
Yes, I've met them.

1439
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,851
Yeah.

1440
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:18,353
It takes us a while
to get any traction,

1441
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:19,520
I'll give you that one.

1442
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:21,815
But let's do a head count, here.

1443
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,439
Your brother, the demigod,

1444
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:29,528
a super soldier, a living legend who
kind of lives up to the legend.

1445
01:40:29,814 --> 01:40:33,034
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1446
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:36,033
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1447
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,496
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1448
01:40:39,574 --> 01:40:40,622
That was the plan.

1449
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,082
Not a great plan.

1450
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,256
When they come,

1451
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:46,832
and they will,

1452
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:48,042
they'll come for you.

1453
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,171
I have an army.

1454
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,344
We have a Hulk.

1455
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,509
I thought the beast
had wandered off.

1456
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:54,555
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1457
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:58,431
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1458
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:00,770
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us,

1459
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:02,974
but it's all on you.

1460
01:41:04,015 --> 01:41:05,141
Because if we can't
protect the Earth,

1461
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,238
you can be damn well
sure we'll avenge it.

1462
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,529
How will your friends
have time for me

1463
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,202
when they are so
busy fighting you?

1464
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:23,664
This usually works.

1465
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,630
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1466
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:28,628
One out of five..

1467
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:33,337
Jarvis, anytime now.

1468
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,805
You will all fall before me.

1469
01:41:37,882 --> 01:41:39,135
Deploy!

1470
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:40,511
Deploy!

1471
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:11,042
And there's one other
person you pissed off.

1472
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,219
His name was Phil.

1473
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:38,655
Right.

1474
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:39,737
Army

1475
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:53,728
Loki!

1476
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:55,563
Turn off the Tesseract,
or I'll destroy it.

1477
01:43:55,645 --> 01:43:56,771
You can't.

1478
01:43:56,896 --> 01:43:58,819
There is no stopping it.

1479
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,654
There is only

1480
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:01,989
the war.

1481
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:03,279
So be it.

1482
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,927
Stark, we're on your
three, headed northeast.

1483
01:44:27,177 --> 01:44:29,180
What? Did you stop
for drive-through?

1484
01:44:29,262 --> 01:44:31,015
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1485
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,784
Sir, we have more incoming.

1486
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:52,369
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1487
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,048
- Nat?
- I see him.

1488
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,975
We got to get back up there.

1489
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,731
Stark, are you seeing this?

1490
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:43,859
Seeing. Still working
on believing.

1491
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,524
Where's Banner? Has
he shown up yet?

1492
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:46,740
Banner?

1493
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:47,818
Just keep me posted.

1494
01:46:48,359 --> 01:46:50,578
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1495
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:54,750
Look at this!

1496
01:46:54,824 --> 01:46:55,826
Look around you!

1497
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,664
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1498
01:47:01,164 --> 01:47:02,667
It's too late.

1499
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:05,420
It's too late to stop it.

1500
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:09,051
No. We can, together.

1501
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:17,765
Sentiment.

1502
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,253
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1503
01:47:49,253 --> 01:47:50,255
Loki.

1504
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:03,648
They're fish in a
barrel down there.

1505
01:48:09,274 --> 01:48:11,275
We got this. It's good. Go.

1506
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:12,577
Do you think you
can hold them off?

1507
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:13,699
Captain,

1508
01:48:15,863 --> 01:48:18,537
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1509
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,029
Just like Budapest
all over again.

1510
01:48:47,895 --> 01:48:50,114
You and I remember
Budapest very differently.

1511
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:07,582
It's going to be an hour

1512
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:09,042
before they can scramble
the National Guard.

1513
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:10,969
National Guard?

1514
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,180
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1515
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:14,256
Do we?

1516
01:49:15,798 --> 01:49:17,051
You need men in these buildings.

1517
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,680
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1518
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,012
right into the line of fire.

1519
01:49:20,136 --> 01:49:22,060
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1520
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,765
You keep them off the streets.

1521
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:26,146
I need a perimeter
as far back as 39th.

1522
01:49:26,601 --> 01:49:27,979
Why the hell should I
take orders from you?

1523
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:43,542
I need men in those buildings.

1524
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:45,747
Lead the people down and
away from the streets.

1525
01:49:45,828 --> 01:49:48,172
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1526
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,177
Well, we got its attention.

1527
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:02,434
What the hell was step two?

1528
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:32,963
What's the story upstairs?

1529
01:50:33,042 --> 01:50:35,011
The power surrounding the
Cube is impenetrable.

1530
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:37,761
Thor's right. We got to
deal with these guys.

1531
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,512
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1532
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:40,716
I have unfinished
business with Loki.

1533
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,181
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1534
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:43,261
Save it.

1535
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,146
Loki's going to keep this
fight focused on us,

1536
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:46,269
and that's what we need.

1537
01:50:46,347 --> 01:50:48,065
Without him, these
things could run wild.

1538
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:50,735
We got Stark up top. He's
going to need us to..

1539
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:02,037
So, this all seems horrible.

1540
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:03,657
I've seen worse.

1541
01:51:04,073 --> 01:51:05,166
Sorry.

1542
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:07,869
No, we could use a little worse.

1543
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:10,414
- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?

1544
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:11,918
Just like you said.

1545
01:51:12,248 --> 01:51:14,842
Then tell him to suit up. I'm
bringing the party to you.

1546
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,176
I don't see how that's a party.

1547
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,060
Dr. Banner.

1548
01:51:33,895 --> 01:51:35,738
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1549
01:51:36,564 --> 01:51:39,113
That's my secret, Captain.

1550
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:42,119
I'm always angry.

1551
01:51:53,789 --> 01:51:55,212
Hold on!

1552
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:26,698
Send the rest.

1553
01:52:33,454 --> 01:52:34,752
Guys.

1554
01:52:34,997 --> 01:52:36,250
Call it, Captain.

1555
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:37,585
All right, listen up.

1556
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:40,171
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1557
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:41,921
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1558
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,927
Eyes on everything. Call
out patterns and strays.

1559
01:52:44,006 --> 01:52:45,099
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1560
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:46,426
Anything gets more
than three blocks out,

1561
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,177
you turn it back or
you turn it to ash.

1562
01:52:48,511 --> 01:52:49,559
- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.

1563
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:50,764
Better clench up, Legolas.

1564
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,520
Thor, you got to try and
bottleneck that portal.

1565
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:57,979
Slow them down.

1566
01:52:58,271 --> 01:53:00,149
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1567
01:53:02,734 --> 01:53:04,030
You and me, we stay
here on the ground.

1568
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,283
We keep the fighting here.

1569
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:06,363
And Hulk..

1570
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,158
Smash.

1571
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:05,212
Sir.

1572
01:54:05,963 --> 01:54:06,965
The Council is on.

1573
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:15,144
Stark, you got a lot of
strays sniffing your tail.

1574
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,060
I'm just trying to keep
them off the streets.

1575
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,320
Well, they can't
bank worth a damn.

1576
01:54:21,395 --> 01:54:22,613
So find a tight corner.

1577
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:24,235
I will roger that.

1578
01:54:47,088 --> 01:54:48,305
Oh, boy.

1579
01:54:55,514 --> 01:54:57,186
Nice call.

1580
01:54:57,265 --> 01:54:58,516
What else you got?

1581
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,444
Thor is taking on a
squadron down on Sixth.

1582
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,488
And he didn't invite me.

1583
01:55:43,228 --> 01:55:45,229
Captain, none of this is
going to mean a damn thing

1584
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:46,279
if we don't close that portal.

1585
01:55:46,355 --> 01:55:47,608
Our biggest guns
couldn't touch it.

1586
01:55:47,983 --> 01:55:50,280
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1587
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:54,072
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1588
01:55:55,114 --> 01:55:56,240
I got a ride.

1589
01:55:57,324 --> 01:55:58,372
I could use a boost, though.

1590
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,037
Are you sure about this?

1591
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:05,050
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1592
01:56:32,234 --> 01:56:34,033
Okay, turn, turn.

1593
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:36,034
Less! Less!

1594
01:57:58,654 --> 01:58:01,658
Captain, the bank on
42nd past Madison.

1595
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,583
They've cornered a lot
of civilians in there.

1596
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:05,412
I'm on it.

1597
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:27,354
Everyone! Clear out!

1598
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,097
Director Fury,

1599
01:58:59,173 --> 01:59:00,720
the Council has made a decision.

1600
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,850
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1601
01:59:03,927 --> 01:59:05,600
But given that it's a
stupid-ass decision,

1602
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,148
I have elected to ignore it.

1603
01:59:07,222 --> 01:59:10,318
Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.

1604
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:11,439
You scramble that jet..

1605
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:14,359
That is the island of
Manhattan, Councilman.

1606
01:59:14,605 --> 01:59:16,779
Until I'm certain my
team can't hold it,

1607
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,859
I will not order
a nuclear strike

1608
01:59:18,943 --> 01:59:20,286
against a civilian population.

1609
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:22,747
If we don't hold them
here, we lose everything.

1610
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:25,826
If I send that bird
out, we already have.

1611
01:59:29,578 --> 01:59:30,921
You.

1612
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:34,757
Hawkeye!

1613
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:36,836
Nat, what are you doing?

1614
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:38,796
A little help?

1615
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:45,220
I got him.

1616
02:00:11,662 --> 02:00:12,663
Enough!

1617
02:00:13,288 --> 02:00:15,507
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1618
02:00:15,833 --> 02:00:18,677
I am a god, you dull creature.

1619
02:00:18,752 --> 02:00:20,300
And I will not be bullied by..

1620
02:00:29,805 --> 02:00:31,729
Puny god.

1621
02:00:40,065 --> 02:00:41,613
The sceptre..

1622
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:43,990
Doctor.

1623
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:48,701
Loki's scepter. The energy.

1624
02:00:48,783 --> 02:00:50,456
The Tesseract can't fight,

1625
02:00:50,534 --> 02:00:52,377
but you can't protect
against yourself.

1626
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:53,583
It's not your fault.

1627
02:00:53,662 --> 02:00:54,755
You didn't know what
you were doing.

1628
02:00:58,167 --> 02:01:00,386
Actually, I think I did.

1629
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:03,466
I built in a safety to
cut their power source.

1630
02:01:04,591 --> 02:01:06,092
Loki's scepter.

1631
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,804
It may be able to
close the portal.

1632
02:01:10,846 --> 02:01:12,689
And I'm looking right at it.

1633
02:01:25,153 --> 02:01:28,657
Sir, we will lose power before
we penetrate that shell.

1634
02:01:35,454 --> 02:01:38,800
Jarvis, you ever hear
the tale of Jonah?

1635
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:41,047
I wouldn't consider
him a role model.

1636
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:52,707
Director Fury is no
longer in command.

1637
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:54,876
Override order 7-Alpha-1- 1.

1638
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:57,420
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff

1639
02:02:58,453 --> 02:03:00,456
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1640
02:03:00,998 --> 02:03:02,796
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1641
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,469
We need to shut it down!

1642
02:03:04,543 --> 02:03:06,546
Repeat, takeoff is
not authorized.

1643
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,546
Stark, do you hear me?

1644
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:41,588
You have a missile headed
straight for the city.

1645
02:03:42,289 --> 02:03:43,712
How long?

1646
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:45,918
Three minutes, max.

1647
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:47,470
The payload will
wipe out Midtown.

1648
02:03:47,712 --> 02:03:49,588
Jarvis, put everything we
got into the thrusters.

1649
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:51,599
1 just did.

1650
02:04:04,311 --> 02:04:05,689
Package is sent.

1651
02:04:05,896 --> 02:04:08,867
Detonation in 2 minutes,
30 seconds, mark.

1652
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:34,220
Are you ready for another bout?

1653
02:04:34,676 --> 02:04:35,722
What, are you getting sleepy?

1654
02:04:41,474 --> 02:04:43,271
Right at the crown!

1655
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:51,109
I can close it.

1656
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:52,909
Can anybody copy?

1657
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:54,243
I can shut the portal down.

1658
02:04:54,569 --> 02:04:56,537
- Do it!
- No, wait.

1659
02:04:56,613 --> 02:04:57,831
Stark, these things
are still coming.

1660
02:04:57,907 --> 02:04:58,908
I got a nuke coming in.

1661
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,868
It's gonna blow in
less than a minute.

1662
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:12,510
And I know just where to put it.

1663
02:05:19,886 --> 02:05:22,265
Stark, you know that's
a one-way trip.

1664
02:05:22,347 --> 02:05:23,770
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1665
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:28,025
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1666
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:29,855
Might as well.

1667
02:05:32,065 --> 02:05:34,488
The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.

1668
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:36,947
The Army is here trying
to contain the violence

1669
02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:38,702
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1670
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:41,292
And I have to say, in all
my years of reporting,

1671
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:44,119
I have never seen
anything like this.

1672
02:05:44,453 --> 02:05:45,796
We have limited
information on the team

1673
02:05:46,038 --> 02:05:49,634
but we do know that billionaire
Tony Stark's Iron Man..

1674
02:07:03,198 --> 02:07:05,042
Come on, Stark.

1675
02:07:11,414 --> 02:07:12,587
Close it.

1676
02:07:32,686 --> 02:07:33,688
Son of a gun.

1677
02:07:38,568 --> 02:07:40,240
He's not slowing down.

1678
02:07:58,253 --> 02:07:59,551
Is he breathing?

1679
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:28,833
What the hell?

1680
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:33,918
What just happened?

1681
02:08:34,164 --> 02:08:36,292
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1682
02:08:40,546 --> 02:08:42,014
We won.

1683
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,893
All right, yay!

1684
02:08:45,967 --> 02:08:48,015
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1685
02:08:48,095 --> 02:08:51,064
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1686
02:08:52,057 --> 02:08:53,479
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1687
02:08:54,143 --> 02:08:56,270
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1688
02:08:56,354 --> 02:08:58,105
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1689
02:08:58,648 --> 02:08:59,990
We're not finished yet.

1690
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:06,993
And then shawarma after.

1691
02:09:28,844 --> 02:09:31,188
If it's all the same to you,

1692
02:09:34,391 --> 02:09:36,109
I'll have that drink now.

1693
02:09:43,984 --> 02:09:46,033
Despite the devastation of
what has been confirmed

1694
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:47,909
as an extraterrestrial attack,

1695
02:09:47,988 --> 02:09:49,536
the extraordinary heroics

1696
02:09:49,657 --> 02:09:51,625
of the group known
as the Avengers

1697
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,293
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,

1698
02:09:53,368 --> 02:09:54,369
but for celebration.

1699
02:09:54,494 --> 02:09:56,963
It's just really great
knowing they're out there.

1700
02:09:57,038 --> 02:09:58,916
That someone is
watching over us.

1701
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,252
I love you, Thor!

1702
02:10:00,333 --> 02:10:02,086
And then these guys were like..

1703
02:10:02,168 --> 02:10:03,511
And then the air goes..

1704
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:05,009
And this green guy walks
up and he goes..

1705
02:10:05,088 --> 02:10:06,180
I don't know.

1706
02:10:06,256 --> 02:10:08,805
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.

1707
02:10:08,884 --> 02:10:11,979
It just seems that there's a
lot they're not telling us.

1708
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:15,307
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.

1709
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:17,567
These so-called "heroes"

1710
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:18,985
have to be held responsible

1711
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:21,314
for the destruction
done to this city.

1712
02:10:21,396 --> 02:10:23,524
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

1713
02:10:23,606 --> 02:10:26,485
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.

1714
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:27,661
Their sudden appearance

1715
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:29,158
and equally sudden
disappearance..

1716
02:10:29,238 --> 02:10:32,082
What, this is all
somehow their fault?

1717
02:10:34,076 --> 02:10:37,250
Captain America saved my life.

1718
02:10:39,372 --> 02:10:42,877
Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,

1719
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,506
I would just..

1720
02:10:45,253 --> 02:10:47,597
I would want to say thank you.

1721
02:10:50,051 --> 02:10:51,597
Where are the Avengers?

1722
02:10:51,926 --> 02:10:54,100
I'm not currently tracking
their whereabouts.

1723
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:56,399
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1724
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:58,100
And the Tesseract?

1725
02:10:58,184 --> 02:11:00,278
The Tesseract is
where it belongs.

1726
02:11:00,895 --> 02:11:03,273
Out of our reach.

1727
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:04,903
That's not your call.

1728
02:11:04,981 --> 02:11:06,029
I didn't make it.

1729
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:08,243
I just didn't argue
with the god that did.

1730
02:11:08,527 --> 02:11:10,199
So, you let him take it

1731
02:11:10,445 --> 02:11:12,118
and the war criminal, Loki,

1732
02:11:12,198 --> 02:11:13,996
who should be answering
for his crime.

1733
02:11:14,074 --> 02:11:16,418
I think he will be.

1734
02:11:30,131 --> 02:11:32,510
I don't think you understand
what you've started,

1735
02:11:32,885 --> 02:11:35,182
letting the Avengers
loose on this world.

1736
02:11:35,595 --> 02:11:36,643
They're dangerous.

1737
02:11:37,014 --> 02:11:40,518
They surely are, and the
whole world knows it.

1738
02:11:41,226 --> 02:11:43,570
Every world knows it.

1739
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:46,198
Was that the point of all this?

1740
02:11:46,481 --> 02:11:48,029
A statement?

1741
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:52,404
A promise.

1742
02:12:00,871 --> 02:12:02,463
Sir, how does it work now?

1743
02:12:03,748 --> 02:12:05,796
They've gone their
separate ways.

1744
02:12:05,876 --> 02:12:08,845
Some, pretty extremely far.

1745
02:12:09,546 --> 02:12:11,548
If we get into a situation
like this again,

1746
02:12:11,631 --> 02:12:12,975
what happens then?

1747
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:14,096
They'll come back.

1748
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:17,262
Are you really sure about that?

1749
02:12:17,345 --> 02:12:18,346
I am.

1750
02:12:20,224 --> 02:12:21,520
Why?

1751
02:12:22,518 --> 02:12:24,395
Because we'll need them to.

1752
02:15:16,274 --> 02:15:18,823
Humans.

1753
02:15:20,029 --> 02:15:24,454
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1754
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:27,539
They stand.

1755
02:15:28,369 --> 02:15:33,591
They are unruly, and
therefore cannot be ruled.

1756
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,724
To challenge them

1757
02:15:44,802 --> 02:15:48,181
is to court death.
