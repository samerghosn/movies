01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,576
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

891
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:31,735
And this is right after
you graduated.

892
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,416
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

893
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,255
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

894
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,429
And this is you with Mom

895
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:37,856
right after a good day
of training.

896
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,215
These were
your three favorite guys.

897
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,992
(MONICA CONTINUES

898
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:42,748
Oh, wait. I forgot.

899
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,320
Your jacket.

900
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:45,873
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

901
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,552
after I spilled ketchup on it.

902
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:03,231
MARIA: That was all
that survived the crash.

903
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:06,193
Or so we thought.

904
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:08,480
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

905
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:12,557
Don't answer that.

906
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:14,358
It's just my neighbor.

907
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:16,193
They can change into anyone.

908
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:22,519
Hi there.

909
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
What do you want?

910
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,032
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

911
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,634
This is my friend, Carol.

912
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:30,074
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

913
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:33,480
- (CRACKLES)
- Yowzers. (CHUCKLES)

914
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:35,835
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

915
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:39,273
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

916
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,559
and I was just wondering...

917
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,815
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

918
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,909
to get a closer look-see?

919
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:45,356
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

920
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:48,637
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

921
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
Mmm.

922
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:51,519
You're really working overtime

923
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,068
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

924
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:57,639
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

925
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,233
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

926
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:01,438
- Uh...
- Okay.

927
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,990
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

928
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,896
You never know
when you're gonna need

929
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,512
to borrow some sugar.

930
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:12,750
(SLURPS)

931
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,391
Now, hang on a second.

932
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,036
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

933
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,159
making a mess
of your friend's house...

934
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,195
It's a lovely home, miss.

935
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,556
Oh, my God!

936
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,639
What the hell?

937
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,514
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

938
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,833
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

939
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,876
Just don't kill me.

940
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,833
That would really complicate
the situation.

941
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:40,679
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

942
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,079
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

943
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,753
TALOS: I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

944
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,556
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

945
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:48,755
Without deception.

946
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,228
And who is that out there?

947
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,429
Okay, that's a fair point...

948
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:55,318
but I'm sure
that you understand

949
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,550
I had to take
some precautions.

950
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:00,871
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

951
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,996
with your hands bound.

952
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:03,275
I just wanna talk.

953
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
Last time we talked,

954
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,815
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

955
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,309
That was before I knew
who you were.

956
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,597
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

957
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,751
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

958
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,878
of your voice
from a plane crash

959
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,393
six years ago...

960
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:23,759
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

961
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,914
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

962
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,070
How'd you get it?

963
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,239
She don't understand.

964
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,856
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

965
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,313
that kind of allows me

966
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,436
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

967
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:35,800
Call me "young lady" again...

968
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,114
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

969
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:38,634
it's not supposed to be.

970
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,030
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

971
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:44,789
BOTH: Your ass.

972
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,429
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

973
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,478
But, look,
I just need your help

974
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:50,755
decoding some coordinates.

975
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,760
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

976
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,117
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

977
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,030
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

978
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:02,639
Deal.

Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

981
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,239
How'd that get in here?

982
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,436
Hmm?

- The cat?

This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,710
That's not a cat.

01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,189
Now, you understand.

1065
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:42,868
What?
What do I understand now?

1066
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:44,917
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1067
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:46,195
He killed her...

1068
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:48,877
'cause she found out
that she was

1069
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,192
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1070
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:53,315
VERS: No.

1071
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,030
Your people are terrorists.

1072
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:57,680
They kill innocents.

1073
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,592
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1074
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,037
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1075
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:06,676
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1076
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:10,439
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1077
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,636
and they destroyed our planet.

1078
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,350
And the handful of us
that are left

1079
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:18,511
will be slaughtered next...

1080
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,673
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1081
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,394
The core that she found

1082
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,039
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1083
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:28,957
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1084
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:33,079
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1085
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,909
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1086
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:38,269
wasn't to fight wars...

1087
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:39,439
but to end them.

1088
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:45,599
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1089
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,720
Well, I already destroyed it.

1090
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,354
No, you destroyed the engine.

1091
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,512
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1092
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,998
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1093
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:58,719
we can find it.

1094
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,113
You'll use it to destroy us.

1095
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:07,399
(SIGHS)
We just want a home.

1096
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,840
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1097
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,832
Can't you see it now?

1098
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:20,394
You're not one of them.

1099
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:24,953
You don't know me.

1100
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,788
You have no idea who I am.

1101
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,150
I don't even know who I am!

1102
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:36,750
You are Carol Danvers.

1103
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,117
You are the woman
on that black box

1104
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:42,760
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1105
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,279
My best friend...

1106
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:49,393
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1107
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:50,913
when no one else did.

1108
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,635
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1109
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,077
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1110
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,311
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1111
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:05,479
You hear me?

1112
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,672
Do you hear me?

1113
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,952
Come here. Come here, girl.

1114
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,039
I got you.

1115

TALOS: <i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1116
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,676
but you were our only lead.

1117
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,070
We discovered
that your energy signature

1118
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,913
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1119
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,591
Now we know why.

1120
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,399
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1121
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,238
I just need your help

to Mar-Vell's lab.

1123
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,597
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1124
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,712
For orbital position
and velocity.

1125
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,552
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1126
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,908

If we track its course,

1130
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,235
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1131
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,118
It's just basic physics.

1132
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
In orbit?

1133
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,078
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1134
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:16,475
I mean,
you're my science guy, right?

1135
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,668
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1136
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,435
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1146
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,237
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1147
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:53,351
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1148
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,555
and you used to do that.

1149

Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1150

in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1151
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,472
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1162
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,975
I just think
you should consider...

setting for your daughter.

1595
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,975

So, is it true?

1619

That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1620
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,229
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1621

I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.
