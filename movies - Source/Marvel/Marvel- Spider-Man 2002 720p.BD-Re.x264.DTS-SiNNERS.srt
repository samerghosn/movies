1
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,603
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

2
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:15,063
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,853
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

4
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:22,527
... if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...

5
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,487
...somebody lied.

6
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:28,947
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...

7
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:30,527
... is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,870
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:39,122
The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.

10
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,959
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:44,117
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,034
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,209
That's me.

14
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:52,295
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:53,704
Stop!

16
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,131
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:59,384
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

18
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,798
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:08,051
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:14,759
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,649
-Don't even think about it.
-You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,394
Would you date him?

23
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,492
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:45,362
No wandering. Proceed direct--
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:49,115
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,750
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:55,168
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,374
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,214
Come on, stay together.

30
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,300
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,504
-Where were you?
-Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,216
-Looking at the books.
-Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:15,805
-Can we drive around the corner?
-Why?

34
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,810
The entrance is right there.

35
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:21,677
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

36
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:24,221
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

37
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,185
...because you flunked out
of private school?

38
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:30,519
-It wasn't for me.
-Of course it was.

39
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:35,523
-Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
-I'm not ashamed of who I am.

40
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,019
It's just....

41
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,656
Just what, Harry?

42
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,360
Forget it.

43
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,697
Pete!

44
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,610
-Hi, Harry.
-Hey, man. What's up?

45
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:50,702
-Won't you be needing this?
-Thanks.

46
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:55,615
-This is my father, Norman Osborn.
-I've heard so much about you.

47
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:59,286
-It's an honor, sir.
-Harry says you're a science whiz.

48
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:02,380
I'm something of a scientist myself.

49
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:05,713
I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

50
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:08,918
-You understood it?
-Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

51
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:12,420
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

52
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:17,137
-I live with my aunt and uncle.
-Hey, you two! Let's move!

53
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:20,971
-Nice to meet you.
-Hope to see you again.

54
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:26,810
-He doesn't seem so bad.
-Not if you're a genius.

55
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,937
I think he wants to adopt you.

56
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:29,731
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

57
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:33,810
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

58
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:37,808
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

59
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,108
That's amazing!

60
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,192
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

61
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,572
It's unreal.

62
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:48,528
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

63
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:52,242
...varying strengths
to help them search for food.

64
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,665
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

65
00:06:56,832 --> 00:07:00,995
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

66
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:02,911
For the school paper?

67
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:12,415
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

68
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,507
...genus Kukulcania.

69
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:19,088
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

70
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:24,545
...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.

71
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,677
-Leave him alone.
-Or what?

72
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,851
Or his father will fire your father.

73
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,595
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

74
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,262
What is going on?

75
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,524
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

76
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:40,725
-This spider...
-Let's go.

77
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:45,064
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

78
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,778
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

79
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,106
-An early awareness of danger.
-Jerks.

80
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,069
A spider-sense.

81
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,362
Hey, look at that spider.

82
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:59,947
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

83
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,115
It's a defense mechanism.

84
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,576
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

85
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,949
Who wouldn't?

86
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:10,958
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility....

87
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,505
-You gonna talk to her now?
-Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

88
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:20,459
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

89
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:24,341
-Disgusting.
-Yeah, hateful little things.

90
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:25,930
I love them!

91
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,132
Yeah, me too.

92
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,966
You know, spiders can change
their color...

93
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:36,975
-...to blend into their environment.
-Really?

94
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:41,273
-Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
-Cool.

95
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:44,850
-transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

96
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:48,144
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

97
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,980
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

98
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,649
There's 14.

99
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:56,490
I beg your pardon?

100
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:59,196
-One's missing.
-Yeah.

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,740
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

102
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:09,955
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

103
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,205
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

104
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,120
Let's talk about listening.

105
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,966
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

106
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,294
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

107
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,383
...but at Midtown High....

108
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,596
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

109
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,226
-Sure.
-Great.

110
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:42,725
Where do you want me?
Over here?

111
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,265
Yeah, that's great.

112
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,349
Don't make me look ugly.

113
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,558
That's impossible.

114
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,066
Perfect.

115
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,369
-Is that good?
-Great.

116
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,289
That's great.

117
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,870
M.J., let's go!

118
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,994
Wait. Thanks!

119
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,224
Parker, let's do it.

120
00:10:57,943 --> 00:11:01,394
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

121
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:04,109
I've already seen the glider.

122
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,571
That's not what I'm here for.

123
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:09,451
General Slocum, good to see you again.

124
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,442
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

125
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,529
-Norman.
-Mr. Osborn.

126
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:18,238
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

127
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:21,871
I want the report on human
performance enhancers.

128
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:26,537
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

129
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,586
-Excellent.
-Any side effects?

130
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,833
Once.

131
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:32,674
All the tests since
have been successful.

132
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:36,588
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

133
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,085
Violence, aggression...

134
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:41,006
...and insanity.

135
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,931
-What do you recommend?
-That was only one test.

136
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:48,013
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

137
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:51,100
-...ready for human testing.
-Dr. Stromm?

138
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:56,100
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

139
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:59,764
-Back to formula?
-Dr. Osborn.

140
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,769
I'll be frank with you.

141
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:07,852
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

142
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,780
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

143
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,865
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

144
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,114
-They test in two weeks.
-And if your performance enhancers...

145
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:22,365
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

146
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:26,999
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

147
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:30,452
Gentlemen. Ladies.

148
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:40,966
And the Lord said, " Let there be light."
And voila! There is light.

149
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:43,293
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

150
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,296
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

151
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,046
I'm already on my ass, May.

152
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:55,719
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

153
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:58,597
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

154
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,136
Hand me that dish. The green one.

155
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:04,148
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

156
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,480
...and upsizing their profits.

157
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,650
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

158
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:13,570
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

159
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:17,484
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

160
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:19,282
Computer....

161
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:23,240
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

162
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:27,158
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

163
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:32,745
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

164
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,828
I love you. And Peter loves you.

165
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:39,335
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

166
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:44,000
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

167
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:49,426
Hi, sweetie. You're just-
Just in time for dinner.

168
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:52,173
How you doing? How was the field trip?

169
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:55,181
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

170
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:57,838
-You won't have a bite?
-Had a bite.

171
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,423
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

172
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,102
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

173
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:07,099
What's that all about?

174
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,575
In this recombination lab...

175
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:35,370
... we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

176
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:38,618
... combining the genetic
information from all three...

177
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:43,625
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

178
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:02,044
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

179
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:05,557
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

180
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:09,389
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

181
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,768
Don't be a coward.

182
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,802
Risks are part of laboratory science.

183
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:18,722
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

184
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:21,398
-Just give me two weeks.
-Two weeks?

185
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,065
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

186
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,990
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

187
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,826
-Get me the Promachloraperazine.
-For what?

188
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:35,740
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

189
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,323
40,000 years of evolution...

190
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:44,245
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

191
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,421
Oh, that's cold.

192
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,125
Norman?

193
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:04,914
Norman!

194
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:16,970
Oh, my God.

195
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:19,887
Oh, my God!

196
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,390
Oh, my God! Norman!

197
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,406
Back to formula?

198
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,508
Weird.

199
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,814
-Peter?
-Yeah?

200
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,766
Are you all right?

201
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,317
I'm fine.

202
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:40,269
-Any better this morning? Any change?
-Change?

203
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,189
Yep. Big change.

204
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:47,361
-Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
-Right.

205
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:07,128
Okay.

206
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,624
-Goodness me!
-Jeez. I thought you were sick.

207
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:17,505
-I got better.
-See?

208
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:21,046
-Bye, guys.
-Have you got your lunch money?

209
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:24,885
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

210
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:27,844
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

211
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:30,134
And don't start up with me.

212
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,393
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

213
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:40,056
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

214
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:43,816
-I have to go to school.
-Who's stopping you?

215
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,865
Hi, M.J.

216
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:05,242
Hey, M.J.

217
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,041
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

218
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,544
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

219
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,035
I got the car. Hop in.

220
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,084
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

221
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,131
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

222
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:23,630
Or not.

223
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,801
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

224
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:35,887
-Stop the bus!
-Catch a cab!

225
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,934
Tell him to stop.

226
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,596
-Check him out!
-Dork!

227
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,323
Dad!

228
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,661
Dad, are you all right?

229
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:08,778
Harry.

230
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,117
What are you doing on the floor?

231
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:15,622
I don't know.

232
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,786
Have you been there all night?

233
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,042
Last night I was-

234
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,627
What?

235
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:29,291
-I don't remember.
-Mr. Osborn?

236
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,171
Sir, I asked her to wait.

237
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:35,673
-My father's not feeling well-
-Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

238
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:36,880
What?

239
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:40,640
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

240
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,177
-What?
-And the flight suit and the glider....

241
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:46,346
-What about it?
-Stolen, sir.

242
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,038
Wow! Great reflexes!

243
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,073
-Thanks.
-No problem.

244
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:22,080
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

245
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:24,497
You just get contacts?

246
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,416
Well, see you.

247
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:18,701
-What happened?
-He's freaking weird.

248
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,539
Did you see that?

249
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,784
Parker?

250
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,052
-It's a fight!
-Think you're funny?

251
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,230
-It was an accident.
-So is my breaking your teeth.

252
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:04,144
-Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you.

253
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,732
-I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
-Kick his ass.

254
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,951
Help him, Harry.

255
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,413
How'd he do that?

256
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,749
Which one?

257
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,297
He's all yours, man.

258
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,516
Flash, get up!

259
00:24:57,144 --> 00:25:00,261
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

260
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:03,682
That was amazing.

261
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:06,598
I'm out of here. Come on.

262
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:52,788
Go, web!

263
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:56,009
Fly.

264
00:26:57,595 --> 00:26:59,670
Up, up and away, web.

265
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:02,673
Shazam!

266
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:04,509
Go! Go!

267
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,509
Go, web, go!

268
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:41,365
Tallyho.

269
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:27,847
-Is she back with the beer yet?
-What?

270
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,314
Bring me some beer.

271
00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:32,066
-Get up off your ass.
-I paid for beer-

272
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,731
-Stop yelling.
-Stop it!

273
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:36,230
You're as stupid as your mother.

274
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,695
Where's she going?
Where you going?

275
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,118
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

276
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:48,615
-Why don't you do them?
-Get in here and do the dishes.

277
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:52,959
-You do them. They're yours, anyway.
-I'm going out!

278
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,659
-Were you listening to that?
-No.

279
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:59,252
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

280
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:02,173
I guess you can always hear us.

281
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,628
Everybody shouts.

282
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,214
Your aunt and uncle don't.

283
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,923
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

284
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:15,557
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash-

285
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:17,432
You really freaked us out.

286
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:19,883
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

287
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:24,134
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

288
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:30,433
So where are you going
after you graduate?

289
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:37,482
I wanna move into the city.

290
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:43,195
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

291
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:46,201
Work my way through college.

292
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,530
What about you?

293
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,695
Headed for the city too.

294
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,654
Can't wait to get out of here.

295
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,326
I wanna....

296
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:59,077
What?

297
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,161
No, come on. Try me.

298
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:06,583
I wanna...

299
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,044
...act...

300
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:11,711
...on-stage.

301
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,127
Really?

302
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:16,669
Oh, that's perfect.

303
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:19,509
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

304
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:21,674
-Really?
-Yeah.

305
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:25,307
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

306
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,016
Peter, that was first grade.

307
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,013
Well...

308
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,057
...even so.

309
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,973
Sometimes...

310
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,476
...you know people.

311
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:42,233
You can just see what's coming.

312
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:48,074
What do you see coming for you?

313
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,318
I don't know.

314
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:59,323
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

315
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:05,834
And what for me?

316
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:07,330
For you?

317
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:11,505
You're gonna light up Broadway.

318
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,335
You know...

319
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,339
...you're taller than you look.

320
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,054
I hunch.

321
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:26,799
Don't.

322
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:33,884
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

323
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,259
Come on.

324
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:38,683
I gotta go.

325
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,685
Bye.

326
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,027
-Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
-Yeah, right.

327
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,185
-Look at it!
-Hop in.

328
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,603
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

329
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,440
Pretty tight, huh?

330
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:55,192
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

331
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:58,195
Cool car.

332
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,924
What's going on in there?

333
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,758
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

334
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,595
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

335
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,967
Okay. Thanks.

336
00:34:12,788 --> 00:34:16,119
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

337
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,958
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

338
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,789
I just don't know anymore.

339
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,748
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

340
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:28,329
-Wait. I'll drive you there.
-I'll take the train.

341
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:31,755
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

342
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:46,257
-Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
-Wait. We need to talk.

343
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:50,809
-We can talk later.
-Well, we can talk now. lf you let me.

344
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,929
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

345
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:58,148
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.

346
00:34:58,317 --> 00:35:03,309
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

347
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:07,612
-You start fights at school.
-I told you I didn't start that fight.

348
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:10,775
-You sure finished it.
-Was I supposed to run away?

349
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,990
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but....

350
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,702
You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

351
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,905
No. Not exactly.

352
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,994
These are the years
when a man changes...

353
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,164
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

354
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,420
Just be careful who you change into.

355
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,458
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

356
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:41,713
But just because you can
beat him up...

357
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,418
...doesn't give you the right to.

358
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:50,336
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

359
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:55,925
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

360
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:59,518
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

361
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:04,023
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.

362
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:07,025
Then stop pretending to be!

363
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:12,358
Right.

364
00:36:15,324 --> 00:36:17,280
I'll pick you up here at 10.

365
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,012
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

366
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:50,512
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

367
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:51,179
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

368
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:54,346
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

369
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:03,103
-One, two, three. That's it!
-Who's the man?

370
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:09,438
Ladies and gentlemen...

371
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:14,150
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

372
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,902
For $3000...

373
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:24,690
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

374
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:29,574
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

375
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:34,239
Who?

376
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:36,371
I know who.

377
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:41,375
The Flying Dutchman!

378
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:43,170
Next.

379
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:47,289
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

380
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,291
No, no. Sign me up.

381
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:53,132
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

382
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:57,507
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

383
00:37:57,722 --> 00:38:00,840
And you're participating
under your own free will?

384
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:05,059
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

385
00:38:07,644 --> 00:38:09,885
Told you! Told you!

386
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,896
Winner!

387
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:13,304
Next victim!

388
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:18,061
Are you ready for more?

389
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:22,775
Bone Saw is ready!

390
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:29,858
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

391
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:34,782
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

392
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:39,414
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to-

393
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:43,291
-What's your name, kid?
-The Human Spider.

394
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:46,248
That's it? That's the best you got?

395
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,541
-Yeah.
-Oh, that sucks.

396
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:53,208
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

397
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:56,632
...the terrifying, the deadly...

398
00:38:56,885 --> 00:39:00,086
...the amazing Spider-Man!

399
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:05,092
-It's "The Human Spider."
-Get out there.

400
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:08,300
-No, he got my name wrong.
-Get out there, moron.

401
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:13,347
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

402
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,643
I hope you brought your mommy.

403
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:20,059
-We'll break you!
-You'll need someone to cry to.

404
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:25,731
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

405
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:28,275
Oh, my God!

406
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:30,112
Oh, my legs!

407
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,902
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

408
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,067
Kill! Kill! Kill!

409
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:44,824
Cage! Cage! Cage!

410
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:46,197
Cage!

411
00:39:55,547 --> 00:39:57,005
Hello? Guys?

412
00:39:58,048 --> 00:40:03,005
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

413
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,010
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

414
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,670
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

415
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,681
Hey, freak show!

416
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:16,512
You're going nowhere.

417
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:19,056
I got you for three minutes.

418
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:21,516
Three minutes of playtime.

419
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,601
-What are you doing up there?
-Staying away from you.

420
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,862
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

421
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:43,076
Finish him off!

422
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,789
Smash him!

423
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:00,704
-Hit him!
-Harder!

424
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:05,039
Kick his spider ass!

425
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,213
Hit him!

426
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:23,434
One, two, three!

427
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:26,431
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

428
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:31,679
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

429
00:41:49,077 --> 00:41:50,737
Now get out of here.

430
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:55,204
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

431
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:57,786
Well, check it again, webhead.

432
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,824
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

433
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:05,411
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

434
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:06,963
I need that money.

435
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:10,505
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

436
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:21,929
-Hey, what the hell-?
-Put the money in the bag.

437
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,094
Hurry up!

438
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:33,512
Hey! He stole the gate!

439
00:42:33,688 --> 00:42:35,646
Stop that guy!

440
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,478
Stop him! He's got my money!

441
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:39,936
Thanks.

442
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:43,565
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

443
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:45,978
Cut him off and call the cops!

444
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:50,199
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

445
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,733
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

446
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,338
-You gotta get back.
-I can't see. What happened?

447
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:15,047
-You gotta get back.
-I can't see. What happened?

448
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,673
Old dude, man.

449
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:22,045
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

450
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:25,054
-What happened?
-Someone got hurt.

451
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:30,634
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Stay back.

452
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,969
-Stay back!
-That's my uncle!

453
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,764
-What happened?
-Carjacker. He's been shot.

454
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:41,429
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

455
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:43,023
Uncle Ben?

456
00:43:43,942 --> 00:43:45,436
Uncle Ben.

457
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:50,523
Uncle Ben?

458
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:55,650
Peter.

459
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,324
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

460
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:05,152
Peter.

461
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:30,172
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

462
00:44:30,387 --> 00:44:35,096
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

463
00:47:12,157 --> 00:47:14,065
Get a unit to the rear!

464
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,661
I got the back!

465
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:32,914
Who's there?

466
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:02,306
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

467
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:06,976
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

468
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,644
Answer me!

469
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:13,315
Stop that guy!

470
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,490
Thanks.

471
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:31,487
See you.

472
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:56,630
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

473
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,793
Oh, no. My God.

474
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:47,369
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

475
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,672
-Good evening.
-General. Good to see you.

476
00:49:59,472 --> 00:50:02,342
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

477
00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:07,934
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

478
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:12,177
-He's clear! Go!
-You're confident about this test?

479
00:50:12,355 --> 00:50:14,643
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

480
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:18,150
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

481
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,230
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

482
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,606
Preflight complete. Mark.

483
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:34,362
An unidentified object
is closing fast.

484
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:35,614
What's that?

485
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,280
Can you see anything?

486
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,121
Oh, my God!

487
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,255
-Say "chess."
-Chess!

488
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:54,628
Peter!

489
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,382
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

490
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:03,050
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

491
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:04,762
-Great!
-You made it.

492
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:10,847
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

493
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,425
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Dad.

494
00:51:14,853 --> 00:51:17,425
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

495
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:19,135
Yeah.

496
00:51:22,108 --> 00:51:25,476
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

497
00:51:25,652 --> 00:51:28,900
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

498
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:30,653
Commencement:

499
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:34,947
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

500
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:40,447
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

501
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,202
You know what? Whatever.

502
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:45,204
Your loss.

503
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:49,447
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

504
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:53,456
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

505
00:52:07,344 --> 00:52:09,585
Can I fix you something?

506
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:11,257
No, thanks.

507
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:58,206
I missed him a lot today.

508
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:02,289
I know.

509
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,873
I miss him too.

510
00:53:07,632 --> 00:53:09,958
But he was there.

511
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:18,342
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

512
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,550
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

513
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:27,385
You loved him...

514
00:53:29,063 --> 00:53:31,304
...and he loved you.

515
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,853
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

516
00:53:36,025 --> 00:53:39,476
How you were meant for great things.

517
00:53:40,028 --> 00:53:42,353
You won't disappoint him.

518
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:20,047
With great power
comes great responsibility.

519
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:23,422
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.

520
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:34,681
Hurry up!

521
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,818
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

522
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,193
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

523
00:54:58,286 --> 00:55:01,038
Bobby. Get a load of this!

524
00:55:04,206 --> 00:55:08,452
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

525
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:12,878
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

526
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:15,666
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

527
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,590
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

528
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:20,797
He stinks and I don't like him.

529
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,086
Don't move, lady!

530
00:55:31,182 --> 00:55:33,932
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

531
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,264
Those tights and that tight little-

532
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:39,768
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

533
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,726
But we should all just give him
One big hug

534
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,518
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

535
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:55,943
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

536
00:55:56,114 --> 00:55:58,242
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

537
00:55:58,242 --> 00:55:59,117
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

538
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:00,117
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

539
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:01,117
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs-

540
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:01,619
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs-

541
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:03,452
-There's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem.

542
00:56:03,452 --> 00:56:05,777
-There's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem.

543
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:07,496
-Well?
-He's news.

544
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:10,195
-The clients can't wait.
-They're about to.

545
00:56:10,373 --> 00:56:14,371
-He pulled six people off a subway.
-From a wreck he probably caused.

546
00:56:14,543 --> 00:56:18,706
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

547
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,827
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

548
00:56:23,007 --> 00:56:25,793
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

549
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:29,003
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

550
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,632
-Whichever's cheaper.
-It's like this:

551
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:35,635
We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have-

552
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:38,972
-We sold out four printings.
-Sold out?

553
00:56:39,143 --> 00:56:40,340
Every copy.

554
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:44,724
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

555
00:56:44,896 --> 00:56:47,813
-That's a problem.
-Then make it page eight.

556
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,641
-That can't be done.
-Get out!

557
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:54,690
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

558
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,983
Aw, what is he, shy?

559
00:56:57,153 --> 00:57:01,150
If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

560
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:04,737
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider-Man picture."

561
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:08,358
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

562
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:22,246
Buzz off.

563
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,914
-M.J., it's me, Peter.
-Hi!

564
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:32,505
-What are you doing around here?
-Begging for a job. How about you?

565
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,708
-I'm headed to an audition.
-An audition? So you're acting?

566
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:37,918
Yeah.

567
00:57:38,137 --> 00:57:42,003
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

568
00:57:42,182 --> 00:57:43,344
That's great.

569
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:47,135
-You're doing it. Living your dream.
-Glamour girl!

570
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:48,934
Your drawer was short $6!

571
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:51,724
Next time, I'll take it
from your check.

572
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:56,597
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

573
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:59,105
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

574
00:57:59,277 --> 00:58:03,402
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

575
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,074
Some dream, huh?

576
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:15,572
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

577
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:18,532
-Don't tell Harry.
-Don't tell Harry?

578
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:23,532
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

579
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,536
Oh, yeah. Right.

580
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,876
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

581
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:33,456
-He'd think it was low or something.
-It's not low. You have a job.

582
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:38,126
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

583
00:58:39,635 --> 00:58:41,543
No, I guess not.

584
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,134
Thanks, Pete.

585
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,467
We should catch up sometime.

586
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:58,224
Let's get some lunch some evening.

587
00:58:59,481 --> 00:59:03,976
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

588
00:59:04,193 --> 00:59:06,896
-And I won't tell Harry.
-Don't tell Harry.

589
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,313
I won't.

590
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:12,231
I won't tell Harry.

591
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,992
Timing's perfect. Hey.

592
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:29,490
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

593
00:59:31,626 --> 00:59:34,331
Norman's making his weekly inspection.

594
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:37,369
Spent half of it on the phone.

595
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:42,672
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

596
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,789
Are you all right?

597
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:50,677
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

598
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:54,925
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

599
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,641
You were late again?

600
00:59:57,268 --> 01:00:01,217
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

601
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:02,639
Around.

602
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:04,521
Peter Parker.

603
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:07,347
-Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
-Who?

604
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:10,608
-This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
-Dad.

605
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:12,644
When do I get to meet her?

606
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,103
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

607
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:22,239
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

608
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:25,284
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

609
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:29,780
-I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
-I'll make a few calls.

610
01:00:29,956 --> 01:00:34,248
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn
what I get. I'll find work.

611
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,083
I respect that.

612
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:38,916
You want to make it on your own.

613
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:40,914
That's great.

614
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:44,121
What other skills do you have?

615
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,461
I was thinking about photography.

616
01:00:49,425 --> 01:00:50,670
Hello.

617
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:54,882
Let's go! Move it!

618
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,715
Watch the street!

619
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:14,525
Cheese!

620
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:24,728
They're crap.

621
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,902
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

622
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,282
-I'll give you $200.
-That seems a little low.

623
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:33,237
Take them somewhere else.

624
01:01:33,663 --> 01:01:37,740
-Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
-We'll put a rug there.

625
01:01:38,123 --> 01:01:40,079
Sit down. Give me that.

626
01:01:41,668 --> 01:01:44,204
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.

627
01:01:44,378 --> 01:01:46,702
-Scrap page one. Run that.
-Headline?

628
01:01:47,005 --> 01:01:50,206
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."

629
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:53,500
-Menace? He was protecting-
-You take the photos...

630
01:01:53,717 --> 01:01:56,385
...I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

631
01:01:56,552 --> 01:01:58,543
-Yes, sir.
-Goody.

632
01:01:59,012 --> 01:02:02,510
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

633
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:05,759
-I'd like a job, sir.
-No jobs. Freelance.

634
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:07,599
Best thing for you.

635
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:12,101
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.

636
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,264
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

637
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:19,731
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

638
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:22,516
-Hi.
-Hi.

639
01:02:22,735 --> 01:02:26,150
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

640
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:30,356
-Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
-Thank you.

641
01:02:30,907 --> 01:02:32,282
I'm Peter Parker.

642
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,943
I'm a photographer.

643
01:02:37,744 --> 01:02:40,282
Yes. I can see that.

644
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:49,827
As of today...

645
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:53,998
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

646
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:58,666
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

647
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:01,675
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

648
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,009
...costs are down, revenues are up...

649
01:03:05,262 --> 01:03:08,097
...and our stock
has never been higher.

650
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:12,675
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

651
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:14,762
What?

652
01:03:14,976 --> 01:03:20,099
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

653
01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:23,106
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

654
01:03:23,273 --> 01:03:24,436
Why wasn't I told?

655
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:28,686
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

656
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:31,273
The deal is off if you come with it.

657
01:03:31,445 --> 01:03:34,860
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

658
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:37,030
You can't do this to me.

659
01:03:40,202 --> 01:03:42,489
I started this company.

660
01:03:43,536 --> 01:03:45,943
You know how much I sacrificed?!

661
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:55,244
-Oh, Max. Please.
-Norman, the board is unanimous.

662
01:03:55,795 --> 01:03:59,791
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

663
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:01,458
I'm sorry.

664
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:04,588
You're out, Norman.

665
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:15,967
Am I?

666
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:22,936
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.

667
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:23,938
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

668
01:04:23,938 --> 01:04:24,438
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

669
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:24,980
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

670
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,686
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

671
01:05:03,086 --> 01:05:06,621
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

672
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:11,336
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

673
01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:16,050
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

674
01:05:16,596 --> 01:05:18,967
I think you're beautiful.

675
01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:35,021
I forgot my drink inside.

676
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:47,360
-Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
-Oh, Harry.

677
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:53,608
-Have you seen my father?
-Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

678
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:08,117
-What is that?
-Must be new this year.

679
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:14,286
What is that?

680
01:06:14,465 --> 01:06:16,375
That's our glider!

681
01:06:26,766 --> 01:06:28,224
What the hell was that?

682
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:58,027
Code three!

683
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:16,202
-Oh, my God! Harry!
-M.J.!

684
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:25,626
Harry! Help me! Harry!

685
01:07:31,597 --> 01:07:33,340
Out, am I?

686
01:07:37,893 --> 01:07:41,096
-Mary Jane!
-Harry!

687
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:44,978
Hello, my dear.

688
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:47,809
It's Spider-Man!

689
01:07:59,324 --> 01:08:01,280
-Come on. Move, kid.
-Billy!

690
01:08:04,786 --> 01:08:07,110
Somebody help him!

691
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:09,367
No!

692
01:08:10,373 --> 01:08:11,914
Mommy!

693
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,873
-Hold it!
-I surrender.

694
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,949
-Oh, boy.
-Hold it right there!

695
01:08:24,756 --> 01:08:26,002
Impressive.

696
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:53,722
-Mary Jane!
-Help! Someone please help me!

697
01:09:19,082 --> 01:09:20,113
Hold on!

698
01:09:21,752 --> 01:09:22,782
Watch out!

699
01:09:31,925 --> 01:09:35,707
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

700
01:10:21,206 --> 01:10:23,873
Well, beats taking the subway.

701
01:10:24,082 --> 01:10:27,332
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

702
01:10:27,502 --> 01:10:28,615
Wait.

703
01:10:28,793 --> 01:10:30,038
Who are you?

704
01:10:30,212 --> 01:10:32,783
-You know who I am.
-I do?

705
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:35,626
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

706
01:10:47,347 --> 01:10:51,213
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

707
01:10:52,391 --> 01:10:56,055
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.

708
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:58,387
No, I'm gonna come-

709
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:02,145
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

710
01:11:02,356 --> 01:11:05,310
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

711
01:11:05,484 --> 01:11:07,771
...I want to buy you something.

712
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:11,275
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

713
01:11:12,322 --> 01:11:15,985
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

714
01:11:18,826 --> 01:11:21,197
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

715
01:11:21,368 --> 01:11:23,112
Don't let the bedbugs-

716
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:31,826
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

717
01:11:33,543 --> 01:11:37,159
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

718
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:41,172
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

719
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,375
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

720
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,962
You're right.

721
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:49,380
I didn't.

722
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,796
I'm gonna get some rest.

723
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:59,300
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

724
01:12:00,394 --> 01:12:02,136
What was that thing?

725
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:04,056
I don't know.

726
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,847
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

727
01:12:24,743 --> 01:12:26,243
Somebody there?

728
01:12:26,243 --> 01:12:27,036
Somebody.

729
01:12:27,036 --> 01:12:28,694
Somebody.

730
01:12:30,037 --> 01:12:31,578
Who said that?

731
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:35,579
Don't play the innocent with me.

732
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:40,711
You've known all along.

733
01:12:44,713 --> 01:12:46,088
Where are you?

734
01:12:46,256 --> 01:12:50,300
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

735
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,006
I'm right here.

736
01:13:00,765 --> 01:13:02,757
I don't understand.

737
01:13:03,768 --> 01:13:06,932
Did you think it was coincidence?

738
01:13:07,185 --> 01:13:10,720
So many good things,
all happening for you.

739
01:13:10,896 --> 01:13:14,560
All for you. Norman.

740
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:18,520
What do you want?

741
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:21,108
To say what you won't.

742
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:23,940
To do what you can't.

743
01:13:24,113 --> 01:13:28,690
To remove those in your way.

744
01:13:32,661 --> 01:13:34,617
The board members.

745
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,287
You killed them.

746
01:13:37,456 --> 01:13:38,997
We killed them.

747
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,363
We?

748
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,123
Remember?

749
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,960
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

750
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:48,627
The performance enhancers.

751
01:13:48,796 --> 01:13:54,085
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

752
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,082
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

753
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:01,130
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

754
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:03,793
And it's only the beginning.

755
01:14:05,306 --> 01:14:09,634
There's only one who can stop us.

756
01:14:10,435 --> 01:14:13,802
Or imagine if he joined us.

757
01:14:18,606 --> 01:14:21,809
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

758
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:25,315
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

759
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:28,485
-These weirdos all got to have a name.
-Mr. Jameson-

760
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:30,314
-Hoffman!
-Yeah?

761
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:35,279
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

762
01:14:35,492 --> 01:14:37,779
How about "Green Meanie"?

763
01:14:37,952 --> 01:14:40,822
Spider-Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.

764
01:14:40,996 --> 01:14:43,319
It is not. I resent that.

765
01:14:43,581 --> 01:14:46,332
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

766
01:14:46,498 --> 01:14:48,158
You don't trust anybody.

767
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:50,368
I trust my barber.

768
01:14:51,211 --> 01:14:52,703
Are you his lawyer?

769
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:57,663
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country-

770
01:15:05,177 --> 01:15:08,296
Jameson, you slime.

771
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:11,797
Who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

772
01:15:12,015 --> 01:15:14,931
-I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
-Liar!

773
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,100
-I swear.
-He's the one who can bring me to him.

774
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,185
-I don't know who he is.
-You are useless.

775
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:23,637
Set him down, tough guy.

776
01:15:23,898 --> 01:15:28,475
-Speak of the devil.
-I knew you two were in this together!

777
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:31,265
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

778
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,940
Sleep....

779
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:52,409
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

780
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:56,993
No, you're not dead yet.

781
01:15:57,211 --> 01:15:59,368
Just paralyzed...

782
01:15:59,546 --> 01:16:01,502
...temporarily.

783
01:16:02,506 --> 01:16:05,588
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

784
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,467
You and I are not so different.

785
01:16:09,176 --> 01:16:12,509
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

786
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,590
Well, to each his own.

787
01:16:15,764 --> 01:16:18,716
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

788
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:24,016
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

789
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:27,476
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

790
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:31,270
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

791
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,981
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

792
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:37,225
Why bother?

793
01:16:37,444 --> 01:16:42,152
-Because it's right.
-Here's the real truth.

794
01:16:42,573 --> 01:16:45,573
There are eight million people
in this city.

795
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:50,076
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

796
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:54,234
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

797
01:16:54,413 --> 01:16:55,823
You, me...

798
01:16:56,414 --> 01:16:58,323
...we're exceptional.

799
01:16:58,582 --> 01:17:03,243
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

800
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:07,125
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

801
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:10,878
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

802
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:13,841
What we could create.

803
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:16,418
Or we could destroy.

804
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:20,542
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

805
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:25,637
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

806
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,512
Think about it, hero.

807
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:47,823
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

808
01:17:58,162 --> 01:17:59,621
It's me again.

809
01:17:59,997 --> 01:18:01,408
How was your audition?

810
01:18:01,622 --> 01:18:04,622
-How'd you know?
-The hot line. Your mom...

811
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,747
...told my aunt, told me.

812
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,537
So you just came by?

813
01:18:08,752 --> 01:18:12,369
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

814
01:18:12,546 --> 01:18:17,123
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but....

815
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:18,877
So how'd it go?

816
01:18:21,051 --> 01:18:23,625
They said I needed acting lessons.

817
01:18:23,804 --> 01:18:27,551
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

818
01:18:27,722 --> 01:18:33,060
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

819
01:18:34,394 --> 01:18:36,469
I'd like a cheeseburger.

820
01:18:36,936 --> 01:18:40,386
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

821
01:18:40,814 --> 01:18:42,225
Come with us.

822
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:45,149
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

823
01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:49,559
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

824
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,564
It's not?

825
01:18:52,988 --> 01:18:54,649
Why so interested?

826
01:18:55,323 --> 01:18:56,818
I'm not.

827
01:18:57,074 --> 01:18:58,449
You're not?

828
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:02,828
-Well, why would I be?
-I don't know.

829
01:19:03,078 --> 01:19:04,869
Why would you be?

830
01:19:06,747 --> 01:19:09,072
I, that's a-

831
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,784
I don't know.

832
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:15,836
Sorry you won't come with us.

833
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:20,252
I'd better run, tiger.

834
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:30,962
Hey, check it out, man.

835
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:32,797
Come on, man.

836
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,599
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

837
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:58,947
Get off me!

838
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:33,712
Wait!

839
01:20:38,555 --> 01:20:40,927
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

840
01:20:41,099 --> 01:20:45,475
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

841
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,559
I was in the neighborhood.

842
01:20:49,438 --> 01:20:52,059
You are amazing.

843
01:20:53,024 --> 01:20:55,728
Some people don't think so.

844
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:59,818
-But you are.
-Nice to have a fan.

845
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,771
Do I get to say thank you this time?

846
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:06,149
Wait.

847
01:22:15,118 --> 01:22:17,239
Let me in! My baby's in there!

848
01:22:17,411 --> 01:22:19,533
-Let me go!
-The roof's collapsing!

849
01:22:19,703 --> 01:22:23,202
-Somebody save my baby!
-The roof's about to collapse!

850
01:22:23,413 --> 01:22:24,742
Look! Up there!

851
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:33,162
Save my baby, please!

852
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:58,007
No!

853
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:09,770
-It's okay. Your baby's fine.
-Oh, my baby!

854
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,735
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

855
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,689
Don't let him get away!

856
01:23:15,905 --> 01:23:19,154
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

857
01:23:19,324 --> 01:23:22,657
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

858
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:25,448
I'm going.

859
01:23:27,122 --> 01:23:30,157
-I'll be here when you get back.
-Not coming back.

860
01:23:30,582 --> 01:23:31,695
Go! Go!

861
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:42,337
Where are you?

862
01:23:44,381 --> 01:23:45,960
Where are you?

863
01:23:51,345 --> 01:23:53,716
I'm gonna get you out of here!

864
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:57,800
It's okay.

865
01:24:04,854 --> 01:24:07,426
You're pathetically predictable.

866
01:24:07,605 --> 01:24:09,514
Like a moth to the flame.

867
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:12,854
What about my generous proposal?

868
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,734
Are you in or are you out?

869
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:22,862
-It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
-Wrong answer.

870
01:24:23,282 --> 01:24:24,775
Oh, great.

871
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:06,219
No one says no to me!

872
01:25:13,564 --> 01:25:16,979
-M.J., will you stop goofing around?
-Harry, relax.

873
01:25:19,484 --> 01:25:20,729
He's here.

874
01:25:21,527 --> 01:25:23,020
Are you ready?

875
01:25:24,863 --> 01:25:27,530
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

876
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:30,823
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

877
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:34,448
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

878
01:25:34,703 --> 01:25:37,405
Who is this lovely young lady?

879
01:25:37,578 --> 01:25:41,872
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

880
01:25:42,082 --> 01:25:44,751
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

881
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:48,658
-Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
-Now, where is Peter?

882
01:25:48,836 --> 01:25:51,207
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

883
01:25:56,966 --> 01:26:00,547
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

884
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:05,047
Peter?

885
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,809
Is that you?

886
01:26:20,273 --> 01:26:24,435
How strange. There's nobody here.

887
01:26:30,904 --> 01:26:35,363
-Bit of a slob, isn't he?
-All brilliant men are.

888
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:10,590
-Hey, everyone.
-Oh, Peter!

889
01:27:10,762 --> 01:27:12,506
It's a jungle out there.

890
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:16,594
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

891
01:27:17,059 --> 01:27:19,893
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

892
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,637
...and we can say grace.

893
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:26,931
Here we go.

894
01:27:33,903 --> 01:27:36,228
-There we are.
-It looks delicious.

895
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,319
Will you do the honors?

896
01:27:53,998 --> 01:27:57,247
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

897
01:28:00,086 --> 01:28:05,422
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

898
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,131
Well, let me see.

899
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:08,835
Oh, my goodness.

900
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:11,498
-That looks awful.
-No, it's nothing.

901
01:28:11,676 --> 01:28:14,796
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

902
01:28:15,012 --> 01:28:20,301
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

903
01:28:21,266 --> 01:28:24,350
How did you say that happened?

904
01:28:24,769 --> 01:28:26,475
Bike messenger.

905
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:28,643
Knocked me down.

906
01:28:34,024 --> 01:28:37,688
-If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
-Why?

907
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:41,979
Something has come to my attention.

908
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:43,440
Are you all right?

909
01:28:43,655 --> 01:28:47,154
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

910
01:28:47,783 --> 01:28:50,154
-Enjoy the fruitcake.
-Dad!

911
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:56,110
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

912
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:57,989
I've got to go.

913
01:28:58,332 --> 01:29:02,457
-This girl is important to me.
-Harry, please. Look at her.

914
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:06,615
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

915
01:29:06,878 --> 01:29:09,878
-What are you saying?
-Your mother was beautiful.

916
01:29:10,047 --> 01:29:15,466
They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.

917
01:29:15,676 --> 01:29:16,921
You're wrong, Dad.

918
01:29:17,469 --> 01:29:20,671
A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:

919
01:29:20,845 --> 01:29:24,712
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

920
01:29:35,104 --> 01:29:37,641
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

921
01:29:37,856 --> 01:29:40,810
-You heard?
-Everyone heard that creep.

922
01:29:41,025 --> 01:29:44,891
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

923
01:29:45,153 --> 01:29:47,478
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

924
01:29:47,654 --> 01:29:49,314
Harry Osborn!

925
01:29:50,405 --> 01:29:52,444
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

926
01:29:55,409 --> 01:29:58,742
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

927
01:29:58,912 --> 01:30:02,030
But Parker, we can destroy him.

928
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:03,574
I can't.

929
01:30:03,747 --> 01:30:06,747
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

930
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,240
Parker must be educated.

931
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,699
What do I do?

932
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:16,998
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

933
01:30:17,172 --> 01:30:20,208
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

934
01:30:20,466 --> 01:30:21,747
Yes?

935
01:30:21,926 --> 01:30:23,835
And then grant his wish.

936
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:26,042
But how?

937
01:30:26,262 --> 01:30:30,555
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

938
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:31,927
Tell me how!

939
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,256
The heart, Osborn.

940
01:30:34,518 --> 01:30:37,552
First, we attack his heart.

941
01:30:39,438 --> 01:30:42,935
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

942
01:30:43,148 --> 01:30:46,100
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

943
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:50,189
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us-

944
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:00,485
Deliver us!

945
01:31:00,701 --> 01:31:02,076
Finish it!

946
01:31:02,368 --> 01:31:06,282
-Finish it!
-From evil!

947
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,158
Two milligrams IV.

948
01:31:15,961 --> 01:31:17,204
Get the BP.

949
01:31:17,628 --> 01:31:21,210
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

950
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:22,751
You have to leave.

951
01:31:22,923 --> 01:31:24,631
-What happened?
-Those eyes!

952
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,877
Those horrible yellow eyes!

953
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,259
He knows who I am.

954
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:21,787
I'm sorry.

955
01:32:25,505 --> 01:32:27,960
-Will she be okay?
-She'll be fine.

956
01:32:28,131 --> 01:32:30,800
She's been sleeping all day.

957
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:34,551
-Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

958
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:41,637
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

959
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:45,506
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

960
01:32:45,725 --> 01:32:48,679
-Have you talked to Harry?
-He called me.

961
01:32:49,145 --> 01:32:51,302
I haven't called him back.

962
01:32:53,398 --> 01:32:55,104
The fact is...

963
01:32:56,274 --> 01:32:59,109
-...I'm in love with somebody else.
-You are?

964
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:01,481
At least I think I am.

965
01:33:03,154 --> 01:33:06,189
-It's not the time to talk about it.
-No. Go on.

966
01:33:06,363 --> 01:33:09,613
Would I know his name, this guy?

967
01:33:09,824 --> 01:33:12,694
You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.

968
01:33:12,868 --> 01:33:14,243
Trust me.

969
01:33:14,493 --> 01:33:15,738
It's funny.

970
01:33:17,746 --> 01:33:21,694
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

971
01:33:21,873 --> 01:33:25,242
-Oh. Him.
-You're laughing at me.

972
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:28,412
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

973
01:33:28,627 --> 01:33:32,921
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

974
01:33:33,088 --> 01:33:36,006
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

975
01:33:36,216 --> 01:33:37,840
I know him a little bit.

976
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:40,921
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

977
01:33:41,136 --> 01:33:44,255
-Has he mentioned me?
-Yeah.

978
01:33:44,596 --> 01:33:46,055
What'd he say?

979
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,967
I said....

980
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:53,350
He asked me what I thought about you.

981
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,307
And what did you say?

982
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:01,100
I said, "Spider-Man."

983
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:06,314
I said, "The great thing about M.J...

984
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:08,069
...is...

985
01:34:08,987 --> 01:34:12,235
...when you look in her eyes...

986
01:34:14,783 --> 01:34:17,984
...and she's looking back in yours...

987
01:34:18,993 --> 01:34:21,993
...everything feels...

988
01:34:23,204 --> 01:34:25,030
...not quite normal.

989
01:34:26,289 --> 01:34:28,081
Because you feel...

990
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,248
...stronger...

991
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:35,409
...and weaker at the same time.

992
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,585
You feel excited...

993
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:41,503
...and at the same time...

994
01:34:42,132 --> 01:34:43,756
...terrified.

995
01:34:46,094 --> 01:34:50,386
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

996
01:34:51,805 --> 01:34:55,422
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

997
01:34:58,143 --> 01:35:00,016
It's as if you've...

998
01:35:00,645 --> 01:35:03,810
...reached the unreachable...

999
01:35:05,398 --> 01:35:08,101
...and you weren't ready for it."

1000
01:35:11,569 --> 01:35:13,310
You said that?

1001
01:35:14,112 --> 01:35:16,435
Well, something like that.

1002
01:36:00,725 --> 01:36:02,219
Dad?

1003
01:36:07,563 --> 01:36:09,637
Dad, is that you?

1004
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:17,728
What is it?

1005
01:36:19,987 --> 01:36:24,979
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1006
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:28,694
She's in love with Peter.

1007
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:30,783
-Parker?
-Yeah.

1008
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:34,070
And how does he feel about her?

1009
01:36:35,497 --> 01:36:38,033
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1010
01:36:38,998 --> 01:36:44,239
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1011
01:36:47,171 --> 01:36:48,913
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:54,832
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

1013
01:36:56,594 --> 01:36:59,796
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1014
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:01,796
That's no excuse.

1015
01:37:02,805 --> 01:37:04,596
I'm proud of you.

1016
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:10,015
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1017
01:37:10,185 --> 01:37:13,435
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1018
01:37:27,572 --> 01:37:29,362
Wake up, little spider.

1019
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:31,024
Wake up.

1020
01:37:32,365 --> 01:37:33,943
Go home, dear.

1021
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:35,487
You look awful.

1022
01:37:35,702 --> 01:37:37,989
-And you look beautiful.
-Thank you.

1023
01:37:38,162 --> 01:37:41,493
-I don't like to leave you here.
-But I'm safe here.

1024
01:37:41,663 --> 01:37:44,368
-Can I do anything for you?
-You do too much.

1025
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:50,078
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1026
01:37:50,836 --> 01:37:52,578
A smile. Finally.

1027
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:57,082
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1028
01:37:57,256 --> 01:37:59,545
You were supposed to be asleep.

1029
01:38:00,384 --> 01:38:05,127
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1030
01:38:05,345 --> 01:38:09,341
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1031
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:15,805
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1032
01:38:16,019 --> 01:38:19,552
-Gee, did I say that?
-You sure did.

1033
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,981
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1034
01:38:25,192 --> 01:38:28,939
-She's still his girl.
-Well, isn't that up to her?

1035
01:38:29,152 --> 01:38:33,729
-She doesn't really know who I am.
-Because you won't let her.

1036
01:38:33,947 --> 01:38:37,065
You're so mysterious all the time.

1037
01:38:37,323 --> 01:38:40,074
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1038
01:38:40,283 --> 01:38:44,233
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1039
01:38:44,703 --> 01:38:47,110
Everybody else knows.

1040
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:51,320
I'll be right back.

1041
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:53,322
But....

1042
01:39:00,671 --> 01:39:02,663
Come on, pick up.

1043
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,125
-Hey M.J.
-Hi. Sing your song at the beep.

1044
01:39:07,176 --> 01:39:09,215
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1045
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:12,345
Hello? You there?

1046
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:17,341
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1047
01:39:17,515 --> 01:39:18,926
All right, well....

1048
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:20,381
Don't....

1049
01:39:21,185 --> 01:39:23,390
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1050
01:39:23,604 --> 01:39:25,096
Hello?

1051
01:39:27,523 --> 01:39:31,221
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1052
01:39:31,442 --> 01:39:33,185
Where is she?

1053
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,090
-What is that?
-That's cool!

1054
01:40:21,306 --> 01:40:25,931
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

1055
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:30,264
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

1056
01:40:47,073 --> 01:40:48,815
Goblin, what have you done?

1057
01:41:31,268 --> 01:41:35,134
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1058
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,180
Because you never know...

1059
01:41:37,354 --> 01:41:42,099
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1060
01:41:43,234 --> 01:41:45,854
Let die the woman you love...

1061
01:41:50,154 --> 01:41:55,229
...or suffer the little children.

1062
01:41:57,618 --> 01:42:00,108
-Spider-Man!
-Save us!

1063
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:02,908
Save us!

1064
01:42:03,204 --> 01:42:05,777
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1065
01:42:05,997 --> 01:42:09,365
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1066
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:11,618
Don't do it, Goblin!

1067
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:14,710
We are who we choose to be.

1068
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:17,712
-Now, choose!
-No!

1069
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:47,975
Everybody stay still!

1070
01:42:57,488 --> 01:42:58,769
Ahoy up there!

1071
01:42:58,948 --> 01:43:01,902
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1072
01:43:09,413 --> 01:43:13,539
-He's coming back!
-Listen. I need you to climb down.

1073
01:43:13,707 --> 01:43:15,202
-I can't.
-Yes, you can!

1074
01:43:20,296 --> 01:43:23,331
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1075
01:43:23,506 --> 01:43:25,082
Trust me.

1076
01:43:26,591 --> 01:43:30,421
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1077
01:43:34,762 --> 01:43:36,801
-Hurry!
-I can't. I can't do it.

1078
01:43:37,014 --> 01:43:38,673
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1079
01:44:07,117 --> 01:44:09,737
-He's not gonna make it.
-He's gonna make it!

1080
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:22,827
It's time to die.

1081
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,670
-I got something for you!
-We ought to kick your ass!

1082
01:44:33,841 --> 01:44:37,256
Leave Spider-Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

1083
01:44:37,927 --> 01:44:41,426
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1084
01:44:41,596 --> 01:44:45,131
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1085
01:44:57,649 --> 01:44:59,439
Spider-Man, watch out!

1086
01:45:31,295 --> 01:45:35,541
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1087
01:45:36,465 --> 01:45:39,086
I offered you friendship...

1088
01:45:39,259 --> 01:45:41,131
...and you spat in my face.

1089
01:46:32,208 --> 01:46:35,872
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1090
01:46:36,045 --> 01:46:39,377
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

1091
01:46:39,546 --> 01:46:41,206
...would have been quick.

1092
01:46:41,381 --> 01:46:44,796
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1093
01:46:45,051 --> 01:46:49,923
...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1094
01:46:54,515 --> 01:46:56,554
M.J. and I...

1095
01:46:57,391 --> 01:47:00,676
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1096
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:56,011
Peter, stop!

1097
01:47:56,179 --> 01:47:58,634
Stop! It's me.

1098
01:48:07,603 --> 01:48:09,096
Mr. Osborn.

1099
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,811
Thank God for you.

1100
01:48:11,021 --> 01:48:13,345
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1101
01:48:13,523 --> 01:48:16,559
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1102
01:48:16,734 --> 01:48:18,475
Don't let him take me again.

1103
01:48:18,652 --> 01:48:20,689
I beg you. Protect me.

1104
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:24,443
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1105
01:48:24,613 --> 01:48:26,106
But not you.

1106
01:48:26,782 --> 01:48:30,729
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1107
01:48:30,951 --> 01:48:33,025
I would never hurt you.

1108
01:48:33,243 --> 01:48:35,153
I knew from the beginning...

1109
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:38,287
...if anything ever happened to me...

1110
01:48:38,456 --> 01:48:40,578
...it was you I could count on.

1111
01:48:40,748 --> 01:48:44,117
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1112
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:46,536
Thank God for you.

1113
01:48:47,545 --> 01:48:48,954
Give me your hand.

1114
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:53,545
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1115
01:48:54,966 --> 01:48:57,752
I've been like a father to you.

1116
01:48:59,301 --> 01:49:00,962
Be a son to me now.

1117
01:49:02,762 --> 01:49:04,636
I have a father.

1118
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:07,880
His name was Ben Parker.

1119
01:49:09,766 --> 01:49:11,225
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1120
01:49:30,154 --> 01:49:31,649
Peter.

1121
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:35,817
Don't tell Harry.

1122
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:09,220
What have you done?

1123
01:50:09,389 --> 01:50:10,966
What have you done?!

1124
01:50:39,115 --> 01:50:41,154
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1125
01:50:42,076 --> 01:50:45,194
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1126
01:50:47,371 --> 01:50:50,654
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1127
01:50:52,248 --> 01:50:54,537
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1128
01:50:56,417 --> 01:50:59,537
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1129
01:51:04,548 --> 01:51:06,375
Thank God for you, Peter.

1130
01:51:07,091 --> 01:51:09,546
You're the only family I have.

1131
01:51:34,067 --> 01:51:36,354
No matter what I do...

1132
01:51:36,527 --> 01:51:39,645
...no matter how hard I try...

1133
01:51:40,238 --> 01:51:44,068
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1134
01:51:54,788 --> 01:51:57,113
You must miss him so much.

1135
01:51:58,082 --> 01:52:01,118
It's been so hard without him.

1136
01:52:04,045 --> 01:52:06,913
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1137
01:52:08,713 --> 01:52:10,505
When I was up there...

1138
01:52:11,257 --> 01:52:14,043
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1139
01:52:15,676 --> 01:52:19,507
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1140
01:52:20,805 --> 01:52:24,006
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1141
01:52:25,475 --> 01:52:27,881
It was you, Pete.

1142
01:52:28,769 --> 01:52:30,641
I kept thinking:

1143
01:52:31,061 --> 01:52:33,847
"I hope I make it through this...

1144
01:52:35,314 --> 01:52:39,689
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1145
01:52:41,068 --> 01:52:42,561
Really?

1146
01:52:42,944 --> 01:52:48,730
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1147
01:52:49,989 --> 01:52:51,947
...who makes me feel...

1148
01:52:52,408 --> 01:52:56,108
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1149
01:52:58,246 --> 01:52:59,904
That I'm just...

1150
01:53:00,581 --> 01:53:02,073
...me.

1151
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:05,073
And that's okay.

1152
01:53:07,292 --> 01:53:08,751
The truth is...

1153
01:53:10,878 --> 01:53:12,668
...I love you.

1154
01:53:14,797 --> 01:53:16,706
I love you so much, Peter.

1155
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:42,180
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1156
01:53:42,356 --> 01:53:44,265
I can't....

1157
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,943
You can't what?

1158
01:53:49,069 --> 01:53:50,528
Tell you...

1159
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:56,565
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1160
01:53:57,658 --> 01:54:01,570
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1161
01:54:02,494 --> 01:54:04,451
I want you to know...

1162
01:54:04,871 --> 01:54:07,539
...that I will always be there
for you.

1163
01:54:07,747 --> 01:54:11,697
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1164
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:14,702
I promise you that.

1165
01:54:18,005 --> 01:54:20,292
I will always be your friend.

1166
01:54:23,216 --> 01:54:25,088
Only a friend...

1167
01:54:25,967 --> 01:54:27,510
...Peter Parker?

1168
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:32,512
That's all I have to give.

1169
01:54:58,863 --> 01:55:01,532
Whatever life holds in store for me...

1170
01:55:01,698 --> 01:55:04,569
...I will never forget these words.:

1171
01:55:04,783 --> 01:55:09,823
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "

1172
01:55:09,996 --> 01:55:12,237
This is my gift.

1173
01:55:12,413 --> 01:55:14,536
My curse.

1174
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:16,948
Who am I?

1175
01:55:17,333 --> 01:55:18,708
I'm Spider-Man.
