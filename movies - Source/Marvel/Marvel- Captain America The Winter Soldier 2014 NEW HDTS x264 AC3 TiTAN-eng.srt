00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,410
Captain America: The Winter Soldier...

3
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:56,762
On your left.

4
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,721
On your left.

5
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:10,951
Aha.. On my left. Got it.

6
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:18,722
Don't say it! Don't you say it!
On your left!

7
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:19,871
Come on!

8
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:29,742
Need a medic?

9
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,561
I need a new set of lungs.

10
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:38,132
Dude, You just ran like
13 miles in 30 minutes.

11
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,331
I guess I got a late start.

12
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,841
For real?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

13
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:43,231
You should take another lap.

14
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,002
Did you just take it?
I assumed you just took it.

15
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:48,252
What unit you're with?

16
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,722
58th, Para-rescue.

17
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,852
But now I'm working
down at the VA.

18
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,091
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

19
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,861
I kinda put that together.

20
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,492
Must have freaked you out coming home
after the whole defrosting thing.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,361
It takes some getting used to.

22
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:03,962
It's good to meet you, Sam.

23
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,992
It's your bed, right?

24
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:09,021
What's that?
Your bed is too soft.

25
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,262
When I was over there
I slept on the ground,

26
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:13,472
used rock for pillows
like a caveman.

27
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,591
Now I'm home, laying in my bed,
and It's like...

28
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,852
Laying on a marshmallow.

29
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,673
I feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

30
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,122
How long?

31
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:23,671
Two tours.

32
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:25,981
You must missed
the good old days, huh?

33
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,752
Well, things aren't so bad.

34
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,252
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

35
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,521
No polio, it's good.

36
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:34,801
Internet. So helpful.

37
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,942
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

38
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,512
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
"Trouble Man" soundtrack.

39
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,192
Everything you've missed
jammed into one album.

40
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:46,502
I'll put it on the list.

41
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,201
_

42
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,241
_

43
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,812
_

44
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,901
All right, Sam, duty calls.

45
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:57,961
Thanks for the run.

46
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,361
If that's what
you wanna call running.

47
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,972
Oh, that's how it is?
That's how it is. Okay.

48
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:04,972
Any time you wanna
stop by the VA,

49
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,651
make me look awesome in front
of the girl at the front desk,

50
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,692
just let me know.
I'll keep it in mind.

51
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:15,931
Hey, fellas.

52
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:18,372
Either one of you know
where the Smithsonian is?

53
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:19,931
I'm gonna pick up a fossil.

54
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,382
It's hilarious.

55
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,081
- How you doing?
- Hey.

56
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:29,731
You can't run everywhere.

57
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:31,352
No, you can't.

58
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:38,731
_

59
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:41,211
The target is a mobile satellite
launch platform:

60
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,352
The Lemurian Star.

61
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:45,171
It was sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

62
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:46,401
93 minutes ago.

63
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,611
Any demands?
A billion and a half.

64
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,972
Why so stiff?
Because it SHIELD'S.

65
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,762
So it's not off course,
it's trespass.

66
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,292
I'm sure they have
a good reason.

67
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:58,122
You know, I'm getting tired
of being Fury's janitor.

68
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,181
Relax, it's not
that complicated.

69
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,301
How many pirates?

70
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:04,342
25. Top mercs, led by this guy.

71
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:08,401
Georges Batroc.
Ex TGSE. Action Division.

72
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:10,731
He's at the top of
Interpol's "red notice".

73
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:14,102
Before the French team mobilized him,
he had 36 kill missions.

74
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,072
This guy has a rep
for maximum casualties.

75
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,461
- Hostages?
- Uh, mostly techs,

76
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:21,192
One off icier, Jasper Sitwell.

77
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,242
They're in the galley.

78
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,112
What Sitwell doing
on a launch ship?

79
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,021
All right, I'm gonna sweep
the deck and find Batroc.

80
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,122
Nat, you'll kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

81
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:29,451
Rumlow, you sweep aft,

82
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,711
find the hostages,
get them to life pods.

83
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,572
Let's get them out.
STRIKE, you heard the Captain.

84
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,581
Gear up!

85
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:50,211
Secure channel seven.
Seven secure.

86
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,021
You do anything fun
Saturday night?

87
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:55,542
Well, all the guys from my
barbershop quartet are dead, so...

88
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,302
No, not really.

89
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,981
Coming up by the drop zone, Cap.

90
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,711
You know, if you ask
Kristen out, from Statistics,

91
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,422
she'll probably say yes.

92
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,862
That's why I don't ask.

93
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:08,521
Too shy or too scared?

94
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:09,731
Too busy!

95
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,141
Was he wearing a parachute?

96
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,481
No.

97
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,262
No, he wasn't.

98
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:12,771
Don't move!

99
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:18,762
Thanks. -Yeah. You seemed
pretty helpless without me.

100
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,031
What about the nurse that lives
across the hall from you?

101
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,172
She seems kinda nice.

102
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,012
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

103
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,591
I'm multitasking.

104
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:32,151
I said to Batroc...

105
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,862
If we want SHIELD to pay...

106
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:35,961
We have to start sending
bodies now!

107
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,542
I have a bullet for someone...

108
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,461
You want a bullet in your head?!

109
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,411
Move that leg.
Want a bullet in your head?

110
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:54,992
I do not like to wait.

111
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:58,161
Call Durand.

112
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,262
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as the rescue arrives.

113
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,552
Yes, Batroc.

114
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,351
Start the engine.

115
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,562
Okay.

116
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:14,632
Hey, sailor.

117
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,381
Shut up.

118
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:39,621
What is it? Want to be a hero?

119
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,711
Well, I waited too long...

120
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:52,851
Look for Batroc.

121
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,111
If I do not hear in two minutes...
I'll start to kill them!

122
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,652
I'll find him!

123
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:06,841
Two minutes.

124
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:40,101
Radio Silence from SHIELD, Batroc...

125
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,912
Targets acquired.

126
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:47,562
STRIKE in position.

127
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:49,861
Natasha, what's your status?

128
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,961
- Status, Natasha?
- Hang on.

129
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:11,711
Engine room is secure.

130
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:21,562
Time's up

131
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,981
Who wants to die first?

132
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,532
You! Take the girl.

133
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:31,601
On my mark.

134
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,871
Three...

135
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,221
Two...

136
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:36,591
One.

137
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,581
I told you,
SHIELD doesn't negotiate.

138
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,611
Hello?

139
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,861
Batroc, Line is dead.

140
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:51,673
I lost contact with them.

141
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,172
Hostages enroot to extraction.

142
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,621
Romanoff missed the
rendezvous point, Captain.

143
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,162
Hostiles are still in play.

144
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,772
Natasha, Batroc is on the move.

145
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:18,241
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

146
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,022
Natasha!

147
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,392
I thought that you
were more than just a shield.

148
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,381
We'll see.

149
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,052
This is awkward.

150
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:45,782
What are you doing?

151
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,772
Backing up the hard drive.
It's a good habit to get into.

152
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,763
Rumlow needed your help.
What the hell are you doing here?

153
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,042
You're saving SHIELD Intel.
Whatever I can get my hands on.

154
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:01,642
Our mission is to rescue hostages.
No. That's your mission...

155
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:04,912
And you've done it beautifully.

156
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,302
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

157
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:09,052
I think
that's overstating things.

158
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:27,831
Okay.

159
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,682
That one's on me.

160
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,741
You damn right.

161
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:52,451
_

162
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:03,121
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

163
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:06,032
I didn't lie. Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

164
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,761
Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.

165
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,601
I'm not obliged to do anything.

166
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,101
Those hostages
could've die, Nick.

167
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:14,672
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

168
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:17,241
Soldiers trust each other,
that's what makes it an army.

169
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,831
Not a bunch of guys
running around and shooting guns.

170
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,072
The last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

171
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,591
Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't uncomfortable with.

172
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:28,961
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

173
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,422
I can't lead a mission

174
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,251
when the people I'm leading
got missions of their owns.

175
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:34,611
It's called
compartmentalization.

176
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:38,221
Nobody spills the secrets
because nobody knows them all.

177
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:39,912
Except you.

178
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:44,932
You're wrong about me.

179
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:46,981
I do share.

180
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,711
I'm nice like that.

181
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:52,991
Insight bay.

182
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:55,581
Captain Rogers does not have
clearance for Project Insight.

183
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,182
Director override,
Fury, Nicholas J.

184
00:14:58,412 --> 00:14:59,662
Confirmed.

185
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:04,131
You know,
They used to play music.

186
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:05,868
Yeah.

187
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:08,942
My grandfather operated one
of this things for 40 years.

188
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,361
My granddad
worked in a nice building.

189
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,461
He got good tips.

190
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:18,101
He'd walk home every night,
roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

191
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,501
He'd say: "Hi!"

192
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,331
People would say "hi" back.

193
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:24,711
Time went on,
neighborhood got rougher.

194
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:26,451
He'd say: "Hi!"

195
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,001
They said, "Keep on steppin".

196
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,192
Grandad got to grip that
lunch bag a little tighter.

197
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,042
Did he ever get mugged?

198
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:37,432
Every week some punk would say:
"What's in the bag?"

199
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,022
What'd he do?

200
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:40,831
He'd show them.

201
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:45,062
A bunch of couple ones
and loaded 0.22 Mag.

202
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,552
My grandad loved people.

203
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:54,022
But he didn't
trust them very much.

204
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:00,942
Yeah, I know.

205
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:04,091
They're a little bit bigger
than that 0.22.

206
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:40,831
This is Project Insight.

207
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:43,312
Three next generation Helicarriers

208
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:46,231
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

209
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:47,802
Launched from the Lemurian Star.

210
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,912
Once we get them in the air
they never need to come down.

211
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:56,451
Continuous suborbital flight courtesy
of our new repulsive engines.

212
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:57,471
Stark?

213
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:01,792
He had a few suggestions once he got
enough close look at our old turbines.

214
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,561
These new long range
precision guns

215
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:07,011
can eliminate a thousand hostiles
in minute.

216
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:11,372
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

217
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,092
We gonna neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen.

218
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,192
I thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

219
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,821
We can't afford
to wait that long.

220
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:19,932
Who's "we"?

221
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,951
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

222
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:25,751
that we need an equine surgeon
threat analysis.

223
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,271
For once we
way ahead of the curve.

224
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,672
By holding a gun at everyone on Earth
and calling it protection?

225
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:35,612
You know,
I read those SSR files.

226
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,771
Greatest generation?

227
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:39,951
You guys did some nasty stuff.

228
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:42,231
Yeah, we compromised.

229
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,531
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

230
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:46,602
But we did it
so the people could be free.

231
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,172
This isn't freedom,
this is fear.

232
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:52,741
SHIELD takes the world as it is,
not as we like it to be.

233
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:56,501
It's getting damn near past time
for you get with the program, Cap.

234
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,112
Don't hold your breath.

235
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,402
Welcome to the Smithsonian.

236
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:24,061
Visitor information offices
are on the second floor.

237
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:33,231
_

238
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,991
A symbol to the nation.

239
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,072
A hero to the world.

240
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,402
The story of Captain America

241
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:45,352
is one of honor,
bravery and sacrifice.

242
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,572
Denied enlistment
due to poor health,

243
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:56,211
Steven Rogers was chosen
for program unique

244
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,162
in the annals
of American warfare.

245
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:04,321
One that would transform him
into world's first super soldier.

246
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,862
In this rare footage, everyone's
favorite warrior, Captain America...

247
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:15,951
Battle taste.

248
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:20,852
Captain America and his Howling
Commandos quickly earned their stripes.

249
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:22,622
Their mission,

250
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:26,321
taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.

251
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:32,001
Best friends since childhood.

252
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,951
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable

253
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,451
on both school yard
and battlefield.

254
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:43,352
Barnes is the only
Howling commando to give his life

255
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,741
in service of his country.

256
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:52,791
That was a difficult winter.

257
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,872
_
A blizzard trapped half a battalion

258
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:56,541
behind the German line.

259
00:19:57,342 --> 00:20:00,001
Steve... Captain Rogers,

260
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,082
He fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade

261
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,882
that had pinned our allies
down for months.

262
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,541
He saved over 1,000 men,

263
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:12,321
including the man who would...

264
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,942
who'd became my husband
as it turned out.

265
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,932
Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.

266
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,461
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

267
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:34,382
I have lived a life.

268
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:40,142
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

269
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,662
What is it?

270
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:50,001
For as long as I can remember
I just wanted to do what was right.

271
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,981
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

272
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,291
And I thought I could

273
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:02,142
throw myself back in and
follow orders. Serve.

274
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,182
It's just not the same.

275
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,761
You always so dramatic.

276
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:16,821
Look, you saved the world.

277
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:23,451
We rather... marked it up.

278
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:24,551
You didn't.

279
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:28,122
Knowing that you helped found SHIELD
is half the reason I stay.

280
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:38,592
The world has changed
and non of us could go back.

281
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,362
All we can do is our best.

282
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:46,102
And sometimes the best
we can do is to start over.

283
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,432
Peggy.

284
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,551
Steve.

285
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:03,511
Yeah.

286
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,372
You're alive!

287
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:10,041
You... you came, you came back.

288
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:11,102
Yeah, Peggy.

289
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:17,102
It's been so long.

290
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:20,652
So long.

291
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:23,731
Well, I couldn't leave
my best girl.

292
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:26,511
Not when she owes me a dance.

293
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:33,882
Secure office.

294
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,652
Open Lemurian Star satellite
launch file.

295
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,402
Access denied.

296
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:49,751
Run decryption.

297
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:53,471
Decryption failed.

298
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:56,531
Director override,
Fury, Nicholas J.

299
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:01,902
Override denied.
All files sealed.

300
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,001
On whose authority?

301
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,501
Fury, Nicholas J.

302
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,432
World Security Council.
Confirmed.

303
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,932
If Nick Fury
thinks he can get us

304
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:20,041
costumed thugs
and STRIKE commandos

305
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:22,321
to mop-up his mess,
he's sadly mistaken.

306
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:23,692
This failure is unacceptable.

307
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,422
Well, considering this attack
took place

308
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,531
one mile from my country
sovereign waters,

309
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:30,182
it's a bit more then that.
I move for an immediate hearing.

310
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,991
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

311
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:34,662
Is this Council's duties
oversees SHIELD?

312
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,662
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

313
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,511
Like how the hell
did a French pirate

314
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:42,622
managed to hijack a covert SHIELD vessel
in broad daylight?

315
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:44,912
For the record, councilman,
he's Algerian.

316
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:46,942
I can draw a map if it'll help.

317
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:50,442
I appreciate your wits,
secretary Pierce,

318
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:54,632
but this council take things like
international piracy fairly seriously.

319
00:23:54,672 --> 00:23:55,721
Really?

320
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:58,271
I don't.

321
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:01,481
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

322
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,461
If this council
is going to fold a rancor

323
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,092
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

324
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:11,182
maybe we need
someone to oversee us.

325
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:13,922
Mr. Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

326
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:19,422
Excuse me.

327
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:20,981
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

328
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:22,701
It depends on your definition.

329
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:34,672
I work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit me?

330
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,811
A nuclear war would do it too.

331
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:39,322
Busy in there?

332
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,451
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

333
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,491
I'm, uh... here to ask a favor.

334
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:48,981
I want you to call for a vote.

335
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:51,182
Project insight has to be delayed.

336
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:55,172
Nick, that's not a favor.
That's a subcommittee hearing.

337
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,791
A long one. -Could be nothing.
Probably is nothing.

338
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:00,541
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

339
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:01,622
What if it is something?

340
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:04,571
Then we both be damn glad
those Helicarriers aren't in the air.

341
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,201
Fine.

342
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:09,612
But you got to get Iron Man

343
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,662
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

344
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:13,491
Thank you, sir.

345
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:16,602
And not just a fly-by.
He's got to mingle.

346
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,912
The thing is...

347
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:22,571
I think it's getting worse.

348
00:25:24,832 --> 00:25:26,422
A cop pulled me over last week.

349
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:28,201
He thought I was drunk.

350
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:32,791
I swerved
to miss the plastic bag.

351
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:35,932
I thought it was an IED.

352
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,981
Some stuff you leave there.

353
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:42,231
Other stuff you bring back.

354
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:45,372
It's our job to figure out
how to carry it.

355
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:49,951
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase
or in a little man-purse?

356
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,271
It's up to you.

357
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:55,152
I'll see you next week.
Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:59,231
Look who it is. The running man.

359
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,622
Caught the last few minutes.

360
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:02,632
It's pretty intense.

361
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:05,551
Yeah, brother, we all
got the same problems.

362
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:07,261
Guilty.

363
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,021
Regret.

364
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:10,821
Did you lose someone?

365
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,082
My wing-men, Riley.

366
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,511
Flight in the night mission.

367
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,832
A standard PJ rescue op.

368
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:21,261
Nothing we hadn't done
a 1000 times before.

369
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:24,372
Till RPG knock Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

370
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:28,251
Nothing I could do.

371
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:30,821
It's like I was up there
just to watch.

372
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:35,412
Sorry. -After that,
I had really hard time

373
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:37,612
finding a reason for being
over there, you know?

374
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:42,521
But you happy now,
back in the world?

375
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:46,412
The number of people giving me orders
is down to about zero.

376
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,132
So, hell yeah.

377
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,511
Do you thinking of getting out?

378
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,142
No.

379
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:55,122
I don't know.

380
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:59,271
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

381
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:01,382
Ultimate fighting?

382
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:03,771
It's just a great idea
of the top of my head.

383
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:06,412
Seriously, you could do
whatever you wanna do.

384
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:08,842
What makes you happy?

385
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:11,501
I don't know.

386
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:16,551
Activating communications
encryption protocol.

387
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:19,021
Open secure line 0405.

388
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:20,451
Confirmed.

389
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:24,652
This is Hill.
I need you here in DC.

390
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:27,471
Deep shadow conditions.

391
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:31,172
Give me four hours.
You have three. over.

392
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:48,771
Want to see my lease?

393
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:08,301
Fracture detected.

394
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:13,612
Recommend anesthetic injection.

395
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,061
DC metropolis dispatch
shows no units in this area.

396
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:28,352
Get me out of here.

397
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:33,741
Propulsion systems offline.
Then reboot, dammit!

398
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:36,471
_

399
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,021
Warning!
Window integrity compromised.

400
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:57,051
You think?

401
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,862
How long to propulsion?

402
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,071
Calculating.

403
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:09,372
Window Integrity: 31%.
Deploying countermeasures.

404
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:10,491
Hold that order.

405
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:15,731
Window Integrity: 19%.
Offensive measures advised.

406
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:16,761
Wait!

407
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:22,231
Window Integrity: 1%.

408
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:23,261
Now!

409
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,521
Propulsion systems now online.

410
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,132
Full acceleration. Now!

411
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,971
Initiate vertical takeoff!

412
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:57,021
Flight systems damaged.
Then activate guidance camera.

413
00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:02,182
Give me the wheel!

414
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:10,561
Get me Agent Hill.

415
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:12,551
Communications array damaged.

416
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:13,781
What's not damaged?

417
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,281
Air conditioning
is fully operational.

418
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:29,912
Traffic ahead.
Give me an alternate route.

419
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:33,301
Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge.
All vehicles stopped.

420
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,892
17 avenue clear in three blocks.
Directly ahead.

421
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,001
Approaching intersection.

422
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:25,622
Get me of the grid!

423
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:27,932
Calculating route
to secure location.

424
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,942
So sweet.

425
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,902
It's so nice.

426
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:47,182
Hey.

427
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:48,392
I got to go, though.

428
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:50,221
Okay, bye.

429
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,892
My aunt.
She's kind of an insomniac.

430
00:33:57,632 --> 00:33:59,311
Hey, if you want... if you want,

431
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:00,711
you welcome to use my machine.

432
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:03,032
Might be cheaper than
the one in the basement.

433
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,311
Oh, yeah? What's it cost?

434
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:07,031
A cup of coffee?

435
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:14,472
Thank you, but...
I already have a load in downstairs

436
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:17,581
and, uh, you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

437
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:21,141
I'm just finished orientation
in the infectious diseases ward.

438
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:23,032
Well, I'll keep my distance.

439
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,411
Hopefully not too far.

440
00:34:27,072 --> 00:34:28,942
Oh, and I think
you left your stereo on.

441
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,972
Oh. Right, thank you.

442
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,331
I don't remember
giving you a key.

443
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:24,192
You really think I'd need one?

444
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:28,572
My wife kicked me out.

445
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:30,862
Didn't know you were married.

446
00:35:32,512 --> 00:35:34,452
There a lot of things
you don't about me.

447
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,581
I know, Nick.
That's the problem.

448
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,552
_

449
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:53,402
I'm sorry to have do this,

450
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:55,632
but I had no place else to crash.

451
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:00,291
_

452
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,141
Who else knows about your wife?

453
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,481
_ -Just...

454
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:12,081
my friends.

455
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,751
Is that what we are?

456
00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:15,902
That's up to you.

457
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:35,661
Don't...

458
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:38,251
trust anyone.

459
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:42,422
Captain Rogers?

460
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:47,811
Captain...
I'm agent 13 of SHIELD'S special service.

461
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,572
Kate?

462
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:52,612
I was assigned to protect you.
On whose order?

463
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:55,722
His.

464
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,931
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.
I need EMTs.

465
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,351
Do you have a twenty
on the shooter?

466
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:07,121
Tell them I'm in pursuit.

467
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,371
Is he gonna make it?

468
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,702
I don't know.

469
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,021
Tell me about the shooter.

470
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:15,371
He's fast and strong.

471
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:19,431
He had a metal arm.

472
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,061
Ballistics?

473
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,902
Three slags. No rifling and
completely untraceable.

474
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,561
Soviet made.

475
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,811
Yeah.
He's dropping. Ventricular tachycardia.

476
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:37,952
Crash cart coming in.
Nurse, help me with the gauzes, please.

477
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,592
- BP is dropping.
- Defibrillator.

478
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:43,561
Charge to 100.

479
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:44,911
Don't do this to me, Nick.

480
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,202
Stand back!

481
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:49,612
Three, two, one. Clear!

482
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:52,592
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

483
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:53,931
Okay. Charge to 200, please.

484
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,012
Stand back!

485
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,851
Three, two, one. Clear!

486
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,391
Give me epinephrine!

487
00:39:00,092 --> 00:39:02,021
- Pulse?
- Negative.

488
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:06,742
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

489
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,081
What's the time?

490
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:29,882
1:03, Doc.

491
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:34,672
Time of death 1:03 AM.

492
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,501
We need to take him.

493
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:28,632
Natasha.

494
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,152
Natasha!

495
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,331
Why was Fury in your apartment?

496
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:51,202
I don't know. -Captain, they
want you back at SHIELD.

497
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:53,371
Yeah, give me a second.
They want you now.

498
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:56,371
Okay.

499
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:00,742
You're a terrible liar.

500
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:10,492
STRIKE team escort
captain Rogers back to SHIELD.

501
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,052
I told him.

502
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:21,581
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

503
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:24,782
STRIKE, move it out.

504
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,552
- Captain rogers.
- Neighbor.

505
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:46,992
Captain.

506
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:48,751
I'm Alexander Pierce.

507
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:50,501
Sir, it's an honor.

508
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:51,751
The honor is mine, Captain.

509
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:54,081
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

510
00:41:55,442 --> 00:41:58,112
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met.

511
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,181
When I was at State Department
in Bogota.

512
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,342
ELN rebels took the embassy.

513
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:07,711
And security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

514
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:11,291
Nick was deputy chief for
the SHIELD station there.

515
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:12,972
And he comes to me with a plan.

516
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:15,052
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

517
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:17,702
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

518
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:20,492
Turned out the ELN
didn't negotiate,

519
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:22,012
so they put out a kill order.

520
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:23,762
They stormed the basement,

521
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,012
and what did they find?
They find it empty.

522
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:29,442
Nick had ignored my direct order,

523
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:33,211
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil.

524
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:37,492
He saved the lives of a dozen
political officers including my daughter.

525
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,842
So you gave him a promotion.

526
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:40,882
I never had any cause to regret it.

527
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:45,121
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

528
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:50,141
I don't know.

529
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:53,202
You know it was bugged?

530
00:42:53,742 --> 00:42:55,782
I did, because Nick told me.

531
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:58,402
He tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

532
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:06,871
I want you to see something.

533
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:09,981
Who hired you, Batroc?

534
00:43:09,992 --> 00:43:11,952
Is that live? -Yeah.
They picked him up last night

535
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:14,652
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

536
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:18,612
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination is batroc's line.

537
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:20,782
No, it's more complicated than that.

538
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:24,331
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

539
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:25,952
He was contacted by e-mail

540
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:27,842
and paid by wire transfer.

541
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:32,811
And then the money was
ran through 17 fictitious accounts.

542
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:34,882
The last one going
to a holding company

543
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:37,202
who was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

544
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:38,851
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

545
00:43:38,942 --> 00:43:41,132
Not likely.
Veech died six years ago.

546
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,501
His last address was
1435 Elmhurt drive.

547
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:47,871
When I first met Nick
his mother lived at 1437.

548
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:53,181
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

549
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:58,101
The prevailing theory
was that the hijacking was cover

550
00:43:58,112 --> 00:44:02,311
for the acquisition and sale
classified information.

551
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:06,251
The sale went south
and that led to Nick's death.

552
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,911
If you really knew Nick Fury
you know that not true.

553
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:14,731
Why do you think we talking?

554
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:21,831
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to

555
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:25,552
but because Nick asked me,
because we were both realists.

556
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:31,141
We knew that despite all the diplomacy
and the handshakes, the rhetoric,

557
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,442
to build a real better world

558
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:38,021
sometimes it means having
to tear the old one down.

559
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,141
That makes enemies.

560
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:47,422
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

561
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:50,302
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

562
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:54,121
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

563
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:58,032
makes me really, really angry.

564
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,722
Captain, you were the last one
to see Nick alive.

565
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:06,121
I don't think that's an accident.

566
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:08,802
And I don't think you do either.

567
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:12,601
So I'm gonna ask again,

568
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,572
why was he there?

569
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:19,601
He told me not to trust anyone.

570
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,461
I wonder if that included him.

571
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:30,722
Sorry.

572
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,411
Those were his last words.

573
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:35,012
Excuse me.

574
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:39,661
Captain,

575
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:42,981
Somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

576
00:45:44,331 --> 00:45:46,541
If anyone gets in my way,
they gonna regret it.

577
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:49,222
Anyone.

578
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:53,492
Understood.

579
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:12,561
Operations control.

580
00:46:12,882 --> 00:46:13,882
Confirmed.

581
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,871
All STRIKE personal on site.

582
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:19,382
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:20,822
- Criminal.
- Confirmed.

584
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:21,922
Cap.

585
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:23,931
Rumlow.

586
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:35,862
Evidence response team found some
fibers on the roof They want us to see.

587
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:39,652
You want me to get the tac-team ready?
No, lets wait to see what that is first.

588
00:46:39,952 --> 00:46:40,961
Right.

589
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:53,541
What's the status so far?

590
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:57,391
Administrations level.
Confirmed.

591
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,481
Excuse me.

592
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:08,762
Sorry about what happened with Fury.

593
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:11,121
Messed up what happened to him.

594
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:12,862
Thank you.

595
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:34,302
- Records.
- Confirmed.

596
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:54,282
Before we get started,
is anyone want to get out?

597
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:01,422
_

598
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,121
Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor.

599
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:47,251
Whoa, whoa, big guy.

600
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:51,572
I just want you to know, Cap,
this ain't personal.

601
00:49:02,882 --> 00:49:04,431
It kinda feels personal.

602
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,842
Drop the shield.
Put your hands in the air!

603
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,742
Give it up, Rogers!
Get that door open!

604
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,052
You have nowhere to run!

605
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:56,961
Are you kidding me?

606
00:49:56,972 --> 00:49:59,612
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge!

607
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,251
Stand down, Captain Rogers.

608
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:13,942
Stand down.

609
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:16,362
Repeat, stand down.

610
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:53,731
Eyes here.

611
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,382
Whatever your op is, bury it.

612
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:57,902
This is level one.

613
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,722
Contact DOT.

614
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:02,121
All traffic lights in the district go red.

615
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:04,681
Shut all runways at BWI,

616
00:51:04,722 --> 00:51:06,382
IND and Reagan.

617
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,862
All security cameras in the city
go to this monitor right here.

618
00:51:10,572 --> 00:51:12,211
Scan all open sources.

619
00:51:12,242 --> 00:51:13,822
Phones, computers,

620
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:15,831
PDAs, whatever.

621
00:51:16,132 --> 00:51:17,601
If someone Tweets about this guy,

622
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:18,931
I want to know about it.

623
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:21,822
With all due respect, If SHIELD is
conducting a manhunt for Captain America,

624
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:23,172
we deserve to know why.

625
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:25,922
Because he lied to us.

626
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:30,882
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

627
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,572
Refused to share it.

628
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:36,282
As difficult as this is to accept,

629
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:39,942
Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.

630
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,061
- Where is it?
- Safe.

631
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:10,871
Try better!
Where did you get it?

632
00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:11,992
Why would I tell you?

633
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:14,472
Fury gave it to you. Why?

634
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:16,061
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

635
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,132
Stop lying.

636
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:19,532
I only act
like I know everything, Rogers.

637
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,331
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

638
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:24,811
Well, makes sense.
The ship was dirty,

639
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,431
Fury needed a way in, so do you.

640
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:28,132
I'm not gonna ask you again.

641
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,121
I know who killed Fury.

642
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:37,282
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

643
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:40,001
The ones who do
call him The Winter Soldier.

644
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:44,822
He's credited with over two dozen
assassinations in the last 50 years.

645
00:52:44,972 --> 00:52:46,331
So he's a ghost-story.

646
00:52:46,882 --> 00:52:50,112
Five years ago I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

647
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:52,572
Somebody shot at my tires
near Odessa.

648
00:52:52,612 --> 00:52:54,871
We've lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

649
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:58,481
I pulled us out, but
The Winter Soldier was there.

650
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:01,722
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him...

651
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:03,282
straight through me.

652
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:05,271
A Soviet slag.

653
00:53:05,402 --> 00:53:08,521
No rifling. Bye-bye Bikinis.

654
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:11,472
Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them.

655
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:16,742
Going after him is a dead-end.
I know, I've tried.

656
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,041
Like you said,
he's a ghost-story.

657
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,722
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

658
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:29,282
Nick Fury was murdered
in cold blood.

659
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:32,461
To any reasonable person,
that would make him a martyr,

660
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:35,402
not a traitor. -You know
what makes him a traitor?

661
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:38,052
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

662
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:41,672
Nick Fury used your friendship
to coerce this council

663
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:43,512
into delaying project Insight.

664
00:53:43,601 --> 00:53:46,231
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

665
00:53:46,342 --> 00:53:49,351
At best, he lied to you.
Or worse.

666
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:51,481
Are you calling for my resignation?

667
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:53,152
I've got a pen and paper right here.

668
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:55,961
That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.

669
00:53:57,161 --> 00:54:00,842
But you do want to have a discussion.
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

670
00:54:01,882 --> 00:54:06,161
This council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.

671
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:10,952
If you wanna say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

672
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:20,181
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

673
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:23,431
If I run in these shoes,
they gonna fall off.

674
00:54:26,302 --> 00:54:28,112
The drive has a level-6
homing program,

675
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:31,012
so as soon as we boot up
SHIELD will know exactly where we are.

676
00:54:31,242 --> 00:54:35,342
How much time do we have?
About nine minutes from...

677
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:37,481
Now.

678
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:46,391
Fury was right about that ship.
Somebody's trying to hide something.

679
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:48,992
This drive is protected by
some sort of AI.

680
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:51,271
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

681
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:52,731
Can you override it?

682
00:54:53,882 --> 00:54:56,481
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

683
00:54:56,822 --> 00:54:58,032
Slightly.

684
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,242
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

685
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:14,961
This is a program that SHIELD
developed to track hostile malware, so...

686
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:19,262
if we can't read the file,
maybe we can find out where it came from.

687
00:55:19,422 --> 00:55:20,882
Can I help you guys
with anything?

688
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:24,882
Uh, No, my fiance was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

689
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:26,762
Right! We're getting married.

690
00:55:26,842 --> 00:55:29,231
Congratulations. Where you guys
thinking about going?

691
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:32,231
New Jersey.

692
00:55:37,222 --> 00:55:39,641
I have the exact same glasses.

693
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:41,641
You two are practically twins.

694
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:44,811
Yeah, I wish. Specimen.

695
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,442
Uh, if you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron. -Thank you.

696
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,672
You said nine minutes, come on.
Shh. Relax.

697
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:55,641
Got it.

698
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:56,992
_

699
00:55:57,141 --> 00:55:58,141
_

700
00:55:59,831 --> 00:56:02,911
You know it?
I used to. Let's go.

701
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:06,021
Standard tac-team.

702
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:09,251
Two behind, to across,
two coming straight at us.

703
00:56:09,271 --> 00:56:12,192
If they make us all engage, we gonna
hit the south escalator to the metro.

704
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,402
Shut up and lean your arm around me.
Laugh from something I said.

705
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:15,632
- What?
- Do it!

706
00:56:24,061 --> 00:56:26,592
Negative at the source.
Give me a floor rundown.

707
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:29,532
Negative on three.
Negative on two.

708
00:56:29,581 --> 00:56:31,842
Scan the upper levels,
work down to me.

709
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,021
- Kiss me.
- What?

710
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:43,282
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

711
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:44,521
Yes, they do.

712
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:55,431
You're still uncomfortable?

713
00:56:56,322 --> 00:56:58,061
It's not exactly the word
I would use.

714
00:56:58,141 --> 00:56:59,742
_

715
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:09,371
Where did Captain America
learned how to steal cars?

716
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,641
Nazi Germany.

717
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:14,442
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet of the dash.

718
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:21,552
All right, I have a question for you,
of which you do not have to answer.

719
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:24,472
I feel like if you're not answering it, though,
you're kind of answering it, you know?

720
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:27,652
What? -Was I your
first kiss since 1945?

721
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:29,742
That bad, huh?
I didn't say that.

722
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:31,411
Well, it kind of sounds like
this what you're saying.

723
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:34,632
No, I didn't... I just wondered
how much practice you had.

724
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:36,552
I don't need practice.
Everybody needs practice.

725
00:57:36,561 --> 00:57:38,862
It was not my first kiss
since 1945.

726
00:57:39,132 --> 00:57:40,891
I'm 95, not dead.

727
00:57:41,342 --> 00:57:42,751
Nobody special, then?

728
00:57:45,242 --> 00:57:48,581
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard
to find someone to share a life experience.

729
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:50,782
That's all right.
Just make something up.

730
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:51,952
What, like you?

731
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,181
I don't know. The truth is
a matter of circumstances.

732
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:56,791
It's not all things
to all people, all the time.

733
00:57:57,992 --> 00:57:59,231
And neither am I.

734
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:01,081
It's a tough way to live.

735
00:58:02,032 --> 00:58:03,692
It's a good way
not to die, though.

736
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,764
You know, it's kind of
hard to trust someone

737
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:08,601
when you don't know who
that someone really is.

738
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:10,402
Yeah.

739
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:15,032
Who do you want me to be?

740
00:58:15,601 --> 00:58:16,922
How about a friend?

741
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:23,552
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

742
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:41,161
This is it.

743
00:58:42,442 --> 00:58:44,431
The file came from
these coordinates.

744
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,742
So did I.

745
00:58:55,012 --> 00:58:56,782
This camp is where
I was trained.

746
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:01,041
Changed much?

747
00:59:03,362 --> 00:59:04,442
A little.

748
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:06,681
Pick up the pace, ladies!

749
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:08,992
Let's go! Let's go!

750
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:10,782
Double time!

751
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:14,041
Come on Rogers, move it!

752
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,771
Come on! Fall in!

753
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:23,362
Rogers! I said fall in!

754
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:26,742
This is a dead end.

755
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:29,601
Zero heat signature,
Zero waves, not even radio.

756
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:34,032
Whoever wrote the file must have
used a router to throw people off.

757
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:36,981
What is it?

758
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:38,911
Army regulations forbid storing ammunition

759
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,942
within 500 yards from the barracks.

760
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:43,411
This building is in
the wrong place.

761
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:00,532
This is SHIELD.

762
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:03,481
Maybe where it started.

763
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:24,922
There's Stark's father.
Howard.

764
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:28,382
Who's the girl?

765
01:00:47,592 --> 01:00:49,762
If you already working
in a secret office...

766
01:01:00,342 --> 01:01:02,211
Why do you need
to hide the elevator?

767
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:57,132
This can't be the data-point.
This technology is ancient.

768
01:02:21,862 --> 01:02:23,802
Initiate system?

769
01:02:27,021 --> 01:02:29,612
Y-E-S. Yes.

770
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:34,771
"Shall we play a game?"

771
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:38,342
It's from a movie that...
Yeah. I saw it.

772
01:02:44,422 --> 01:02:46,862
Rogers, Steven.

773
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:49,422
Born, 1918.

774
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:57,251
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna.
Born, 1984.

775
01:02:57,302 --> 01:03:01,702
This is some kind of a recording.
I am not a recording, Fraulein.

776
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:07,141
I may not be the man I was when
the Captain took me prisoner in 1945,

777
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:09,512
But I am.

778
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:12,931
Do you know this thing?

779
01:03:15,851 --> 01:03:18,731
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.

780
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:22,891
He's been dead for years.
First correction, I am Swiss.

781
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:28,661
Second, look around you.
I have never been more alive.

782
01:03:28,822 --> 01:03:33,192
In 1972 I received
a terminal diagnosis.

783
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:36,382
Science could not save my body,

784
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:40,621
my mind, however,
that was worth saving.

785
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:44,322
On 200,000 feet of data banks.

786
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:48,322
You are standing in my brain.

787
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:50,902
- How did you get here?
- Invited.

788
01:03:51,192 --> 01:03:53,891
This Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

789
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:57,461
SHIELD recruited German scientists
with strategic values.

790
01:03:57,472 --> 01:03:59,621
They thought I could help their cause.

791
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,811
I also helped my own.

792
01:04:01,822 --> 01:04:03,541
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

793
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:07,382
Cut off one head
and two more shall take its place.

794
01:04:07,822 --> 01:04:08,972
Prove it.

795
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,672
Accessing archive.

796
01:04:13,222 --> 01:04:15,472
HYDRA was founded on the belief

797
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:19,771
that humanity could not
be trusted with its own freedom.

798
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:21,851
What we did not realize,

799
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:25,672
was that if you try to take
that freedom, they resist.

800
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,672
War taught us much.

801
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:32,442
Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.

802
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:38,262
After the war, SHIELD
was founded and I was recruited.

803
01:04:38,512 --> 01:04:40,661
The new HYDRA grew.

804
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:45,371
A beautiful parasite
inside SHIELD.

805
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:51,141
For 70 years HYDRA has been
secretly feeding crisis.

806
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:53,161
Reaping war.

807
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:56,251
And when history
did not cooperate,

808
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,512
history was changed.

809
01:04:58,621 --> 01:05:00,882
That's impossible.
SHIELD must have stopped you.

810
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:03,641
Accidents will happen.

811
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:08,322
HYDRA created a world so chaotic

812
01:05:08,331 --> 01:05:12,481
that humanity is finally
ready to sacrifice its freedom

813
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:15,121
to gain its security.

814
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:19,061
Once the purification process
is complete,

815
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:22,871
HYDRA'S new world order
will arise.

816
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:25,141
We won, Captain.

817
01:05:25,452 --> 01:05:29,411
Your death amounts
to the same as your Life.

818
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:31,192
A zero sum.

819
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:35,751
As I was saying...

820
01:05:36,981 --> 01:05:38,032
What's on this drive?

821
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:41,862
Project Insight
requires insight.

822
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:44,461
So I wrote an algorithm.

823
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:46,012
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

824
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:49,012
The answer to your question
is fascinating.

825
01:05:49,081 --> 01:05:53,492
Unfortunately, You shall be
too dead to hear it.

826
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:00,661
Steve, I got a bogey.

827
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:03,742
Short-range ballistic.
30 seconds, tops.

828
01:06:03,762 --> 01:06:05,681
- Who fired it?
- SHIELD.

829
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:09,382
I'm afraid I have been
stalling, Captain.

830
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:12,952
Admit it, it's better this way.

831
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:15,572
We're both of us...

832
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:17,871
out of time.

833
01:07:40,842 --> 01:07:42,121
Call in the asset.

834
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:02,262
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.
Do you need anything before I leave?

835
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:06,692
No. It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

836
01:08:06,802 --> 01:08:09,601
- Okay, night-night.
- Good night.

837
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:17,082
Want some milk?

838
01:08:26,622 --> 01:08:28,502
The timetable has moved.

839
01:08:30,532 --> 01:08:32,082
Our window is limited.

840
01:08:36,402 --> 01:08:38,051
Two targets of level six.

841
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:41,612
They already cost me Zola.

842
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:44,502
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

843
01:08:46,591 --> 01:08:51,631
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...
I forgot my phone.

844
01:08:56,771 --> 01:09:00,122
Oh, Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.

845
01:09:24,521 --> 01:09:25,591
Hey, man.

846
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:28,561
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

847
01:09:29,351 --> 01:09:31,282
Everyone we know
is trying to kill us.

848
01:09:34,032 --> 01:09:35,231
Not everyone.

849
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,231
- You okay?
- Yeah.

850
01:10:03,042 --> 01:10:04,231
What's going on?

851
01:10:07,811 --> 01:10:10,681
When I first joined SHIELD,
I thought it was going straight.

852
01:10:15,181 --> 01:10:18,051
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

853
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:26,221
I thought I knew
whose lies I'm telling, but...

854
01:10:29,671 --> 01:10:31,692
I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.

855
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,601
There's a chance
you might be in the wrong business.

856
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:41,841
I owe you.

857
01:10:43,402 --> 01:10:44,561
It's okay.

858
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:46,712
If it was the other way around,

859
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,381
and it was down to me to save
your life, and be honest with me,

860
01:10:53,862 --> 01:10:55,402
would you trust me to do it?

861
01:10:57,822 --> 01:10:59,181
I would now.

862
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:03,122
And I'm always honest.

863
01:11:04,832 --> 01:11:08,561
Well, you seem pretty chippered for someone
who just found out they died for nothing.

864
01:11:08,822 --> 01:11:12,811
Well, I guess I just like to know
who I'm fighting.

865
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:14,742
I made breakfast.

866
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:17,841
If you guys...
eat that sort of thing.

867
01:11:19,721 --> 01:11:21,011
So, the question is:

868
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:23,402
Who in SHIELD could launch
a domestic missile strike?

869
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:26,242
Pierce.

870
01:11:26,452 --> 01:11:29,231
Well, 'cause he will be sitting on top
of the most secured building in the world.

871
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:30,452
But he's not working alone.

872
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:33,042
Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.

873
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:35,771
So it's Jasper Sitwell.

874
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,212
So, the real question is:

875
01:11:40,221 --> 01:11:42,362
How do the two most wanted
people in Washington

876
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:44,731
kidnap a SHIELD officer
in broad daylight?

877
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:47,521
The answer is: they don't.

878
01:11:48,261 --> 01:11:50,351
- What's this?
- Call it a resume.

879
01:11:53,822 --> 01:11:55,131
Is this Bakhmala?

880
01:11:55,372 --> 01:11:57,681
Khalid Khandil mission.
That was you.

881
01:11:58,721 --> 01:12:00,582
You didn't say he was
a para-rescue.

882
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:03,742
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

883
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:06,681
I heard they couldn't bring in
the choppers because of the RPGs.

884
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,962
What'd you use, a stealth-chuting?
No.

885
01:12:09,801 --> 01:12:11,002
These.

886
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:19,101
I thought you said you're a pilot.
I never said a pilot.

887
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:24,771
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

888
01:12:25,311 --> 01:12:26,612
You got out for a good reason.

889
01:12:26,652 --> 01:12:28,612
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

890
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:30,492
There's no better reason
to get back in.

891
01:12:33,787 --> 01:12:35,747
Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?

892
01:12:35,771 --> 01:12:37,511
The last one is at Fort Meade.

893
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:40,761
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

894
01:12:43,412 --> 01:12:44,652
Shouldn't be a problem.

895
01:12:44,872 --> 01:12:46,271
_

896
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,131
Listen,
I gotta fly home tonight,

897
01:12:48,141 --> 01:12:51,002
There's a... I got some
constituency problem,

898
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:52,952
and I gotta press the flesh.

899
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:55,551
Any constituent in particular,
Mr. Senator?

900
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:57,962
Un, no, not really.

901
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:01,862
23. Kinda hot. Real hot.

902
01:13:01,872 --> 01:13:04,011
You know, wants to be reporter.
I think.

903
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:05,891
I don't listen at that point.

904
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:10,141
Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.
Really? 'Cause she's killing my back.

905
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,641
Look, this isn't the place
to talk about it.

906
01:13:12,652 --> 01:13:13,942
Nice pin.

907
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:16,141
Thank you.

908
01:13:16,442 --> 01:13:17,582
Come here.

909
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:19,942
Hail, HYDRA.

910
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:24,421
See that, right?
I just saw that, Yeah.

911
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:26,981
Should I get it checked?
I think so.

912
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:34,471
_

913
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:37,962
I need a minute.
Bring the car around.

914
01:13:42,442 --> 01:13:45,171
Yes, sir.
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?

915
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:47,301
I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.

916
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:51,742
Who is this? -The good looking guy
in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock.

917
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,171
Your other ten o'clock.

918
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:58,412
There you go.

919
01:14:00,822 --> 01:14:02,021
What do you want?

920
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:04,431
You're gonna go around
the corner, to your right.

921
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,091
There's a gray car,
two spaces down.

922
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,942
You and I are gonna take a ride.

923
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:10,912
And why would I do that?

924
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:13,872
Because that tie seems
really expensive

925
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:16,252
and I'd hate to mess it up.

926
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:27,261
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

927
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:30,131
Never heard of it.
What were you doing in the Lemurian Star?

928
01:14:30,141 --> 01:14:32,351
I was throwing up.
I get seasick.

929
01:14:37,462 --> 01:14:40,962
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you can throw me off the roof?

930
01:14:41,471 --> 01:14:43,421
'Cause it's really
not your style, Rogers.

931
01:14:44,622 --> 01:14:47,181
You're right. It's not.

932
01:14:48,231 --> 01:14:49,421
It's hers.

933
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:56,202
Oh, wait. What about that girl
from accounting, Laura... -Lillian.

934
01:14:56,782 --> 01:14:58,652
Lip piercing, right?
Yeah, she's cute.

935
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,601
Yeah, I'm not ready for that.

936
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:14,061
Zola's algorithm is a program...

937
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:18,942
For choosing Insight's targets.
What targets?

938
01:15:19,152 --> 01:15:20,282
You!

939
01:15:21,261 --> 01:15:23,872
The TV anchor in Cairo,
The Undersecretary of Defense,

940
01:15:23,881 --> 01:15:25,862
A high school valedictorian
in Iowa city.

941
01:15:26,412 --> 01:15:29,622
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat to HYDRA.

942
01:15:30,452 --> 01:15:32,492
Now, or in the future.

943
01:15:32,572 --> 01:15:34,801
The Future? How can it know?

944
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:39,631
How could it not?

945
01:15:41,061 --> 01:15:44,322
The 21st century
is a digital book.

946
01:15:45,702 --> 01:15:47,622
Zola taught HYDRA
how to read it.

947
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:53,662
Your bank records, medical histories,
voting patterns,

948
01:15:53,692 --> 01:15:56,301
e-mails, phone calls,
the damn SAT scores.

949
01:15:57,481 --> 01:16:00,971
Zola's algorithm
evaluates peoples' past

950
01:16:01,822 --> 01:16:03,421
to predict their future.

951
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:04,942
What then?

952
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,782
Oh, my god, Pierce is gonna kill me.
What then?

953
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:17,252
Then the Insight heli-carriers
scratch people off the list.

954
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:21,181
A few millions at a time.

955
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:31,671
HYDRA doesn't like leaks. - So why
don't you try sticking a cork in it.

956
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:34,471
Insight's launching in 16 hours.
We're cutting a little bit close here.

957
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:36,521
I know. We'll use him
to bypass the DNA scans

958
01:16:36,532 --> 01:16:38,122
and access the heli-carriers
directly.

959
01:16:38,152 --> 01:16:40,032
What?! Are you crazy?

960
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,221
That is
a terrible-terrible idea.

961
01:17:25,652 --> 01:17:26,811
shooot!

962
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:39,462
Hang on!

963
01:19:19,532 --> 01:19:22,801
I'll take care of her. find him.

964
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,381
Go. I got this!

965
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:04,971
LZ in 2300 block,
Virginia Avenue.

966
01:21:04,981 --> 01:21:06,561
Rendezvous two minutes.

967
01:21:09,242 --> 01:21:13,311
Civilians in threat,
I repeat, civilians in threat.

968
01:21:18,002 --> 01:21:20,442
LZ 2300 block, Virginia Avenue.

969
01:21:20,462 --> 01:21:21,841
Rendezvous two minutes.

970
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:49,782
Get out of the way!
Stay out of the way!

971
01:23:37,051 --> 01:23:39,782
- Bucky?
- Who the hell is Bucky?

972
01:24:08,492 --> 01:24:10,141
Drop the shield, Captain!
On your knees!

973
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:13,221
Get on your knees, now! Now!
Get down! Get down!

974
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:15,402
Get on your knees, now!

975
01:24:16,782 --> 01:24:18,061
Don't move.

976
01:24:24,181 --> 01:24:28,212
Put the gun down.
Not here. Not here!

977
01:24:43,742 --> 01:24:44,902
It was him.

978
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:50,652
He looked right at me
and he didn't even know me.

979
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:53,631
How's that even possible?
It was like 70 years ago.

980
01:24:54,112 --> 01:24:55,221
Zola.

981
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:59,082
Bucky's old unit was captured in '43.
Zola experimented on him.

982
01:24:59,742 --> 01:25:02,002
Whatever he did,
helped Bucky survive the fall.

983
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,942
They must have found him.
Non of that's your fault, Steve.

984
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:12,561
Even when I had nothing,
I had Bucky.

985
01:25:15,662 --> 01:25:17,072
We need to get a doctor here.

986
01:25:17,341 --> 01:25:20,341
We don't put pressure on that wound
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

987
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:30,462
That thing was squeezing
my brain.

988
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:35,072
Who's this guy?

989
01:25:45,601 --> 01:25:47,311
Three holes. Start digging.

990
01:26:14,782 --> 01:26:16,981
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

991
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:18,962
- Maybe two.
- Let me take her.

992
01:26:19,021 --> 01:26:20,551
She wants to see him first.

993
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,021
About damn time.

994
01:26:34,332 --> 01:26:37,862
Lacerated spinal column,
cracked sternum,

995
01:26:37,891 --> 01:26:41,181
shattered collarbone,
perforated liver,

996
01:26:41,652 --> 01:26:43,112
one hell of a headache.

997
01:26:43,542 --> 01:26:45,021
Don't forget
your collapsed lung.

998
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:46,532
Let's not forget that.

999
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:48,421
In other words, I'm good.

1000
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,872
They cut you open.
Your heart stopped.

1001
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:52,752
Tetrodotoxin B.

1002
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:55,261
Slows the pulse
to one beat a minute.

1003
01:26:55,301 --> 01:26:57,221
Banner developed it for stress.

1004
01:26:57,282 --> 01:27:00,082
Didn't work so great for him.
We found a use for it.

1005
01:27:00,101 --> 01:27:02,091
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1006
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:04,822
The attempt on the director's life
had to look successful.

1007
01:27:04,992 --> 01:27:07,042
Can't kill you
if you already dead.

1008
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:09,011
Besides,

1009
01:27:09,902 --> 01:27:11,761
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1010
01:27:27,061 --> 01:27:28,452
Sergeant Barnes...

1011
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:31,921
Bucky, no!

1012
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:38,152
The procedure
has already started.

1013
01:27:41,952 --> 01:27:46,391
You're going to be
the new face of HYDRA.

1014
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:47,832
Put him on freeze.

1015
01:27:58,721 --> 01:28:03,122
Sir, he's unstable. Erratic.

1016
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:18,572
Mission report.

1017
01:28:21,391 --> 01:28:22,992
Mission report, now.

1018
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:37,082
The man on the bridge...

1019
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:41,261
Who was he?

1020
01:28:42,862 --> 01:28:45,492
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1021
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:49,582
I knew him.

1022
01:28:58,091 --> 01:29:00,572
Your work has been
a gift to mankind.

1023
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:04,462
You shaped the century.

1024
01:29:05,141 --> 01:29:07,542
And I need you to do it
one more time.

1025
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:12,162
Society is at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1026
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:14,782
Tomorrow morning we're
gonna give it a push.

1027
01:29:16,572 --> 01:29:19,521
But if you don't do your part,
I can?t do mine.

1028
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:24,351
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1029
01:29:27,252 --> 01:29:28,612
But I knew him.

1030
01:29:35,391 --> 01:29:36,572
Prep him.

1031
01:29:37,221 --> 01:29:39,641
He's been out of
cryo-freeze too long.

1032
01:29:39,981 --> 01:29:42,221
Then wipe him, then start over.

1033
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:27,141
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1034
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,221
He said peace
wasn't an achievement.

1035
01:30:31,662 --> 01:30:33,622
It was a responsibility.

1036
01:30:34,692 --> 01:30:38,442
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1037
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:40,242
We have to stop the launch.

1038
01:30:40,891 --> 01:30:43,962
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.

1039
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,221
What's that?

1040
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:50,021
Once the heli-carriers
reach 3000 feet,

1041
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:54,152
they'll triangulate with Insight
satellites, becoming fully weaponized.

1042
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:56,011
We need to breach
those carriers,

1043
01:30:56,021 --> 01:30:59,002
and replace their targeting
blades, with our own.

1044
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:00,002
One or two won't cut it.

1045
01:31:00,011 --> 01:31:02,662
We need to
link all three carriers for this to work.

1046
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:05,872
You guys, if even one of
those ships remains operational

1047
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:08,231
a whole lot of people
are gonna die.

1048
01:31:08,612 --> 01:31:11,532
We have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is HYDRA.

1049
01:31:11,721 --> 01:31:14,072
We need to get pass them,
insert the server blades,

1050
01:31:14,082 --> 01:31:16,962
and maybe, just maybe,
we can salvage what's...

1051
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,502
We're not salvaging anything.

1052
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:20,011
We're not just taking down
the carriers, Nick,

1053
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:22,542
we're taking down SHIELD.
SHIELD had nothing to do with it.

1054
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:24,822
You gave me this mission,
this is how it ends.

1055
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:27,212
SHIELD'S been compromised,
you've said so yourself.

1056
01:31:27,221 --> 01:31:29,131
HYDRA was right under your nose,
and nobody noticed.

1057
01:31:29,141 --> 01:31:32,412
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1058
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:34,731
And how many paid the price
before you did?

1059
01:31:37,481 --> 01:31:39,221
Look, I didn't know
about Barnes.

1060
01:31:39,481 --> 01:31:41,292
Even if you have,
would you have told me?

1061
01:31:41,681 --> 01:31:43,641
Or would you've
compartmentalize that too?

1062
01:31:44,412 --> 01:31:46,421
SHIELD, HYDRA...

1063
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:48,641
It all goes.

1064
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:50,181
He's right.

1065
01:31:56,341 --> 01:31:57,471
Don't look at me.

1066
01:31:57,481 --> 01:31:59,511
I do what he does, just slower.

1067
01:32:03,082 --> 01:32:04,152
Well...

1068
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:13,402
Looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1069
01:32:24,902 --> 01:32:26,521
We looked for you after.

1070
01:32:27,652 --> 01:32:29,761
My folks wanted to
give you a ride from the cemetery.

1071
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:33,412
I know, I'm sorry.
I just... kinda wanted to be alone.

1072
01:32:34,601 --> 01:32:35,851
How was it?

1073
01:32:36,402 --> 01:32:37,582
It was okay.

1074
01:32:38,242 --> 01:32:39,521
She's next to dad.

1075
01:32:41,851 --> 01:32:43,202
I was gonna ask...

1076
01:32:43,372 --> 01:32:45,242
I know what you gonna say, Buck,
it's just...

1077
01:32:46,082 --> 01:32:49,122
We can put the couch cushion
on the floor like we were kids.

1078
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:52,532
It'll be fun. All you gotta do
is shine my shoes, maybe...

1079
01:32:52,561 --> 01:32:54,341
pick up the trash.

1080
01:32:59,601 --> 01:33:00,801
Come on.

1081
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:07,471
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1082
01:33:08,301 --> 01:33:11,721
The thing is...
you don't have to.

1083
01:33:15,332 --> 01:33:17,402
I'm with you till the end
of the line, pal.

1084
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:22,971
He's gonna be there, you know?
I know.

1085
01:33:23,502 --> 01:33:27,212
Look, whoever he used to be,
the guy he is now,

1086
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:29,641
I don't think
he's the kind you save.

1087
01:33:29,902 --> 01:33:31,442
He's the kind you stop.

1088
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,662
I don't know if I can do that.

1089
01:33:35,921 --> 01:33:38,011
Well, he might not
give you a choice.

1090
01:33:38,061 --> 01:33:39,341
He doesn't know you.

1091
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:41,622
He will.

1092
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:45,921
Gear up. It's time.

1093
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:50,002
- You're gonna wear that?
- No.

1094
01:33:50,332 --> 01:33:52,572
You gonna fight a war,
you gotta wear a uniform.

1095
01:34:00,681 --> 01:34:05,242
Oh, man. I am so fired.

1096
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:31,801
We are in final launch sequence.

1097
01:34:32,311 --> 01:34:33,612
_

1098
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:35,902
We are go on guidance.

1099
01:34:37,372 --> 01:34:39,822
All personnel,
to launch station.

1100
01:34:40,442 --> 01:34:42,702
And how was your flight?
Lovely.

1101
01:34:42,801 --> 01:34:44,971
The ride from the airport less so.

1102
01:34:45,612 --> 01:34:47,771
Sadly, SHIELD can't
control everything.

1103
01:34:48,152 --> 01:34:49,771
Including Captain America.

1104
01:34:53,582 --> 01:34:56,192
This facility is
biometricly controlled.

1105
01:34:56,301 --> 01:34:58,891
These will give you
unrestricted access.

1106
01:35:03,252 --> 01:35:05,421
I parked there for two months.
But it's "his spot."

1107
01:35:05,442 --> 01:35:07,591
So where's he been?
I think Afghanistan.

1108
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:09,782
Negative, DT-6.
The pattern is full.

1109
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:11,162
All because it's...

1110
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:14,362
Must be the dish.

1111
01:35:15,862 --> 01:35:18,402
I'll check it out.
Clear approach from the roof.

1112
01:35:19,112 --> 01:35:21,782
Request to clear the area
for launch.

1113
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:26,122
Excuse us.

1114
01:35:26,131 --> 01:35:28,921
I know the road hasn't exactly
been smooth,

1115
01:35:29,042 --> 01:35:32,712
and some of you would have gladly
kick me out of the car along the way.

1116
01:35:34,742 --> 01:35:37,921
Finally we're here,
and the world should be grateful.

1117
01:35:39,112 --> 01:35:42,242
Attention, all SHIELD agents.
This is Steve Rogers.

1118
01:35:44,721 --> 01:35:46,881
You heard a lot about me
in the last few days.

1119
01:35:47,891 --> 01:35:50,181
Some of you would even
ordered to haunt me down.

1120
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:52,881
But I think it's time
you know the truth.

1121
01:35:56,881 --> 01:35:58,792
SHIELD is not what
we thought it was.

1122
01:35:59,261 --> 01:36:01,221
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1123
01:36:02,242 --> 01:36:04,521
Alexander Pierce
is their leader.

1124
01:36:07,681 --> 01:36:10,301
STRIKE and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.

1125
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:12,212
I don't know how many more,

1126
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:14,471
But I know
they're in the building.

1127
01:36:15,572 --> 01:36:17,362
They could be standing
right next to you.

1128
01:36:19,082 --> 01:36:20,891
They almost have what they want:

1129
01:36:21,511 --> 01:36:23,452
absolute control.

1130
01:36:24,032 --> 01:36:27,712
They shot the Nick Fury
and it won't end there.

1131
01:36:28,122 --> 01:36:30,072
If you launch those heli-carriers today,

1132
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:33,042
HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.

1133
01:36:35,731 --> 01:36:37,122
Unless we stop them.

1134
01:36:41,122 --> 01:36:42,681
I know I'm asking a lot, but...

1135
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:47,122
the price of freedom is high,
always has been.

1136
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:49,992
And it is a price
I'm willing to pay.

1137
01:36:52,412 --> 01:36:54,492
And if I'm the only one,
so be it.

1138
01:36:56,931 --> 01:36:58,502
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1139
01:37:03,301 --> 01:37:06,881
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1140
01:37:07,122 --> 01:37:09,341
You smug son of a bitch.

1141
01:37:13,391 --> 01:37:14,712
Arrest him!

1142
01:37:16,792 --> 01:37:18,452
I guess I've got the floor.

1143
01:37:25,402 --> 01:37:28,282
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1144
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:34,822
- Is there a problem?
- I'm...

1145
01:37:39,332 --> 01:37:41,372
Is there a problem?
Sorry, sir.

1146
01:37:50,221 --> 01:37:51,921
I'm not gonna launch
those ships.

1147
01:37:55,271 --> 01:37:58,242
Captain's orders.
Move away from your station.

1148
01:37:58,591 --> 01:37:59,652
Like he said!

1149
01:37:59,702 --> 01:38:02,252
Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon!

1150
01:38:02,561 --> 01:38:03,881
Captain's orders.

1151
01:38:05,582 --> 01:38:07,431
You picked
the wrong side, agent.

1152
01:38:08,652 --> 01:38:10,252
It depends on where
you're standing.

1153
01:38:38,742 --> 01:38:40,141
_

1154
01:38:54,782 --> 01:38:56,301
Close the bay door!

1155
01:38:56,332 --> 01:38:59,471
Close the bay door now!
Close the bay door!

1156
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:18,652
_

1157
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:20,782
They're initiating launch.

1158
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:42,992
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1159
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:44,962
If they're shooting at you,
they're bad.

1160
01:40:18,221 --> 01:40:21,341
Cap, I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1161
01:40:21,442 --> 01:40:22,742
You okay?

1162
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:25,942
Not dead yet.

1163
01:40:33,122 --> 01:40:34,572
Let me ask you a question.

1164
01:40:37,002 --> 01:40:39,931
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow,

1165
01:40:41,471 --> 01:40:43,822
and you knew that they were
gonna drag your daughters

1166
01:40:43,832 --> 01:40:47,051
into a soccer stadium...
for execution.

1167
01:40:49,171 --> 01:40:52,242
And you can just stop it.
With a flip of a switch.

1168
01:40:52,662 --> 01:40:53,771
Would you?

1169
01:40:53,942 --> 01:40:55,202
Wouldn't you all?

1170
01:40:57,471 --> 01:40:59,351
Not if it was your switch.

1171
01:41:23,431 --> 01:41:24,862
I'm sorry.

1172
01:41:31,192 --> 01:41:32,771
Did I step on your moment?

1173
01:41:34,202 --> 01:41:36,492
Satellites in range
at 3,000 feet.

1174
01:41:37,402 --> 01:41:39,931
- Falcon, status?
- Engaging.

1175
01:42:04,072 --> 01:42:05,681
All right, Cap, I'm in.

1176
01:42:07,881 --> 01:42:09,192
shooot!

1177
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:42,051
Eight minutes, Cap.
Working on it.

1178
01:42:49,412 --> 01:42:50,761
_

1179
01:42:50,811 --> 01:42:51,811
What are you doing?

1180
01:42:51,822 --> 01:42:55,612
She's disabling the security protocols and
dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.

1181
01:42:55,622 --> 01:42:58,231
Including HYDRA'S.
And SHIELD'S.

1182
01:42:58,801 --> 01:43:01,731
If you do this, non of your pasts
is gonna remain hidden.

1183
01:43:04,862 --> 01:43:08,601
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you as you really are?

1184
01:43:09,771 --> 01:43:11,011
Are you?

1185
01:43:27,322 --> 01:43:28,431
Alpha locked.

1186
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:33,402
Falcon, where are you now?
I had to take a detour.

1187
01:44:05,452 --> 01:44:06,801
Hell, yeah!

1188
01:44:13,421 --> 01:44:14,601
I'm in.

1189
01:44:17,681 --> 01:44:19,162
Bravo locked.

1190
01:44:21,351 --> 01:44:23,282
Two down, one to go.

1191
01:44:24,962 --> 01:44:26,761
All SHIELD pilots, scramble.

1192
01:44:27,202 --> 01:44:29,862
We are the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1193
01:45:10,712 --> 01:45:11,881
_

1194
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:15,061
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1195
01:45:15,072 --> 01:45:16,721
It takes two
alpha-level members.

1196
01:45:16,801 --> 01:45:18,981
Don't worry, company's coming.

1197
01:45:42,601 --> 01:45:43,981
Did you get my flowers?

1198
01:45:46,462 --> 01:45:48,622
I'm glad you're here, Nick.
Really?

1199
01:45:50,082 --> 01:45:52,212
'Casue I thought you
had me killed.

1200
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:53,712
You know how the game works.

1201
01:45:54,731 --> 01:45:57,622
Why make me head of SHIELD?
'Cause you're the best.

1202
01:45:57,761 --> 01:45:59,442
And the most ruthless person
I've ever met.

1203
01:45:59,452 --> 01:46:01,692
I did what I did
to protect people.

1204
01:46:02,862 --> 01:46:04,902
Our enemies
are your enemies, Nick.

1205
01:46:05,822 --> 01:46:07,981
Disorder, war...

1206
01:46:08,771 --> 01:46:11,402
It just a matter of time before
a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1207
01:46:11,412 --> 01:46:13,601
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1208
01:46:15,282 --> 01:46:16,492
Diplomacy?

1209
01:46:16,862 --> 01:46:19,101
A holding action. A band-aid.

1210
01:46:20,122 --> 01:46:23,481
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1211
01:46:24,862 --> 01:46:27,431
You didn't ask, you just did
what had to be done.

1212
01:46:28,702 --> 01:46:32,872
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1213
01:46:33,902 --> 01:46:35,981
by sacrificing 20 million.

1214
01:46:36,942 --> 01:46:40,131
It's the next step, Nick, if you
have the courage to take it.

1215
01:46:40,141 --> 01:46:42,212
No, I have the courage no to.

1216
01:46:46,811 --> 01:46:48,702
Retinal scanner active.

1217
01:46:48,872 --> 01:46:50,152
What are you doing?

1218
01:46:50,332 --> 01:46:52,752
Don't you think we wiped
your clearance from the system?

1219
01:46:52,761 --> 01:46:54,822
I know you erased my password,

1220
01:46:54,902 --> 01:46:57,181
probably deleted
my retinal scan,

1221
01:46:57,202 --> 01:47:00,622
but if you want to stay
ahead of me, Mr. Secretary...

1222
01:47:04,301 --> 01:47:07,622
You need to keep both eyes open.

1223
01:47:11,822 --> 01:47:13,771
Alpha-level confirmed.

1224
01:47:13,782 --> 01:47:16,822
Encryption code accepted.
Safeguards removed.

1225
01:47:17,021 --> 01:47:20,551
Charlie Carrier's 45 degrees
off the port bow.

1226
01:47:26,202 --> 01:47:29,431
Six minutes. -Hey, Sam,
I'm gonna need a ride.

1227
01:47:30,502 --> 01:47:32,372
Roger.
Let me know when you're ready.

1228
01:47:34,771 --> 01:47:36,032
I just did.

1229
01:47:53,662 --> 01:47:55,631
You know, you a lot heavier
than you look.

1230
01:47:56,061 --> 01:47:57,452
I had a big breakfast.

1231
01:47:59,561 --> 01:48:00,742
Steve!

1232
01:48:31,301 --> 01:48:33,292
Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay?

1233
01:48:33,372 --> 01:48:34,622
Yeah, I'm here.

1234
01:48:35,252 --> 01:48:36,841
I'm still on the heli-carrier.

1235
01:48:37,141 --> 01:48:40,582
Where are you?
I'm grounded, the suit's down.

1236
01:48:41,322 --> 01:48:43,942
Sorry, Cap.
Don't worry, I got this.

1237
01:48:46,282 --> 01:48:48,032
Emergency evacuation.

1238
01:48:48,051 --> 01:48:51,292
All personnel need
to get to the safe areas.

1239
01:49:00,341 --> 01:49:02,192
Sir, the Council
has been breached.

1240
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:05,002
Repeat, Dispatch.
Black Widow is up there.

1241
01:49:05,322 --> 01:49:06,521
Headed up.

1242
01:49:08,981 --> 01:49:10,362
- Falcon!
- Yeah?

1243
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:12,921
Rumlow is heading for the Council.
I'm on it.

1244
01:49:23,851 --> 01:49:25,212
People are gonna die, Buck.

1245
01:49:27,152 --> 01:49:28,572
And I can't let that happen.

1246
01:49:36,921 --> 01:49:38,771
Please, don't make me do this.

1247
01:50:47,202 --> 01:50:48,212
_

1248
01:50:48,231 --> 01:50:49,372
Done.

1249
01:50:50,402 --> 01:50:51,622
And it's trending.

1250
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:02,492
Unless you want 2-inch hole in
your sternum, I'd put that gun down.

1251
01:51:04,971 --> 01:51:07,292
That was armed the moment
pinned it on.

1252
01:51:40,402 --> 01:51:41,471
Drop it.

1253
01:51:42,322 --> 01:51:43,532
Drop it!

1254
01:52:03,631 --> 01:52:06,832
I'm on 41, heading towards
the south-west stairwell.

1255
01:52:13,622 --> 01:52:14,921
This is gonna hurt.

1256
01:52:16,532 --> 01:52:19,582
There are no prisoners with HYDRA,
just order.

1257
01:52:19,902 --> 01:52:21,752
And order only comes
through pain.

1258
01:52:23,572 --> 01:52:25,992
Are you ready for yours?
Man, shut the hell up.

1259
01:52:27,811 --> 01:52:30,981
Lieutenant, how much longer?
65 seconds to satellite link.

1260
01:52:31,171 --> 01:52:34,502
Target reengaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1261
01:52:38,631 --> 01:52:39,631
One minute.

1262
01:52:59,082 --> 01:53:00,721
30 seconds, Cap.

1263
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:03,442
Stand by.

1264
01:53:17,471 --> 01:53:19,042
We reached 3000 feet.

1265
01:53:19,811 --> 01:53:21,601
Satellite coming online now.

1266
01:53:23,462 --> 01:53:24,931
Deploy algorithm.

1267
01:53:25,891 --> 01:53:27,502
Algorithm deployed.

1268
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:29,931
We are go to targets.

1269
01:53:34,921 --> 01:53:35,971
_

1270
01:53:47,141 --> 01:53:48,391
_

1271
01:53:49,002 --> 01:53:51,792
Targets saturation reached.
All targets assigned.

1272
01:53:52,011 --> 01:53:53,412
Fire when ready.

1273
01:53:55,181 --> 01:53:56,542
Firing in...

1274
01:53:56,582 --> 01:53:57,801
three...

1275
01:53:58,612 --> 01:53:59,761
two...

1276
01:54:00,662 --> 01:54:01,841
one.

1277
01:54:04,702 --> 01:54:05,971
Charlie locked.

1278
01:54:06,101 --> 01:54:07,351
Where are the targets?

1279
01:54:08,561 --> 01:54:09,952
Where are the targets?

1280
01:54:10,002 --> 01:54:11,542
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1281
01:54:13,202 --> 01:54:14,502
_

1282
01:54:28,811 --> 01:54:29,971
Fire now.

1283
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:32,051
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1284
01:54:32,391 --> 01:54:33,851
Do it now!

1285
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:05,561
What a waste.

1286
01:55:05,712 --> 01:55:08,351
Are you still on the fence
about Rogers chances?

1287
01:55:08,662 --> 01:55:10,931
Time to go, Councilwoman.
This way.

1288
01:55:11,511 --> 01:55:13,811
Come on. You gonna
fly me out of here.

1289
01:55:14,152 --> 01:55:17,591
You know, there was a time
I would have taken a bullet for you.

1290
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:20,212
You already did.
And you will again when...

1291
01:55:24,072 --> 01:55:25,072
_

1292
01:55:25,082 --> 01:55:26,082
_

1293
01:55:34,252 --> 01:55:35,572
Romanoff!

1294
01:55:36,402 --> 01:55:37,652
Natasha!

1295
01:55:39,311 --> 01:55:41,181
Natasha, come on!

1296
01:55:48,131 --> 01:55:49,782
Those really do sting.

1297
01:56:22,652 --> 01:56:24,292
Hail, HYDRA.

1298
01:57:19,322 --> 01:57:20,992
You're out of your depth, kid.

1299
01:57:38,242 --> 01:57:40,381
Please, tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1300
01:57:40,402 --> 01:57:41,872
Sam, where are you?

1301
01:57:42,551 --> 01:57:46,372
41st floor, north-west corner!
We're on it, stay where you are.

1302
01:57:46,412 --> 01:57:47,841
Not an option!

1303
01:58:02,021 --> 01:58:04,731
41st floor! 41st!

1304
01:58:04,742 --> 01:58:07,851
It's not likely to put the floor numbers
on the outside of a building.

1305
01:58:09,381 --> 01:58:12,391
Hill, where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1306
01:58:28,242 --> 01:58:29,532
You know me.

1307
01:58:31,261 --> 01:58:32,631
No, I don't!

1308
01:58:42,212 --> 01:58:43,351
Bucky.

1309
01:58:44,731 --> 01:58:46,372
You know me your whole life.

1310
01:58:53,731 --> 01:58:55,011
Your name...

1311
01:58:55,152 --> 01:58:59,261
is James Buchanan Barnes.
Shut up!

1312
01:59:07,681 --> 01:59:09,282
I'm not gonna fight you.

1313
01:59:13,442 --> 01:59:14,881
You're my friend.

1314
01:59:21,622 --> 01:59:22,981
You are my mission.

1315
01:59:25,282 --> 01:59:27,872
You're... my... mission!

1316
01:59:30,721 --> 01:59:32,162
Then finish it.

1317
01:59:35,162 --> 01:59:37,492
'Cause I'm with you
till the end of the line.

1318
02:01:28,931 --> 02:01:33,881
_

1319
02:01:48,582 --> 02:01:50,122
On your left.

1320
02:02:09,481 --> 02:02:11,881
_

1321
02:02:41,002 --> 02:02:42,912
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth

1322
02:02:43,032 --> 02:02:45,042
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1323
02:02:45,171 --> 02:02:46,362
I do.

1324
02:02:48,511 --> 02:02:50,731
Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?

1325
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:54,761
I don't know what's left
left for him to say.

1326
02:02:54,771 --> 02:02:58,282
I think the rock in the middle of the
Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.

1327
02:02:58,292 --> 02:03:00,381
Well, he could explain
how this country's expected

1328
02:03:00,391 --> 02:03:02,242
to maintain its national security

1329
02:03:02,252 --> 02:03:06,742
now that he and you
have laid waste our intelligence apparatus.

1330
02:03:06,952 --> 02:03:09,002
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1331
02:03:09,021 --> 02:03:12,072
Many of which you seem
to have had a personal hand in telling.

1332
02:03:12,091 --> 02:03:16,051
Agent, you should know that
there are some on this committee who feel,

1333
02:03:16,061 --> 02:03:19,712
given your service record,
both for this country and against it,

1334
02:03:20,202 --> 02:03:21,992
that you belong in penitentiary.

1335
02:03:22,231 --> 02:03:24,471
Not mouthing off
on Capitol Hill.

1336
02:03:26,122 --> 02:03:27,872
You're not gonna
put me in prison.

1337
02:03:28,591 --> 02:03:30,902
You're not gonna
put any of us in prison.

1338
02:03:31,992 --> 02:03:33,271
You know why?

1339
02:03:34,051 --> 02:03:36,931
Do enlight us.
Because you need us.

1340
02:03:38,021 --> 02:03:40,332
Yes, the world is
a vulnerable place,

1341
02:03:40,561 --> 02:03:42,532
and yes we helped
make it that way.

1342
02:03:43,351 --> 02:03:46,162
But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.

1343
02:03:47,692 --> 02:03:49,921
So if you want to arrest me,
arrest me.

1344
02:03:50,801 --> 02:03:52,381
You'll know where to find me.

1345
02:04:27,742 --> 02:04:30,942
So, you've experienced
this sort of things before?

1346
02:04:31,292 --> 02:04:32,631
You get used to it.

1347
02:04:32,671 --> 02:04:34,872
_

1348
02:04:35,002 --> 02:04:37,202
We've been data-mining
HYDRA'S files.

1349
02:04:37,462 --> 02:04:40,162
Looks Like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1350
02:04:41,332 --> 02:04:43,402
I'm heading to Europe tonight.

1351
02:04:43,631 --> 02:04:45,402
Wanted to ask if you'll come with me.

1352
02:04:46,242 --> 02:04:47,962
There's something
I gotta do first.

1353
02:04:48,601 --> 02:04:51,442
How about you, Wilson?
I could use a man with your abilities.

1354
02:04:52,192 --> 02:04:54,261
I'm more of a soldier
than a spy.

1355
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:56,362
All right, than.

1356
02:05:01,402 --> 02:05:05,362
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me right here.

1357
02:05:07,362 --> 02:05:10,462
You should be honored. That's about
as close as he gets to saying thank you.

1358
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:14,492
- Not going with him?
- No.

1359
02:05:14,681 --> 02:05:16,502
- Not staying here?
- No.

1360
02:05:17,891 --> 02:05:20,301
I blew all my covers
I gotta go figure a new one.

1361
02:05:20,402 --> 02:05:22,801
It might take a while.
I'm counting on it.

1362
02:05:25,572 --> 02:05:29,181
That thing you asked for,
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1363
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,771
Will you do me a favor?

1364
02:05:34,162 --> 02:05:35,481
Call that nurse.

1365
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:38,381
She' not a nurse.
And you're not a SHIELD agent.

1366
02:05:39,631 --> 02:05:41,612
What was her name again?
Sharon.

1367
02:05:42,742 --> 02:05:44,112
She's nice.

1368
02:05:56,002 --> 02:05:57,421
Be careful, Steve.

1369
02:05:58,572 --> 02:06:00,521
You might not wanna
pull on that thread.

1370
02:06:11,832 --> 02:06:13,252
You're going after him?

1371
02:06:13,962 --> 02:06:15,351
You don't have to come with me.

1372
02:06:15,362 --> 02:06:16,681
I know.

1373
02:06:18,362 --> 02:06:19,641
When do we start?

1374
02:06:20,492 --> 02:06:23,192
_

1375
02:07:25,742 --> 02:07:27,891
_

1376
02:07:27,942 --> 02:07:30,042
_

1377
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:32,091
_

1378
02:07:34,192 --> 02:07:36,542
_

1379
02:07:37,841 --> 02:07:40,292
_

1380
02:07:40,942 --> 02:07:43,141
_

1381
02:07:43,942 --> 02:07:46,091
_

1382
02:07:46,292 --> 02:07:48,591
_

1383
02:07:50,841 --> 02:07:52,992
_

1384
02:07:55,442 --> 02:07:57,742
_

1385
02:08:07,442 --> 02:08:09,591
_

1386
02:08:09,891 --> 02:08:12,091
_

1387
02:08:13,692 --> 02:08:16,042
Captain America: The Winter Soldier...

1388
02:08:18,841 --> 02:08:20,061
It's over.

1389
02:08:20,261 --> 02:08:22,721
Fury has released everything
to the public.

1390
02:08:23,242 --> 02:08:24,841
Everything he knows about.

1391
02:08:24,992 --> 02:08:27,152
Mr. Strucker, If they get a word
of our work here,

1392
02:08:27,202 --> 02:08:29,100
If they found out
we serve HYDRA...

1393
02:08:29,101 --> 02:08:31,171
HYDRA, SHIELD...

1394
02:08:31,822 --> 02:08:35,101
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1395
02:08:38,521 --> 02:08:40,471
What we have...

1396
02:08:42,152 --> 02:08:44,542
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1397
02:08:47,271 --> 02:08:50,811
We've only scratched
the surface and already...

1398
02:08:53,881 --> 02:08:57,851
There are other facilities
doing HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1399
02:08:58,872 --> 02:09:02,162
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1400
02:09:02,481 --> 02:09:04,242
Keep them off our scent.

1401
02:09:04,582 --> 02:09:06,431
What about the volunteers?

1402
02:09:06,872 --> 02:09:10,862
The dead will be buried so deep their
own ghosts won't be able to find them.

1403
02:09:13,021 --> 02:09:14,742
And the survivors?

1404
02:09:16,421 --> 02:09:17,771
The twins.

1405
02:09:21,612 --> 02:09:24,582
Sooner or later
they will meet the twins.

1406
02:09:26,652 --> 02:09:30,662
It's not a world of spies anymore.
Not even a world of heroes.

1407
02:09:31,782 --> 02:09:34,801
This is the age of miracles, doctor.

1408
02:09:36,332 --> 02:09:38,822
There's nothing more horrifying

1409
02:09:40,141 --> 02:09:41,652
than a miracle.
