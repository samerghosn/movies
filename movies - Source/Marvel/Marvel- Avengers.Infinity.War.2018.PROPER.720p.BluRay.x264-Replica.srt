1
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,192
This is the Asgardian

2
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,736
refugee vessel Statesman.

3
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,777
We are under assault.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,950
I repeat, we are under assault.

5
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,658
The engines are dead,
life support failing.

6
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,789
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,953
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.

8
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,582
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,165
We have very few soldiers here.

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,210
This is not a warcraft.

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,295
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,769
Hear me and rejoice.

13
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,817
You have had the privilege

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,573
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

15
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,750
You may think this is suffering.

16
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,953
No.

17
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,338
It is salvation.

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,930
Universal scales
tip toward balance

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,758
because of your sacrifice.

20
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,805
Smile.

21
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:48,146
For even in death,

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,691
you have become
Children of Thanos.

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,163
I know what it's like to lose.

24
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,296
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

25
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,793
yet to fail, nonetheless.

26
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,510
It's frightening.

27
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,812
Turns the legs to jelly.

28
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,058
But I ask you, to what end?

29
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,072
Dread it, run from it...

30
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:41,653
destiny arrives all the same.

31
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,703
And now, it's here.

32
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,122
Or should I say...

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,949
I am.

34
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,756
You talk too much.

35
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,509
The Tesseract.

36
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,003
Or your brother's head.

37
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,054
I assume you have a preference.

38
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,600
Oh, I do.

39
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,062
Kill away.

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,449
All right, stop!

41
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,962
We don't have the Tesseract.

42
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,966
It was destroyed on Asgard.

43
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,638
You really are
the worst brother.

44
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,562
I assure you, brother...

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,697
the sun will shine on us again.

46
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,651
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

47
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,786
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

48
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,161
And for another...

49
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,748
we have a Hulk.

50
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,850
Let him have his fun.

51
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,610
Allfathers...

52
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,735
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

53
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,660
time.

54
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,959
That was a mistake.

55
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,514
No!

56
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,271
You're going to die for that.

57
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,651
Shh.

58
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,285
My humble personage...

59
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,000
bows before your grandeur.

60
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,512
No other being
has ever had the might...

61
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,591
nay, the nobility...

62
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,685
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

63
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,564
The universe lies
within your grasp.

64
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,560
There are two more stones
on Earth.

65
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,524
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

66
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,237
Father, we will not fail you.

67
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,901
If I might interject.

68
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,369
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

69
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,875
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

70
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,375
If you consider
failure experience.

71
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,206
I consider
experience experience.

72
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,917
Almighty Thanos...

73
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,886
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

74
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,894
Odinson...

75
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,728
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

76
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,228
god of mischief...

77
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,605
do hereby pledge to you...

78
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:16,901
my undying fidelity.

79
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,954
Undying?

80
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,423
You should choose your words
more carefully.

81
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:57,942
You...

82
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,662
will never be...

83
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,456
a god.

84
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:15,793
No!

85
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,270
No resurrections this time.

86
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,049
No. Loki.

87
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,837
Seriously,
you don't have any money?

88
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,970
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

89
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,429
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

90
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:47,469
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

91
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,479
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

92
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,639
Dollars?

93
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,148
- Rupees.
- Which is?

94
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,145
Uh, buck and a half.

95
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,525
What do you want?

96
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,317
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

97
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,751
Thanos is coming.

98
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,538
He's coming.

99
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,130
Who?

100
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,099
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

101
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,179
You're totally rambling.

102
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,308
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

103
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,514
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

104
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,725
and in the dream you gotta pee.

105
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,893
- Yeah.
- Okay.

106
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,184
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

107
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,441
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

108
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,520
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

109
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,605
"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

110
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,780
And then you wake up
and in real life

111
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,903
you actually have to pee.

112
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,984
- Yes.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,192
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

114
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,077
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

115
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:51,408
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

116
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,209
It was so real.

117
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,918
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

118
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,995
Uh, what was his name?

119
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,414
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

120
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,208
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

121
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:01,967
...and thought that we were...

122
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,219
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

123
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,341
- Yes?
- No.

124
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,797
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

125
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,306
If you wanted to have a kid...

126
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,388
you wouldn't have done that.

127
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,019
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

128
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,517
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

129
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,101
You're not helping
your case, okay?

130
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,307
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

131
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,942
You don't need that.

132
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:19,360
I know, I had the surgery.

133
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,481
I'm just trying to protect us...

134
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,313
and future usses and that's it.

135
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,073
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

136
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,071
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

137
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,202
You know me so well.

138
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,998
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

139
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,408
You should have shirts
in your closet.

140
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,786
Yeah.

141
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,337
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

142
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,668
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

143
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,966
Show off this Harry Winston.

144
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,384
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

145
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,590
I should promise you.

146
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,051
- Yes.
- I will.

147
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,553
Thank you.

148
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,806
Tony Stark.

149
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,971
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

150
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,567
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

151
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,602
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

152
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,109
We need your help.

153
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,490
It's not overselling it
to say that

154
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,111
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

155
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,739
And who's "we"?

156
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,490
Hey, Tony.

157
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:12,697
Bruce.

158
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,490
- Pepper.
- Hi.

159
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,120
- Oh.
- You okay?

160
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,086
At the dawn of the universe,

161
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,134
there was nothing. Then...

162
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,798
Boom.

163
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:30,682
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

164
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,684
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

165
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,267
These Infinity Stones

166
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:39,269
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

167
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,397
Space.

168
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,691
Reality.

169
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,485
Power.

170
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,863
Soul.

171
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,157
Mind.

172
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,322
And Time.

173
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,166
Tell me his name again.

174
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,466
Thanos.

175
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:07,923
He's a plague, Tony.

176
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,879
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

177
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,264
He wipes out
half the population.

178
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,058
He sent Loki.

179
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,600
The attack on New York,
that's him.

180
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,306
This is it.

181
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,475
What's our timeline?

182
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,775
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

183
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,936
That already makes him

184
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,567
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

185
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,075
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

186
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,241
He could destroy life

187
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,320
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

188
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,370
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

189
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,581
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

190
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,241
Is that what it is?

191
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,917
I'm going to allow that.

192
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:47,591
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

193
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,134
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

194
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,211
No can do.

195
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,097
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

196
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,381
And I swore off dairy...

197
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,059
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

198
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,601
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

199
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,138
A bit chalky.

200
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,851
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

201
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,140
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

202
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,397
Point is, things change.

203
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,403
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

204
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,605
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,690
Yeah, so conversely,

206
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,650
it may also be
his best chance against us.

207
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,201
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

208
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,278
What is your job exactly?

209
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,989
Besides making balloon animals.

210
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,743
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

211
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,328
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

212
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,371
The fact is we have this stone.

213
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,751
We know where it is.

214
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,466
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

215
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,344
and we have to find him now.

216
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,551
Yeah, that's the thing.

217
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,630
What do you mean?

218
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,974
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

219
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,176
He's offline.

220
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,510
- What?
- Yeah.

221
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,679
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

222
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,014
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

223
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,649
Who could find Vision then?

224
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,645
shooot.

225
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:51,313
Probably Steve Rogers.

226
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:52,653
Oh, great.

227
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,325
Maybe.

228
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,943
But...

229
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,532
Call him.

230
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,580
It's not that easy.

231
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,537
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

232
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,620
No.

233
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,376
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

234
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,091
Broke up?

235
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,970
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

236
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,966
Cap and I fell out hard.

237
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,136
We're not on speaking terms.

238
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,096
Tony, listen to me.

239
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,522
Thor's gone.

240
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,395
Thanos is coming.

241
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,102
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

242
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,370
Flip phone.

243
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,692
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

244
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,940
moving your hair, would ya?

245
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,113
Not at the moment, no.

246
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,647
You okay?

247
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,767
- Help him!
- Banner!

248
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,527
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

249
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,731
Friday, what am I looking at?

250
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,153
Not sure.
I'm working on it.

251
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,361
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

252
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,656
in your back pocket, Doc!

253
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,034
Might wanna use it.

254
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,768
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

255
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,228
Holy shooot.

256
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,146
We're all gonna die!

257
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,442
There's a spaceship!

258
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,320
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

259
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:45,954
What's the matter with you kids?

260
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,827
You never seen
a spaceship before?

261
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,429
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

262
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,506
Notify first responders.

263
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:04,845
Will do.

264
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,126
Hear me and rejoice.

265
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,965
You are about to die

266
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,089
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

267
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,717
Be thankful...

268
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,427
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

269
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,552
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

270
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,438
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

271
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:53,722
Stonekeeper.

272
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,026
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

273
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,898
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

274
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,777
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

275
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,240
He means get lost, Squidward.

276
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,573
He exhausts me.

277
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,700
Bring me the stone.

278
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,788
Banner, you want a piece?

279
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,160
Mmm, no, not really.

280
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,539
But when do I ever get
what I want?

281
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,703
That's right.

282
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,630
Okay. Push!

283
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,256
It's been a while.

284
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,916
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

285
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,085
Okay. Shh.

286
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,921
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

287
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,338
Come on, come on, man.

288
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,721
God!

289
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,094
Where's your guy?

290
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,979
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

291
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,101
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

292
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,731
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

293
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,112
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

294
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,197
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

295
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,278
It's okay.

296
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,739
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

297
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:52,247
- I have him.
- Damn it.

298
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,105
Where'd that come from?

299
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,315
It's nanotech.

300
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,441
You like it?
A little something I...

301
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,490
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

302
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,694
won't be joining us...

303
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,622
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.

304
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,127
It stays with me.

305
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,633
Exactly. Bye.

306
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,184
Tony, you okay?

307
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,313
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.

308
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:58,513
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

309
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,978
I'm trying. He won't come out.

310
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,942
Hammer.

311
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:13,570
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

312
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,865
Come out! Come out! Come out!

313
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,250
No!

314
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,917
What do you mean, "no"?

315
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,298
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

316
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,262
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.

317
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,769
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

318
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,931
Uh, he's from space.

319
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,981
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

320
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:10,469
Your powers are quaint.

321
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,297
You must be popular
with children.

322
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,055
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

323
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,185
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

324
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:37,410
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

325
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,160
You'll only wish you were dead.

326
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,417
No!

327
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,089
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.

328
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,804
On it!

329
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,599
Not cool.

330
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:11,855
Gotcha!

331
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,608
Wait!

332
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,661
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

333
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,165
Hang on, kid.

334
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,220
Oh!

335
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,015
Ugh.

336
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,851
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

337
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,526
Give me a little juice, Friday.

338
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:06,873
Unlock 17:A.

339
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,474
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

340
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,723
But you said save the wizard!

341
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,137
I can't breathe.

342
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,103
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

343
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,309
Yeah. That makes sense.

344
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,496
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

345
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:51,709
Happy trails, kid.

346
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,211
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.

347
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,634
Oh, come on!

348
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,054
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

349
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,221
Tony? Oh, my God.

350
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,306
Are you all right?
What's going on?

351
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,769
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think

352
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,145
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.

353
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,317
Why?

354
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,894
Just 'cause I'll probably

355
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,400
not make it back for a while.

356
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,731
Tell me you're not on that ship.

357
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,816
Yeah.

358
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,241
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.

359
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,993
Honey, I'm sorry.

360
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,325
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

361
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:24,654
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.

362
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,914
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.

363
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,034
Come back.

364
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,123
Boss, we 're losing her.

365
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,334
I'm going too.

366
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:42,673
Oh, my God!

367
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:49,104
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

368
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:04,819
Where you going?

369
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,489
The Time Stone's been taken.

370
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,577
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

371
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,666
What will you do?

372
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,124
I'm gonna make a call.

373
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,583
Sing it, Drax!

374
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,550
Why are we doing this again?

375
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,345
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

376
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,429
Someone could be dying.

377
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,689
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

378
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,644
'Cause we're nice.

379
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:16,808
And maybe whoever it is

380
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,565
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

381
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,070
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

382
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,948
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

383
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,153
We take his ship.

384
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,989
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

385
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,193
All right!

386
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,830
We are arriving.

387
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:33,241
All right, Guardians,

388
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,451
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

389
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,916
so let's put on our mean faces.

390
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,714
Groot, put that thing away, now.

391
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,795
I don't wanna tell you again.

392
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,005
Groot.

393
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,298
I am Groot!

394
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,382
- Whoa!
- Language!

395
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,848
- Hey!
- Wow.

396
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,681
You got some acorns on you, kid.

397
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,391
Ever since you got a little sap,

398
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,471
you're a total d-hole.

399
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,684
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

400
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,154
What happened?

401
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,538
Oh, my God.

402
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,872
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

403
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:24,092
Wipers! Wipers!

404
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,548
Get it off.

405
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,971
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

406
00:29:35,147 --> 00:29:36,933
He is not a dude.

407
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,644
You're a dude.

408
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,023
This... This is a man.

409
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,147
A handsome, muscular man.

410
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,315
I'm muscular.

411
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,400
But who are you kidding, Quill?

412
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,858
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

413
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,943
Yeah, right.

414
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,528
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

415
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,953
What?

416
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,750
Gamora, do you think I'm...

417
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,631
He is anxious, angry.

418
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,667
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

419
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,297
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

420
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,471
Wow.

421
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,424
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

422
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,309
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

423
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,470
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

424
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,936
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

425
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,314
It's like his muscles

426
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,311
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

427
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,192
Stop massaging his muscles.

428
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,980
Wake him up.

429
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,067
Wake.

430
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,920
Who the hell are you guys?

431
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,344
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

432
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,228
To bring balance to the universe

433
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,477
by wiping out half of all life.

434
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,607
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

435
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,059
massacre by massacre.

436
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,729
Including my own.

437
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,489
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

438
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:10,865
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

439
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,452
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

440
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,412
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

441
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,546
Your father killed my brother.

442
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,088
Oh, boy.

443
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,920
Stepfather, technically.

444
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,006
And she hates him
as much as you do.

445
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,260
Families can be tough.

446
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:36,766
Before my father died,

447
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,594
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

448
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,012
that he imprisoned in Hel.

449
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,148
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

450
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,605
So I had to kill her.

451
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,816
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

452
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,145
Goes round and round and...

453
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,980
I feel your pain.

454
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,445
I feel your pain as well,
because...

455
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,780
I mean, it's not a competition,

456
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,986
but I've been through a lot.

457
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,825
My father killed my mother.

458
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,114
And then I had to kill
my father.

459
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,699
That was hard.

460
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:03,743
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

461
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,163
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

462
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,048
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

463
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,970
How do I open this thing?
ls there some sort of, uh...

464
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,053
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

465
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,511
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

466
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,017
No, you're not.

467
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:29,019
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

468
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,898
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

469
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,443
- No.
- You are.

470
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,328
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

471
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,660
No, I'm not.

472
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,871
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

473
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,039
Are you mocking me?

474
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:53,423
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

475
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,920
He's trying to copy me.

476
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,005
I need you to stop doing that.

477
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,798
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

478
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,340
We need to stop Thanos.

479
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,055
Which means we need to find out

480
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,135
where he's going next.

481
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,554
Knowhere.

482
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,393
He must be going somewhere.

483
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,557
No, no. Knowhere?

484
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,397
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

485
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,983
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

486
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:16,570
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

487
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,905
Because for years...

488
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:20,240
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

489
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,742
with a man called the Collector.

490
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,499
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

491
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,453
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

492
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,910
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

493
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:29,625
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

494
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:32,165
There are six stones out there.

495
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,550
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

496
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,009
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

497
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,511
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

498
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:43,346
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

499
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,137
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

500
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,221
They're with the Avengers.

501
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,807
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

502
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:50,099
Like Kevin Bacon?

503
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,564
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

504
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,644
I haven't been there in a while.

505
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,028
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

506
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,816
No one even knows where it is.

507
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,733
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

508
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:00,284
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

509
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:02,866
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

510
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,076
You're welcome.

511
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,457
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

512
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,291
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

513
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,588
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

514
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:14,840
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

515
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,626
That place is a legend.

516
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,215
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

517
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,342
to ever torment the universe.

518
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,554
I would very much like
to go there, please.

519
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:23,717
The rabbit is correct

520
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,802
and clearly the smartest
among you.

521
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,972
Rabbit?

522
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,387
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

523
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,773
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

524
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:30,932
You're very perceptive.

525
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,317
You seem like a noble leader.

526
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,985
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

527
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,943
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

528
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,858
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

529
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:40,150
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

530
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,235
Quiet.

531
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,911
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

532
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,697
Look, this is my ship.

533
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:46,614
And I'm not goin' to...

534
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,708
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

535
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,119
The Thanos-killing kind.

536
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,454
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

537
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:55,670
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

538
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,925
Your bodies would crumble

539
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,172
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

540
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,257
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

541
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,592
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

542
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,005
If we don't go to Knowhere

543
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,682
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

544
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,389
he'll be too powerful to stop.

545
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,724
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

546
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,605
We got two ships

547
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,056
and a large assortment
of morons.

548
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,478
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

549
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,815
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

550
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:18,487
to try to stop Thanos.

551
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,568
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

552
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,030
For the record...

553
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,117
I know that
you're going with him

554
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:25,286
because it's where Thanos isn't.

555
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,947
You know, you really shouldn't

556
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,157
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

557
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,458
Come on, Groot.

558
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,713
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

559
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,260
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

560
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,545
Bye.

561
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,436
Vis?

562
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,818
Is it the stone again?

563
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,608
It's as if it's speaking to me.

564
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,951
What does it say?

565
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,204
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

566
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,659
Hey.

567
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,005
Tell me what you feel.

568
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,730
I just feel you.

569
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:43,818
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

570
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:45,983
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

571
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,617
What if I miss that train?

572
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,778
There's an 11:00.

573
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,369
What if I missed all the trains?

574
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:54,458
What if this time
I didn't go back?

575
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:55,960
But you gave Stark your word.

576
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,291
I'd rather give it to you.

577
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,422
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

578
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,922
We both made promises.

579
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,800
Not to each other.

580
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,210
Wanda.

581
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,512
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

582
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,721
trying to see
if this could work and...

583
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,476
I don't know.

584
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,603
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

585
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,476
I think...

586
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,731
- It works.
- It works.

587
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,186
It works.

588
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,894
Stay.

589
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,485
Stay with me.

590
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:32,489
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

591
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,289
What are they?

592
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,045
What the stone
was warning me about.

593
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,353
I have to go.

594
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,429
No, Vision.

595
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,306
Vision, if that's true,

596
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,188
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

597
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:03,318
Wanda, I...

598
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,527
Vision!

599
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,347
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

600
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,230
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

601
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,025
My systems are failing.

602
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,608
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

603
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,364
Vis!

604
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,621
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

605
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:40,958
Hands off.

606
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,009
Come on. Come on.

607
00:39:58,186 --> 00:39:59,972
Come on, you gotta get up.

608
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,355
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

609
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,853
Hey. We have to go.

610
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:09,362
Please. Please leave.

611
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,275
You asked me to stay.

612
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:13,695
- I'm staying.
- Please.

613
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,606
- Get up.
- I can't.

614
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,483
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

615
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,815
You'll never get
the chance again.

616
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,333
Can you stand?

617
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,505
Thank you, Captain.

618
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,840
Let's get you on the jet.

619
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,226
Now, I thought we had a deal.

620
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,108
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

621
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,610
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,565
We just wanted time.

623
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,525
Where to, Cap?

624
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,862
Home.

625
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,498
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

626
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,106
Zehobereians.

627
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,021
Mother! Where's my mother?

628
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,530
Choose a side or die.

629
00:42:57,699 --> 00:42:59,155
Mother!

630
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,489
One side is a revelation...

631
00:43:01,661 --> 00:43:04,699
the other an honor
known only to a few.

632
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,081
What's wrong, little one?

633
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,123
My mother. Where is my mother?

634
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,132
What's your name?

635
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,132
Gamora.

636
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,755
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

637
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,300
Come.

638
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,675
Let me help you.

639
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,315
Look.

640
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:46,657
Pretty, isn't it?

641
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,875
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

642
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,788
Too much to one side
or the other...

643
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,635
Here. You try.

644
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,476
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.

645
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,813
Uh-uh.

646
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,269
Concentrate.

647
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,027
There. You've got it.

648
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,623
Gamora.

649
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,793
Do you know if these grenades

650
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,041
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

651
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,295
Because I was thinking about

652
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:38,965
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

653
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,132
But I don't want to
if they're the...

654
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,458
I need to ask a favor.

655
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:43,719
Yeah, sure.

656
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,347
One way or another,

657
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,675
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

658
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,927
Which is what
the grenades are for.

659
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,188
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

660
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:58,518
If things go wrong...

661
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,275
If Thanos gets me...

662
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,786
I want you to promise me...

663
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:10,947
you'll kill me.

664
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,699
What?

665
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,246
I know something he doesn't.

666
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,007
And if he finds it out,

667
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:24,460
the entire universe
could be at risk.

668
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,219
What do you know?

669
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:28,427
If I tell you, you'd know too.

670
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,311
If it's so important...

671
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,471
shouldn't I?

672
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,813
Only if you wanna die.

673
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,565
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

674
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:39,976
Just...

675
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:45,398
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

676
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,907
I mean, I'd like to.

677
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,911
I really would. But you...

678
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,286
Swear to me.

679
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,081
Swear to me on your mother.

680
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,085
Okay.

681
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:12,300
Okay.

682
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,570
- Oh.
- Dude.

683
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,197
How long have you been
standing there?

684
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,278
An hour.

685
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,072
An hour?

686
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,911
Are you serious?

687
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,246
I've mastered the ability

688
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:40,998
of standing
so incredibly still...

689
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:44,798
that I become
invisible to the eye.

690
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,418
Watch.

691
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,931
You're eating a zarg-nut.

692
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,804
But my movement...

693
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:56,260
was so slow...

694
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,938
that it's imperceptible.

695
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,097
Mmm, no.

696
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,523
I'm sure I'm invisible.

697
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,856
Hi, Drax.

698
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,563
Damn it.

699
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,210
This place looks deserted.

700
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:32,130
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

701
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,219
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

702
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:37,099
Let's put down right here.

703
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,402
I don't have it.

704
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,242
Everyone in the galaxy knows

705
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,740
you'd sell your own brother...

706
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,530
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

707
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,619
to your pathetic collection.

708
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:09,838
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

709
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,264
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

710
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,101
I told you.

711
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:20,887
I sold it.

712
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,766
Why would I lie?

713
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,152
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

714
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,695
Like suicide.

715
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,356
You do understand.

716
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,318
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

717
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,862
I didn't know what it was.

718
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,831
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

719
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,199
It's him.

720
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,833
Last chance, charlatan.

721
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,338
Where's the stone?

722
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,498
Today...

723
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:49,916
Drax. Drax.

724
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,050
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

725
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,172
Drax, wait.

726
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,047
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

727
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,465
Drax.

728
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,596
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

729
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:06,014
He doesn't have the stone yet.

730
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,809
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

731
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:11,817
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

732
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,072
No.

733
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,280
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

734
00:49:16,744 --> 00:49:18,030
Sleep.

735
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,956
Okay.

736
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,219
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

737
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,838
The other right.

738
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,873
Why?

739
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,971
Why you, daughter?

740
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:37,565
That was quick.

741
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:48,244
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

742
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:53,297
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

743
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:58,920
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.

744
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,556
But one never knows for sure.

745
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,617
Reality is often disappointing.

746
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:27,030
That is, it was.

747
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,451
Now...

748
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:35,251
reality can be whatever I want.

749
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,257
You knew I'd come.

750
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,045
I counted on it.

751
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,760
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

752
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,103
Thanos!

753
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,733
No!

754
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,702
Let her go, Grimace.

755
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,153
Peter.

756
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,864
I told you to go right.

757
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,824
Now? Really?

758
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,414
You let her go!

759
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,545
Ah, the boyfriend.

760
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,704
No.

761
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,043
Like to think of myself

762
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,592
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

763
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,798
- Let her go.
- Peter.

764
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,681
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

765
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:28,759
Not him.

766
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,947
You promised. You promised.

767
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:48,327
Oh, daughter.

768
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,282
You expect too much from him.

769
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,461
She's asked, hasn't she?

770
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,416
Do it.

771
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:06,505
Mmm.

772
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,179
Do it!

773
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,353
I told you to go right.

774
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,278
I love you more than anything.

775
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,900
I love you too.

776
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,253
I like him.

777
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,914
Still no word from Vision?

778
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,659
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

779
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,331
On a stolen Quinjet

780
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,208
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.

781
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,257
You know they're
only criminals because

782
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,833
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

783
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,126
My God, Rhodes.

784
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,514
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.

785
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:30,797
If it weren't for those Accords,

786
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,257
Vision would've been right here.

787
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,228
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

788
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,722
That's right.

789
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,567
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

790
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,943
You have second thoughts?

791
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:44,820
Not anymore.

792
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:52,244
Mr. Secretary.

793
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,454
You got some nerve.

794
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:00,744
I'll give you that.

795
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,664
You could use
some of that right now.

796
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,750
The world's on fire.

797
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:09,635
And you think all is forgiven?

798
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,090
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

799
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,300
And I'm way past
asking permission.

800
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,307
Earth just lost
her best defender.

801
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,021
So we're here to fight.

802
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,521
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

803
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,440
we'll fight you too.

804
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,690
Arrest them.

805
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,411
All over it.

806
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,867
That's a court-martial.

807
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,329
It's great to see you, Cap.

808
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:46,206
You too, Rhodey.

809
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,291
Hey.

810
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,923
Wow. You guys...

811
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,755
really look like crap.

812
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,516
Must've been
a rough couple years.

813
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,347
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

814
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,976
Uh, I think you look great.

815
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:05,400
Uh...

816
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:10,110
Yeah, I'm back.

817
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:12,775
Hi, Bruce.

818
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,322
Nat.

819
00:56:22,753 --> 00:56:24,289
This is awkward.

820
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,335
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

821
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,670
And they can clearly find us.

822
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,052
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

823
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,802
After the whole
Accords situation,

824
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:35,422
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

825
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,137
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

826
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,554
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

827
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,184
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

828
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,141
Okay, look.

829
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:45,065
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

830
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,648
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

831
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:51,525
Vision's stone.

832
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,940
Then we have to protect it.

833
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:54,733
No, we have to destroy it.

834
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,199
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

835
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,280
to this entity in my head.

836
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,947
About its nature.

837
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,663
But also its composition.

838
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:05,827
I think if it were exposed

839
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,755
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

840
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,759
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

841
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,509
its molecular integrity
could fail.

842
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,298
Yeah, and you with it.

843
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,224
We're not having
this conversation.

844
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:22,385
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

845
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,472
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

846
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,231
That's too high a price.

847
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,106
Only you have
the power to pay it.

848
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,409
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

849
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:43,119
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

850
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,704
But it should.

851
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,579
We don't trade lives, Vision.

852
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,713
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

853
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,670
to save how many
millions of people?

854
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,880
Tell me,
why is this any different?

855
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,342
Because you might have a choice.

856
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,972
Your mind is made up

857
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,427
of a complex construct
of overlays.

858
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:06,188
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

859
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,099
All of them mixed together,

860
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,682
all of them
learning from one another.

861
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,811
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

862
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,072
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

863
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,652
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

864
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:18,199
Perhaps the best parts.

865
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,867
Can we do that?

866
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:21,614
Not me, not here.

867
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:24,159
Well, you better find someone

868
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,411
and somewhere fast.

869
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,949
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

870
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,251
have your old rooms back.

871
00:58:31,298 --> 00:58:32,880
I know somewhere.

872
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:48,764
The Kingsguard

873
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,144
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

874
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,853
And the Border Tribe?

875
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,902
Those that are left.

876
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,313
Send word to the Jabari as well.

877
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,572
M'Baku likes a good fight.

878
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,577
And what of this one?

879
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,322
This one may be tired of war.

880
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:08,704
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

881
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:32,940
Where's the fight?

882
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,273
On its way.

883
00:59:53,672 --> 00:59:56,255
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

884
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:00,126
I have never failed him.

885
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,309
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

886
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,061
with the Time Stone
still attached

887
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,309
to your vaguely
irritating person...

888
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,067
there would be judgment.

889
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,197
Give me...

890
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:30,032
the stone.

891
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,878
Wow, you're a seriously

892
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,054
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

893
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,215
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

894
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,800
What the...

895
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,719
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

896
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:51,931
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

897
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,097
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

898
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,431
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

899
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,516
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

900
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,731
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

901
01:00:57,903 --> 01:00:58,893
God damn it.

902
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,860
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

903
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:03,364
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

904
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,820
And now, I'm here in space.

905
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,407
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

906
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,663
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

907
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,072
This is a one-way ticket.

908
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,704
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

909
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:13,784
No, I did think this through.

910
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,494
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

911
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,161
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

912
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,922
if there's no neighborhood.

913
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,208
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

914
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,635
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

915
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:28,632
Come on. We got a situation.

916
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:30,634
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

917
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,719
What's your plan?

918
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,974
- Go.
- Um...

919
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,059
Okay, okay... Uh...

920
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,567
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

921
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,364
Painful, aren't they?

922
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,117
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

923
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,869
And any one of them...

924
01:01:55,961 --> 01:01:58,168
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

925
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,373
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend-

926
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,211
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.

927
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,753
You've saved nothing.

928
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,632
Your powers are inconsequential

929
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,931
compared to mine.

930
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,969
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

931
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,322
Yes! Wait.
What are those?

932
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,677
Hey, we haven't officially met.

933
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,054
Cool.

934
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,514
We gotta turn this ship around.

935
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,681
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

936
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:56,219
No, I want to protect the stone.

937
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,603
And I want you to thank me.

938
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,181
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

939
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,067
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

940
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,478
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

941
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,646
I seriously don't know

942
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:06,900
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

943
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,315
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

944
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,983
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

945
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:13,072
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

946
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,829
And due to that fact,

947
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,246
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

948
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,079
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

949
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,164
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

950
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,327
The adults are talking.

951
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:24,088
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

952
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,875
What is he, your ward?

953
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,041
No.

954
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,420
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

955
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,304
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

956
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,472
I'm Spider-Man, then.

957
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,925
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

958
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,010
Thing's on autopilot.

959
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,894
Can we control it?

960
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,976
Fly us home?

961
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,976
- Stark?
- Yeah.

962
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,394
Can you get us home?

963
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,813
Yeah, I heard you.

964
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,574
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

965
01:03:52,244 --> 01:03:53,735
Under no circumstances

966
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:56,367
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

967
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,702
I don't think
you quite understand

968
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:58,782
what's at stake here.

969
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,291
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

970
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,204
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

971
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,963
Since he sent an army
to New York

972
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,586
and now he's back.

973
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,672
And I don't know what to do.

974
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,007
So I'm not so sure

975
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,882
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

976
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,675
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

977
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,059
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

978
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,972
So I say we take
the fight to him.

979
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,139
Doctor.

980
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,521
Do you concur?

981
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:31,572
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

982
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:34,697
But you have to understand...

983
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,532
if it comes to saving you

984
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,081
or the kid or the Time Stone...

985
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,083
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

986
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,585
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

987
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,041
Nice. Good, moral compass.

988
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,835
We're straight.

989
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:55,463
All right, kid.

990
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,802
You're an Avenger now.

991
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,675
I thought you might be hungry.

992
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,356
I always hated that chair.

993
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,608
So I've been told.

994
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:57,197
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

995
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,443
I hated this room.

996
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,659
This ship.

997
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,619
I hated my life.

998
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,288
You told me that too.

999
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,835
Every day-

1000
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,597
For almost 20 years.

1001
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,556
I was a child when you took me.

1002
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,726
I saved you.

1003
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,268
No.

1004
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,273
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1005
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,608
Going to bed hungry...

1006
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,822
scrounging for scraps.

1007
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,905
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1008
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:45,036
I'm the one who stopped that.

1009
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,375
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1010
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,161
The children born...

1011
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,164
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1012
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,583
It's a paradise.

1013
01:06:57,262 --> 01:06:59,128
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1014
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:02,132
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1015
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,342
You're insane.

1016
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,476
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1017
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:08,393
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1018
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,942
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1019
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:14,485
It needs correction.

1020
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,978
You don't know that!

1021
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,565
I'm the only one who knows that.

1022
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,574
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1023
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,744
For a time...

1024
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:34,039
you had that same will...

1025
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,047
as you fought by my side.

1026
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:39,965
Daughter.

1027
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:42,550
I'm not your daughter.

1028
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,677
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1029
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,934
And, in doing so,

1030
01:07:50,023 --> 01:07:52,231
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1031
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:57,983
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1032
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,869
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1033
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,159
I am disappointed.

1034
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,416
But not because
you didn't find it.

1035
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,748
But because you did.

1036
01:08:17,217 --> 01:08:18,958
And you lied.

1037
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:37,185
Nebula.

1038
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,784
Don't do this.

1039
01:08:45,954 --> 01:08:47,161
Some time ago,

1040
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:49,956
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1041
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,115
Please don't do this.

1042
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,497
And very nearly succeeded.

1043
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,627
So I brought her here.

1044
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,414
To talk.

1045
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,470
Stop. Stop it.

1046
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,690
I swear to you on my life.

1047
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,481
I never found the Soul Stone.

1048
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,199
Accessing memory files.

1049
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,701
You know what he's about to do.

1050
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,453
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

1051
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,738
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.

1052
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,864
He will!

1053
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,916
He can't, Nebula.

1054
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,418
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...

1055
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:39,377
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.

1056
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,216
You're strong.

1057
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:49,256
Me.

1058
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,435
You're generous.

1059
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:55,764
Me.

1060
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,189
But I never taught you to lie.

1061
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,979
That's why you're so bad at it.

1062
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:09,740
Where is the Soul Stone?

1063
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,721
Vormir!

1064
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,865
The stone is on Vormir.

1065
01:10:51,204 --> 01:10:53,367
Show me.

1066
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,791
I am Groot.

1067
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,076
Tinkle in the cup.

1068
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,502
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1069
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:01,833
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1070
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,088
I am Groot.

1071
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,293
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1072
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,875
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1073
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,385
You speak Groot?

1074
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,341
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1075
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,550
I am Groot.

1076
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,716
You'll know when we're close.

1077
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,475
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1078
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,769
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1079
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,600
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1080
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,060
It's truly awesome.

1081
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:33,237
Okay, time to be the captain.

1082
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,787
So, dead brother, huh?

1083
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,295
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1084
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,664
Well, he's been dead before.

1085
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,671
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1086
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:51,470
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1087
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,926
Both dead.

1088
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,220
But still got a mom, though?

1089
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,967
Killed by a dark elf.

1090
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:58,136
A best friend?

1091
01:11:58,271 --> 01:11:59,603
Stabbed through the heart.

1092
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:06,148
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1093
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,863
Absolutely.

1094
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:13,527
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1095
01:12:13,703 --> 01:12:15,286
they're all
tremendous motivators.

1096
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,363
They really clear the mind.

1097
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,157
So I'm good to go.

1098
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,997
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1099
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,748
he's the toughest there is.

1100
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,960
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

1101
01:12:26,132 --> 01:12:27,668
He's never fought me twice.

1102
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:30,042
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1103
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,462
It better be some hammer.

1104
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,969
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1105
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:41,684
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1106
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,814
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1107
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,890
but none succeeded.

1108
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:48,483
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1109
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:51,444
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1110
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,483
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1111
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,447
Fate wills it so.

1112
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,868
Mmm-hmm.

1113
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,787
And what if you're wrong?

1114
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,872
If I'm wrong, then...

1115
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:06,707
what more could I lose?

1116
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,886
I could lose a lot.

1117
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,096
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1118
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,894
Okay.

1119
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,073
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1120
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,949
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1121
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,110
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1122
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,868
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1123
01:13:41,207 --> 01:13:42,288
He gave you his eye?

1124
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,574
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1125
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,711
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1126
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,872
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1127
01:13:49,966 --> 01:13:51,002
Hmm..

1128
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:55,002
Huh?

1129
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:57,841
Oh.

1130
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,845
I would've washed that.

1131
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,395
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1132
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:05,854
Hey, we're here!

1133
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:10,976
I don't think this thing works.

1134
01:14:11,154 --> 01:14:12,315
Everything seems dark.

1135
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,490
It ain't the eye.

1136
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,204
Something's wrong.

1137
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,545
The star's gone out.

1138
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:35,965
And the rings are frozen.

1139
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,573
I hope these dwarves are better

1140
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,402
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1141
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,250
Maybe they realized
that they live

1142
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,747
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1143
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,878
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1144
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,792
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1145
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,131
Yes, why?

1146
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,341
It look anything like that?

1147
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,510
I am Groot.

1148
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,177
Go back to the pod.

1149
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,228
Eitri, wait!

1150
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,226
Stop!

1151
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,145
Stop.

1152
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:37,855
Thor?

1153
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,568
What happened here?

1154
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,283
You were supposed to protect us.

1155
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,824
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1156
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,210
Asgard is destroyed.

1157
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:57,300
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1158
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,057
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1159
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:17,358
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1160
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,323
I made what he wanted.

1161
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:27,372
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1162
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,503
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1163
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:38,377
All except me.

1164
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,336
"Your life is yours," he said.

1165
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,599
"But your hands are mine alone."

1166
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,551
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1167
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,270
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1168
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,769
every axe, hammer, sword...

1169
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,149
it's all inside your head.

1170
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,939
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1171
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,650
Trust me, I know.

1172
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:05,827
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1173
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,614
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1174
01:17:48,788 --> 01:17:50,996
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1175
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:58,662
Hey, what's going on?

1176
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,046
I think we're here.

1177
01:18:00,216 --> 01:18:02,675
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1178
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,966
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1179
01:18:06,055 --> 01:18:07,091
Close those around it.

1180
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:09,801
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1181
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,262
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

1182
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,014
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

1183
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,649
We might wanna turn.

1184
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,059
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1185
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,506
You all right?

1186
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,268
That was close.

1187
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,887
I owe you one.

1188
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,480
Let me just say, if aliens

1189
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,309
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1190
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,601
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1191
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:05,112
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1192
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:06,780
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1193
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,323
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1194
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,832
Thanos!

1195
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1196
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:43,609
Stay down, clown.

1197
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,908
Die, blanket of death!

1198
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,747
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1199
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,953
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1200
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:04,956
Where is Gamora?

1201
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,626
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1202
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:10,716
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1203
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,800
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1204
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,131
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1205
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,143
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1206
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,313
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1207
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:22,472
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1208
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,688
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1209
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:25,896
I'll kill all three Of you

1210
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,819
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1211
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:28,979
Starting with you.

1212
01:20:29,073 --> 01:20:30,154
Wait, what, Thanos?

1213
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,323
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1214
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,488
What master do you serve?

1215
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:35,903
What master do I serve?

1216
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,453
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1217
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,364
You're from Earth.

1218
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,541
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1219
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,957
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1220
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:43,163
What are you hassling us for?

1221
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,087
So you're not with Thanos?

1222
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:47,381
With Thanos?

1223
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:50,551
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1224
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,552
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1225
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,096
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

1226
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,470
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1227
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,805
You know Thor?

1228
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,060
Yeah.

1229
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,604
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1230
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:04,435
Where is he now?

1231
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,365
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1232
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:22,748
It's a mold.

1233
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,493
A king's weapon.

1234
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:27,796
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1235
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,292
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1236
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,926
Did it have a name?

1237
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,341
Storm breaker.

1238
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:36,922
That's a bit much.

1239
01:21:38,976 --> 01:21:40,057
So how do we make it?

1240
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:44,104
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1241
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,274
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1242
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:52,521
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1243
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,159
The hell happened
to this planet'?

1244
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:00,115
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1245
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,413
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1246
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,539
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1247
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:10,122
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1248
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,539
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1249
01:22:11,717 --> 01:22:13,048
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1250
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:14,342
pin him down, get what we need.

1251
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:16,173
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1252
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,300
We just want the gauntlet.

1253
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:20,257
Are you yawning?

1254
01:22:20,351 --> 01:22:22,514
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1255
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:23,636
Did you hear what I said?

1256
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,721
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1257
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:27,980
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1258
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,984
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1259
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:32,645
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1260
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,404
Kick names, take ass.

1261
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:35,814
Yeah, that's right.

1262
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:43,872
All right, just get over here,
please.

1263
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,203
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up'?

1264
01:22:46,377 --> 01:22:48,539
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1265
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:52,543
We gotta coalesce.

1266
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:54,333
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1267
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,797
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1268
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:58,132
We don't know what it means.

1269
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:01,140
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1270
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,768
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1271
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:05,847
and that way
it might be really good.

1272
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,979
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1273
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,265
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1274
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:11,479
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1275
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,018
Exactly like Footloose.

1276
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,061
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1277
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:16,354
It never was.

1278
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,568
Don't encourage this, all right?

1279
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:18,944
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1280
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,618
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1281
01:23:20,703 --> 01:23:21,819
By the way, that's a compliment.

1282
01:23:22,413 --> 01:23:23,904
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1283
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,618
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1284
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,824
that's 100% you.

1285
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:29,243
Your math is blowing my mind.

1286
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:30,623
Excuse me.

1287
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:35,045
But does your friend
often do that?

1288
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,756
Strange, we all right?

1289
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:50,100
You're back. You're all right.

1290
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,978
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1291
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:56,149
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1292
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,568
To see all the possible outcomes

1293
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:00,490
of the coming conflict.

1294
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:02,576
How many did you see?

1295
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,987
14,000,605.

1296
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,078
How many did we win?

1297
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:14,000
One.

1298
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,895
The stone
had better be up there.

1299
01:24:40,783 --> 01:24:42,820
For your sister's sake.

1300
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:08,469
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1301
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,806
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1302
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,145
You know us?

1303
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:19,859
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1304
01:25:20,364 --> 01:25:22,025
Where is the Soul Stone?

1305
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,404
You should know...

1306
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,195
it extracts a terrible price.

1307
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,122
I am prepared.

1308
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:35,998
We all think that at first.

1309
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:42,838
We are all wrong.

1310
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,773
How is it you know
this place so well?

1311
01:25:56,943 --> 01:26:01,278
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1312
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,448
I even held one in my hand.

1313
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:08,657
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1314
01:26:08,829 --> 01:26:12,868
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1315
01:26:21,592 --> 01:26:24,506
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1316
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,587
As does what you fear.

1317
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,805
What's this?

1318
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,845
The price.

1319
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,639
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1320
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:41,735
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1321
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:44,947
Tell me what it needs.

1322
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,654
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1323
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:51,365
understands its power...

1324
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:56,074
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1325
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:57,788
Of what?

1326
01:26:58,212 --> 01:27:00,170
In order to take the stone,

1327
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:02,668
you must lose
that which you love.

1328
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,881
A soul...

1329
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,796
for a soul.

1330
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:26,863
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1331
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,190
a moment...

1332
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,618
when you got what you deserved.

1333
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:37,119
And I was always
so disappointed.

1334
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,170
But now...

1335
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,219
You kill and torture...

1336
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,173
and you call it mercy.

1337
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:59,354
The universe has judged you.

1338
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:05,402
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1339
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,438
You failed.

1340
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,692
And do you wanna know why?

1341
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,493
Because you love nothing.

1342
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,823
No one.

1343
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,625
No.

1344
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,251
Really?

1345
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,386
Tears?

1346
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:34,139
They're not for him.

1347
01:28:48,405 --> 01:28:49,612
No.

1348
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,528
This isn't love.

1349
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,073
I ignored my destiny once.

1350
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,703
I cannot do that again.

1351
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:04,578
Even for you.

1352
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:31,146
I'm sorry, little one.

1353
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,234
No!

1354
01:31:13,842 --> 01:31:16,676
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1355
01:31:16,845 --> 01:31:18,086
I hope you're right about this.

1356
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:21,131
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1357
01:31:36,865 --> 01:31:38,230
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

1358
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,360
to the rest of the world...

1359
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,783
this is not what I imagined.

1360
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:43,912
And what did you imagine?

1361
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:45,197
The Olympics.

1362
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,115
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1363
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,713
Should we bow?

1364
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:04,131
Yeah, he's a king.

1365
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:06,467
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1366
01:32:07,646 --> 01:32:09,762
What are you doing?

1367
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,849
Uh, we don't do that here.

1368
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,268
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1369
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:17,438
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1370
01:32:17,614 --> 01:32:18,604
How we looking?

1371
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,657
You will have my Kingsguard,

1372
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:23,702
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

1373
01:32:24,663 --> 01:32:27,577
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1374
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:31,622
How you been, Buck?

1375
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,913
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.

1376
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:48,012
Whoa.

1377
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:50,185
The structure is polymorphic.

1378
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,515
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1379
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,774
Why didn't you just reprogram

1380
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,978
the synapses
to work collectively?

1381
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:02,317
Because we didn't think of it.

1382
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,029
I'm sure you did your best.

1383
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,409
Can you do it?

1384
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:09,618
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1385
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,956
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1386
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:14,418
It will take time, brother.

1387
01:33:16,131 --> 01:33:17,167
How long?

1388
01:33:17,257 --> 01:33:18,463
As long as you can give me.

1389
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,345
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1390
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,487
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

1391
01:33:54,002 --> 01:33:55,835
God, I love this place.

1392
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:57,621
WAR MACHINE Yeah,
don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1393
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,626
We got more incoming
outside the dome.

1394
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:19,943
It's too late.

1395
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:22,229
We need to destroy
the stone now.

1396
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:24,439
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1397
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:25,948
We will hold them off.

1398
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:29,532
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1399
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:30,695
you blow it to hell.

1400
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:32,204
I will.

1401
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,162
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

1402
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,376
And get this man a shield.

1403
01:34:47,806 --> 01:34:48,887
I don't think

1404
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,090
you get the scientifics here.

1405
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,725
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...

1406
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:54,261
you're gonna need something
a lot bigger

1407
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:55,390
to yank 'em loose.

1408
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:57,601
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1409
01:34:57,774 --> 01:35:00,893
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1410
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:10,319
Fire the engines!

1411
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,551
More power, rabbit!

1412
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,792
Well done, boy.

1413
01:36:05,592 --> 01:36:07,503
That's Nidavellir.

1414
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:28,563
Damn it.

1415
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:30,528
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1416
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,113
The mechanism is crippled.

1417
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,613
- What?
- With the iris closed,

1418
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:34,739
I can't heat the metal.

1419
01:36:34,913 --> 01:36:36,199
How long will it take
to heat it?

1420
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,033
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1421
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,079
I'm gonna hold it open.

1422
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,369
That's suicide.

1423
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:45,960
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1424
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:56,802
How we looking, Bruce?

1425
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:58,639
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

1426
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:04,023
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1427
01:37:04,109 --> 01:37:06,020
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

1428
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:12,073
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1429
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:14,568
I've got two heat signatures

1430
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:15,652
breaking through the tree line.

1431
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,314
Thank you for standing with us.

1432
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:47,768
Of course, brother.

1433
01:38:08,298 --> 01:38:09,914
Where's your other friend?

1434
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,042
You will pay for his life
with yours.

1435
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,216
Thanos will have that stone.

1436
01:38:17,015 --> 01:38:18,471
That's not gonna happen.

1437
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,930
You are in Wakanda now.

1438
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:24,563
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1439
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,685
We have blood to spare.

1440
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,659
They surrender?

1441
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:44,448
Not exactly.

1442
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:12,898
What the hell?

1443
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,483
Looks like we pissed her off.

1444
01:39:28,253 --> 01:39:29,789
They're killing themselves.

1445
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:07,623
You see the teeth
on those things?

1446
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,699
All right, back up, Sam.

1447
01:40:08,793 --> 01:40:10,079
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

1448
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:23,719
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter

1449
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:24,844
and get in behind us...

1450
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,805
there's nothing
between them and Vision.

1451
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,929
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

1452
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,479
How do we do that?

1453
01:40:32,859 --> 01:40:34,475
We open the barrier.

1454
01:40:36,738 --> 01:40:40,858
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

1455
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:43,068
Requesting
confirmation, My King.

1456
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:44,823
You said open the barrier?

1457
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:46,203
On my signal.

1458
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,323
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1459
01:40:49,668 --> 01:40:53,082
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1460
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,516
Wakanda forever!

1461
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:20,939
NOW!

1462
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,682
How much longer, Shuri?

1463
01:41:52,856 --> 01:41:54,393
I've barely begun, brother.

1464
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:56,399
You might want to pick up
the pace.

1465
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,317
Allfathers, give me strength.

1466
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:07,279
You understand, boy?

1467
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:10,447
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1468
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,828
It'll kill you.

1469
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,708
Only if I die.

1470
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:16,994
Yes.

1471
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:20,247
That's what killing you means.

1472
01:42:48,244 --> 01:42:50,155
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1473
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:42,587
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1474
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,498
Thor, you okay?

1475
01:43:50,181 --> 01:43:51,467
I think he's dying.

1476
01:43:51,641 --> 01:43:53,599
He needs the axe!

1477
01:43:55,061 --> 01:43:56,393
Where's the handle?

1478
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,774
Tree, help me find the handle!

1479
01:45:10,637 --> 01:45:12,845
There's too many of 'em!

1480
01:45:39,332 --> 01:45:42,667
You guys are so screwed now!

1481
01:45:46,047 --> 01:45:48,038
Bring me Thanos!

1482
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,280
Oh, yeah.

1483
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,412
You're much more of a Thanos.

1484
01:46:29,757 --> 01:46:31,920
I take it the Maw is dead.

1485
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:36,679
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1486
01:46:38,391 --> 01:46:40,554
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1487
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,510
You may regret that.

1488
01:46:43,354 --> 01:46:44,720
He brought you face-to-face

1489
01:46:44,814 --> 01:46:46,225
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1490
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,860
And where do you think
he brought you?

1491
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,655
Let me guess. Your home?

1492
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:01,324
It was.

1493
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,494
And it was beautiful.

1494
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,587
Titan was like most planets.

1495
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:13,625
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1496
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:17,045
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1497
01:47:18,056 --> 01:47:19,262
Genocide.

1498
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:24,060
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1499
01:47:25,396 --> 01:47:27,559
They called me a madman.

1500
01:47:28,274 --> 01:47:30,515
And what I predicted
came to pass.

1501
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:35,229
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

1502
01:47:35,823 --> 01:47:37,029
I'm a survivor.

1503
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,408
Who wants to murder trillions.

1504
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:43,287
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1505
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:48,542
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1506
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:52,121
And then what?

1507
01:47:53,466 --> 01:47:54,957
I'd finally rest...

1508
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,878
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1509
01:48:00,056 --> 01:48:03,595
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1510
01:48:04,435 --> 01:48:09,145
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

1511
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,556
Our?

1512
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,069
Piece of cake, Quill.

1513
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,484
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

1514
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:00,863
Boom!

1515
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:03,826
Don't let him close his fist.

1516
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,032
Magic.

1517
01:49:09,667 --> 01:49:10,658
More magic.

1518
01:49:11,502 --> 01:49:12,493
Magic with a kick.

1519
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:14,119
Magic with a...

1520
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:16,752
Insect!

1521
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:55,286
Well, well.

1522
01:49:55,463 --> 01:49:56,498
You should've killed me.

1523
01:49:56,672 --> 01:49:58,380
It would've been
a waste of parts!

1524
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:05,128
Where's Gamora?

1525
01:50:46,472 --> 01:50:47,507
Is he under?
Don't let up.

1526
01:50:47,682 --> 01:50:50,300
Be quick. He is very strong.

1527
01:50:50,476 --> 01:50:52,514
Parker, help! Get over here.

1528
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:55,020
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.

1529
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:01,476
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.

1530
01:51:01,654 --> 01:51:02,770
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.

1531
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:04,070
For the record,
this was my plan.

1532
01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:07,115
You're not so strong now, huh?

1533
01:51:07,618 --> 01:51:09,359
Where is Gamora?

1534
01:51:09,453 --> 01:51:11,411
My Gamora.

1535
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,618
No, bullshit!

1536
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,203
Where is she?

1537
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:17,581
He is in anguish.

1538
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,287
Good.

1539
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:22,713
He... He mourns.

1540
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,877
What does
this monster have to mourn?

1541
01:51:27,597 --> 01:51:28,679
Gamora.

1542
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,551
What?

1543
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:35,469
He took her to Vormir.

1544
01:51:36,105 --> 01:51:38,063
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

1545
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,349
But she didn't.

1546
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,442
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1547
01:51:46,324 --> 01:51:49,783
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1548
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,028
Tell me she's lying.

1549
01:51:54,498 --> 01:51:57,287
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

1550
01:51:58,753 --> 01:52:02,167
I had to.

1551
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,336
No, you didn't.

1552
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:06,212
No, you didn't.

1553
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:11,387
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1554
01:52:11,557 --> 01:52:13,344
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

1555
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,051
Hey, stop! Stop!

1556
01:52:15,186 --> 01:52:17,019
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!

1557
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:21,640
Oh, God.

1558
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:23,210
Come and get some, space dogs!

1559
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:29,132
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1560
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:31,213
Come on! Get some!

1561
01:53:31,470 --> 01:53:33,507
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1562
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:36,006
Okay. How much for the arm?

1563
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:39,885
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1564
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:49,770
New haircut?

1565
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:51,443
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1566
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:55,818
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.

1567
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:58,658
I am Groot.

1568
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,122
I am Steve Rogers.

1569
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:23,350
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1570
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:34,489
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

1571
01:54:35,077 --> 01:54:36,192
I'm doing it.

1572
01:55:00,101 --> 01:55:01,717
Why was she up there
all this time?

1573
01:55:02,686 --> 01:55:05,554
She's on the field. Take it.

1574
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:39,296
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.

1575
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,425
Somebody get to Vision!

1576
01:55:44,186 --> 01:55:45,972
- I got him!
- On my way.

1577
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,194
He'll die alone. As will you.

1578
01:55:54,363 --> 01:55:55,649
She's not alone.

1579
01:56:21,891 --> 01:56:23,599
Oh, no, you don't.

1580
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,224
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1581
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,681
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

1582
01:56:27,855 --> 01:56:28,845
What? No! No!

1583
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:35,319
Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!

1584
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:38,905
Hulk? Hulk,

1585
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,903
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1586
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,694
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1587
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:49,703
Hulk! Hulk!

1588
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:51,577
Hulk!

1589
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:54,917
No!

1590
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,832
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!

1591
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,216
I'll do it myself!

1592
01:57:00,137 --> 01:57:01,970
Come on! Yeah!

1593
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:15,900
See ya!

1594
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,948
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1595
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:42,877
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

1596
01:57:43,847 --> 01:57:46,385
But you're dying, like any man.

1597
01:57:54,984 --> 01:57:56,225
Get outta here!

1598
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:00,690
Go!

1599
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:21,087
That was really gross.

1600
01:58:48,246 --> 01:58:49,327
I thought I told you to go.

1601
01:58:50,873 --> 01:58:52,581
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1602
01:59:04,136 --> 01:59:06,173
I got you. I got you.

1603
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:08,421
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1604
01:59:53,686 --> 01:59:55,176
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1605
01:59:57,273 --> 02:00:00,185
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1606
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:04,603
A fake.

1607
02:00:12,579 --> 02:00:16,038
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1608
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:17,369
Stark.

1609
02:00:17,543 --> 02:00:18,625
You know me?

1610
02:00:19,253 --> 02:00:20,368
I do.

1611
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:24,039
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1612
02:00:24,967 --> 02:00:26,298
My only curse is you.

1613
02:00:28,887 --> 02:00:29,877
Come on!

1614
02:00:57,833 --> 02:00:59,791
All that for a drop of blood.

1615
02:01:43,837 --> 02:01:45,623
You have my respect, Stark.

1616
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:50,509
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1617
02:01:56,016 --> 02:01:58,099
I hope they remember you.

1618
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,019
Stop.

1619
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:16,318
Spare his life...

1620
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:19,863
and I will give you the stone.

1621
02:02:23,418 --> 02:02:24,704
No tricks.

1622
02:02:29,509 --> 02:02:30,498
Don't.

1623
02:03:21,935 --> 02:03:23,643
One to go.

1624
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:34,942
Where is he?

1625
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:45,282
Did we just lose?

1626
02:03:49,212 --> 02:03:51,123
Why would you do that?

1627
02:03:54,469 --> 02:03:56,710
We're in the endgame now.

1628
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,119
Are you okay?

1629
02:04:26,083 --> 02:04:27,791
What? What is it?

1630
02:04:29,962 --> 02:04:31,078
He's here.

1631
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:45,137
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

1632
02:04:47,896 --> 02:04:49,854
What the hell?

1633
02:05:15,382 --> 02:05:16,372
Cap.

1634
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:18,591
That's him.

1635
02:05:20,637 --> 02:05:23,220
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1636
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:48,787
Wanda.

1637
02:05:49,833 --> 02:05:51,119
It's time.

1638
02:05:51,293 --> 02:05:52,283
No.

1639
02:05:52,462 --> 02:05:54,668
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1640
02:05:54,838 --> 02:05:56,250
Look at me.

1641
02:05:56,423 --> 02:05:57,585
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1642
02:05:57,675 --> 02:05:58,664
Don't.

1643
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,875
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1644
02:06:01,887 --> 02:06:04,470
We are out of time.

1645
02:06:05,265 --> 02:06:06,381
I can't.

1646
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:07,970
Yes, you can.

1647
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:09,884
You can.

1648
02:06:11,396 --> 02:06:13,684
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1649
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:17,559
It's not fair.

1650
02:06:18,779 --> 02:06:20,362
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1651
02:06:22,324 --> 02:06:23,780
It's all right.

1652
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:26,909
You could never hurt me.

1653
02:06:35,962 --> 02:06:37,748
I just feel you.

1654
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:01,997
It's all right.

1655
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,265
It's all right.

1656
02:08:17,606 --> 02:08:18,688
I love you.

1657
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:50,127
I understand, my child.

1658
02:08:51,681 --> 02:08:53,297
Better than anyone.

1659
02:08:54,976 --> 02:08:56,887
You could never.

1660
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:04,725
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1661
02:09:06,529 --> 02:09:09,146
But now is no time to mourn.

1662
02:09:11,409 --> 02:09:15,404
Now is no time at all.

1663
02:09:38,729 --> 02:09:39,719
No!

1664
02:10:37,704 --> 02:10:39,161
I told you...

1665
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:42,372
you'd die for that.

1666
02:10:56,724 --> 02:10:58,465
You should have...

1667
02:11:01,103 --> 02:11:02,559
You should...

1668
02:11:05,065 --> 02:11:08,309
You should have
gone for the head.

1669
02:11:10,237 --> 02:11:11,226
No!

1670
02:11:44,646 --> 02:11:45,853
Daughter?

1671
02:11:53,488 --> 02:11:54,854
Did you do it?

1672
02:11:56,783 --> 02:11:57,774
Yes.

1673
02:12:06,210 --> 02:12:07,792
What did it cost?

1674
02:12:11,506 --> 02:12:12,997
Everything.

1675
02:12:23,269 --> 02:12:24,805
What did you do?

1676
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:27,552
What'd you do?

1677
02:12:41,203 --> 02:12:42,568
Where'd he go?

1678
02:12:45,498 --> 02:12:46,579
Thor.

1679
02:12:49,878 --> 02:12:51,494
Where'd he go?

1680
02:12:51,671 --> 02:12:52,912
Steve?

1681
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:30,037
Up, General. Up!

1682
02:13:30,627 --> 02:13:32,038
This is no place to die.

1683
02:13:47,101 --> 02:13:48,684
I am Groot.

1684
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:50,306
Oh...

1685
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:53,271
No, no, no!

1686
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:56,942
Groot! No.

1687
02:14:10,376 --> 02:14:11,537
Sam!

1688
02:14:15,588 --> 02:14:17,329
Sam, where you at?

1689
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:28,765
Somethings happening.

1690
02:14:40,905 --> 02:14:42,067
Quill?

1691
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:50,490
Steady, Quill.

1692
02:14:50,748 --> 02:14:51,909
Oh, man.

1693
02:14:56,087 --> 02:14:57,078
Tony.

1694
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:03,091
There was no other way.

1695
02:15:08,766 --> 02:15:09,756
Mr. Stark?

1696
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:15,561
I don't feel so good.

1697
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:18,640
You're all right.

1698
02:15:18,735 --> 02:15:19,817
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

1699
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:21,439
I don't know...

1700
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:24,279
I don't want to go.

1701
02:15:24,365 --> 02:15:26,073
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

1702
02:15:26,243 --> 02:15:28,951
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1703
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,989
I'm sorry.

1704
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:51,305
He did it.

1705
02:16:16,085 --> 02:16:19,293
What is this'?
What the hell is happening?

1706
02:16:36,188 --> 02:16:37,929
Oh, God.

1707
02:27:34,219 --> 02:27:35,550
Still no word from Stark?

1708
02:27:35,721 --> 02:27:36,961
No, not yet.

1709
02:27:37,139 --> 02:27:38,425
We're watching every satellite

1710
02:27:38,515 --> 02:27:40,381
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.

1711
02:27:40,477 --> 02:27:42,433
What is it?

1712
02:27:42,603 --> 02:27:44,935
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1713
02:27:45,105 --> 02:27:47,016
Same energy signature
as New York?

1714
02:27:47,191 --> 02:27:48,522
Ten times bigger.

1715
02:27:50,028 --> 02:27:51,143
Tell Klein we'll meet him at...

1716
02:27:51,236 --> 02:27:52,272
Nick! Nick!

1717
02:28:05,918 --> 02:28:07,204
They okay?

1718
02:28:08,212 --> 02:28:09,953
There's no one here.

1719
02:28:19,515 --> 02:28:21,005
Call Control.

1720
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:23,054
Code red.

1721
02:28:23,727 --> 02:28:24,718
Nick.

1722
02:28:26,397 --> 02:28:27,388
Hill.

1723
02:28:42,329 --> 02:28:43,490
Oh, no.

1724
02:28:45,125 --> 02:28:46,114
Mother...
