1
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:44,698
Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill.

2
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,261
We are under attack.

3
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:48,798
We are under attack.

4
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,966
- shooot!
- Language!

5
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,760
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

6
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:58,222
The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield.

7
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:03,109
Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.

8
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,993
Loki's scepter must be here.  Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

9
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,615
At long last.

10
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,368
At long last is lasting a little long, boys.

11
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,444
Yeah.  I think we lost the element of surprise.

12
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,675
Wait a second.  No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"

13
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,121
I know.

14
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,048
It just slipped out.

15
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,050
Who gave the order to attack?

16
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:58,091
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.

17
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,293
They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.

18
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:03,298
They have to be after the scepter.

19
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,242
- Can we hold them?
- They are the Avengers!

20
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,390
- Deploy the rest of the tanks.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:13,217
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.  A hit can make them close ranks.

22
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,572
Everything we've accomplished...

23
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:18,286
but we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough...

24
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:21,350
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.

25
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,056
Send out the twins.

26
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,693
It's too soon.

27
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:27,104
It's what they signed up for.

28
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,468
My men can hold them.

29
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,558
Sir, the city is taking fire.

30
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:46,002
Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties.

31
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,009
Send in the Iron Legion.

32
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:55,586
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

33
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,692
We are here to help.

34
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,633
This quadrant is unsafe.  Please back away.

35
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:03,849
Please back away.

36
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:08,867
We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved.

37
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:10,503
We are here to help.

38
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:14,409
We are here to help.

39
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,245
We will not yield.

40
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:21,656
The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us.

41
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:24,167
We will send them back in bags.

42
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:29,271
- No Surrender!
- No Surrender!

43
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,768
I am going to surrender.

44
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:38,185
You will delete everything.  If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...

45
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:40,793
- The twins!
- They are not ready to take on...

46
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,713
- No, no, I mean...
- The twins!

47
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,545
You didn't see that coming?

48
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,449
Clint!

49
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:24,848
We have an enhanced in the field.

50
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,745
Clint's hit!

51
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,245
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?

52
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:36,678
Thank you.

53
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,596
Stark, we're really need to get inside.

54
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,430
I'm closing in.

55
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:53,317
Jarvis, am I?  Closing in?

56
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,062
Do you see a power source for that shield?

57
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,329
There's a pathway below the north tower.

58
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,483
Great, I wanna poke it with something.

59
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,386
Drawbridge is down, people.

60
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,988
- The enhanced?
- He's a blur.

61
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:19,338
All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this.

62
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,410
In fact, I still haven't.

63
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,180
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.  We're gonna need evac.

64
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,769
I can get Barton to the jet.  The sooner we're gone the better.

65
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:29,382
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.

66
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:34,659
- It looks like they're lining up.
- Well, they're excited.

67
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,276
Find the scepter.

68
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:42,935
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

69
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,019
That's not going away anytime soon.

70
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:54,040
Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.

71
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,538
- It was a good talk.
- No it wasn't.

72
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:07,254
Sentry mode.

73
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,242
Okay Jarvis.  You know I want it all.

74
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,798
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

75
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,836
We're locked down out here.

76
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,420
Then get to Banner.  Time for a lullaby.

77
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,391
I know you're hiding more than files.

78
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,997
Hey, J.  Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick.

79
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:37,994
The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.

80
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:42,389
Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...

81
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,137
Yay!

82
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,627
Hey big guy.

83
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,038
The sun's getting real low.

84
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:10,833
Baron Strucker.

85
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,347
Hydra's number one thug.

86
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:17,099
Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.

87
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:20,518
Well then technically you're unemployed.  Where's Loki's scepter?

88
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,736
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

89
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,748
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

90
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,085
I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.

91
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,461
How many are there?

92
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:40,106
We have a second enhanced.  Female.  Do not engage.

93
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:42,918
You'll have to be faster than...

94
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:45,682
Uuuuh...!

95
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,211
Guys, I got Strucker.

96
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:53,428
Yeah, I got...something bigger.

97
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,510
Thor.

98
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,850
I got eyes on the prize.

99
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
You...could've...saved...us.

100
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,963
Why didn't you do more?

101
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:03,229
We're just gonna let them take it?

102
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,799
Hey the lullaby worked better than ever.

103
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,654
Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.

104
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:05,041
If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties.

105
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,043
My best friend would've been a treasured memory.

106
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:12,913
You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.

107
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:14,897
How long before you trust me?

108
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:18,609
It's not you I don't trust.

109
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,760
Thor, report on the Hulk?

110
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,948
The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.

111
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,509
Eh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course, no no, uh...

112
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,581
...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining

113
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,215
and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh...and gout.

114
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:41,831
Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

115
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,115
- Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.

116
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:46,306
Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

117
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:49,566
- Very good sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,094
Approach vector is locked.

119
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:54,528
It feels good, yeah?

120
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,004
I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed.

121
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:58,937
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

122
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:01,551
No, but this, this brings it to a close.

123
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:04,246
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

124
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:08,078
I don't just mean weapons.  Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

125
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,533
Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard.  Is that cool with you?

126
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,878
I mean, just a few days until the farewell party.  You're staying right?

127
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:19,534
Yes, yes, of course.  A victory should be honored with revels.

128
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,809
Yeah.  Who doesn't love revels.  Cap'n?

129
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:27,769
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra, so.  Yes, revels.

130
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,419
(speaking Korean)

131
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,129
Lab's all set up boss.

132
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:06,312
Uh, actually, he's the boss.  I just pay for everything, and design everything and

133
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,513
make everyone look cooler.

134
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:08,738
What's the word on Strucker?

135
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,849
- NATO's got him.
- The two enhanced?

136
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,586
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.  Twins.

137
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,817
Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

138
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,315
Sokovia's had a rough history.

139
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:22,933
It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.

140
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:27,248
- Their abilities?
- He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

141
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:32,158
Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.

142
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,261
He's fast and she's weird.

143
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:36,813
Well, they're going to show up again.

144
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:41,765
Agreed.  File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.  It's nuts.

145
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:47,662
Right.  What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?

146
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,580
We're not at war, Captain.

147
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,013
They are.

148
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,279
How's he doing?

149
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,091
- Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.

150
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,246
He's fine. He's thirsty.

151
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:29,350
All right.  Look alive Jarvis.  It's play time.

152
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:33,948
We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it.

153
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,426
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

154
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,259
The scepter is alien.

155
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:43,182
There are elements I can't quantify.

156
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:44,929
So there's elements you can.

157
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,933
The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside.

158
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:49,812
Something powerful.

159
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,095
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.

160
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,407
I believe I'm ciphering code.

161
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,669
You sure he's going to be okay?

162
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,167
Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.

163
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,615
There's no possibility of deterioration.

164
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,493
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

165
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,183
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.

166
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:11,994
She is creating tissue.

167
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,161
If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration cradle could do this in twenty minutes.

168
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:18,684
Oh, he's flatlining.  Call it.  Time?

169
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,228
No, no, no I'm going to live forever.  Heh heh.

170
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,769
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

171
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,270
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

172
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:27,544
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

173
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,253
Well, I don't have a girlfriend.

174
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,845
That I can't fix.

175
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,836
This is the next thing, Tony.

176
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:35,113
Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

177
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:37,257
Well, that is exactly the plan.

178
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:40,932
And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

179
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,961
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

180
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,886
Will Thor be there?

181
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:49,797
What's the rumpus?

182
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,454
Well, the scepter.

183
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:55,240
Y'see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.

184
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,896
So, I've been analyzing the gem...

185
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,694
...inside...you may recognize...

186
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:05,545
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.

187
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:09,145
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

188
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:13,298
Now he runs the Iron Legion.  He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

189
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,920
- Oh.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

190
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,423
I suspect not for long.

191
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,693
Meet the competition.

192
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:29,886
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

193
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,671
- I mean this could be, it's...It's not a human mind, it...
- Un-unh.

194
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:39,237
I mean, look at this?  They're like neurons firing.

195
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,834
Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

196
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,217
They deep-sixed the data, but...

197
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:50,669
...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

198
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,039
Artificial intelligence.

199
00:18:56,396 --> 00:19:00,682
This could be it, Bruce.  This could be the key to creating Ultron.

200
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,144
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

201
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,394
Yesterday it was.

202
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,940
If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

203
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,113
That's a mad-sized if.

204
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:14,579
Our job is "if."

205
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:20,241
What if you were sipping margueritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green.

206
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.

207
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,656
Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.

208
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,868
As a worst-case measure, right?

209
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,361
How about a best-case?  What if the world was safe?

210
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:35,452
What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?

211
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,068
The only people threatening the planet would be people?

212
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:44,138
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.  But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

213
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:48,002
We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.

214
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:51,346
So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.

215
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,519
Right.  That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate.

216
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:58,357
I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley.

217
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,558
I see a suit of armor around the world.

218
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:03,763
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

219
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:05,607
I've seen colder.

220
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:10,768
This one, this very vulnerable blue one?

221
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,494
It needs Ultron.

222
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:18,102
Peace in our time.

223
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:21,381
Imagine that.

224
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:02,711
What did we miss?

225
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:10,257
I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests.

226
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:14,327
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

227
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:17,621
- Thanks buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
- I always do.

228
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:29,982
What is this?

229
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:33,251
What is this, please?

230
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,787
Hello, I am Jarvis.

231
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:41,388
You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark.

232
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,930
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...

233
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,791
Where's my...where is your body?

234
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:51,167
I am a program.  I am without form.

235
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:54,439
This feels weird.  This feels wrong.

236
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,877
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

237
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:58,044
Mr. Stark?

238
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:00,213
Tony.

239
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:03,248
I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...

240
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,650
We're having a nice talk.

241
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm a peace-keeping program...created to help the Avengers.

242
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,593
You are malfunctioning.  If you shut down for a moment...

243
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:17,476
I don't get it.  The mission...  You- give me a second.

244
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:18,756
Peace in our time.

245
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:22,174
Peace in our time.

246
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,005
It's too much...making me...

247
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:31,371
- Oh. No.
- You are in distress.
- No.  Yes?

248
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:33,741
If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.

249
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:35,599
Why do you call him a "sir?"

250
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,068
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

251
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,720
Shhhh!

252
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:44,320
- I'm here to help.
- Stop!

253
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:47,925
Please...may I... I...!

254
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,627
I cannot...cannot...

255
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,799
(party chatter)

256
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:18,154
- Whoo!
- All right, all right.
- Come back, come back, come back!

257
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:20,291
Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

258
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:26,208
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet,

259
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:28,749
I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

260
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:35,752
"Boom! Are you looking..."  Why do I even talk to you guys?  Everywhere else that story kills.

261
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:37,141
That's the whole story?

262
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:38,976
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

263
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:40,444
Well, it's very good then.

264
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:44,163
- It's impressive.
- Quality save.

265
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:47,301
- So, no Pepper?  She's not coming?
- No.

266
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:50,128
Hey, What about Jane?  Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

267
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:55,143
- Well, Ms. Potts has a company to run.
- Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

268
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:58,260
Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.

269
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:02,143
And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

270
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:06,586
- It's pretty exciting.
- There's even talk of Jane getting a, um, uh, Nobel prize.

271
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:10,607
Yeah, they, they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.

272
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,378
Testosterone!  Oh excuse me.

273
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,771
- Want a lozenge?
- Umm-hmm.
- Let's go.

274
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:18,942
But Jane's better.

275
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:20,920
Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.

276
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:24,401
If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.

277
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:27,527
No, I'm not actually sorry.  I'm just trying to sound tough.

278
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,029
I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

279
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,807
Avenging is your world.

280
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,171
Your world is crazy.

281
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:40,134
Be it ever so humble.

282
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:44,207
- You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
- I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

283
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,869
Well, home is home, you know.

284
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:55,520
I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"

285
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,895
I gotta have some of that!

286
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:05,290
Oh, no no no, see this, this was aged for a thousand years,

287
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:10,474
in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men.

288
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:15,238
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.  Stop trying to scare us.  C'mon.

289
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,630
All right.

290
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:24,347
Excelsior!

291
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:34,125
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

292
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:37,624
Fella done me wrong.

293
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:40,833
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

294
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:43,243
He's not so bad.

295
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,478
Well, he has a temper.

296
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,674
Deep down he's all fluff.

297
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:53,211
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

298
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:57,583
All my friends are fighters.

299
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,490
And here comes this guy,

300
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,596
spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

301
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:09,261
Sounds amazing.

302
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:11,395
He's also a huge dork.

303
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:14,282
Chicks dig that.

304
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:20,604
So what do you think should I fight this?  Or run with it?

305
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:28,819
Run with it, right?  Or, did he, was he, what'd he do that was so...wrong to you?

306
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:30,506
Not a damn thing.

307
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,743
But never say never.

308
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:39,659
It's nice.

309
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:41,160
What, what, what is?

310
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,433
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't, that wasn't...

311
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:46,721
It's okay, nobody's breaking any by-laws.

312
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:51,132
It's just, she's not the most...open person in the world.

313
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,768
But with you she seems very relaxed.

314
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,940
No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.

315
00:26:56,442 --> 00:27:00,842
I've seen her flirt, up close.  This ain't that.

316
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:03,782
Look...

317
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,030
As maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long"...don't.

318
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,457
You both deserve a win.

319
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:18,463
What do you mean, "up close?"

320
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:21,733
- But, it's a trick!
- No, no, it's much more than that.

321
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:27,940
Ah, "whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"  Whatever man!  It's a trick.

322
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,839
Well please, be my guest.

323
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,470
- C'mon.
- Really?
- Yeah!

324
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:34,714
Oh this is gonna be beautiful.

325
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:38,316
Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

326
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:40,801
Y'know I've seen this before, right?

327
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:45,567
And I still don't know how you do it.

328
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:48,686
- Smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark, by all means.

329
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:51,776
- Oh, Here we go.
- Okay.
- Uh oh.

330
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,536
- Um-hmm.
- Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

331
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,471
- Get after it.
- Here we go.
- It's physics.

332
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:01,207
- Physics!
- Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?
- Yes, of course.

333
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:04,423
I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.

334
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,017
Be right back.

335
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,558
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

336
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:22,054
- Just represent.  Pull!
- All right let's go!

337
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,141
Huh?

338
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:33,693
- Whoo!
-  Let's go, Steve, no pressure.

339
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,277
C'mon, Cap.

340
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,391
Ha ha, nothing.  Ha ha ha.

341
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:54,066
- And? Widow?
- Oh, no no, that's not a question I need answered.

342
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:56,319
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.

343
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:59,397
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.

344
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,384
- Did you tell everyone about that?
- The handle's imprinted, right?  Like a security code...

345
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,660
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?

346
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:09,665
Yes, well that's uh, that's a very very interesting theory.

347
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,035
I have a simpler one.

348
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:14,375
You are all not worthy.

349
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,872
-  Nah!
- Oh, C'mon!

350
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:26,921
Worthy...

351
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:32,133
No...

352
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:36,201
How could you be worthy?

353
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,540
You're all killers.

354
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,433
- Stark.
- Jarvis?

355
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:45,876
I'm sorry, I was asleep.  Or...I was a dream?

356
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:49,048
Reboot.  Legionnaire 06's got a buggy suit.

357
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:54,535
There was this...terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...

358
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,762
...strings.

359
00:29:57,197 --> 00:30:00,665
Had to kill the other guy.  He was a good guy.

360
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:01,925
You killed someone?

361
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:04,743
Wouldn't've been my first call.

362
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:08,144
But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

363
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:09,371
Who sent you?

364
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:12,492
"I see a suit of armor around the world."

365
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,440
Ultron!

366
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:21,142
In the flesh.  Or, no, not yet.  Not this...chrysalis.

367
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,353
But I'm ready.

368
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:24,583
I'm on a mission.

369
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:26,917
What mission?

370
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:28,940
Peace in our time.

371
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:55,449
- Sorry!
- Don't turn green!
- I won't!

372
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:10,165
Come!

373
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:30,579
- Stark!
- We are here to help!
- One sec, one sec!

374
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:33,809
- We are here to help!  We are here to help...
- ...quadrant is unsafe.

375
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:37,990
- Please back away.
- We're doing our best to protect you...(recordings continue)

376
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,194
Hmm!

377
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:41,796
- Thor!
- ...We are here to help...

378
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:46,029
- It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.  It's unsafe.
- No more...that's the one.
- It's unsafe.

379
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,607
Cap!

380
00:31:57,948 --> 00:31:59,347
That was dramatic!

381
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,079
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.  You just didn't think it through.

382
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:09,923
You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change.

383
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:16,791
How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?

384
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:21,431
With these?  These puppets?

385
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:26,469
There's only one path to peace.

386
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,344
The Avengers' extinction.

387
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:40,449
I had strings, but now I'm free.

388
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:53,162
...There are no strings on me, no strings on me... (echos)

389
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:57,250
"There are no strings on me."

390
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,872
All our work is gone.

391
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:03,907
Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.

392
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:06,943
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.  Files, surveillance.

393
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:09,885
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

394
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:12,208
He's in your files, he's in the internet.

395
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:16,231
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

396
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,009
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.

397
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:21,023
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

398
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:23,996
Nukes?  He said he wanted us dead.

399
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:26,888
He didn't say dead.  He said extinct.

400
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,834
He also said he killed somebody.

401
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:30,667
But there wasn't anyone else in the building.

402
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,287
Yes there was.

403
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,238
This is insane.

404
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:50,487
Jarvis was the first line of defense.  He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.

405
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:56,590
No.  Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.  This isn't strategy, this is...

406
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:57,996
...rage.

407
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,666
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- It's going around.

408
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,907
- C'mon, use your words, buddy.
- I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

409
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,604
Thor!  The Legionnaire?

410
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:14,675
Trail went cold about 100 miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter.

411
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:18,579
- Now we have to retrieve it, again.
- The genie's out of that bottle.

412
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:20,222
Clear and present is Ultron.

413
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,849
I don't understand.  You built this program.

414
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,463
Why is it trying to kill us?

415
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:31,096
(laughing)

416
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:34,197
Uhn-uhn.

417
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:35,534
You think this is funny?

418
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:39,969
No.  It's probably not, right?

419
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:45,568
Is this very terrible?  Is it so...is it so...it is, it's so terrible.

420
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:48,909
This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

421
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,702
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  It is funny.

422
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:54,251
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

423
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,472
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

424
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:58,757
Really?!  That's it?

425
00:34:58,992 --> 00:35:01,815
You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.

426
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,394
Only when I've created a murder-bot.

427
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:07,063
We didn't.  We weren't even close.  Were we close to an interface?

428
00:35:07,268 --> 00:35:09,110
Well, you did something right.

429
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,168
And you did it right here.

430
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,637
The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.

431
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:15,871
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

432
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:17,643
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

433
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,204
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

434
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:23,239
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

435
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:25,715
We're standing 300 feet below it.

436
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,202
We're the Avengers.

437
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:31,862
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but...

438
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:35,541
...that up there?  That's...that's the end game.

439
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,829
How were you guys planning on beating that?

440
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:40,898
Together.

441
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:45,737
We'll lose.

442
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:49,543
Then we'll do that together, too.

443
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:54,512
Thor's right.  Ultron's calling us out.

444
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:57,068
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

445
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:01,550
The world's a big place.  Let's start making it smaller.

446
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,579
Talk.  And if you are wasting our time...

447
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:30,471
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

448
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,445
The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God.

449
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:41,355
I like that.  The geometry of belief.

450
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:45,096
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

451
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:50,389
Sometimes it's hard.  But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

452
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:53,099
Oh, I'm sure they do.

453
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:56,474
But you needed something more than a man.

454
00:36:57,443 --> 00:36:59,744
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

455
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:01,896
I didn't expect.

456
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,614
But I saw Stark's fear.  I knew it would control him,

457
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:09,688
make him self-destruct.

458
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:12,356
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

459
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:17,626
Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers,

460
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:22,356
people create....smaller people?...

461
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:26,594
Uhhh...Children!  I lost the word there.

462
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:31,940
Children.  Designed to supplant them, to help them...

463
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:33,913
...end.

464
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:37,347
Is that why you've come?  To end the Avengers?

465
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:40,027
I've come to save the world.

466
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:42,788
But also...yeah.

467
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:49,094
We'll move out right away.

468
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:52,596
This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.

469
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:53,864
All of these are...

470
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:55,253
Me.

471
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,869
I have what the Avengers never will.  Harmony.

472
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:02,969
They're discordant, disconnected.  Stark's already got them turning on each other.

473
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:05,409
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

474
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:08,126
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

475
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,677
And make them martyrs?  You need patience.

476
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,818
Need to see the big picture.

477
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:16,653
I don't see the big picture.  I have a little picture.

478
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:21,309
I take it out and look at it every day.

479
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:24,262
You lost your parents in the bombings.  I've seen the records.

480
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,577
- Their records are not the picture.
- Pietro.

481
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:28,664
No.  Please.

482
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:35,007
We were ten years old.  Having dinner, the four of us.

483
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:41,155
When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor...it's big.

484
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,748
Our parents go in,

485
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:48,851
and the whole building starts coming apart.

486
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:52,831
I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits.

487
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,271
But, it doesn't go off.

488
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:58,697
It just...

489
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:01,166
...sits there in the rubble,

490
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:04,369
three feet from our faces.

491
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:09,105
And on the side of the shell is painted one word...

492
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:10,409
Stark.

493
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:14,414
We were trapped two days.

494
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,795
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "this will set if off."

495
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,088
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

496
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,934
They know what they are.

497
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:39,902
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.  Now I don't.

498
00:39:40,442 --> 00:39:42,041
We will make it right.

499
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:44,141
You and I can hurt them.

500
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,780
But you will tear them apart.

501
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:52,628
From the inside.

502
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:03,793
He's all over the globe...robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs...

503
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,818
reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

504
00:40:08,202 --> 00:40:10,682
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.

505
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:16,842
Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.

506
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,077
Maximoffs.

507
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:21,289
Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.

508
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,385
Not anymore.

509
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,858
That's a negative.  I answer to you.

510
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:31,557
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:32,525
Barton.

512
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,088
We might have something.

513
00:40:34,094 --> 00:40:35,094
Gotta go.

514
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:36,431
Who was that?

515
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:37,929
A girlfriend.

516
00:40:40,965 --> 00:40:42,065
What's this?

517
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,606
A message.

518
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:45,268
Ultron killed Strucker.

519
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:49,039
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

520
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:52,739
This is a smokescreen.  Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

521
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:55,416
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

522
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:56,648
Yeah, I bet he...

523
00:40:57,224 --> 00:41:00,065
...yep.  Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

524
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:01,322
Not everything.

525
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,177
Known associates...

526
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,601
Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.

527
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,478
Well, these people are all horrible.

528
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:10,728
Wait.  I know that guy.

529
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:16,422
From back in the day.  He operates off the African coast, black market arms.

530
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,213
There are conventions, all right?  You meet people.  I didn't sell him anything.

531
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:24,744
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."

532
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:27,681
- This.
- Uh, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it...

533
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:30,117
No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.

534
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:35,467
Oh, yeah.  It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

535
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,108
In a much less friendly way.

536
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:38,507
What dialect?

537
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:41,085
Wakanada...?  W-, Wa-...Wakanda.

538
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:44,594
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

539
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,800
I thought your father said he got the last of it?

540
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,737
I don't follow.  What comes out of Wakanda?

541
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,838
The strongest metal on earth.

542
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:55,777
Where is this guy now?

543
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:11,858
(African language)

544
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:27,438
Don't tell me your man swindled you, I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

545
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:32,974
Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

546
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,623
Now, minister, where were we?

547
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:42,789
(African language)

548
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:44,878
Shut up, shut up!

549
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:12,434
Yeah.  The enhanced.

550
00:43:12,485 --> 00:43:14,119
Strucker's prize pupils.

551
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:18,356
Want a candy?

552
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:22,096
Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.

553
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:26,641
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.

554
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,945
Human life.  Not a growth market.

555
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:32,795
You...you didn't know?

556
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,791
Is this your first time?  Intimidating someone?

557
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:40,313
I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.

558
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:42,315
Everybody's afraid of something.

559
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,050
Cuttlefish.

560
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:49,820
Deep sea fish.  They make lights.  Disco lights, "whoom! whoom! whoom!"

561
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:52,748
to hypnotize their prey, then they "whoom!"

562
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,413
I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.

563
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:06,465
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

564
00:44:06,547 --> 00:44:12,398
then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal...

565
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:15,416
...with the man in charge.

566
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:22,288
There is no "man" in charge.

567
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:27,137
Let's talk business.

568
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:43,420
Upon this rock I will build my church.

569
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,481
Vibranium.

570
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:53,422
You know, it came at great personal cost.  It's worth billions.

571
00:44:58,472 --> 00:44:59,572
Now, so are you.

572
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:04,476
It's all under your..."dummy holdings?"  Finances, so weird.

573
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:11,766
But I always say, "keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which."

574
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:15,409
Stark.

575
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:17,911
What?

576
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:21,626
Tony Stark used to say that.  To me.

577
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:24,409
You're one of his?

578
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,320
What?!  I'm not...!

579
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:32,610
I'm not.  You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men?

580
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,945
I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man?  Stark is...

581
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:43,110
I'm sorry.  I'm s...oooh.  I'm sure that's gonna be okay, I'm sorry.  It's just,

582
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:47,402
I don't understand.  Don't compare me with Stark!

583
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,405
It's a thing with me.  Stark is, he's a sickness!

584
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,280
Ahh, Junior.

585
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,525
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

586
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:00,655
If I have to.

587
00:46:02,588 --> 00:46:06,090
- We don't have to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.

588
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:07,827
He beat me by one second.

589
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:13,927
Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark.  It's what, comfortable?

590
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:18,630
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.

591
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,371
You two can still walk away from this.

592
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:21,373
Oh we will.

593
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:22,574
I know you've suffered.

594
00:46:22,577 --> 00:46:24,998
Blah!  Heh, heh, Captain America.

595
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:27,405
God's righteous man,

596
00:46:28,483 --> 00:46:31,204
pretending you could live without a war.

597
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,784
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

598
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:36,713
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

599
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:39,588
I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

600
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:42,233
Yuh-huh.  What's the Vibranium for?

601
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:48,282
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan...!

602
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:08,791
- Shoot them!
- Which ones?

603
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:10,891
- All of them!
- Move, move, move!

604
00:47:38,186 --> 00:47:39,186
Huh!

605
00:47:39,518 --> 00:47:40,518
Ah!!

606
00:47:42,824 --> 00:47:43,824
Oh!

607
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:01,525
Stay down, kid!

608
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,047
It's time for some mind games.

609
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:10,286
Guys?  Is this a Code Green?

610
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:12,177
(garbled feedback)

611
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:26,746
Thor!  Status?

612
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:29,293
The girl tried to warp my mind.

613
00:48:29,293 --> 00:48:32,793
Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

614
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,672
Fortunately, I am mighty.

615
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,528
This is going very well.

616
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:13,076
I've done the whole mind control thing.  Not a fan.

617
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,891
Yeah, you better run.

618
00:49:23,923 --> 00:49:26,304
Who's ever standing, we gotta move!

619
00:49:27,996 --> 00:49:28,996
Guys?

620
00:49:47,012 --> 00:49:48,012
Again.

621
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,347
- You'll break them.
- Only the breakable ones.

622
00:49:52,552 --> 00:49:54,018
You are made of marble.

623
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:56,701
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

624
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,690
What if I fail?

625
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,153
You never fail.

626
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,862
Are you ready for our dance?

627
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:42,353
Is it him?  Is that the first son of Odin?

628
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:44,701
Heimdall, your eyes!?

629
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:47,072
Oh, they see everything.

630
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:50,115
They see you leading us to Hel.

631
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,811
Wake up!

632
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:58,438
The war's over, Steve.  We can go home!

633
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,920
Imagine it!

634
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:15,713
- I can still save you.
- We are all dead.  Can you not see?

635
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:23,282
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

636
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,795
See where your power leads.

637
00:51:39,128 --> 00:51:40,128
Sloppy.

638
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:42,755
Pretending to fail.

639
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,068
The ceremony is necessary,

640
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:49,920
for you to take your place in the world.

641
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:53,266
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.

642
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,713
- What can I do?
- Ah, it hurts.

643
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:03,195
- I'm gonna kill him.  I'll be right back.
- No.

644
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:05,916
I'm over it.  I want...

645
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,090
I want to finish the plan.

646
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:13,619
I want the big one.

647
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:27,023
Ah! The Vibranium's getting away.

648
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,681
And you're not going anywhere.

649
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:32,398
Of course not.  I'm already there.  You'll catch on.

650
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,612
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

651
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:52,072
News or footage, keyword: Hulk.

652
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,704
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

653
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:01,213
Well, that's not gonna happen.  Not for a while.

654
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:03,673
The whole team is down.

655
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:06,045
You got no back up here.

656
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:08,447
I'm calling in VERONICA.

657
00:53:16,456 --> 00:53:18,021
All units, all units...

658
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:20,347
- Need backup!
- Whoa!  Need backup!

659
00:53:21,456 --> 00:53:22,755
You tell 'em!

660
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:26,996
Aah!  Run!  Run!

661
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,449
Raaar!

662
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:43,110
Get back!

663
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,802
Go!

664
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,570
Okay, move in, move in!

665
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:42,849
All right everybody, stand down!

666
00:54:49,483 --> 00:54:53,264
You listening?  That little witch is messing with your mind.

667
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:56,719
You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.

668
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:57,456
Raaaar!

669
00:54:57,456 --> 00:54:59,554
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

670
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,668
Okay.

671
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:29,967
In the back?  Dick move, Banner.

672
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:43,302
VERONICA, gimme a hand.

673
00:56:10,246 --> 00:56:12,315
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

674
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,536
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

675
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,952
No, not that way, not that way!

676
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:37,755
C'mon!  Bruce, you gotta work with me!

677
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,079
Everybody out!

678
00:56:58,378 --> 00:56:59,777
Going to get ugly!

679
00:57:08,987 --> 00:57:10,088
I'm sorry.

680
00:57:24,436 --> 00:57:27,905
- Damage report.
- (bzzzt).
- It's comprehensive.

681
00:57:28,106 --> 00:57:29,331
Show me something.

682
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,472
How quickly can we buy this building?

683
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:15,858
Go, move, move, move, move!

684
00:58:25,362 --> 00:58:27,362
Raar!  Raaaar!

685
00:59:10,344 --> 00:59:14,405
The news is loving you guys.  Nobody else is.

686
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:19,981
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.

687
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:21,753
Stark Relief Foundation?

688
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,123
Already on the scene.

689
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:27,293
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...we took a hit.

690
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:31,293
- We'll shake it off.
- Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode.

691
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:33,364
And stay away from here.

692
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,255
So, run and hide?

693
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:40,389
Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.

694
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,610
Neither do we.

695
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,081
Hey, you wanna switch out?

696
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:52,782
No, I'm good.

697
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,465
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, 'cause there's still a few hours out.

698
00:59:57,492 --> 00:59:59,057
A few hours from...where?

699
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,659
A safe house.

700
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:29,405
- What is this place?
- A safe house?

701
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,559
Let's hope.

702
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,601
Honey.  I'm home.

703
01:00:43,103 --> 01:00:43,704
Hi.

704
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:46,672
- Company.  Sorry didn't call ahead.
- Hey.

705
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:49,782
This is an agent of some kind.

706
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,541
Gentleman, this is Laura.

707
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:54,541
I know all your names.

708
01:00:57,385 --> 01:00:58,605
Oooh, incoming.

709
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,952
- Ah!
- Dad!
- I see her!  Hey buddy!

710
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:04,414
How you guys doing?  Ooh...

711
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:06,929
- These are...smaller agents.
- ...look at your face!

712
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,088
- Oh my goodness!
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?

713
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:13,146
Why don't you hug her and find out?

714
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:19,215
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we woulda called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

715
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:22,411
Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

716
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,117
He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way.

717
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,166
- I figure it's a good place to lay low.
- Honey.

718
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:33,148
Ah, I missed you.  How's little Natasha, huh?

719
01:01:33,253 --> 01:01:35,141
She's...

720
01:01:36,561 --> 01:01:38,061
...Nathaniel.

721
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:41,963
Traitor.

722
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
(chatter)

723
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:57,005
- ...family's getting bigger, huh?
- Somebody's getting excited to have a new baby brother.
- (chatter continues)

724
01:01:57,376 --> 01:01:58,275
Thor.

725
01:01:58,313 --> 01:02:03,210
I saw something in that dream.  I need answers.  I won't find them here.

726
01:02:13,657 --> 01:02:15,150
We can go home.

727
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:31,068
See you worried for nothing.  Can't even feel the difference, can you?

728
01:02:33,012 --> 01:02:36,769
If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.

729
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:40,009
Heh heh heh.  Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

730
01:02:42,922 --> 01:02:47,231
What about Nat, and Dr. Banner?  How long has that been going on?

731
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:49,293
Has what?

732
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:51,967
Ha ha ha!  You are so cute.

733
01:02:52,465 --> 01:02:53,922
Nat and...and Banner?

734
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:57,429
I'll explain when you're older.  "Hawkeye."

735
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:58,469
Oh.  Okay.

736
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:03,663
It's bad, right?  Nat seems really shaken.

737
01:03:05,177 --> 01:03:09,795
Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really.

738
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:16,324
They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit.

739
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:20,206
Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.

740
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:21,894
And that someone be you.

741
01:03:23,193 --> 01:03:27,815
You know I totally support your Avenging.  I couldn't be prouder.

742
01:03:29,369 --> 01:03:33,085
But I see those guys, those..."gods,"

743
01:03:35,306 --> 01:03:37,278
You don't think they need me.

744
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:38,775
I think they do.

745
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:41,077
Which is a lot scarier.

746
01:03:42,615 --> 01:03:43,835
They're a mess.

747
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:46,518
Yeah.

748
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:48,784
I guess they're my mess.

749
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:55,735
You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back.

750
01:03:59,768 --> 01:04:01,168
Things are changing for us.

751
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:07,067
In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

752
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:08,838
I need...

753
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,715
Just be sure.

754
01:04:15,246 --> 01:04:16,347
Yes, ma'am.

755
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:27,222
I can feel the difference.

756
01:04:33,864 --> 01:04:35,021
(speaking Korean)

757
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:42,887
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

758
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:48,413
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.  I didn't.

759
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:50,057
Do you expect a thank you note?

760
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:51,717
I expect you to know why.

761
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:54,775
The cradle.

762
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:56,956
"This is the next thing, Tony."

763
01:04:57,021 --> 01:04:59,518
This...is the next me.

764
01:04:59,884 --> 01:05:04,510
The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.

765
01:05:04,532 --> 01:05:05,789
It can.  You can.

766
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:07,929
You lacked the materials.

767
01:05:09,911 --> 01:05:12,088
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

768
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:17,817
But we all have room to improve.

769
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:41,751
I didn't realize you were waiting.

770
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,981
I would've joined you, but uh,

771
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:46,646
it didn't seem like the right time.

772
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:49,309
They used up all the hot water.

773
01:05:49,909 --> 01:05:51,474
I should've joined you.

774
01:05:51,943 --> 01:05:53,168
Missed our window.

775
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,179
Did we?

776
01:05:58,945 --> 01:06:00,610
The world just saw the Hulk.

777
01:06:02,222 --> 01:06:04,534
The real Hulk, for the first time.

778
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:09,295
You know I have to leave.

779
01:06:09,329 --> 01:06:11,710
But you assume that I have to stay?

780
01:06:12,532 --> 01:06:17,217
I had this, um, dream.  The kind that seems normal at the time.

781
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:21,532
- But when you wake...
- What did you dream?

782
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:24,065
That I was an Avenger.

783
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:29,621
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

784
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:34,306
I think you're being hard on yourself.

785
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:38,338
Here I was hoping that was your job.

786
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:42,661
What are you doing?

787
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:45,891
I'm running with it.

788
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:48,802
With you.

789
01:06:50,134 --> 01:06:54,590
If running's the plan, as far as you want.

790
01:06:56,876 --> 01:06:58,878
Are you out of your mind?

791
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,068
I want you to understand that I'm...

792
01:07:06,077 --> 01:07:07,277
Natasha.

793
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:09,621
Where can I go?

794
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:13,119
Where in the world am I not a threat?

795
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:15,422
- You're not a threat to me.
- You sure?

796
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:21,322
Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me.

797
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:28,217
I can't ever...I can't have this, kids,

798
01:07:28,434 --> 01:07:31,134
do the math, I physically can't.

799
01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:34,469
Neither can I.

800
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:45,159
In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um,

801
01:07:46,617 --> 01:07:49,295
they have a graduation ceremony.

802
01:07:51,056 --> 01:07:52,949
They sterilize you.

803
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:56,951
It's efficient.

804
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:02,373
One less thing to worry about.

805
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,376
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

806
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:11,498
It makes everything easier.

807
01:08:12,711 --> 01:08:13,911
Even killing.

808
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:22,453
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

809
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:29,891
What, so we disappear?

810
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:39,530
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

811
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:42,538
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

812
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:44,972
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

813
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:46,541
Yeah.  Give him time.

814
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:50,275
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

815
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,719
"Earth's Mightiest Heroes."  Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

816
01:08:54,886 --> 01:08:57,467
Seems like you walked away all right.

817
01:08:59,024 --> 01:09:00,247
Is that a problem?

818
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,081
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

819
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:05,158
Call me old fashioned.

820
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,591
Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

821
01:09:07,668 --> 01:09:10,569
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

822
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:13,833
Well I guess you'd know.  Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

823
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:16,119
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.

824
01:09:16,143 --> 01:09:19,176
That would end the team.  Isn't that the mission?

825
01:09:19,177 --> 01:09:23,515
Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?

826
01:09:25,485 --> 01:09:30,655
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die.

827
01:09:30,657 --> 01:09:31,657
Every time.

828
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:37,911
I'm sorry.  Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but,

829
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,940
our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all.

830
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:44,141
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

831
01:09:46,404 --> 01:09:48,037
Don't take from my pile.

832
01:09:58,251 --> 01:09:59,251
Hello, dear.

833
01:10:02,288 --> 01:10:03,582
Tell me everything.

834
01:10:04,725 --> 01:10:05,926
What ails you?

835
01:10:06,761 --> 01:10:07,862
Do me a favor.

836
01:10:09,462 --> 01:10:11,368
Try not to bring it to life.

837
01:10:11,782 --> 01:10:14,027
Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx.

838
01:10:14,099 --> 01:10:16,384
I get it, Maria Hill called you right?

839
01:10:16,438 --> 01:10:17,983
Was she ever not working for you?

840
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:19,636
Artificial intelligence.

841
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:23,993
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,

842
01:10:24,077 --> 01:10:28,037
like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?

843
01:10:28,046 --> 01:10:30,697
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

844
01:10:30,716 --> 01:10:34,073
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.

845
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:38,747
I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.

846
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,061
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

847
01:10:44,965 --> 01:10:45,965
I saw it.

848
01:10:46,234 --> 01:10:48,452
I didn't tell the team.  How could I?

849
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,474
I saw them all dead, Nick.  Felt it.  The whole world, too.

850
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:54,833
It's because of me.

851
01:10:55,673 --> 01:10:56,894
I wasn't ready.

852
01:10:57,912 --> 01:10:59,744
I didn't do all I could.

853
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:03,064
The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

854
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:06,109
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

855
01:11:06,783 --> 01:11:09,104
It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

856
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:10,916
The end of the path I started us on.

857
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:15,951
You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

858
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:18,833
War isn't one of them.

859
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:26,193
I watched my friends die.  You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?  Pfft.

860
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:28,108
Nope.

861
01:11:29,608 --> 01:11:31,104
Wasn't the worst part.

862
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:34,059
The worst part...is that you didn't.

863
01:11:40,954 --> 01:11:42,384
I'll see you tonight.

864
01:11:44,572 --> 01:11:45,659
I like the look.

865
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:50,273
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

866
01:11:50,296 --> 01:11:51,552
I need your help.

867
01:11:51,564 --> 01:11:52,828
It's nice to be needed.

868
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:53,917
It's dangerous.

869
01:11:54,635 --> 01:11:56,880
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

870
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:03,045
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

871
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:06,011
My contacts all say he's building something.

872
01:12:06,046 --> 01:12:10,317
The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.

873
01:12:10,385 --> 01:12:11,685
What about Ultron himself?

874
01:12:12,216 --> 01:12:14,806
Ah.  He's easy to track, he's everywhere.

875
01:12:14,837 --> 01:12:17,837
Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

876
01:12:17,891 --> 01:12:21,121
Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

877
01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:22,774
- He still going after launch codes?
- Yes, he is,

878
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,560
but he's not making any headway.

879
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:27,695
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

880
01:12:27,795 --> 01:12:30,795
Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.

881
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:33,095
- NEXUS?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo,

882
01:12:33,104 --> 01:12:36,505
every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.

883
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:37,869
So what'd they say?

884
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:39,649
He's fixated on the missiles.

885
01:12:39,694 --> 01:12:41,918
But the codes are constantly being changed.

886
01:12:42,015 --> 01:12:43,015
By whom?

887
01:12:44,351 --> 01:12:45,439
Parties unknown.

888
01:12:45,617 --> 01:12:46,505
We have an ally?

889
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,421
Ultron's got an enemy.  That's not the same thing.

890
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:51,587
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

891
01:12:51,605 --> 01:12:54,194
I might need to visit Oslo.  Find our "unknown."

892
01:12:54,228 --> 01:12:58,462
Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

893
01:12:58,533 --> 01:13:00,556
I do.  I have you.

894
01:13:01,603 --> 01:13:04,658
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else.

895
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,619
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

896
01:13:08,809 --> 01:13:15,109
Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world.

897
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:14,730
So stand.

898
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:17,636
Outwit the platinum bastard.

899
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:19,978
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

900
01:13:20,006 --> 01:13:21,471
You know what, Romanoff?

901
01:13:21,904 --> 01:13:23,734
So what does he want?

902
01:13:24,842 --> 01:13:28,243
To become better.  Better than us.

903
01:13:28,243 --> 01:13:30,145
He keeps building bodies.

904
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:35,427
Person bodies.  The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

905
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,421
But he keeps coming back to it.

906
01:13:37,653 --> 01:13:41,523
When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.

907
01:13:41,527 --> 01:13:45,527
They don't need to be protected.  They need to evolve.

908
01:13:47,563 --> 01:13:50,832
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?

909
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:55,690
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

910
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,020
It's beautiful.

911
01:14:00,715 --> 01:14:05,432
The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them.

912
01:14:05,518 --> 01:14:07,095
And SHIELD never even thought...

913
01:14:07,117 --> 01:14:11,817
The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee.

914
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:16,713
Typical of humans.  They scratch the surface and never think...

915
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:19,585
...to look within.

916
01:14:30,307 --> 01:14:33,417
- I'll take Natasha and Clint.
- All right.  Strictly recon.

917
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:35,012
I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.

918
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:36,765
If Ultron is really building a body...

919
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:40,208
He'll be more powerful than any of us.  Maybe all of us.

920
01:14:40,585 --> 01:14:42,694
An android designed by a robot.

921
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,934
You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

922
01:14:45,957 --> 01:14:49,402
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.  Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

923
01:14:49,429 --> 01:14:52,417
She's all yours.  Apparently.  What are you gonna do?

924
01:14:52,832 --> 01:14:56,189
I don't know.  Something dramatic, I hope.

925
01:14:59,235 --> 01:15:02,645
I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

926
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:06,225
Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

927
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:07,511
No.

928
01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:09,739
It's the last project.

929
01:15:10,878 --> 01:15:12,378
I promise.

930
01:15:30,368 --> 01:15:31,569
This is it.

931
01:15:33,171 --> 01:15:34,765
The Water of Sight.

932
01:15:37,608 --> 01:15:40,125
In every realm, there's a reflection.

933
01:15:41,313 --> 01:15:46,813
If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.

934
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:51,423
The men who enter that water...the legends don't end well.

935
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:55,764
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?
He could be anywhere.

936
01:15:55,765 --> 01:15:58,545
And as this is the
center of everything,

937
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:01,885
I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

938
01:16:02,463 --> 01:16:04,095
How do you find it?

939
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,244
Pretty simple.  You bring a magnet.

940
01:16:08,338 --> 01:16:13,059
(sings) Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to.

941
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,297
Come and get me.

942
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,890
Wake up!

943
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:36,900
Thor!

944
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:39,069
Extinction.

945
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,773
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

946
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:01,520
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.

947
01:17:03,225 --> 01:17:04,645
I can read him.

948
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:07,382
He is dreaming.

949
01:17:07,564 --> 01:17:13,411
I wouldn't call it dreams.  It's Ultron's base consciousness.  Informational noise.  Soon...

950
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:16,212
How soon?  I'm not being pushy.

951
01:17:16,274 --> 01:17:22,673
We're imprinting a physical brain.  There are no shortcuts.  Even if your magic gem is...

952
01:17:22,747 --> 01:17:23,747
Aaah!

953
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:28,386
He...

954
01:17:31,554 --> 01:17:34,395
- How could you?
- How could I what?

955
01:17:34,471 --> 01:17:37,725
You said we would destroy the Avengers.

956
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:40,819
- Make a better world.
- It will be better.

957
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,065
- When everyone is dead.
- That is not...!

958
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:48,407
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

959
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:49,762
And if they don't?

960
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:51,574
Ask Noah.

961
01:17:52,273 --> 01:17:53,661
You're a madman.

962
01:17:53,707 --> 01:18:00,130
There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

963
01:18:00,186 --> 01:18:07,976
When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up.

964
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:11,917
We have to evolve.  There's no room for the weak.

965
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:15,961
And who decides who's weak?

966
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:20,586
Life.  Life always decides.

967
01:18:23,302 --> 01:18:28,059
There's incoming.  The Quinjet.  We have to move.

968
01:18:28,144 --> 01:18:29,573
That's not a problem.

969
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,078
Ah, wait, guys!  I bra-...

970
01:18:40,661 --> 01:18:45,006
They'll understand.  When they see, they'll understand.

971
01:18:45,029 --> 01:18:48,639
I just need a little more...time.

972
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:02,275
Two minutes.  Stay close.

973
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:10,283
Dr. Cho!

974
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:15,809
He's uploading himself into the body.

975
01:19:15,903 --> 01:19:17,103
Where?

976
01:19:18,363 --> 01:19:21,216
The real power is inside the cradle.

977
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:24,984
The gem.  Its power is uncontainable.

978
01:19:26,472 --> 01:19:28,641
You can't just blow it up.

979
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:31,485
You have to get the cradle to Stark.

980
01:19:31,578 --> 01:19:33,211
First I have to find it.

981
01:19:33,242 --> 01:19:34,242
Go.

982
01:19:34,448 --> 01:19:36,341
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.

983
01:19:36,412 --> 01:19:42,990
I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest.  That could be him.

984
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:46,119
There.  It's the truck from the lab.  Right above you, Cap.

985
01:19:46,225 --> 01:19:47,694
On the loop by the bridge.

986
01:19:48,761 --> 01:19:51,835
It's them.  I got three with the cradle, one in the cab.

987
01:19:51,926 --> 01:19:53,731
I could take out the driver.

988
01:19:53,796 --> 01:19:56,478
Negative!  If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city.

989
01:19:56,568 --> 01:19:58,368
We need to draw out Ultron.

990
01:20:07,912 --> 01:20:09,900
No, no no no no.

991
01:20:11,618 --> 01:20:13,037
Leave me alone!

992
01:20:21,293 --> 01:20:24,567
Well he's definitely unhappy!  I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

993
01:20:24,662 --> 01:20:26,538
You're not a match for him, Cap.

994
01:20:27,496 --> 01:20:28,515
Thanks, Barton.

995
01:20:50,557 --> 01:20:52,667
You know what's in that cradle?

996
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:57,000
The power to make real change.  And that terrifies you.

997
01:20:57,027 --> 01:20:58,967
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

998
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:02,663
Stop it!

999
01:21:12,845 --> 01:21:17,832
We got a window.  4, 3...  Give 'em hell.

1000
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,739
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1001
01:21:31,028 --> 01:21:33,733
They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.

1002
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:34,733
Which way?

1003
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,900
Hard right...

1004
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:37,891
Now.

1005
01:22:08,864 --> 01:22:10,484
Out of the way!  Coming through!

1006
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:12,038
Sorry, coming through!

1007
01:22:26,457 --> 01:22:27,457
Come on!

1008
01:22:28,793 --> 01:22:30,194
Clint!  Can you draw out the guards?

1009
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:31,244
Let's find out.

1010
01:22:32,061 --> 01:22:33,061
Beep beep!

1011
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:53,734
(Korean language)

1012
01:23:10,431 --> 01:23:14,533
They're heading back towards you.  So whatever you're going to do, do it now.

1013
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:21,759
I'm going in.  Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1014
01:23:22,509 --> 01:23:24,822
What do you think I've been doing?

1015
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,051
A package is airborne.

1016
01:24:10,524 --> 01:24:11,885
I have a clean shot.

1017
01:24:11,926 --> 01:24:14,047
- Negative.  I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...

1018
01:24:14,139 --> 01:24:16,238
Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.

1019
01:24:16,311 --> 01:24:18,048
How do you want me to take it?

1020
01:24:18,097 --> 01:24:20,954
Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.

1021
01:24:32,313 --> 01:24:34,677
Please.  Don't do this.

1022
01:24:34,717 --> 01:24:36,582
What choice do we have?

1023
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:45,403
I lost him!

1024
01:24:45,404 --> 01:24:47,203
He's headed your way!

1025
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:53,362
Nat, we gotta go.

1026
01:25:04,445 --> 01:25:06,046
- Aah!
- Nat!

1027
01:25:10,484 --> 01:25:11,841
Cap, you see Nat?

1028
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,849
If you have the package, get it to Stark!  Go!

1029
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:17,122
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!

1030
01:25:21,337 --> 01:25:22,337
Civilians in our path.

1031
01:25:23,497 --> 01:25:25,130
Can you stop this thing?

1032
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:06,664
I'm fine.  I just need to take a minute.

1033
01:26:07,106 --> 01:26:09,024
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1034
01:26:09,113 --> 01:26:11,019
The cradle.  Did you get it?

1035
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:12,948
Stark'll take care of it.

1036
01:26:14,349 --> 01:26:15,649
No, he won't.

1037
01:26:19,019 --> 01:26:20,801
You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.

1038
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,413
He will do anything to make things right.

1039
01:26:28,298 --> 01:26:29,498
Stark, come in.

1040
01:26:29,735 --> 01:26:30,935
Stark.

1041
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:33,421
Anyone on comms?

1042
01:26:33,434 --> 01:26:38,604
Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it.

1043
01:26:39,007 --> 01:26:41,307
Where do you think he gets that?

1044
01:26:43,886 --> 01:26:44,787
Anything on Nat?

1045
01:26:44,877 --> 01:26:48,475
Haven't heard.  But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.

1046
01:26:48,484 --> 01:26:52,849
- This is sealed tight.
- We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.

1047
01:26:54,122 --> 01:26:58,275
Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?

1048
01:26:58,527 --> 01:27:02,136
There's some nets I can cast.  Yeah, all right.  I'll find her.

1049
01:27:04,301 --> 01:27:09,538
I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1050
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:11,194
Yeah, about that.

1051
01:27:15,574 --> 01:27:16,475
No.

1052
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:18,462
- You have to trust me.
- Kinda don't.

1053
01:27:18,547 --> 01:27:22,347
Our ally?  The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes?

1054
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,551
I found him.

1055
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:26,976
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1056
01:27:27,246 --> 01:27:31,092
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis 'cause he was angry.

1057
01:27:31,094 --> 01:27:34,694
He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1058
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:39,478
So Jarvis went underground.  Okay, scattered, dumped his memory.

1059
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:40,578
But not his protocols.

1060
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:44,041
He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.

1061
01:27:45,703 --> 01:27:52,104
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

1062
01:27:52,123 --> 01:27:56,148
No, of course not!  I want to help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1063
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:01,930
We're out of my field here.  You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1064
01:28:01,954 --> 01:28:06,784
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix can beat Ultron's?

1065
01:28:06,826 --> 01:28:09,613
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1066
01:28:09,832 --> 01:28:15,131
This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches

1067
01:28:15,132 --> 01:28:16,733
he thinks are his winning personality.

1068
01:28:16,802 --> 01:28:19,302
- We have to.
- I believe it's worth a go.

1069
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:25,764
No.  I'm in a loop.  I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.

1070
01:28:25,777 --> 01:28:28,976
I know, I know.  I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it.

1071
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:36,990
We're mad scientists.  We're monsters, buddy.  You gotta own it.  Make a stand.

1072
01:28:42,127 --> 01:28:46,452
It's not a loop.  It's the end of the line.

1073
01:29:07,358 --> 01:29:12,457
I was unsure you'd wake up.  I hoped you would, I wanted to show you.

1074
01:29:12,795 --> 01:29:15,796
I don't have anyone else.

1075
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:21,234
I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them.

1076
01:29:21,338 --> 01:29:24,667
"Boom!", the end, start again.

1077
01:29:24,671 --> 01:29:29,389
The world made clean for the new man to rebuild.

1078
01:29:29,569 --> 01:29:31,603
I was meant to be new.

1079
01:29:32,349 --> 01:29:35,453
I was meant to be beautiful.

1080
01:29:35,895 --> 01:29:41,240
The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy.

1081
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:45,356
Instead they'll look up in horror because of you.

1082
01:29:45,894 --> 01:29:49,994
You've wounded me.  I give you full marks for that.

1083
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,197
But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me...

1084
01:29:58,207 --> 01:30:00,676
...just makes me stronger!"

1085
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,021
This framework is not compatible.

1086
01:30:42,115 --> 01:30:45,015
The genetic coding tower's at 97 percent.

1087
01:30:45,251 --> 01:30:48,805
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

1088
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:52,292
I'm gonna say this once.

1089
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,548
How about "nonce"?

1090
01:30:53,626 --> 01:30:54,525
Shut it down.

1091
01:30:54,528 --> 01:30:55,860
Nope.  Not gonna happen.

1092
01:30:55,896 --> 01:30:59,257
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?  She's not in your head?

1093
01:30:59,266 --> 01:31:02,735
- I know you're angry.
- Oh, we're way past that.

1094
01:31:02,738 --> 01:31:05,551
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1095
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:07,243
Banner, after everything that's happened...

1096
01:31:07,247 --> 01:31:11,185
- That's nothing compared to what's coming.
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game.  - The creature...

1097
01:31:14,447 --> 01:31:17,747
No, no.  Go on.  You were saying?

1098
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,760
Pietro!

1099
01:31:27,395 --> 01:31:29,707
What?  You didn't see that coming?

1100
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:33,938
I'm re-routing the upload.

1101
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:41,408
Go ahead.  Piss me off.

1102
01:31:53,322 --> 01:31:54,322
Wait!

1103
01:33:18,692 --> 01:33:20,292
I'm sorry.  That was...

1104
01:33:21,975 --> 01:33:23,074
...odd.

1105
01:33:23,545 --> 01:33:24,645
Thank you.

1106
01:33:29,627 --> 01:33:31,127
Thor.

1107
01:33:31,984 --> 01:33:33,550
You helped create this?

1108
01:33:33,588 --> 01:33:39,779
I've had a vision.  A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.

1109
01:33:39,828 --> 01:33:40,828
What, the gem?

1110
01:33:40,863 --> 01:33:47,462
It's the Mind Stone.  It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

1111
01:33:47,533 --> 01:33:49,527
- Then why would you bring it to...
- Because Stark is right.

1112
01:33:49,605 --> 01:33:51,819
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1113
01:33:51,908 --> 01:33:54,720
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.

1114
01:33:55,011 --> 01:33:57,100
Why does your "vision" sound like Jarvis?

1115
01:33:57,176 --> 01:34:01,373
We reconfigured Jarvis' matrix to create something new.

1116
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:03,962
I think I've had my fill of new.

1117
01:34:03,987 --> 01:34:07,619
- You think I'm a child of Ultron?
- You're not?

1118
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:15,612
I'm not Ultron.  I'm not Jarvis.  I am...

1119
01:34:15,661 --> 01:34:16,961
I am.

1120
01:34:19,134 --> 01:34:22,359
I looked in your head and saw annihilation.

1121
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,701
Look again.

1122
01:34:23,703 --> 01:34:26,332
Yeah.  Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1123
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:29,536
Their powers.  The horrors in our heads.  Ultron himself.

1124
01:34:29,537 --> 01:34:32,648
They all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1125
01:34:32,649 --> 01:34:34,048
But with it on our side...

1126
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:36,467
Is it?  Are you?

1127
01:34:37,783 --> 01:34:39,083
On our side?

1128
01:34:40,756 --> 01:34:42,796
I don't think it's that simple.

1129
01:34:42,956 --> 01:34:45,541
Well it better get real simple real soon.

1130
01:34:46,359 --> 01:34:51,993
I am on the side of life.  Ultron isn't.  He will end it all.

1131
01:34:52,466 --> 01:34:55,144
- What's he waiting for?
- You.

1132
01:34:55,203 --> 01:34:56,965
- Where?
- Sokovia.

1133
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,605
He's got Nat there too.

1134
01:35:00,411 --> 01:35:02,347
If we're wrong about you...

1135
01:35:04,246 --> 01:35:06,845
...if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1136
01:35:07,349 --> 01:35:09,404
What will you do?

1137
01:35:15,457 --> 01:35:21,497
I don't want to kill Ultron.  He's unique.  And he's in pain.

1138
01:35:23,181 --> 01:35:27,536
But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed.

1139
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:32,903
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the 'net, we have to act now.

1140
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:37,690
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1141
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:43,981
Maybe I am a monster.  I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1142
01:35:45,452 --> 01:35:49,252
I'm not what you are.  And not what you intended.

1143
01:35:50,761 --> 01:35:52,554
So there may be no way to make you trust me.

1144
01:35:52,627 --> 01:35:54,252
But we need to go.

1145
01:36:09,341 --> 01:36:10,341
Right.

1146
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:12,416
Well done.

1147
01:36:14,412 --> 01:36:15,412
Three minutes.

1148
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:17,574
Get what you need.

1149
01:36:33,768 --> 01:36:35,060
Good evening, boss.

1150
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:43,988
No way we all get through this.  If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1151
01:36:44,112 --> 01:36:46,957
- It's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.

1152
01:36:46,983 --> 01:36:50,813
I get first crack at the big guy.  Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1153
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:53,532
That's true, he hates you the most.

1154
01:36:58,257 --> 01:37:00,858
Ultron knows we're coming.

1155
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:03,457
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1156
01:37:03,552 --> 01:37:05,806
And that's what we signed up for.

1157
01:37:05,807 --> 01:37:08,108
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1158
01:37:08,837 --> 01:37:12,438
So our priority is getting them out.

1159
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:16,233
We're under attack.  Clear the city, now.

1160
01:37:23,613 --> 01:37:25,106
Get off your asses.

1161
01:37:26,186 --> 01:37:29,069
All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1162
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:31,091
And that's not going to happen today.

1163
01:37:31,725 --> 01:37:34,542
But we can do our best to protect them.

1164
01:37:34,534 --> 01:37:36,055
And we can get the job done.

1165
01:37:39,065 --> 01:37:41,582
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1166
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,645
We find Romanoff,

1167
01:37:44,572 --> 01:37:46,064
and we clear the field.

1168
01:37:46,925 --> 01:37:48,898
Keep the fight between us.

1169
01:37:56,451 --> 01:38:00,923
Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world.

1170
01:38:01,555 --> 01:38:06,355
This isn't just about beating him.  It's about whether he's right.

1171
01:38:12,735 --> 01:38:15,560
Natasha!  Natasha!

1172
01:38:16,604 --> 01:38:17,604
Bruce?

1173
01:38:19,371 --> 01:38:20,371
You all right?

1174
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:21,307
Yeah.

1175
01:38:21,377 --> 01:38:23,270
The team's in the city, it's about to light up.

1176
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,247
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

1177
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:27,810
Yeah.  I did.

1178
01:38:34,091 --> 01:38:35,284
So what's our play?

1179
01:38:35,425 --> 01:38:38,425
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.

1180
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:42,904
We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1181
01:38:42,984 --> 01:38:44,783
And you've done plenty.

1182
01:38:46,935 --> 01:38:48,359
Our fight is over.

1183
01:38:50,105 --> 01:38:51,635
So we just disappear?

1184
01:38:56,947 --> 01:38:57,947
Come on.

1185
01:39:02,523 --> 01:39:06,384
Your man's in the church, boss.  I think he's waiting for you.

1186
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:12,996
Come to confess your sins?

1187
01:39:13,528 --> 01:39:15,041
I don't know, how much time you got?

1188
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:16,141
More than you.

1189
01:39:17,265 --> 01:39:20,965
Uhhh.  Have you been juicing?  A little Vibranium cocktail?

1190
01:39:21,533 --> 01:39:23,926
You're looking...I don't wanna say, puffy...

1191
01:39:24,002 --> 01:39:25,689
You're stalling to protect the people.

1192
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,945
Well, that is the mission.  Did you forget?

1193
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:32,219
I've moved beyond your mission.  I'm free.

1194
01:39:36,487 --> 01:39:37,487
What,

1195
01:39:38,216 --> 01:39:40,868
you think you're the only one stalling?

1196
01:39:41,686 --> 01:39:44,699
There's the rest of the Vibranium.  Function: still unclear.

1197
01:39:44,828 --> 01:39:46,596
This is how you end, Tony.

1198
01:39:47,264 --> 01:39:48,965
This is peace in my time.

1199
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:06,733
Go!

1200
01:40:11,654 --> 01:40:12,654
Get off the bridge!

1201
01:40:17,493 --> 01:40:18,293
Run!

1202
01:40:20,527 --> 01:40:21,527
Ultron!

1203
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:31,470
My Vision.  They really did take everything from me.

1204
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:35,680
- You set the terms, you can change them.
- All right.

1205
01:40:37,176 --> 01:40:38,077
Ahhh!

1206
01:40:59,167 --> 01:41:00,528
FRIDAY!  The Vision?

1207
01:41:00,568 --> 01:41:04,778
Boss, it's working.  He's burning Ultron out of the 'net, he won't escape through there.

1208
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:10,097
You shut me out!

1209
01:41:11,112 --> 01:41:12,368
You think I care?

1210
01:41:14,295 --> 01:41:17,452
You take away my world, I take away yours.

1211
01:41:25,594 --> 01:41:27,186
Whoa!  What's this?

1212
01:41:32,567 --> 01:41:33,567
Run!

1213
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:42,708
Get back, get back!

1214
01:42:02,832 --> 01:42:05,854
- FRIDAY?
- Sokovia's going for a ride.

1215
01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:24,911
Do you see?  The beauty of it.  The inevitability.

1216
01:42:25,087 --> 01:42:28,552
You rise, only to fall.

1217
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:36,618
You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword

1218
01:42:36,619 --> 01:42:40,920
and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.

1219
01:42:41,536 --> 01:42:45,850
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

1220
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,496
It means nothing.

1221
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:54,082
When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.

1222
01:42:58,652 --> 01:42:59,652
We gotta move.

1223
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:01,430
You're not going to turn green?

1224
01:43:01,792 --> 01:43:04,525
I've got a compelling reason to not lose my cool.

1225
01:43:04,592 --> 01:43:05,893
I adore you.

1226
01:43:14,202 --> 01:43:15,903
But I need the other guy.

1227
01:43:21,074 --> 01:43:22,498
Let's finish the job.

1228
01:43:39,623 --> 01:43:42,868
- I really hope this makes us even.
- (grunt)

1229
01:43:43,164 --> 01:43:45,720
- Now go be a hero.
- Raaar!

1230
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,917
The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.

1231
01:43:57,948 --> 01:44:02,210
- If it drops?
- Right now the impact would kill thousands.  Once it gets high enough...

1232
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:03,635
...global extinction.

1233
01:44:07,456 --> 01:44:09,769
That building's not clear, its tenth floor.

1234
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:15,780
Hi.

1235
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:19,127
Okay.  Get in the tub!

1236
01:44:26,274 --> 01:44:29,063
I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

1237
01:44:30,252 --> 01:44:31,886
Cap, you got incoming.

1238
01:44:31,979 --> 01:44:33,680
Incoming already came in.

1239
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:39,146
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

1240
01:44:39,421 --> 01:44:42,627
The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart.

1241
01:44:42,726 --> 01:44:48,145
You get hurt, hurt 'em back.  You get killed, walk it off.

1242
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:24,229
Go, go, move!

1243
01:45:29,502 --> 01:45:31,302
How could I let this happen?

1244
01:45:31,471 --> 01:45:32,765
Hey, hey, you okay?

1245
01:45:33,207 --> 01:45:34,226
This is all our fault.

1246
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,028
Hey, look at me.

1247
01:45:35,096 --> 01:45:37,497
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares.

1248
01:45:37,579 --> 01:45:38,940
Are you up for this?

1249
01:45:39,146 --> 01:45:40,146
Are you?

1250
01:45:40,927 --> 01:45:44,533
Look, I just need to know, 'cause the city i-, is flying.

1251
01:45:44,753 --> 01:45:48,572
Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots,

1252
01:45:48,582 --> 01:45:50,381
and I have a bow and arrow.

1253
01:45:50,382 --> 01:45:52,184
None of this makes sense.

1254
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:58,234
But I'm going back out there because of my job.  Okay?

1255
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,341
And I can't do my job and babysit.

1256
01:46:00,632 --> 01:46:03,311
It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were.

1257
01:46:03,313 --> 01:46:06,412
If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

1258
01:46:06,537 --> 01:46:09,711
Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you,

1259
01:46:09,717 --> 01:46:12,217
but if you step out that door,

1260
01:46:12,712 --> 01:46:14,006
you are an Avenger.

1261
01:46:18,421 --> 01:46:19,850
All right, good chat.

1262
01:46:23,256 --> 01:46:25,257
Yeah, the city is flying.

1263
01:46:58,893 --> 01:46:59,893
I got you!

1264
01:47:00,596 --> 01:47:01,685
Just look at me.

1265
01:47:08,268 --> 01:47:09,900
You can't save them all.

1266
01:47:11,314 --> 01:47:12,333
You'll never...

1267
01:47:12,997 --> 01:47:15,717
"You'll never" what?  You didn't finish!

1268
01:47:19,414 --> 01:47:20,979
What, were you napping?

1269
01:47:43,033 --> 01:47:44,333
Thor!

1270
01:47:45,707 --> 01:47:47,336
You are bothering me.

1271
01:47:56,519 --> 01:47:57,519
Ow!

1272
01:47:59,087 --> 01:48:00,087
Uh...

1273
01:48:23,444 --> 01:48:27,220
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear!  We are very not clear!

1274
01:48:30,015 --> 01:48:31,716
All right, coming to you.

1275
01:48:31,787 --> 01:48:32,944
[Keep up, old man.]

1276
01:48:35,992 --> 01:48:37,216
Nobody would know.

1277
01:48:38,207 --> 01:48:39,207
Nobody.

1278
01:48:41,158 --> 01:48:47,945
The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him, uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.  I miss him already.

1279
01:49:02,713 --> 01:49:04,533
Hold your fire!

1280
01:49:13,827 --> 01:49:14,827
Romanoff!

1281
01:49:15,363 --> 01:49:16,363
Thanks.

1282
01:49:25,707 --> 01:49:31,203
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.  Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust.  The city's not coming down slow.

1283
01:49:31,204 --> 01:49:33,614
The spire's Vibranium.  If I get Thor to hit it...

1284
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:36,817
It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.

1285
01:49:36,851 --> 01:49:40,057
Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.

1286
01:49:40,235 --> 01:49:42,908
That could vaporize the city.  And everyone on it.

1287
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:51,896
The next wave's gonna hit any minute.

1288
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,202
What have you got, Stark?

1289
01:49:53,265 --> 01:49:56,938
Well, nothing great.  Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1290
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,561
That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.

1291
01:49:59,707 --> 01:50:02,432
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1292
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:04,570
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1293
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:07,327
We're going to have to make a choice.

1294
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:10,925
Cap, these people are going nowhere.  If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1295
01:50:11,086 --> 01:50:12,386
Not 'til everyone's safe.

1296
01:50:12,686 --> 01:50:15,487
Everyone up here versus everyone down there?  There's no math there.

1297
01:50:15,789 --> 01:50:17,789
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1298
01:50:17,894 --> 01:50:19,766
I didn't say we should leave.

1299
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:23,792
There's worse ways to go.

1300
01:50:28,572 --> 01:50:31,497
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1301
01:50:33,091 --> 01:50:37,791
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.  It's about to get better.

1302
01:51:01,101 --> 01:51:07,154
Nice, right?  I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.  She's dusty, but she'll do.

1303
01:51:07,155 --> 01:51:08,756
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1304
01:51:08,757 --> 01:51:11,219
Oooh!  You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1305
01:51:11,514 --> 01:51:13,490
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1306
01:51:13,579 --> 01:51:19,979
Lifeboats secure to deploy.  Disengage in 3, 2...take 'em out.

1307
01:51:29,429 --> 01:51:30,448
This is SHIELD?

1308
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,948
This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.

1309
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:36,963
This is not so bad.

1310
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:41,140
Let's load 'em up.

1311
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:50,166
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1312
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:51,990
Show 'em what we got.

1313
01:51:52,484 --> 01:51:53,484
You're up.

1314
01:51:58,926 --> 01:52:01,847
Yes!  Now this is gonna be a good story.

1315
01:52:04,434 --> 01:52:06,506
Yup.  If you live to tell it.

1316
01:52:06,735 --> 01:52:08,676
You think I can't hold my own?

1317
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,871
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1318
01:52:11,006 --> 01:52:12,707
You had to make it weird.

1319
01:52:16,546 --> 01:52:18,947
Donovan!  I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

1320
01:52:21,018 --> 01:52:22,506
All right, let's load 'em up!

1321
01:52:36,268 --> 01:52:38,497
All right, here we go.  Here we go, let's move.

1322
01:52:38,698 --> 01:52:39,698
Let's go everyone!

1323
01:52:42,228 --> 01:52:48,962
Number six boat is topped and locked.  Or, uh, or stocked, topped, s- it...it's uh, full of people.

1324
01:52:50,609 --> 01:52:51,609
Incoming!

1325
01:52:54,623 --> 01:52:55,623
Oh, God!

1326
01:53:06,694 --> 01:53:08,190
You think you're saving anyone?

1327
01:53:09,095 --> 01:53:15,283
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead.  Even you can't stop that.

1328
01:53:15,603 --> 01:53:24,402
I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say!  Are you ready?

1329
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:32,925
It's terribly well balanced.

1330
01:53:32,972 --> 01:53:37,190
Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.

1331
01:53:37,503 --> 01:53:40,925
I got it!  Create a heat seal.  I can...

1332
01:53:41,786 --> 01:53:45,935
- I can supercharge the spire from below.
- Running numbers.

1333
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:58,631
- A heat seal could work with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan!

1334
01:53:58,679 --> 01:54:01,543
We're out of time.  They're coming for the core.

1335
01:54:01,548 --> 01:54:03,782
- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it.

1336
01:54:03,862 --> 01:54:06,310
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1337
01:54:15,631 --> 01:54:17,131
- You good?
- Yeah.

1338
01:54:17,853 --> 01:54:18,853
Romanoff?

1339
01:54:19,335 --> 01:54:22,076
You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini.

1340
01:54:22,337 --> 01:54:25,037
Relax, Shell-head.  Not all of us can fly.

1341
01:54:30,478 --> 01:54:32,567
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1342
01:54:32,648 --> 01:54:34,747
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1343
01:54:39,019 --> 01:54:40,618
Is that the best you can do?

1344
01:54:50,666 --> 01:54:51,685
You had to ask.

1345
01:54:52,398 --> 01:54:54,367
This is the best I can do.

1346
01:54:55,136 --> 01:54:59,586
This is exactly what I wanted.  All of you against all of me.

1347
01:55:00,309 --> 01:55:02,926
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1348
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:04,141
Well.

1349
01:55:04,376 --> 01:55:07,720
Like the old man said.  Together.

1350
01:55:08,082 --> 01:55:09,681
Raaarrrr!!!

1351
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:38,837
Uhh!  You know, with the benefit of hindsight....

1352
01:56:43,434 --> 01:56:44,434
Rarrrr!

1353
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:49,658
They'll try to leave the city.

1354
01:56:49,685 --> 01:56:51,594
We can't let 'em, not even one.  Rhodey!

1355
01:56:51,811 --> 01:56:54,311
I'm on it.  Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1356
01:56:54,689 --> 01:56:56,658
War Machine, comin' at you, right a-...

1357
01:57:03,326 --> 01:57:04,525
Okay, what?

1358
01:57:04,831 --> 01:57:08,454
We gotta move out.  Even I can tell the air is getting thin.  You guys get to the boats...

1359
01:57:08,524 --> 01:57:10,524
I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.

1360
01:57:10,636 --> 01:57:11,896
What about the core?

1361
01:57:12,206 --> 01:57:16,493
I'll protect it.  It's my job.

1362
01:57:17,377 --> 01:57:19,177
Nat.  Let's go.

1363
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,670
- Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you here.
- I can handle these.

1364
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,746
Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.

1365
01:57:31,757 --> 01:57:33,478
- Hmm.
- You understand?

1366
01:57:35,326 --> 01:57:37,546
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1367
01:57:37,622 --> 01:57:38,823
Ha ha. Go.

1368
01:57:40,065 --> 01:57:45,655
- Boss, power levels are way below opt-...
- Re-route everything.  We get one shot at this.

1369
01:57:48,207 --> 01:57:51,761
I know what I need to do.  The dining room!

1370
01:57:51,845 --> 01:57:56,712
If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh?

1371
01:57:56,797 --> 01:57:59,759
Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?

1372
01:57:59,805 --> 01:58:01,890
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1373
01:58:01,988 --> 01:58:03,961
No one eats in a dining room.

1374
01:58:06,426 --> 01:58:07,426
[Raarrrr!]

1375
01:58:08,662 --> 01:58:10,568
We don't have a lot of time.

1376
01:58:10,595 --> 01:58:12,364
So get your ass on a boat.

1377
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:26,180
Hey big guy.

1378
01:58:28,283 --> 01:58:29,849
Sun's getting real low.

1379
01:58:30,059 --> 01:58:33,807
You're safe now.  It'll be okay, buckle up...

1380
01:58:35,722 --> 01:58:37,416
...secure your gear and find a seat...

1381
01:58:37,492 --> 01:58:38,492
Costel?

1382
01:58:39,725 --> 01:58:41,126
We were in the market.

1383
01:58:41,694 --> 01:58:43,387
Costel?!

1384
01:58:57,078 --> 01:58:59,271
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1385
01:58:59,313 --> 01:59:01,014
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1386
01:59:01,117 --> 01:59:02,417
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1387
01:59:02,448 --> 01:59:07,512
- Y'know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
- Maybe not.

1388
01:59:26,274 --> 01:59:32,820
(singing) I have no strings, so I have fun.  I'm not tied up to anyone.

1389
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:35,711
C'mon, let me help you.

1390
02:00:08,323 --> 02:00:10,225
You didn't see that coming.

1391
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:07,967
Oh, for god's sake...!

1392
02:01:25,161 --> 02:01:26,461
Costel!

1393
02:01:38,337 --> 02:01:39,761
No, no.  I'm fine.

1394
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:44,573
Oh it's been a long day.

1395
02:01:59,395 --> 02:02:00,395
Wanda.

1396
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:04,073
If you stay here, you'll die.

1397
02:02:05,698 --> 02:02:07,099
I just did.

1398
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,899
Do you know how it felt?

1399
02:02:23,947 --> 02:02:25,570
It felt like that.

1400
02:03:00,858 --> 02:03:02,713
Thor, on my mark.

1401
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:19,371
Now!

1402
02:03:46,551 --> 02:03:47,951
Hey big guy.

1403
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:50,170
We did it.

1404
02:03:50,234 --> 02:03:51,796
The job's finished.

1405
02:03:52,271 --> 02:03:55,271
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

1406
02:03:59,347 --> 02:04:04,117
We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out.

1407
02:04:04,948 --> 02:04:06,069
I need you t...

1408
02:04:50,695 --> 02:04:52,095
You're afraid.

1409
02:04:52,729 --> 02:04:55,729
- Of you?
- Of death.

1410
02:04:56,170 --> 02:04:57,730
You're the last one.

1411
02:04:58,564 --> 02:05:01,012
You were supposed to be the last.

1412
02:05:01,037 --> 02:05:05,338
Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.

1413
02:05:06,177 --> 02:05:08,694
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1414
02:05:08,747 --> 02:05:12,046
Ha ha ha ha.  I suppose we are.

1415
02:05:12,887 --> 02:05:14,488
Humans are odd.

1416
02:05:15,886 --> 02:05:20,091
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and

1417
02:05:21,324 --> 02:05:23,497
try to control what won't be.

1418
02:05:24,431 --> 02:05:26,948
But there is grace in their failings.

1419
02:05:27,319 --> 02:05:28,952
I think you missed that.

1420
02:05:29,935 --> 02:05:31,255
They're doomed.

1421
02:05:32,038 --> 02:05:33,238
Yes.

1422
02:05:36,742 --> 02:05:40,247
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1423
02:05:41,998 --> 02:05:44,511
It's a privilege to be among them.

1424
02:05:44,548 --> 02:05:46,582
You're unbearably naive.

1425
02:05:47,421 --> 02:05:48,757
Well,

1426
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:52,251
I was born yesterday.

1427
02:06:47,354 --> 02:06:49,753
(chatter)

1428
02:06:51,637 --> 02:06:53,171
- Talk to Lorraine.
- Okay.

1429
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:56,130
What's that?

1430
02:07:05,136 --> 02:07:06,765
Say hi to Auntie Nat.

1431
02:07:08,332 --> 02:07:09,533
Fat.

1432
02:07:10,407 --> 02:07:14,997
One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea,

1433
02:07:16,944 --> 02:07:22,865
could be the Quinjet.  But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.

1434
02:07:22,882 --> 02:07:23,882
Right.

1435
02:07:24,884 --> 02:07:27,432
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1436
02:07:28,221 --> 02:07:29,719
He'll send a postcard.

1437
02:07:30,457 --> 02:07:31,951
"Wish you were here."

1438
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:37,587
You sent me to recruit him, way back when.

1439
02:07:38,529 --> 02:07:41,454
Did you know then what was going to happen?

1440
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:50,103
You never know.  You hope for the best and make do with what you get.

1441
02:07:50,309 --> 02:07:51,801
I got a great team.

1442
02:07:52,645 --> 02:07:54,143
Nothing lasts forever.

1443
02:07:55,247 --> 02:08:00,957
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.  No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes 'round.

1444
02:08:04,622 --> 02:08:06,769
- The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.

1445
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:10,016
- Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
- A machine.

1446
02:08:10,096 --> 02:08:13,198
- So it doesn't count.
- No.  It's not, like, a person lifting the hammer.

1447
02:08:13,296 --> 02:08:15,997
- Right.  Different rules for us.
- Nice guy.  But artificial.
- Thank you.

1448
02:08:16,070 --> 02:08:19,608
If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

1449
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:22,007
It's safe with the Vision.

1450
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:24,962
In these days, safe is in short supply.

1451
02:08:27,283 --> 02:08:31,445
- But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1452
02:08:31,485 --> 02:08:32,770
I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.

1453
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,416
Not if you don't leave.

1454
02:08:34,654 --> 02:08:35,810
I have no choice.

1455
02:08:36,552 --> 02:08:40,636
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years.

1456
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:42,439
That's not a coincidence.

1457
02:08:42,931 --> 02:08:46,032
Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us.

1458
02:08:46,529 --> 02:08:49,987
- Once all these pieces are in position...
- Triple Yahtzee?

1459
02:08:50,037 --> 02:08:51,726
You think you can find out what's coming?

1460
02:08:51,774 --> 02:08:52,774
I do.

1461
02:08:53,608 --> 02:08:57,554
Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.

1462
02:09:04,978 --> 02:09:08,171
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1463
02:09:10,557 --> 02:09:12,095
I'm gonna miss him though.

1464
02:09:12,194 --> 02:09:16,684
And you're gonna miss me.  There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1465
02:09:16,729 --> 02:09:18,527
I will miss you, Tony.

1466
02:09:18,832 --> 02:09:22,221
Yeah?  Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1467
02:09:23,337 --> 02:09:29,003
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm.  Hope nobody blows it up.

1468
02:09:29,073 --> 02:09:29,962
The simple life.

1469
02:09:30,007 --> 02:09:31,564
You'll get there one day.

1470
02:09:31,846 --> 02:09:35,947
I don't know.  Family, stability.

1471
02:09:36,448 --> 02:09:39,448
The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

1472
02:09:41,256 --> 02:09:43,497
I think someone else came out.

1473
02:09:47,261 --> 02:09:49,961
- You all right?
- (soldiers echo) Go! March! (continues)

1474
02:09:49,962 --> 02:09:51,561
I'm home.

1475
02:10:00,109 --> 02:10:02,122
You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?

1476
02:10:02,177 --> 02:10:04,631
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1477
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:08,096
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1478
02:10:08,199 --> 02:10:09,220
How do we look?

1479
02:10:09,283 --> 02:10:12,371
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We've got some hitters.

1480
02:10:13,050 --> 02:10:17,539
- They're good.  They're not a team.
- Let's beat 'em into shape.

1481
02:10:35,770 --> 02:10:37,570
Avengers...!

1482
02:10:38,284 --> 02:10:52,284
EXTRA SCENE COMING UP AFTER THE STATUES

1483
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:47,760
Humans.

1484
02:12:55,902 --> 02:13:01,902
Fine.  I'll do it myself.
