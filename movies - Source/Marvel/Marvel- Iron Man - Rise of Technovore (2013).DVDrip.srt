00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:03,039
<b>IRON MAN
Rise of Technovore</b>

4
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:13,236
<i>One must be a sea
to receive a polluted stream</i>

5
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:17,408
<i>without becoming impure.</i>

6
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,159
<i>Lo, I teach you the Overman.</i>

7
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:23,933
<i>He is that sea.</i>

8
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:29,022
<i>In him can your great
contempt be submerged.</i>

9
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,971
What's the problem?

10
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,692
Did you drink too much last night?

11
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:24,718
I can hold my liquor much
better than you, servicemen.

12
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,888
That's just the rookies,
and if you're not careful,

13
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,997
you might end up like them,
barfing your guts out inside your suit.

14
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:33,127
Watch and learn! I'm about to do some

15
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,603
maneuvers only big boys can pull off!

16
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:13,401
You'd better give up
and admit defeat, Rhodey!

17
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,260
Your War Machine is all about
firepower, not speed. It's too heavy!

18
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,782
You might as well admit it.
You're never going to catch me!

19
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,539
Just watch me!

20
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:44,921
Gotcha!

21
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,677
You keep forgetting one thing, Tony.

22
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,615
It's not just speed that counts
here, I'm an air force pilot

23
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,183
with a whole lot of experience.

24
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:07,855
I have years of training under my belt,
in actual combat conditions!

25
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,591
You're a novice who only
just got his license!

26
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:21,903
No fair, shooting repulsor rays!

27
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,562
You said you were experienced
in tactics! You didn't see that coming?

28
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,420
<i>Imagine if outbreaks of violence,</i>

29
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,055
<i>murder, and terrorism could all be</i>

30
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,091
<i>detected and prevented
before they ever took place!</i>

31
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,793
<i>It sounds like
science-fiction, but it's not.</i>

32
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,262
<i>We're here to introduce
the new Howard satellite,</i>

33
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,632
<i>developed by Stark Industries.</i>

34
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>This technology will enable the
S.H.I.E.L.D. detection program</i>

35
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,637
<i>to monitor every event and the full range</i>

36
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,461
<i>of human activity, all over the place.</i>

37
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,675
<i>But there are those who are already</i>

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,810
<i>calling it the ultimate spy satellite.</i>

39
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,678
<i>Privacy-rights advocates have demanded</i>

40
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,148
<i>that Stark Industries
scrap its deployment.</i>

41
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:11,375
<i>Tony Stark responded to those accusations
in his presentation last night...</i>

42
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:23,387
I named this satellite "Howard" after

43
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:30,971
my dad, who always watched out for me.

44
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,476
<i>He believed in the concept
of personal freedom.</i>

45
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,745
<i>The Howard satellite has nt been
designed to infringe upon that right.</i>

46
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,014
<i>Instead, it's an all-seeing
eye in the sky with one job,</i>

47
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,951
<i>to identify and prevent trouble
before it occurs, 24 hours a day.</i>

48
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,485
<i>Once it's launched and activated,</i>

49
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,221
<i>it will provide relief
to the victims of crime,</i>

50
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,754
<i>and protect countless
lives all over the world.</i>

51
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,800
<i>Tony Stark,
the CEO of Stark Industries,</i>

52
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,767
<i>who is also known as Iron Man,</i>

53
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,103
<i>is claiming the launch
of his new satellite</i>

54
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,906
<i>will provide endless benefits
to ordinary citizens...</i>

55
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,608
<i>With many
questions unanswered, there is</i>

56
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,110
<i>much anxiety over potential
violations of privacy...</i>

57
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,279
<i>People are wondering whether they're</i>

58
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,615
<i>able to trust this man, who has
a background as a weapons dealer.</i>

59
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,783
<i>There is an undercurrent of anxiety that</i>

60
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,153
<i>the satellite was developed for some</i>

61
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,257
<i>secret purpose. There
are those who say there is</i>

62
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,858
<i>great danger in putting all
our faith in technology.</i>

63
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,726
<i>Who will be in control, man or machine?</i>

64
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,396
<i>Here comes Tony Stark
in his Iron Man armor,</i>

65
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,997
<i>and Colonel James Rhodes,
flying his War Machine!</i>

66
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:33,300
<i>Obviously, they are both
here to reassure the public.</i>

67
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,182
Glad you're still alive.

68
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,052
Not as much as me.

69
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,653
Who the hell are these guys?

70
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,687
They're targeting the Howard.

71
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,658
I've run into these bastards before.

72
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,661
They're armored mercenaries who
call themselves the "raiders."

73
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,297
They must be paranoid that we're gonna
be able to track their activities.

74
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,290
They're jamming the radio waves!

75
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,533
Data interrupt!
We've lost communications!

76
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,672
Scramble our interceptors
and get them out there.

77
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,865
Rhodey! Great work!

78
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,965
It's time for us to have
a little chat, my friend.

79
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,701
<i>If you answer nicely, you
might survive this interview.</i>

80
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,738
You'll be in prison, but at
least you'll still be alive.

81
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,640
Am I supposed to be scared? My
boss is more powerful than you.

82
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,267
He's far surpassed your capabilities.

83
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:10,024
He's that good, is he? Maybe I can
find a job for him in my company.

84
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,460
We'd have to settle a few things
first, like a claim for damages.

85
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,251
We've only just begun.

86
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,636
My boss is going to smash your
satellite into pieces before

87
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,696
you have a chance to play with it!

88
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:32,168
If he's that powerful, why is
he so afraid to show himself?

89
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,673
Oh, he's here.

90
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,346
Rhodey!

91
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,849
Take care of this guy, will you?

92
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:48,284
Hey!

93
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,129
Have all staff except necessary
personnel evacuate immediately!

94
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,431
We're about to launch the satellite!

95
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,888
Yes, sir!

96
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,659
Who's there? Only authorized
personnel are allowed in here!

97
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:50,957
Fuel update!

98
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,426
Complete, sir!

99
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,494
Launch pad status!

100
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,629
Ready to go!

101
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,231
Fire flow complete!

102
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,734
Countdown continuing.

103
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,134
25... 24... 23... 22... 21... 20... 19...

104
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,370
Wind speed, eight miles per hour!

105
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,803
Purging energy supply pipe!

106
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,206
- All systems are green!
- Acknowledged!

107
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,440
Good morning.

108
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,865
Huh?

109
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,669
And goodbye.

110
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:17,618
Huh? What the heck?

111
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,788
<i>Unknown phenomenon.
No reference in the database.</i>

112
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,279
<i>Possible presence of
erosive biological cells.</i>

113
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,043
No one escapes.

114
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,589
I won't let you do it!

115
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,419
<i>Power is down.
Energy reserves at 55%.</i>

116
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,004
Who is this guy?

117
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,506
<i>Insufficient data.
Genome DNA extract impossible.</i>

118
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,475
<i>Cannot read base sequence.</i>

119
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,412
<i>Unknown gene region.</i>

120
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,287
<i>Centrifuge is required
to continue analysis.</i>

121
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,052
You must be some kind of monster!

122
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,778
How could you sacrifice so many
lives for a single satellite?

123
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:39,015
Hey, you! Say something!

124
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:46,190
The leaders of all fascist companies
appear to have similar eyes.

125
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,336
The eyes of smartass
kids also seem the same.

126
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:03,717
People who place their faith
in high-technology, like you,

127
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,120
sShould be placed in museums
with the rest of the fossils.

128
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,279
Actually, coffins would be better.

129
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:14,028
And kids who are all mouth, like you,

130
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,186
sShould be sent to the Stark
school of re-education.

131
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,588
I am Ezekiel.

132
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,525
Ezekiel?

133
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:27,006
I promise you, I will be dancing

134
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,942
around your coffin as they
drive in the final nail.

135
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:33,003
I will then hold a wake in
the offbeat style you so favor.

136
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,376
I'm not done with you yet!

137
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:43,312
Goodbye.

138
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:57,738
Shoot! What the hell is this?

139
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,296
Tony, where are you?

140
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:06,235
What happened down here?
What's going on in this place?

141
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,017
I'm done on my end!

142
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,820
Tony, are you down here somewhere?

143
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,586
- Don't come any further!
- What? Are you in trouble?

144
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:18,315
- What's that?
- Rhodey!

145
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,610
I don't believe this.

146
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,231
The control tower's gone!

147
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:49,823
Any signs of life?

148
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,499
I'm afraid not.

149
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,794
Wait! I see some movement
down in the rubble!

150
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,331
It's Tony Stark! He made it out, sir!

151
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,967
Iron Man is alive!

152
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,136
Send black widow to pick him up!

153
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,128
And hurry! We need to
debrief him immediately!

154
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,581
Come on! Where are you, Rhodey?

155
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,400
Come on! You've got to be
here somewhere! I'll find you,

156
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,638
No matter how long it takes!
If you're alive, answer me!

157
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:43,700
Natasha! Help me find Rhodey! Please!

158
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:52,452
Stark! There's no time to waste,
we have to get out of here.

159
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,644
Fury has ordered me to
escort you to the helicarrier.

160
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,868
The medical team will
continue to search for survivors,

161
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,461
But casualties are expected to
rise to more than 300 people.

162
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:23,416
Nick! Rhodey died!
Right in front of me!

163
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,375
And so did a lot of other people.

164
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,422
Who the hell were these guys?

165
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,657
All their signals were blocked

166
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,516
By a very powerful
electromagnetic field.

167
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,788
I was hoping you could
give us some guidance.

168
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,294
He was a smartass kid.

169
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:49,375
His armor was weird.
It was very advanced,

170
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,244
I'll tell you that is something
I've never seen before.

171
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,146
It was techno bio-organic matter,

172
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,082
combined with manmade mechanisms!

173
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,257
Techno bio-organic armor?

174
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,054
I'm gonna find
that guy. And when I do,

175
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,278
I'm gonna make him pay for Rhodey!

176
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,194
Nick! What's going on
here? What are you up to?

177
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,196
You're not leaving this complex, Stark.

178
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,833
Not until S.H.I.E.L.D. has worked
out exactly what's going on.

179
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,567
Are you suggesting I
had something to do with this?

180
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,603
We have more questions.

181
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,440
What happened just now is
being broadcast everywhere.

182
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,107
It's being played out
on every news channel

183
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,344
On every television across the planet.

184
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,778
If we don't provide an explanation

185
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,203
some high-up heads at the
Pentagon are going to roll.

186
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,884
Just routine procedure, of
course. Business as usual.

187
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,989
They have enough heads. Believe
me, they can afford to lose a few.

188
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,957
That's not the most important thing now.

189
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,992
We need to get hold of that kid before

190
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:42,867
he causes any more damage.
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do!

191
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:46,972
Go after him.

192
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:12,315
<i>Nick! Will you
call off your pit-bull?</i>

193
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:19,689
For god's sake! I don't
have time to mess around!

194
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,290
That's too bad.

195
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,307
I'm the only one who has a chance

196
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,176
against that smart-ass
kid's technology!

197
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,413
<i>You probably won't believe I,</i>

198
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,882
but I'm telling you the truth,
I'm not enjoying this one bit.

199
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,784
There are rules.

200
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,086
And whether you like it or not, I
happen to be duty-bound to obey them.

201
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:43,856
<i>There'll be hell to pay if I let
our only witness get himself killed.</i>

202
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,215
You government workers sure
have a tough job.

203
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,536
<i>Homing missiles
locked on and tracking.</i>

204
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,359
Thanks a lot for the update!

205
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:19,915
Wanna play?

206
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,588
<i>Commander, he's gone!
We've lost him!</i>

207
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:52,315
Natasha?

208
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,810
Sorry, Natasha.

209
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,993
Stark!

210
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,942
I need to teach that
kid the greatness of technology.

211
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,733
I'm going to have to find
out where its weaknesses are.

212
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,705
How's the art coming?

213
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:27,977
I'm still working on it.

214
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:31,825
I love art, but I don't
intend to become an artist.

215
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,361
After all this time playing around,

216
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:39,031
I realize I don't have the
talent for it like my uncle.

217
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:42,459
You shouldn't give up in
frustration. Your body has the DNA for it.

218
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:49,142
There's something
I've finally come to realize.

219
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:53,702
Even with talent, you need chaos
to give birth to a dancing star.

220
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,215
I'm not sure I have it.

221
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,576
Someday, man will no
longer give birth to any star.

222
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:05,382
By the way, I see they managed
to launch the satellite after all.

223
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,693
The raiders couldn't control

224
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,429
the reinforced functions I gave them.

225
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,566
However, it's still early in the game.

226
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,067
I'll be preparing another offensive.

227
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,859
Tony Stark.

228
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,863
Tony Stark.

229
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:26,869
He seems to be in possession of
a wide range of technological icons.

230
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,351
And one of the high-tech
graven images these people

231
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,476
<i>place on an altar to worship,
is his new satellite.</i>

232
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:35,822
<i>He's the high priest of technology.</i>

233
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:36,980
<i>Yes.</i>

234
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,961
<i>But it's a conceited and
foolish misunderstanding.</i>

235
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,561
<i>Technology and the people who give birth</i>

236
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:43,730
<i>to it are nothing more than false idols,</i>

237
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,455
<i>leading society to disaster.</i>

238
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,770
It's a tiresome task. But these
people must be taught the truth.

239
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,013
Huh?

240
00:24:58,695 --> 00:24:59,895
I need your help!

241
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:03,076
Excuse me?

242
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,151
Check the black market
for bio-related products.

243
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:11,518
You promised me
a full week's vacation!

244
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,053
And anyway, aren't you
supposed to be in Utah

245
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,423
for the launch of that new
satellite you developed?

246
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,959
I'll make it up to you, Pepper.

247
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,594
I'll tell you what. This year, you can

248
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,994
have the villa and a
whole support staff.

249
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,564
Thanks, but you already gave me that to

250
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,633
make up for losing last year's vacation.

251
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,868
I did? Okay, then how about I rent you

252
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:32,194
an entire village or something?
Please, Pepper. It's urgent.

253
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:36,076
What's going on here?

254
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,750
I'll tell you inside.

255
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:43,349
How long is it before
the Howard goes online?

256
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,919
Everything should be
active within four hours.

257
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,493
We're going to use that
satellite to find its maker.

258
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:55,018
As of now, priority one is
capturing the fugitive Iron Man.

259
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,220
Poor Rhodey. I can't believe it.

260
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,736
I can't believe
he was such an idiot for

261
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,137
Letting that kid get him.
I could've taken care of myself.

262
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:07,106
He didn't need to come looking for me.

263
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:10,042
You're saying the killer was a child?

264
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,412
Yeah, some know-it-all kid!

265
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,346
There was something about him,
though, that was very intriguing.

266
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,917
The bottom line is, if he was
able to create a technology

267
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,778
that I've never seen or heard of
before, he deserves a little respect.

268
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,080
His sense of design isn't
really my cup of tea.

269
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:27,683
But his results are.

270
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,732
As you know, I've dealt with
some shady vendors in the past.

271
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:36,903
But Rhodey was the exact opposite.

272
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:41,280
He was a straight arrow. All
the time I knew him, he never

273
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:45,412
broke the rules or left the
straight and narrow. I admired him.

274
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,814
He really believed in the dream.

275
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,382
Rhodey was a government
worker and a normal person.

276
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,218
I'm nothing but a rich genius.

277
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,720
The worlds we lived
in were so different,

278
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,822
it's amazing we got along at all.

279
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,080
He was a good friend,

280
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:03,797
but I'm not sad about it.
I'm fine, really.

281
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,467
It's a shame, though, that I
lost someone to race against.

282
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:11,627
I guess I should have let
him win some of the times.

283
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:13,613
Tony.

284
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,035
That suit was made of
technology I've never seen before.

285
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:25,451
Nanotechnology?
Biotechnology? No.

286
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:27,844
It was nowhere near as simple as that.

287
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:32,125
He had inserted the integral
DNA of living organisms

288
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,961
into a material based on the
functions of a human body.

289
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:39,031
It couldn't be done in a
normal research facility.

290
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:42,102
Could he somehow be
using mutated cells? No!

291
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,438
He's synthesizing them
in a molecule assembler!

292
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,008
If not, it wouldn't be stable.

293
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,809
Tony. I need you to authorize access.

294
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,134
Stark, vocal authorization.

295
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:59,152
Nanomachines, nanotechnology. Here's
something on human-mech hybrids.

296
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,288
There's research being
done all over the world,

297
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:06,259
but no one has announced
a practical application.

298
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,193
I haven't heard of
any successes, either.

299
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:10,163
But I have to believe my own eyes.

300
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,097
What I saw was a definite breakthrough.

301
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:16,036
It merged biotechnology
and mechatronics.

302
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,705
Customized artificial neurons
were working in conjunction

303
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,375
with the human nervous system.
He was controlling them perfectly.

304
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,279
A. I.M! It's a company
called Advanced Idea Mechanics

305
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:30,215
And they're the largest
supplier in the black market.

306
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,719
They've been researching
biotechnological hybrid armors

307
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,454
for a long time, in secret.

308
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:39,792
In recent years, they've continuously
invested vast amounts of capital.

309
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,729
Does your data indicate where
their research facility is located?

310
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,453
Let me see.

311
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,191
Karachi, Pakistan!
There's a secret lab there!

312
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:53,205
The facility is being fronted
as a warehouse for medical supplies.

313
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,307
But actually, they're involved with

314
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:58,944
chemical warfare research and
the sales of illegal weapons.

315
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:01,837
I've downloaded map coordinates
in case you plan to pay them a visit.

316
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,656
Thanks, Pepper. You can
return to your vacation now.

317
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:12,525
Are you going
to be okay on your own?

318
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,762
A kid misbehaved. An
adult needs to discipline him.

319
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:21,190
You're a kid yourself, Tony,
an obstinate, stubborn kid.

320
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,461
Are you going to scold me, Pepper?

321
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:31,166
Why do you keep putting
me in that position?

322
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:36,103
I don't want to be the only
adult in this relationship.

323
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:40,041
It's intriguing, though. I find
I'm drawn to more mature women.

324
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:42,845
Especially when they're beautiful.

325
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:49,018
Darn it.

326
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:52,922
Tony.

327
00:29:55,992 --> 00:29:59,471
Iron Man is not responding.
All signals are being blocked.

328
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,474
Damn it! Teams blue and
gold, cover all escape routes!

329
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,001
Team red, move in on my
command. Capture and contain!

330
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:09,615
It's S.H.I.E.L.D.
What did you do this time?

331
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,941
Something awful, I imagine.

332
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,018
I suppose it's
too late to apologize.

333
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:50,278
<i>Confirming as
our target, Mr. Tony Stark.</i>

334
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,159
<i>Checking profile.</i>

335
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:57,384
<i>Target identified.</i>

336
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:03,192
<i>Mr. Stark, please throw away your
weapons and surrender immediately.</i>

337
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:07,227
<i>Please comply.</i>

338
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,377
<i>Please comply. You can leave
your belongings with us.</i>

339
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:15,181
<i>Please comply.</i>

340
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,349
<i>You can leave your belongings with us.</i>

341
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,519
<i>You can leave your belongings with us.</i>

342
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,611
<i>You can leave your belongings with us.</i>

343
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,929
Sorry, Nick.

344
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,895
I don't have time to waste right now.

345
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,921
I'll pay for the damages. I have to go.

346
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:33,623
Fire.

347
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:12,662
There goes my
vacation. Predictable.

348
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:05,381
Don't you ever knock
before you enter a room?

349
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:32,905
<i>All Mandroids have
lost position of Iron Man.</i>

350
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:36,211
Visual monitors are disabled.
Switching to motion sensors.

351
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,284
Hey, boys, I'd love to keep playing.

352
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,860
But I think it's time to excuse myself.

353
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:57,836
Sorry, nick, but I had to do
what I thought was necessary.

354
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:01,173
I think you need to improve
the a-one on the Mandroids.

355
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,708
After facing off with
them, I have to say,

356
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,134
they seem a little vulnerable to me!

357
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:20,065
All Mandroids
have been annihilated.

358
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,751
Get me special Agents
Barton and Romanova.

359
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,588
Right away, sir.

360
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:32,771
So, miss Potts. Is your boss
free any time in the near future?

361
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:36,342
I'm afraid he's fully booked
for the next three years or so.

362
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,413
Of course. Being Tony Stark,
he never follows his schedule.

363
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,349
Then he blames me when he
misses his appointments.

364
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,485
There's something
I want to show you.

365
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,652
I was trying to tell your
crazy boss about this,

366
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:50,445
but he appears to be
blocking all communications.

367
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,661
One day he's going
to go off half-cocked,

368
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:59,836
and run into something
unexpected he can't handle.

369
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:45,900
They herald the coming of
the lightning, and perish as heralds.

370
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:51,150
Lo. Lo.

371
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,385
I am a herald of the lightning.

372
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,909
I am a herald of the lightning.

373
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:59,514
I feel good today.

374
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:14,574
It's so beautiful.

375
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,443
With the Technovores,
I will have great power.

376
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,480
I will be able to control any machine,

377
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,405
using the interface
built into this armor.

378
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:32,581
So. Are you ready to go?

379
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:39,699
Yes. I will now be able to infect
the satellite and bring it down.

380
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,291
We will grind these oppressors
and their techno gods to dust.

381
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,371
It's up to you, however,
as to where you want to use it.

382
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,572
Obviously.

383
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:38,958
Excellent. We have a deal, my friend.

384
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,516
Tell your associates A.I.M. says hello.

385
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:44,853
What's wrong?

386
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,833
shooot! It's the Punisher!
How did he track me?

387
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:08,920
We're being blown to bits over here!

388
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:10,690
You need to send
reinforcements right away!

389
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,559
What do you mean, 10 minutes? Nobody's
gonna be alive here in 10 minutes!

390
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,851
We need them in 10 seconds!

391
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,451
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,916
Let me handle this, Castle.

393
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,384
I don't need help from
a company president

394
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,619
who can't stay out of the limelight.

395
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:45,646
These guys are scum.
They don't deserve to live.

396
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:50,695
Frank, listen,
I don't disagree with your feelings.

397
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,965
But I need some answers
before you wipe 'em out.

398
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,835
I have all the answers I
need. Get out of the way.

399
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,994
If you shoot, I'll blast
you from here to Tokyo!

400
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:09,614
Fine, go ahead.

401
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:11,751
I appreciate it. All right. Let's get

402
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,786
this over with while
Punisher's still in a good mood.

403
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:17,422
I need to know about
the men who hired you.

404
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:20,960
Do you think an A.I.M. man would
give up the identity of his clients?

405
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,628
Come on, Stark! You of all people

406
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,463
should know what would
happen if I were to do that!

407
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:28,400
Let me guess. You'd never
be able to do business again.

408
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:31,137
Permanently!

409
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,096
I figured. But thanks
for the directory anyway.

410
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,166
Nice work.

411
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:46,751
So, neo-terrorists. Techno-organisms,
buyers of body armor.

412
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:49,327
Let's see who you've been dealing with.

413
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:59,632
Ezekiel. Wait a minute!
I know that name!

414
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,132
But I've got a dossier on
him, if it's any use to you.

415
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:03,202
You're sure about that?

416
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,737
I remember that name, too.

417
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,639
As a friend, you'd let
me read that dossier?

418
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,041
Huh! Now you're a friend?

419
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,177
The same friend who threatened
to blast me from here to Tokyo?

420
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,679
I guess our job is done.
Let's get out of here.

421
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:32,797
How can you drink this
coffee? It's like sludge.

422
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:34,567
It's military issue.

423
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,402
Drinking it at night in the
jungle used to calm me down.

424
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:40,639
Actually this place kind
of reminds me of a jungle.

425
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,664
Here's the file. I found it.

426
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:51,106
Ezekiel Stane... Stane! Wait!

427
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,641
Obadiah Stane's son?

428
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,123
That would be pretty disgusting.

429
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,648
This nutcase turns out to be
the son of your old partner?

430
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:03,619
Obadiah went crazy.
I had no choice at the time.

431
00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:05,753
<i>I had to kill him.</i>

432
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:12,170
Are you telling me
he's that Ezekiel Stane?

433
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:14,806
But he's supposed to have
died in an aircraft accident!

434
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,197
At the age of 16!

435
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:21,679
His father had a lot
of assets hidden around the world.

436
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:25,083
Having inherited all that,
I'm sure a clever kid like him

437
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,652
Would know how to put
it to very good use.

438
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:29,688
Nowadays, a little cash can
make the impossible possible.

439
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,646
You're right.
There's no denying that.

440
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,760
Looks to me like this kid has been

441
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,530
burying his trail for a lot of years.

442
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,467
<i>And now he shows up in the form
of a sociopathic super-genie.</i>

443
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,568
<i>There are rumors he injected his brain</i>

444
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:45,503
<i>with nanobots to make himself
smarter than he already was.</i>

445
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:50,608
According to this, he's involved in
a wide range of shady research.

446
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:52,811
From synthetic drugs to nanotechnology.

447
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:54,869
One of his interests
is techno-organic armor.

448
00:42:55,471 --> 00:42:57,750
What a surprise.

449
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,740
He won't be an easy opponent to handle.

450
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:03,655
I've been after him for six months
and I haven't been able to pin him down.

451
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,490
Let me try something.

452
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:07,226
What are you looking for?

453
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,896
I'm hacking directly into the
S.H.I.E.L.D. network. I figure if

454
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,364
I cross-reference your dossier
with the data in the network

455
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,534
I might be able to find out where he is.

456
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,759
Computer geeks are something else.

457
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:22,797
Thirty miles to Karachi.

458
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,144
<i>Log note, I'm
briefing Agent Natasha</i>

459
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:28,146
<i>Romanova, and Agent Clint Barton.</i>

460
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:30,623
<i>Here's the update, it's
been confirmed that Stark has</i>

461
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,851
<i>joined forces with Frank
Castle, known as "the Punisher."</i>

462
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:36,188
That weapon-crazy lunatic?

463
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,590
Although I hear he's not very
good with a bow and arrow.

464
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,360
I want to get out of this country as
quickly as possible. If it's discovered

465
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,829
that we're violating the
airspace of a sovereign nation,

466
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,353
it'll cause an international incident.

467
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:47,932
You have 40 minutes to complete

468
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:50,407
the mission and get back to the ship.

469
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:56,407
Shanghai?

470
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:59,911
I don't get it. What would he
know about a place like that?

471
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:03,181
We had a weapons research center there,

472
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,750
until I decided to close
it down a few years ago.

473
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,853
Then someone bought the property
and built a luxury hotel there

474
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,811
with a penthouse suite for wealthy VIPs.

475
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:13,458
The hotel's privacy is
as tight as a Swiss bank.

476
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:17,228
The land itself was apparently
purchased by Obadiah Stane.

477
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:20,733
You see how effective a
little bit of cash can be?

478
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,268
Thanks for everything,
Frank. The next time I come,

479
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:25,726
I'm gonna bring you a bag of
the best coffee in the world.

480
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:28,440
Hello, we've got company!

481
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,911
Oh, boy! I knew
they'd come, sooner or later.

482
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,313
They sure seem to have a
lot of time on their hands.

483
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,070
See you.

484
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:40,175
Wait!

485
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,557
<i>There is an object
approaching from behind.</i>

486
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:46,947
Is it a missile?

487
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,416
Negative.

488
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:57,759
Bulls-eye!

489
00:44:59,896 --> 00:45:01,673
Some freakin' arrows
caused this much damage?

490
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:03,275
<i>Conducting system check.</i>

491
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,146
So glad I installed a
protective force field.

492
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,481
Give up, Stark, and come
with us to see the director.

493
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,940
You really think he's going
to come along willingly?

494
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:17,521
<i>System interrupt.
Initiating forced shutdown.</i>

495
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:19,525
Hold on, wait a minute!

496
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,695
Stop fighting. There's
no way you can get loose.

497
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,498
You might as well accept it. The
game's over, buddy. We're taking you in.

498
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,224
Listen, Stark! In the
helicarrier's medical bay is...

499
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:37,476
Watch out! You're not
too good at this, Stark!

500
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,867
Crap, he's getting away!

501
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:49,989
Tell me something. Are you trying
to be as obvious as you can?

502
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,190
What do you mean, Stark? I
thought you liked the attention.

503
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:54,882
Not when I look
like five miles of bad road!

504
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,262
Well then, hang on, buddy!

505
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,822
What's your problem, mister?

506
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:25,556
It's over, Stark!

507
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:28,226
If you join forces with
a crazed vigilante killer,

508
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,228
no-one's gonna take you
seriously as a hero, buddy!

509
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:33,253
That son of a gun!

510
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:43,775
Don't do it, Frank! They're
just following orders!

511
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,277
I'm not trying to kill them!

512
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,652
I just want them to know
we're not about to surrender!

513
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:52,717
shooot!

514
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:54,376
- You ready?
- Leave it to me!

515
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:04,351
Bingo!

516
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:21,079
All right, guys!

517
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:25,005
If you don't want to get hurt any
further, you'd better come out!

518
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:30,177
We hear you. But before we do,

519
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:32,581
here's a little gift!

520
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:45,471
You bastard!

521
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,739
Thanks for the compliment.

522
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,940
Now throw down your weapons
and raise your hands!

523
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:51,199
Did you hear me?

524
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:57,815
Good girl.

525
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,240
You, too!

526
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:04,456
Fine. You jerk. Don't think
you're gonna get away with this.

527
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,059
Bunch of bleeding-heart
S.H.I.E.L.D. weaklings!

528
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,217
If you disrespect me again, I'll...

529
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:16,534
If you don't want a
tunnel bored in your head,

530
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,958
throw your guns away!

531
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:23,364
Whatever. I don't need them now, anyway.

532
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:29,070
I guess I was able to buy enough time.

533
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,289
<i>Power reserves
now recovered to 40%.</i>

534
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:40,958
Good, now go ahead and re-route
force field reserves to thrusters.

535
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,226
<i>Affirmative.</i>

536
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:43,601
Come back here!

537
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:52,427
It's no use. Your
arrows won't reach him.

538
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:54,978
Darn it!

539
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:04,949
<i>Power reserves fully
recovered. All systems are now optimal.</i>

540
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:06,875
I've wasted too much time.

541
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:14,092
I can already hear the
boss dismissing us, sarcastically.

542
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,284
Yeah. It makes me want
to bore a hole into my own head.

543
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:26,626
You owe me, Stark.

544
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:29,297
Payback won't be cheap.

545
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,498
I hear a soft breeze.

546
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:09,570
And that wind gathers another soft wind.

547
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,873
I can sense our destiny. We
come together with that wind.

548
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:17,144
Listen carefully, Sasha.

549
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,347
Can you hear it, as well?

550
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:31,302
Jarvis, have you got anything?

551
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:33,237
<i>Readings are
unclear. There's interference.</i>

552
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:35,641
<i>Wait, there is a slight reaction.</i>

553
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,675
<i>It could well be a living organism.</i>

554
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,951
That doesn't help me much.

555
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:51,478
Hey, boy! I came to see you. Why
don't you turn the lights on for me?

556
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:55,159
When I was young, I
played hide and seek.

557
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,829
I hid in the dark garage
for so long, I fell asleep.

558
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,097
After a while, my mom, Maria, came

559
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:02,601
to look for me. She was worried sick.

560
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,402
Did your parents do the same for you?

561
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,371
I've never
played hide and seek.

562
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,273
<i>Five meters
behind you, the air shift.</i>

563
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,898
<i>And the room temperature changed slight.</i>

564
00:51:12,434 --> 00:51:16,148
Where did you come
from? Did you use magic?

565
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,951
My mom was very upset by
my behavior. I worried her

566
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,286
with my appearances and disappearances.

567
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,422
If you keep this up, your
mom will get upset, too.

568
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:26,824
Or your dad, if he's still around.

569
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:32,630
I don't hide from anyone. You're
simply not looking in the right place.

570
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,032
Really? This is starting to feel

571
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,556
more and more like a kid's game to me.

572
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:43,474
I told you before, I've
never played hide and seek.

573
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,701
And my dad that you speak of,
I suspect you know who he is.

574
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,273
You might as well say his name.

575
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:56,755
Obadiah!

576
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,846
That is correct.

577
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:02,231
<i>He can summon up a
hologram, just like that!</i>

578
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:08,467
- You want revenge?
- Revenge? Why would I want that?

579
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,969
Because I killed
him. You knew that.

580
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:15,762
Wait, that's right. You were
involved, weren't you? I remember now.

581
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:18,199
You'd forgotten that?

582
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:23,338
It wasn't as important an event
in my life as you might imagine.

583
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,452
We weren't actually that close.

584
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,927
Then why are you targeting me?

585
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:35,327
- Don't be so conceited.
- What?

586
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,528
I wasn't
targeting you specifically.

587
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:40,032
It's just that you
were standing in my way.

588
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,489
I don't understand. What are you saying?

589
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,873
<i>But he killed Rhodey.</i>

590
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,009
Even if it was just a prank,
some things cannot be forgiven!

591
00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:01,686
<i>Rapid power decrease.
System error detected.</i>

592
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,722
What's going on?

593
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,157
<i>Synthetic alloys and unknown biological
entities have invaded the system.</i>

594
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,226
Technovores.

595
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,661
<i>Power source and all
sensors have been compromised.</i>

596
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,235
Technovores?

597
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:15,389
This armor is pretty well made.

598
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:17,802
Who do you think made it?

599
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,628
I'm impressed. For someone
like you, it's good.

600
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,675
I realize you can't move.

601
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,811
But believe me, Sasha
will still be impressed.

602
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,086
Sasha?

603
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,909
This must be your pride
and joy. The arc reactor.

604
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:46,097
Don't you have anything to say?

605
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,666
Like how you think
Tony Stark is a genius?

606
00:53:53,394 --> 00:53:56,842
I must say, it's very well
made. For you people, that is.

607
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,344
What does that mean "you people"?
I'll have you know...

608
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,679
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit,

609
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:04,148
and as a result, they were
expelled from the garden of Eden.

610
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:09,855
And 160,000 years ago in Africa,
mitochondrial Eve was born.

611
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,023
The ancestor of humankind.

612
00:54:13,148 --> 00:54:16,894
Very impressive. Did you study
the history of mankind in college?

613
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:19,597
Now there are over
seven billion people on Earth.

614
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:20,965
What does that
have to do with anything?

615
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,601
You asked what I
meant when I said "you people."

616
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:26,327
That's what I was referring to.

617
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,476
You talk as though you're
not a part of the human race.

618
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,333
That's exactly how I feel.

619
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:36,815
I think I'm different
from the rest of you.

620
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,849
Then what are you?

621
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:41,253
It's somewhat hard to describe, really.

622
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:46,780
But if I were forced to explain it
in words, I guess I would be a breeze.

623
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,731
A breeze? I'm a little
confused, can you elaborate on that?

624
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,699
Sasha would also be a breeze.

625
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,735
Who is this "Sasha" you
keep referring to? A girlfriend?

626
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,971
A gentle breeze
that caresses your skin.

627
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,996
And ruffles up the grass and trees.

628
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,110
I see. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

629
00:55:06,235 --> 00:55:07,545
But I'm beginning to
understand one thing.

630
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,648
Obadiah wasn't a very attentive father.

631
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:14,052
He let you get lost
in a world of dreams.

632
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,788
You represent
the dinosaurs of the past.

633
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,646
I, however, represent the future.

634
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:20,981
Dinosaurs of the past?

635
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:25,085
You should consider retirement.

636
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:31,092
That sounds pretty good to me.
I could relax in a nice, quiet place.

637
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:35,440
In fact, I actually tried that once.

638
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,009
But my personal assistant
just won't let me.

639
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,445
This time, I'm afraid
I'll have to override her.

640
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:45,382
You'll retire for sure. You
understand the situation, don't you?

641
00:55:45,507 --> 00:55:49,487
New wind, new future.
A brand new world is created

642
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,056
to go with the brand new future.

643
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:55,360
A completely new
technology will be created.

644
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,552
The old will die out,
and the new will be born.

645
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:04,034
That is the providence of nature.

646
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,992
A superior technology to that of man.

647
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:11,543
Howard will be the whistling arrow
that announces the new reality.

648
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:16,047
You should be honored. The wind
that follows is going to blow away

649
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,315
your most advanced technology.

650
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,141
Howard will be the
shot that leads the way.

651
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:31,096
Hey. Obadiah was lucky he didn't
hang around long enough to see this.

652
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,266
New technology, you say?
Technovores, you called it?

653
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,668
Don't make me laugh.

654
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:40,871
The birth of mankind.
Refinement of steel.

655
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:46,411
Computers, biotechnology. The
things you call old technology

656
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,570
Have all been linked and accumulated
to create your "Technovore."

657
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:02,583
It's not new at all.

658
00:57:04,085 --> 00:57:07,554
The truth is, it's only been born
and exists because of the past.

659
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:14,505
You think you represent a
brand new form of existence?

660
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:18,842
You're mistaken, kid. You're no
more advanced than the rest of us.

661
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:20,501
You were born from human parents.

662
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:24,081
So?

663
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:28,753
You're just a petulant
child throwing temper tantrums.

664
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,755
And just like a child,
if you've been bad,

665
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,590
it's an adult's
responsibility to correct you.

666
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,527
You would do that?

667
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:38,085
I don't think so. Be quiet for a second.

668
00:57:55,704 --> 00:57:58,083
<i>Part of the
system has been restored.</i>

669
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,708
Where? Search for the
area that's functional!

670
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,811
The missile!

671
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:06,496
<i>Locked on target.</i>

672
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:13,697
Foolish man.

673
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:16,735
Do you know what will be
written on the brass plate

674
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,204
that gets installed on
your exhibit in the museum?

675
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,963
"Here lies a fragment of Iron Man."

676
00:58:29,637 --> 00:58:34,108
But only if someone is able to identify
those fragments after I blow you up.

677
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:39,246
You spoilt kid.

678
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:42,893
I don't want to put the curators of

679
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:44,795
the museum to that much trouble!

680
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,134
Perhaps if we had had more time,
I could have taught you a few things.

681
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,436
Well, it's time for goodbye, Tony Stark.

682
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,827
There's still quite a bit of work to do.

683
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:08,108
What's wrong, boy?

684
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:15,326
<i>Invading
Technovore now being removed.</i>

685
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,028
<i>Restarting system, restoring circuits.</i>

686
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:22,400
<i>Energy charge in three,
two, one, complete.</i>

687
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,436
What's the matter, boy?
You look like you're in trouble.

688
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:28,094
Do you need the hand of an adult?

689
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:33,768
I don't believe I do. The
future is full of uncertain elements.

690
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:38,483
It's okay for a
child to rely on adults.

691
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,275
Send energy to the reactor!
Force field deployed!

692
00:59:56,724 --> 01:00:00,594
Hey, where did you go, boy?
Hide and seek time is over!

693
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:19,657
You went too quickly.

694
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:28,621
You can't break me...

695
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:33,159
and you're unable to change the future

696
01:00:34,362 --> 01:00:36,773
because that timeline's already written.

697
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,615
It's a blessing your father's not
here to witness this all play out.

698
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,106
That's enough, Stark!

699
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:50,588
It took long enough but we
finally caught up with you!

700
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,123
You're coming in with
us to see the director

701
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,092
or I'm gonna add an
extra hole in your head!

702
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,927
All right, William Tell.
You made your point.

703
01:00:57,052 --> 01:00:58,719
I'll go, but only if she takes me in.

704
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:22,619
You only got 98 on your test?

705
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:26,224
Without a perfect score, you're
the same as the other idiots!

706
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,315
Go to your room and reflect on
your shortcomings until dinner.

707
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:34,764
I thought you were much better
than this! You're a disappointment!

708
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:41,172
Did you listen to me? I told
you never to touch my Monger!

709
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,097
You little fool! This Monger is
worth 10 times as much as you!

710
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:05,429
My god! I can't
believe what I'm seeing!

711
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,998
Rhodey survived that attack?
Has he woken up at all?

712
01:02:08,123 --> 01:02:09,333
He's being kept alive by
the life-support system

713
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:10,867
but so far we haven't seen...

714
01:02:10,992 --> 01:02:13,704
Hey, Rhodey! Rhodey, can you hear me?

715
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,239
If you don't wake up
you're gonna die a loser!

716
01:02:16,364 --> 01:02:18,842
You can't die without beating
me in a race at least once!

717
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,012
That would be shameful! Tony...

718
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,413
Wait a minute! How 'bout this?

719
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:27,018
If you wake up I'll concede
the next race to you!

720
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,219
I'll introduce you to
a beautiful woman, too!

721
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:31,222
You just tell me which
model on which page

722
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,190
of that magazine you were looking at!

723
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:35,760
Anyone at all! Except
the girl on page 10.

724
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,295
I've got dibs on her.
Just don't tell Pepper!

725
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,697
Other than that, anybody you want!

726
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:46,637
All stations! An unknown program
is hacking into our system!

727
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:47,905
Shutting off communications!

728
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,108
Starting antivirus program!

729
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,532
Initiating defense protocols!
How are the main servers?

730
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:57,681
We can't stop it.

731
01:02:57,806 --> 01:03:01,007
Someone breached our security
and is invading our systems.

732
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:02,543
Technovores.

733
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:06,123
Ezekiel's Technovores are the invaders.

734
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:08,192
What?

735
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:12,318
I'm sure the servers have been
taken over by now. It's too late.

736
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:15,989
Damn it!

737
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:35,452
He's gone! Where did he go?

738
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:37,487
The Howard is under attack!

739
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:40,447
What's happening?

740
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:43,927
Initiate Guardian program!

741
01:03:44,052 --> 01:03:47,364
It won't start! The
firewall is about to be breached!

742
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:49,367
If we don't do something immediately,

743
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,291
all the systems in
Howard will be taken over!

744
01:03:53,094 --> 01:03:56,463
I'm right
here. Look around for me.

745
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,652
My, my.

746
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:11,478
You're not very observant.
I'm right beside you.

747
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:30,012
Above us!

748
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:37,920
Are you okay?

749
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,659
Yeah, here's the problem.

750
01:04:49,784 --> 01:04:53,097
Howard has the power to access
every computer in the world.

751
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,032
Including military satellites.

752
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,434
Exactly. He's planning to make Howard

753
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:00,271
the source to hack into the world's
military satellites and control them.

754
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:04,742
- Ezekiel called that the wind.
- The wind?

755
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,878
He's planning to wipe out
everything that lives on this planet!

756
01:05:11,672 --> 01:05:13,384
What happened to the server room?

757
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,259
I haven't been
able to get a response.

758
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,362
Stark! What are
you planning to do?

759
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,731
I'm going to fix the
computer so we can use it.

760
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:30,434
If I can divert the power of the arc
reactor and aim it at the Technovores,

761
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,503
I can annihilate them.

762
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,137
I'm pretty sure I can
survive for five minutes

763
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:36,005
without this old heart of mine.

764
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,065
After that,

765
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:41,969
I guess it's straight to heaven!

766
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:51,010
I can't tell the situation
from here. What do you want to do?

767
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:54,990
I guess we should return to the bridge.

768
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:02,900
Ezekiel is definitely
coming here to target us.

769
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:06,293
<i>Warning! Warning! Power
reserves decreasing rapidly!</i>

770
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:09,697
Ezekiel!

771
01:06:10,664 --> 01:06:12,014
He's here!

772
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,085
Hi there, "old man" Tony!

773
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,454
Stop this, now!

774
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,690
Where are Clint and Natasha?

775
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,425
They're tucked away
safe and sound. What?

776
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,726
Don't worry about them.

777
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,050
Connect it.

778
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,911
Good, Maria. Now re-boot the Howard.

779
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:49,380
Rebooting Howard, sir!
The Guardian

780
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,882
program has also been initiated!

781
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,507
You people are determined to
try and get in my way somehow.

782
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:59,289
Come here. Sit down.

783
01:06:59,414 --> 01:07:02,114
You and I are gonna
have a talk! Right now!

784
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:05,429
No matter what you
think about your father

785
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,688
I can tell you Obadiah
loved you very much.

786
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:11,434
It was a pretty straightforward bargain.

787
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:13,360
He was human and you were his son!

788
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:16,039
Was that all?

789
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:17,942
Isn't that enough?
You'll achieve nothing

790
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,478
if you throw away your history.

791
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,380
I have personal
experience. I was only able

792
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,014
to move forward by accepting my father.

793
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:26,983
And you'll only create a new world

794
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:29,653
by accepting the past
and building on it.

795
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:35,259
A relic like
you is lecturing me

796
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,329
about the future? How amusing...

797
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,231
Why should I listen
to someone irrelevant?

798
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:54,010
The Technovores!

799
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:56,235
Why... why are you betraying me?

800
01:07:58,505 --> 01:08:00,773
Together, we could have defeated them.

801
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:06,512
I can't see anything, feel anything.

802
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:09,159
Sorry, Ezekiel.

803
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:10,617
The wind...

804
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:14,788
... has stopped.

805
01:08:28,903 --> 01:08:31,082
I've lost all instruments!
I have no control over the helicarrier!

806
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,338
It's losing altitude!

807
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:39,113
Shoot him!

808
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:56,462
Come over here! This way, you bastard!

809
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:02,469
Hurry up, Maria!

810
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:16,193
<i>Reactor detected.
Power reserve at 15 percent.</i>

811
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,684
I have that much?

812
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:23,756
That's it, pal. Playtime is over!

813
01:09:31,064 --> 01:09:32,777
Propulsive force still inoperable!

814
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,851
Too many engines are offline!

815
01:09:35,802 --> 01:09:37,414
Where are we going to land?

816
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:39,550
Shanghai, China!

817
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,743
Contact the Chinese government!
Have them evacuate everyone!

818
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:50,884
Tony, what's going on up there?

819
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:03,274
<i>Power dropping
rapidly! Now entering red zone!</i>

820
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,265
<i>Emergency!
Emergency! Emergency!</i>

821
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:11,371
Well, that's it! This kid
needs some serious disciplining!

822
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:17,770
<i>System error!
System error! Danger!</i>

823
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:27,514
Is it really going to end here?
Am I done for?

824
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:31,350
My body won't move.

825
01:11:53,106 --> 01:11:55,908
Rhodey, is that you?

826
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:13,926
Rhodey...

827
01:12:16,797 --> 01:12:18,965
Guess I must have overslept!

828
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:24,347
Remind me to reward you later
for waking up, old friend!

829
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:25,682
Rhodey...

830
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:26,806
How did he...

831
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,844
Rhodey!

832
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:52,097
What in the...

833
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:01,774
Wait, Rhodey!

834
01:13:18,493 --> 01:13:19,970
What the hell...

835
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:21,845
What's happening?

836
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:28,511
Whatever it is, we're gonna have
to put an end to it, right now!

837
01:13:28,636 --> 01:13:29,603
Let's go!

838
01:13:35,309 --> 01:13:37,511
<i>Peace to everything.</i>

839
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:42,626
<i>Fear... leave it to me,</i>

840
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,296
<i>you powerless immature beings.</i>

841
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,654
<i>I will bring prosperity to all.</i>

842
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:54,537
<i>I will proceed with salvation
for all. I will break free.</i>

843
01:13:54,662 --> 01:13:58,175
<i>I will realize the salvation of all.</i>

844
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,835
<i>I will break free.</i>

845
01:14:03,136 --> 01:14:06,237
<i>I will merge.</i>

846
01:14:07,074 --> 01:14:08,719
<i>Repeat, technology has already
been released. Stupid...</i>

847
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:12,078
<i>... has been closed.</i>

848
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:14,792
Ezekiel!

849
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,793
<i>Power reserves at 7 percent!</i>

850
01:14:16,918 --> 01:14:20,430
<i>Red zone! Re-charge immediately!
Re-charge immediately!</i>

851
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:22,055
What is this guy saying?

852
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:28,271
Rhodey! Do you
understand what's going on?

853
01:14:28,396 --> 01:14:31,108
We have to conserve
our energy resources!

854
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,710
But we can't just
let him destroy everything!

855
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,845
Stop wasting bullets!

856
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,771
What are you talking about?
What are we supposed to do then?

857
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:46,023
I don't know what we can do!
I'm trying to think of something!

858
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,248
<i> ... final... universe...
reincarnation.</i>

859
01:15:01,162 --> 01:15:03,340
We've lost control of the Howard!

860
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,875
<i>Powerless and immature beings...</i>

861
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,502
<i>prosperity...</i>

862
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,615
<i>I will proceed with
the salvation of all.</i>

863
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:14,140
He's replicated it!

864
01:15:16,077 --> 01:15:18,154
He's using the Howard to control

865
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:20,724
all the other military
satellites in orbit!

866
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,250
I'm confused! What's this all
about? Is he planning an attack?

867
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:29,966
Ezekiel, you said that a
new wind would create a new future.

868
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:32,603
Is this how you plan to reset the world?

869
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,139
Destroy everything and start all over?

870
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,039
All of the military
satellites have been

871
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:39,614
repositioned! He's preparing to attack!

872
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:46,939
<i> ... world... technology...
I will start.</i>

873
01:15:48,576 --> 01:15:53,157
He's completely insane.
He's going to destroy the world.

874
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,391
Tony, we should
save our nail clippings.

875
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:57,627
What?

876
01:15:57,752 --> 01:16:00,752
To be filed with
our wills. As keepsakes.

877
01:16:02,222 --> 01:16:05,368
I hate to bring this
up but why would we do that?

878
01:16:05,493 --> 01:16:08,238
There won't be anyone
left to give them to.

879
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:11,474
I thought it might be something
Pepper could remember us by.

880
01:16:11,599 --> 01:16:12,943
Wait a minute. Pepper!

881
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:16,802
Wills...

882
01:16:17,904 --> 01:16:19,805
leaving something behind...

883
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,587
Of course!

884
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:26,256
Pepper! Pepper, can you hear me?

885
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,680
Yes, sir.

886
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,127
<i>Are you focused enough
to help me one last time?</i>

887
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:33,796
<i>Anything but dictation.</i>

888
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:37,591
<i>You're an amazing secretary but
it's a little more complicated than that.</i>

889
01:16:42,762 --> 01:16:45,908
I'm not surprised. You can't
do anything without my input.

890
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:48,078
<i>I want to give
you a present before I die.</i>

891
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:52,748
<i>What's the one thing you've
never had since I've known you?</i>

892
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:54,908
What do you truly want,
more than anything else?

893
01:16:57,545 --> 01:17:00,189
What do I want more than anything else?

894
01:17:00,314 --> 01:17:02,948
That's easy. What I want is a vacation!

895
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:07,564
<i>Vacation. Vacation.</i>

896
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:13,537
<i>Vacation. Vacation.
Vacati... Vacation. Vacation.</i>

897
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:16,239
We're starting to
regain control of the Howard!

898
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:19,376
<i>Good job, Pepper! I was able
to get through Howard's back door!</i>

899
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,011
What back door?

900
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,212
I'm not all-powerful.
I'm an imperfect human

901
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:27,149
and I realized a while ago
that I had to be careful.

902
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:30,020
<i>I programmed a back
door into the satellite</i>

903
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,256
<i>to protect it from unauthorized users.</i>

904
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:36,326
When did you set up my
voice as the password?

905
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,828
<i>You talked in your sleep
when you passed out at your desk.</i>

906
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:41,198
I don't remember that.

907
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,233
You wouldn't.

908
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,203
But I was able to uplink my
armor to the Howard at the time.

909
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,604
You've earned that vacation twice over.

910
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:51,675
<i>Thank you very
much, Mr. President.</i>

911
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,342
<i>The particle-beam
cannon on the Chinese</i>

912
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:55,112
<i>military satellite is about to shoot!</i>

913
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,280
<i>I'm only able
to control one satellite</i>

914
01:17:57,405 --> 01:17:58,971
<i>and I won't have control for long!</i>

915
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:03,619
I want to show this guy
something I have that he doesn't!

916
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:05,922
Are you out of your
mind? What are you gonna do?

917
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:09,648
This is gonna be our
last chance, so listen carefully!

918
01:18:11,118 --> 01:18:14,363
<i>The Technovores are trying to
take over the Howard by hacking in!</i>

919
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:16,065
How much time do we have?

920
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:17,724
Tens of seconds, that's all.

921
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,837
I'm counting on you Rhodey. Okay?

922
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:23,907
All right, Jarvis, pull the trigger!

923
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,532
<i>Affirmative!</i>

924
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:28,167
Tony!

925
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:31,347
Here we go! Hope your
little nap didn't affect your aim!

926
01:18:31,472 --> 01:18:32,972
Aim at what?

927
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,439
All right, it's aligned.

928
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,497
Rhodey! This is it!
You've only got one chance!

929
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:05,168
Let's do it! Release the
energy of the arc reactor!

930
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:10,976
The Technovores reacted.
Aim for the crack!

931
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:12,922
Careful...

932
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:14,390
All missiles are ready to launch!

933
01:19:14,515 --> 01:19:17,761
Rhodey, we have no
time! You have to shoot!

934
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,487
Do it now! It's our last
chance before the world ends.

935
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:23,389
Shoot!

936
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:25,358
All missiles, armed and ready!

937
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:28,027
Rhodey!

938
01:19:36,403 --> 01:19:39,382
Bear down and shoot!
Everything should work now!

939
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:47,947
Launching!

940
01:19:55,855 --> 01:19:57,355
Tony!

941
01:21:01,154 --> 01:21:04,967
Yeah, the last thing I can
remember is watching the bombs go off.

942
01:21:05,092 --> 01:21:07,136
I guess the Technovores decided
they needed to repair you

943
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:10,606
before they could override your system.

944
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:13,233
And in the process, it looks
to me like they saved your life.

945
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:15,211
That was fortunate.

946
01:21:15,336 --> 01:21:17,480
Now it's your turn to recover!

947
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:19,716
At least you'll be taken care
of by a bunch of hot nurses!

948
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,885
I'm glad you're okay, Tony,

949
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,688
but if you do anything like
that again, I'll kill you myself.

950
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:27,579
I hear you, Pepper. When a child
is bad, you need to scold him.

951
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:32,652
So, you're finally getting it.
You're an obstinate child...

952
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:35,564
... who needs discipline.

953
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:38,935
And it's an adult's
duty to provide that discipline.

954
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,203
Do you hate women who scold?

955
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:44,807
Not really. All boys look
up to authority figures.

956
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:47,682
Especially when they're
as beautiful as you.

957
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:53,617
<i>Don't forget, now.
You promised me a vacation.</i>

958
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,952
<i>Of course. So
where do you want to go?</i>

959
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,052
<i>I'll take some days off, too.</i>

960
01:21:57,177 --> 01:21:58,755
<i> What?</i>

961
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,180
<i>Let's take a vacation.
Just the two of us. How 'bout it?</i>

962
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:05,228
<i>Is that an order, sir?</i>

963
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,287
<i>No. It's more like a suggest.</i>

964
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:14,327
Well then, I suggest you and I pack up.

965
01:22:21,034 --> 01:22:24,314
<i>The insane man shut
up and looked at the audience.</i>

966
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,382
<i>The audience also shut
up and looked at him.</i>

967
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:29,152
He regained consciousness last night.

968
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:31,253
He has a visitor today but there's been

969
01:22:31,378 --> 01:22:33,590
no change. He's still mentally deranged.

970
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:36,792
He finally threw his
light against the ground.

971
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:39,085
The light shattered and died out.

972
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:46,559
This tremendous event is
still on its way, still wandering.

973
01:22:48,127 --> 01:22:52,030
It has not yet reached the ears of men.

974
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:56,735
Deeds, though done, still
require time to be seen and heard.

975
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:01,451
This deed is still
more distant from them

976
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:04,310
than the most distant of stars.

977
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:09,426
Still, they were able to do the deed.

978
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,895
According to the people, this insane man

979
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:19,225
forced his way into various
churches that day singing, "requiem."

980
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:22,729
The wind!
