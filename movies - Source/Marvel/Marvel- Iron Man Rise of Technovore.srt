1
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,278
One must be a sea to receive a polluted stream

2
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,492
without becoming impure.

3
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:20,829
Lo, I teach you the Overman.

4
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:26,043
He is that sea.

5
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:03,037
What's the problem?

6
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,834
Did you drink too much last night?

7
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:23,182
I can hold my liquor much better
than you, servicemen.

8
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,769
That's just the rookies,
and if you're not careful,

9
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:26,895
you might end up like them,

10
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,063
barfing your guts out inside your suit.

11
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,817
Watch and learn!
I'm about to do some

12
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,442
maneuvers only big boys can pull off!

13
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:11,689
You'd better give up and admit defeat, Rhodey!

14
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:16,277
Your War Machine is all about firepower,
not speed. It's too heavy!

15
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,454
You might as well admit it.
You're never going to catch me!

16
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,623
Just watch me!

17
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,097
Gotcha!

18
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,108
You keep forgetting one thing, Tony.

19
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:59,362
It's not just speed that counts here,
I'm an Air Force pilot

20
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,990
with a whole lot of experience.

21
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,408
I have years of training under my belt,

22
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,536
in actual combat conditions!

23
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,538
You're a novice who only just got his license!

24
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,216
No fair, shooting repulsor rays!

25
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,637
You said you were experienced in tactics!
You didn't see that coming?

26
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,192
Imagine if outbreaks of violence,

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,735
murder, and terrorism could all be

28
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,656
detected and prevented
before they ever took place!

29
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,408
It sounds like science-fiction,
but it's not.

30
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,034
We're here to introduce
the new Howard satellite,

31
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,036
developed by Stark Industries.

32
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,040
This technology will enable the
S.H.I.E.L.D. detection program

33
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:54,334
to monitor every event and the full range

34
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:56,502
of human activity, all over the planet.

35
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,298
But there are those who are already

36
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,216
calling it the ultimate spy satellite.

37
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,384
Privacy-rights
advocates have demanded

38
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,012
that Stark Industries scrap its deployment.

39
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,391
Tony Stark responded to those accusations
in his presentation last night...

40
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:22,403
I named this satellite "Howard" after

41
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:29,952
my Dad, who always watched out for me.

42
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:33,165
It's a tribute to him.
And for a particular reason.

43
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,915
He believed in the concept of personal freedom.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,336
The Howard satellite has not been designed
to infringe upon that right.

45
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,504
Instead, it's an all-seeing
eye in the sky with one job,

46
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,673
to identify and prevent trouble before
it occurs, 24 hours a day.

47
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,175
Once it's launched and activated,

48
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,843
it will provide relief to the victims of crime,

49
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,470
and protect countless lives all over the world.

50
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,314
Tony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries,

51
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,524
who is also known as Iron Man,

52
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,442
is claiming the launch of his new satellite

53
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,362
will provide endless benefits
to ordinary citizens...

54
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,281
With many questions unanswered, there is

55
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,617
much anxiety over potential
violations of privacy...

56
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,951
People are wondering whether they're

57
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,120
able to trust this man, who has
a background as a weapons dealer.

58
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,415
There is an undercurrent of anxiety that

59
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,584
the satellite was developed for some

60
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:21,088
secret purpose.
There are those who say there is

61
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,713
great danger in putting all of
our faith in technology.

62
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,298
Who will be in control, man or machine?

63
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,052
Here comes Tony Stark in his Iron Man armor,

64
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,512
and Colonel James Rhodes,
flying his War Machine!

65
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,098
Obviously, they are
both here to reassure the public.

66
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,189
Glad you're still alive.

67
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,606
Not as much as me.

68
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,608
Who the hell are these guys?

69
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,776
They're targeting the Howard.

70
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,029
I've run into these bastards before.

71
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,033
They're armored mercenaries who call
themselves the "Raiders."

72
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,286
They must be paranoid that we're gonna be
able to track their activities.

73
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,165
They're jamming the radio waves!

74
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,550
Data interrupt!
We've lost communications!

75
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,721
Scramble our lnterceptors
and get them out there.

76
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,956
Rhodey! Great work!

77
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:42,437
It's time for us to have
a little chat, my friend.

78
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,606
If you answer nicely,
you might survive this interview.

79
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,567
You'll be in prison, but at least
you'll still be alive.

80
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,530
Am I supposed to be scared?
My boss is more powerful than you.

81
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,450
He's far surpassed your capabilities.

82
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:08,547
He's that good, is he?
Maybe I can find a job for him in my company.

83
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,633
We'd have to settle a few things first,
like a claim for damages.

84
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,427
We've only just begun.

85
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:21,350
My boss is going to smash
your satellite into pieces before

86
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:24,729
you have a chance to play with it!

87
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:31,318
If he's that powerful,
why is he so afraid to show himself?

88
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,697
Oh, he's here.

89
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,038
Rhodey!

90
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,664
Take care of this guy, will you?

91
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Hey!

92
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:20,951
Have all staff except necessary
personnel evacuate immediately!

93
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,453
We're about to launch the satellite!

94
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,955
Yes, sir!

95
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:28,668
Who's there?
Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!

96
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:49,980
Fuel update!

97
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,231
Complete, sir!

98
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,399
Launch pad status!

99
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,525
Ready to go!

100
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,154
Fire flow complete!

101
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,405
Countdown continuing.

102
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,823
25...24...23...
22...21...20... 19...

103
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,116
Wind speed, eight miles per hour!

104
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,494
Purging energy supply pipe!

105
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,203
- All systems are green!
- Acknowledged!

106
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,371
Good morning.

107
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,789
Huh?

108
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,669
And goodbye.

109
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,048
Huh? What the heck?

110
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:19,510
Unknown phenomenon.
No reference in the database.

111
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,429
Possible presence of erosive biological cells.

112
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,126
No one escapes.

113
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,056
I won't let you do it!

114
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,578
Power is down.
Energy reserves at 55%.

115
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,043
Who is this guy?

116
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,296
Insufficient data.
Genome DNA extract impossible.

117
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,380
Cannot read base sequence.

118
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,009
Unknown gene region.

119
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,094
Centrifuge is required to continue analysis.

120
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,682
You must be some kind of monster!

121
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,394
How could you sacrifice so many lives
for a single satellite?

122
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:38,066
Hey, you! Say something!

123
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:45,280
The leaders of all fascist companies
appear to have similar eyes.

124
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,461
The eyes of smartass kids also seem the same.

125
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:02,506
People who place their faith in
high-technology, like you,

126
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,717
should be placed in museums
with the rest of the fossils.

127
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,389
Actually, coffins would be better.

128
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,725
And kids who are all mouth, like you,

129
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:15,269
should be sent to the Stark School
of Re-Education.

130
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,772
I am Ezekiel.

131
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,692
Ezekiel?

132
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,697
I promise you, I will be dancing

133
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,698
around your coffin as they
drive in the final nail.

134
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:32,036
I will then hold a wake in
the offbeat style you so favor.

135
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,501
I'm not done with you yet!

136
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,171
Goodbye.

137
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:56,144
Shoot! What the hell is this?

138
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:58,395
Tony, where are you?

139
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:05,320
What happened down here?
What's going on in this place?

140
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,322
I'm done on my end!

141
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,576
Tony, are you down here somewhere?

142
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,327
Don't come any further!
What? Are you in trouble?

143
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:17,414
What's that? Tony!

144
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,010
I don't believe this.

145
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,307
The control tower's gone!

146
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:48,779
Any signs of life?

147
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,072
I'm afraid not.

148
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,618
Wait! I see some movement
down in the rubble!

149
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,245
It's Tony Stark!
He made it out, sir!

150
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,331
Iron Man is alive!

151
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:01,875
Send Black Widow to pick him up!

152
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,169
And hurry! We need to
debrief him immediately!

153
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,731
Come on!
Where are you, Rhodey?

154
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:32,907
Come on! You've got to be here somewhere!
I'll find you,

155
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,369
no matter how long it takes!
If you're alive, answer me!

156
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:42,875
Natasha!
Help me find Rhodey! Please!

157
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:50,424
Stark! There's no time to waste,
we have to get out of here.

158
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,802
Fury has ordered me to escort you
to the helicarrier.

159
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:06,982
The medical team will continue
to search for survivors,

160
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,569
but casualties are expected to rise
to more than 300 people.

161
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:21,622
Nick! Rhodey died!
Right in front of me!

162
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,459
And so did a lot of other people.

163
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,211
Who the hell were these guys?

164
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,547
All their signals were blocked

165
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,632
by a very powerful electromagnetic field.

166
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:36,971
I was hoping you could give us some guidance.

167
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,352
He was a smartass kid.

168
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,647
His armor was weird.
It was very advanced,

169
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,026
I'll tell you that is something
I've never seen before.

170
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:51,986
It was techno bio-organic matter,

171
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,738
combined with manmade mechanisms!

172
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,323
Techno bio-organic armor?

173
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,785
I'm gonna find that guy.
And when I do,

174
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:01,328
I'm gonna make him pay for Rhodey!

175
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,917
Nick! What's going on here?
What are you up to?

176
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,920
You're not leaving this complex, Stark.

177
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:11,380
Not until S.H.I.E.L.D.
has worked out exactly what's going on.

178
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,382
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with this?

179
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,175
We have more questions.

180
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:18,136
What happened just now
is being broadcast everywhere.

181
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:19,971
It's being played out on every news channel

182
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,807
on every television across the planet.

183
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:23,351
If we don't provide an explanation

184
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:26,229
some high-up heads at the Pentagon
are going to roll.

185
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,607
Just routine procedure, of course.
Business as usual.

186
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,693
They have enough heads.
Believe me, they can afford to lose a few.

187
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,695
That's not the most important thing now.

188
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,656
We need to get hold of that kid before

189
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,367
he causes any more damage.
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do!

190
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:45,789
Go after him.

191
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,356
Nick! Will you call
off your pit-bull?

192
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,823
For God's sake!
I don't have time to mess around!

193
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,324
That's too bad.

194
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,164
I'm the only one who has a chance

195
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,000
against that
smart-ass kid's technology!

196
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,667
You probably won't believe it,

197
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,753
but I'm telling you the truth,
I'm not enjoying this one bit.

198
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,256
There are rules.

199
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:38,509
And whether you like it or not,
I happen to be duty-bound to obey them.

200
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,430
There'll be hell to pay if I let
our only witness get himself killed.

201
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:45,223
You government workers sure have a tough job.

202
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:54,357
Homing missiles locked on and tracking.

203
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,402
Thanks a lot for the update!

204
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,090
Wanna play?

205
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,155
Commander, he's gone!
We've lost him!

206
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,332
Natasha?

207
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,944
Sorry, Natasha.

208
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,836
Stark!

209
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,548
I need to teach that kid
the greatness of technology.

210
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,843
I'm going to have to find out
where its weaknesses are.

211
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,797
How's the art coming?

212
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,176
I'm still working on it.

213
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,431
I love art, but I don't
intend to become an artist.

214
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:33,142
After all this time playing around,

215
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,145
I realize I don't have the talent
for it like my uncle.

216
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,483
You shouldn't give up in frustration.
Your body has the DNA for it.

217
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,865
There's something I've finally come to realize.

218
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,367
Even with talent, you need chaos

219
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,787
to give birth to a dancing star.

220
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,997
I'm not sure I have it.

221
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,625
Someday, man will no
longer give birth to any star.

222
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:04,382
By the way, I see they managed to launch
the satellite after all.

223
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:06,549
The Raiders couldn't control

224
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,176
the reinforced functions I gave them.

225
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,221
However, it's still early in the game.

226
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,057
I'll be preparing another offensive.

227
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,976
Tony Stark.

228
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,979
Tony Stark.

229
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,817
He seems to be in possession of

230
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,986
a wide range of technological icons.

231
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,615
And one of the high-tech graven images
these people

232
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,492
place on an altar to worship,
is his new satellite.

233
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:34,744
He's the high priest of technology.

234
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,122
Yes.

235
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:39,500
But it's a conceited and foolish
misunderstanding.

236
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,251
Technology and the people who give birth

237
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,752
to it are nothing more than false idols,

238
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:45,463
leading society to disaster.

239
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,855
It's a tiresome task.
But these people must be taught the truth.

240
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:44,147
Huh?

241
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:58,996
I need your help!

242
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,624
Excuse me?

243
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,250
Check the black market
for bio-related products.

244
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,089
You promised me a full week's vacation!

245
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,842
And anyway, aren't you supposed to be in Utah

246
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:14,803
for the launch of that new
satellite you developed?

247
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,847
I'll make it up to you, Pepper.

248
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,349
I'll tell you what.
This year, you can

249
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:20,851
have the villa and a whole support staff.

250
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:23,311
Thanks, but you already gave me that to

251
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,355
make up for losing last year's vacation.

252
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,398
I did?
Okay, then how about I rent you

253
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:31,362
an entire village or something?
Please, Pepper. It's urgent.

254
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,031
What's going on here?

255
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,450
I'll tell you inside.

256
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,955
How long is it before the Howard goes online?

257
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,500
Everything should be active within four hours.

258
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,001
We're going to use
that satellite to find its maker.

259
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:54,134
As of now, priority one is capturing
the fugitive Iron Man.

260
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,304
Poor Rhodey.
I can't believe it.

261
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,848
I can't believe he was such an idiot for

262
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,894
letting that kid get him.
I could've taken care of myself.

263
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,980
He didn't need to come looking for me.

264
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,856
You're saying the killer was a child?

265
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,901
Yeah, some know-it-all kid!

266
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,028
There was something about him, though,
that was very intriguing.

267
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,490
The bottom line is,
if he was able to create a technology

268
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,827
that I've never seen or heard of before,
he deserves a little respect.

269
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,205
His sense of design isn't really my cup of tea.

270
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:26,709
But his results are.

271
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,213
As you know, I've dealt with some
shady vendors in the past.

272
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:35,300
But Rhodey was the exact opposite.

273
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,552
He was a straight arrow.
All the time

274
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:39,305
I knew him, he never broke the rules

275
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:43,892
or left the straight
and narrow. I admired him.

276
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,394
He really believed in the dream.

277
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,271
Rhodey was a government worker
and a normal person.

278
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:50,023
I'm nothing but a rich genius.

279
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,442
The worlds we lived in were so different,

280
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:54,903
it's amazing we got along at all.

281
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,197
He was a good friend,

282
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:02,452
but I'm not sad about it.
I'm fine, really.

283
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,248
It's a shame, though,
that I lost someone to race against.

284
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,627
I guess I should have let him win
some of the times.

285
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:12,462
Tony.

286
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:18,134
That suit was made of technology
I've never seen before.

287
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:24,266
Nanotechnology? Biotechnology?
No.

288
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,894
It was nowhere near as simple as that.

289
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,564
He had inserted the integral DNA
of living organisms

290
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:34,067
into a material based on the functions
of a human body.

291
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,528
It couldn't be done in
a normal research facility.

292
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,907
Could he somehow be using mutated cells?
No!

293
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:43,911
He's synthesizing them in a molecule assembler!

294
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,704
If not, it wouldn't be stable.

295
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,583
Tony. I need you
to authorize access.

296
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,125
Stark, vocal authorization.

297
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,758
Nanomachines, nanotechnology.
Here's something on human-mech hybrids.

298
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,928
There's research being done all over the world,

299
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:04,932
but no one has announced
a practical application.

300
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:07,142
I haven't heard of any successes, either.

301
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,060
But I have to believe my own eyes.

302
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:10,938
What I saw was a definite breakthrough.

303
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:13,981
It merged biotechnology and mechatronics.

304
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:18,362
Customized artificial neurons were
working in conjunction

305
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:21,699
with the human nervous system.
He was controlling them perfectly.

306
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,952
A.I.M!
It's a company called Advanced Idea Mechanics

307
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,788
and they're the largest
supplier in the black market.

308
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,709
They've been researching
biotechnological hybrid armors

309
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,794
for a long time, in secret.

310
00:28:34,336 --> 00:28:36,380
In recent years, they've continuously

311
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:38,464
invested vast amounts of capital.

312
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,719
Does your data indicate where their
research facility is located?

313
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:43,636
Let me see.

314
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:47,307
Karachi, Pakistan!
There's a secret lab there!

315
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,059
The facility is being fronted

316
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,894
as a warehouse for medical supplies.

317
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,230
But actually, they're involved with

318
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,400
chemical warfare research and the sales

319
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:57,901
of illegal weapons.

320
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,403
I've downloaded map coordinates

321
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,863
in case you plan to pay them a visit.

322
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:09,413
Thanks, Pepper.
You can return to your vacation now.

323
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,080
Are you going to be okay on your own?

324
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:15,001
A kid misbehaved.
An adult needs to discipline him.

325
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:20,298
You're a kid yourself, Tony,
an obstinate, stubborn kid.

326
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,635
Are you going to scold me, Pepper?

327
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,267
Why do you keep putting me in that position?

328
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,854
I don't want to be the only adult
in this relationship.

329
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,108
It's intriguing, though.
I find I'm drawn to more mature women.

330
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,862
Especially when they're beautiful.

331
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,076
Darn it.

332
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,954
Tony.

333
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:57,961
Iron Man is not responding.
All signals are being blocked.

334
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,713
Damn it! Teams Blue and Gold,
cover all escape routes!

335
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,051
Team Red, move in on my
command. Capture and contain!

336
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,471
It's S.H.I.E.L.D.
What did you do this time?

337
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,097
Something awful, I imagine.

338
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,067
I suppose it's too late to apologize.

339
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,387
Confirming
as our target, Mr. Tony Stark.

340
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:52,140
Checking profile.

341
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:57,395
Target identified.

342
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:02,276
Mr. Stark, please throw away your weapons
and surrender immediately.

343
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:06,654
Please comply.

344
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,201
Please comply.
You can leave your belongings with us.

345
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,871
Please comply.

346
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:20,794
You can leave your belongings with us.

347
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:22,671
Sorry, Nick.

348
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,343
I don't have time to waste right now.

349
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:30,929
I'll pay for the damages.
I have to go.

350
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:32,806
Fire.

351
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:11,845
There goes my vacation.
Predictable.

352
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,727
Don't you ever knock

353
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,480
before you enter a room?

354
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:30,589
All Mandroids have lost position of Iron Man.

355
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,261
Visual monitors are disabled.
Switching to motion sensors.

356
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,115
Hey, boys, I'd love to keep playing.

357
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,992
But I think it's time to excuse myself.

358
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:56,592
Sorry, Nick, but I had to do
what I thought was necessary.

359
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,929
I think you need to improve
the A-One on the Mandroids.

360
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,472
After facing off with them, I have to say,

361
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:03,016
they seem a little vulnerable to me!

362
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,989
All Mandroids have been annihilated.

363
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,911
Get me special agents Barton and Romanova.

364
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:24,704
Right away, sir.

365
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:31,085
So, Miss Potts.
Is your boss free any time in the near future?

366
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:34,965
I'm afraid he's fully booked
for the next three years or so.

367
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:38,885
Of course. Being Tony Stark,
he never follows his schedule.

368
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,721
Then he blames me
when he misses his appointments.

369
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:44,141
There's something I want to show you.

370
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:46,101
I was trying to tell your crazy boss about this,

371
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:49,521
but he appears to be
blocking all communications.

372
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:55,360
One day he's going to
go off half-cocked,

373
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,695
and run into something
unexpected he can't handle.

374
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:45,076
They herald the coming
of the lightning, and perish as heralds.

375
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,873
Lo.
Lo.

376
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,041
I am a herald of the lightning.

377
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,208
I am a herald of the lightning.

378
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,590
I feel good today.

379
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,021
It's so beautiful.

380
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:16,106
With the Technovores, I will have great power.

381
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,235
I will be able to control any machine,

382
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,447
using the interface built into this armor.

383
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:31,664
So. Are you ready to go?

384
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:38,255
Yes. I will now be able to infect
the satellite and bring it down.

385
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,298
We will grind these oppressors
and their techno gods to dust.

386
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,592
It's up to you, however,

387
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,387
as to where you want to use it.

388
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:30,639
Obviously.

389
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,731
Excellent.
We have a deal, my friend.

390
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,567
Tell your associates
A.I.M. says hello.

391
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,987
What's wrong?

392
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,958
shooot! It's the Punisher!
How did he track me?

393
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,802
We're being blown to bits over here!

394
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,262
You need to send reinforcements right away!

395
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:12,514
What do you mean, 10 minutes?
Nobody's gonna be alive here in 10 minutes!

396
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,976
We need them in 10 seconds!

397
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,701
What do you think you're doing?

398
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,621
Let me handle this, Punisher.

399
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,164
I don't need help from a company president

400
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:38,625
who can't stay out of the limelight.

401
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:41,628
These guys are scum.

402
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,713
They don't deserve to live.

403
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:49,052
Punisher, I don't disagree with your feelings.

404
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,512
But I need some answers before you wipe 'em out.

405
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,599
I have all the answers I need.
Get out of the way.

406
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:58,143
If you shoot, I'll blast you from here to Tokyo!

407
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:08,320
Fine, go ahead.

408
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,114
I appreciate it.
All right. Let's get

409
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,909
this over with while
Punisher's still in a good mood.

410
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,161
I need to know about the men who hired you.

411
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,081
Do you think an A.I.M.
man would give up

412
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,916
the identity of his clients?

413
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,251
Come on, Stark!
You of all people

414
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:24,086
should know what would happen
if I were to do that!

415
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,465
Let me guess.
You'd never be able to do business again.

416
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,175
Permanently!

417
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:33,262
I figured.
But thanks for the directory anyway.

418
00:40:36,182 --> 00:40:37,349
Nice work.

419
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:45,108
So, neo-terrorists.
Techno-organisms, buyers of body armor.

420
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,485
Let's see who you've been dealing with.

421
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:51,864
Ezekiel?

422
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:57,829
Ezekiel. Wait a minute!
I know that name!

423
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:00,706
But I've got a dossier on him,
if it's any use to you.

424
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:02,125
You're sure about that?

425
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,208
I remember that name, too.

426
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,586
As a friend, you'd let me read that dossier?

427
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,630
Huh! Now you're a friend?

428
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,757
The same friend who threatened to blast me
from here to Tokyo?

429
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,677
I guess our job is done.
Let's get out of here.

430
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:31,820
How can you drink this coffee?
It's like sludge.

431
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,197
It's military issue.

432
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,159
Drinking it at night in the jungle
used to calm me down.

433
00:41:36,242 --> 00:41:39,536
Actually this place kind of
reminds me of a jungle.

434
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,164
Here's the file. I found it.

435
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:50,255
Ezekiel Stane...
Stane! Wait!

436
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:52,675
Obadiah Stane's son?

437
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,677
That would be pretty disgusting.

438
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:58,306
This nutcase turns out to be
the son of your old partner?

439
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,643
Obadiah went crazy.
I had no choice at the time.

440
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:04,811
I had to kill him.

441
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:10,275
Are you telling me he's that Ezekiel Stane?

442
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:13,487
But he's supposed to have died
in an aircraft accident!

443
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:15,364
At the age of 16!

444
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,286
His father had a lot of assets
hidden around the world.

445
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,623
Having inherited all that,
I'm sure a clever kid like him

446
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,166
would know how to put it to very good use.

447
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:28,418
Nowadays, a little cash
can make the impossible possible.

448
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:30,672
You're right.
There's no denying that.

449
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,675
Looks to me like this kid has been

450
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,802
burying his trail for a lot of years.

451
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:40,222
And now he shows up in the form of
a sociopathic super-genius.

452
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:42,141
There are rumors he injected his brain

453
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,018
with nanobots to make himself smarter
than he already was.

454
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,230
According to this, he's involved in

455
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:49,398
a wide range of shady research.

456
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,568
From synthetic drugs to nanotechnology.

457
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,945
One of his interests
is techno-organic armor.

458
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:56,530
What a surprise.

459
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:58,782
He won't be an easy opponent to handle.

460
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,034
I've been after him for six months

461
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,661
and I haven't been able to pin him down.

462
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,246
Let me try something.

463
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,706
What are you looking for?

464
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,543
I'm hacking directly into the S.H.I.E.L.D. network.
I figure if

465
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,213
I cross-reference your dossier
with the data in the network

466
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,215
I might be able to find out where he is.

467
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,800
Computer geeks are something else.

468
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,847
Thirty miles to Karachi.

469
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,018
Log note, I'm briefing Agent Natasha

470
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,936
Romanova, and Agent Clint Barton.

471
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,605
Here's the update, it's been confirmed that

472
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:30,273
Stark has joined forces with Frank Castle,

473
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:31,898
known as "The Punisher."

474
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:34,735
That weapon-crazy lunatic?

475
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:37,362
Although I hear he's not very good
with a bow and arrow.

476
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:38,739
I want to get out of this country as

477
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,074
quickly as possible.
If it's discovered

478
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,659
that we're violating the airspace
of a sovereign nation,

479
00:43:42,744 --> 00:43:44,411
it'll cause an international incident.

480
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:46,789
You have 40 minutes to complete

481
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:48,333
the mission and get back to the ship.

482
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,255
Shanghai?

483
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:58,760
I don't get it.
What would he know about a place like that?

484
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,887
We had a weapons research center there,

485
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,472
until I decided to close it down
a few years ago.

486
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:06,643
Then someone bought the property
and built a luxury hotel there

487
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:08,853
with a penthouse suite for wealthy VIPs.

488
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,148
The hotel's privacy is as tight as a Swiss bank.

489
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:15,860
The land itself was apparently purchased
by Obadiah Stane.

490
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:18,737
You see how effective
a little bit of cash can be?

491
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:21,907
Thanks for everything, Frank.
The next time I come,

492
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,744
I'm gonna bring you a bag
of the best coffee in the world.

493
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,788
Hello, we've got company!

494
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:30,083
Oh, boy! I knew
they'd come, sooner or later.

495
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:33,418
They sure seem to have
a lot of time on their hands.

496
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,170
See you.

497
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:38,173
Wait!

498
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:44,429
There is an object approaching from behind.

499
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:46,014
Is it a missile?

500
00:44:46,557 --> 00:44:47,599
Negative.

501
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,775
Bulls-eye!

502
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,530
Some freakin' arrows caused this much damage?

503
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,780
Conducting system check.

504
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,742
So glad I installed a protective force field.

505
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,246
Give up, Stark, and come with us
to see the Director.

506
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,998
You really think he's going to
come along willingly?

507
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:16,003
System interrupt.
Initiating forced shutdown.

508
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,963
Hold on, wait a minute!

509
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:21,967
Stop fighting.
There's no way you can get loose.

510
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,971
You might as well accept it.
The game's over, buddy.
We're taking you in.

511
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:28,349
Listen, Stark!
In the helicarrier's medical bay is...

512
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,148
Watch out! You're not
too good at this, Stark!

513
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,900
Crap, he's getting away!

514
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:48,077
Tell me something.
Are you trying to be as obvious as you can?

515
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,996
What do you mean, Stark?
I thought you liked the attention.

516
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,916
Not when I look like five miles of bad road!

517
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:57,128
Well then, hang on, buddy!

518
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:00,840
What's your problem, mister?

519
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:23,862
It's over, Stark!

520
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:26,740
If you join forces with a crazed
vigilante killer,

521
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,202
no-one's gonna take you seriously
as a hero, buddy!

522
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,661
That son of a gun!

523
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,422
Don't do it, Frank!
They're just following orders!

524
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm not trying to kill them!

525
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,385
I just want them to know we're not
about to surrender!

526
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:51,516
shooot!

527
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,518
You ready?
Leave it to me!

528
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:03,485
Bingo!

529
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,876
All right, guys!

530
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:21,336
If you don't want to get hurt any further,

531
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,713
you'd better come out!

532
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:29,262
We hear you. But before we do,

533
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,764
here's a little gift!

534
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
You bastard!

535
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,320
Thanks for the compliment.

536
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:48,447
Now throw down your weapons
and raise your hands!

537
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:50,282
Did you hear me?

538
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,914
Good girl.

539
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:57,998
You, too!

540
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:03,253
Fine. You jerk.
Don't think you're gonna get away with this.

541
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,882
Bunch of bleeding-heart
S.H.I.E.L.D. weaklings!

542
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:08,300
If you disrespect me again, I'll...

543
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,432
If you don't want a tunnel bored in your head,

544
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:16,976
throw your guns away!

545
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,481
Whatever. I don't
need them now, anyway.

546
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,112
I guess I was able to buy enough time.

547
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,161
Power reserves now recovered to 40%.

548
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:39,873
Good, now go ahead and re-route
force field reserves to thrusters.

549
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,041
Affirmative.

550
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,251
Come back here!

551
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,552
It's no use.
Your arrows won't reach him.

552
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,512
Darn it!

553
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:03,856
Power reserves fully recovered.
All systems are now optimal.

554
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:05,023
I've wasted too much time.

555
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:12,782
I can already hear the boss
dismissing us, sarcastically.

556
00:49:12,865 --> 00:49:16,369
Yeah. It makes me want to bore
a hole into my own head.

557
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,043
You owe me, Stark.

558
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:28,380
Payback won't be cheap.

559
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,623
I hear a soft breeze.

560
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,713
And that wind gathers another soft wind.

561
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,717
I can sense our destiny.
We come together with that wind.

562
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,177
Listen carefully, Sasha.

563
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,431
Can you hear it, as well?

564
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:29,275
Jarvis, have you got anything?

565
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,777
Readings are unclear.
There's interference.

566
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,820
Wait, there is a slight reaction.

567
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:35,989
It could well be a living organism.

568
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:38,284
That doesn't help me much.

569
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:50,588
Hey, boy! I came to see you.
Why don't you turn the lights on for me?

570
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,632
When I was young, I played hide and seek.

571
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,594
I hid in the dark garage for so long,
I fell asleep.

572
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:58,887
After a while, my mom, Maria, came

573
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,139
to look for me.
She was worried sick.

574
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,224
Did your parents do the same for you?

575
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:04,934
I've never played hide and seek.

576
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:06,978
Five meters behind you, the air shifted.

577
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,981
And the room temperature changed slightly.

578
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:14,402
Where did you come from?
Did you use magic?

579
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,739
My mom was very upset by my behavior.
I worried her

580
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,909
with my appearances and disappearances.

581
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:22,077
If you keep this up,
your Mom will get upset, too.

582
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,164
Or your Dad, if he's still around.

583
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:31,336
I don't hide from anyone.
You're simply not looking in the right place.

584
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,880
Really?
This is starting to feel

585
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,340
more and more like a kid's game to me.

586
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:41,554
I told you before,
I've never played hide and seek.

587
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:45,851
And my Dad that you speak of,
I suspect you know who he is.

588
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:52,315
You might as well say his name.

589
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:55,735
Obadiah!

590
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,028
That is correct.

591
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,074
He can summon up a hologram, just like that!

592
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,619
You want revenge?

593
00:52:03,702 --> 00:52:06,831
Revenge?
Why would I want that?

594
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:10,166
Because I killed him.
You knew that.

595
00:52:10,668 --> 00:52:14,922
Wait, that's right.
You were involved, weren't you?
I remember now.

596
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,215
You'd forgotten that?

597
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,387
It wasn't as important an event in my
life as you might imagine.

598
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,099
We weren't actually that close.

599
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,768
Then why are you targeting me?

600
00:52:31,438 --> 00:52:33,481
Don't be so conceited.
What?

601
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,318
I wasn't targeting you specifically.

602
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:38,570
It's just that you were standing in my way.

603
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,574
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

604
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,744
But he killed Rhodey.

605
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:50,123
Even if it was just a prank,
some things cannot be forgiven!

606
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,592
Rapid power decrease.
System error detected.

607
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,344
What's going on?

608
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,804
Synthetic alloys and unknown biological entities

609
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,181
have invaded the system.

610
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:06,472
Technovores.

611
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:08,516
Power source and all sensors
have been compromised.

612
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:09,768
Technovores?

613
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:14,440
This armor is pretty well made.

614
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,483
Who do you think made it?

615
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:19,737
I'm impressed.
For someone like you, it's good.

616
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,032
I realize you can't move.

617
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:25,867
But believe me, Sasha will still be impressed.

618
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:26,952
Sasha?

619
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,083
This must be your pride and joy.
The arc reactor.

620
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,135
Don't you have anything to say?

621
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,639
Like how you think Tony Stark is a genius?

622
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,356
I must say, it's very well made.
For you people, that is.

623
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,067
What does that mean "you people"?
I'll have you know...

624
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,235
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit,

625
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,612
and as a result, they were expelled
from the Garden of Eden.

626
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:08,534
And 160,000 years ago in Africa,
Mitochondrial Eve was born.

627
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:10,829
The ancestor of humankind.

628
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,541
Very impressive.
Did you study the history of mankind in college?

629
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:18,003
Now there are over
seven billion people on Earth.

630
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,630
What does that have to do with anything?

631
00:54:19,713 --> 00:54:22,507
You asked what I meant when I said
"you people."

632
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,344
That's what I was referring to.

633
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:30,266
You talk as though you're not
a part of the human race.

634
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:32,351
That's exactly how I feel.

635
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,688
I think I'm different from the rest of you.

636
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:37,606
Then what are you?

637
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,565
It's somewhat hard to describe, really.

638
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,987
But if I were forced to explain it in words,

639
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,905
I guess I would be a breeze.

640
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,911
A breeze?
I'm a little confused, can you elaborate on that?

641
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,246
Sasha would also be a breeze.

642
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,333
Who is this "Sasha" you keep referring to?
A girlfriend?

643
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,793
A gentle breeze that caresses your skin.

644
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,170
And ruffles up the grass and trees.

645
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,967
I see.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

646
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,427
But I'm beginning to understand one thing.

647
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:09,471
Obadiah wasn't a very attentive father.

648
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,891
He let you get lost in a world of dreams.

649
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,643
You represent the dinosaurs of the past.

650
00:55:15,728 --> 00:55:17,730
I, however, represent the future.

651
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,148
Dinosaurs of the past?

652
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:24,277
You should consider retirement.

653
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,284
That sounds pretty good to me.
I could relax in a nice, quiet place.

654
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,829
In fact, I actually tried that once.

655
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:36,748
But my personal assistant just won't let me.

656
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,625
This time, I'm afraid I'll have to override her.

657
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:43,922
You'll retire for sure.
You understand the situation, don't you?

658
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:48,344
New wind, new future.
A brand new world is created

659
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:50,929
to go with the brand new future.

660
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,514
A completely new technology will be created.

661
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:56,601
The old will die out, and the new will be born.

662
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,815
That is the providence of nature.

663
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,152
A superior technology to that of man.

664
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:09,447
Howard will be the whistling arrow
that announces the new reality.

665
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:14,619
You should be honored.
The wind that follows is going to blow away

666
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,039
your most advanced technology.

667
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,291
Howard will be the shot that leads the way.

668
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:29,050
Hey. Obadiah was lucky he didn't hang around
long enough to see this.

669
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:34,014
New technology, you say?
Technovores, you called it?

670
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:35,849
Don't make me laugh.

671
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,268
The birth of mankind.
Refinement of steel.

672
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:44,942
Computers, biotechnology.
The things you call old technology

673
00:56:45,025 --> 00:56:48,612
have all been linked and accumulated
to create your "technovore."

674
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:01,625
It's not new at all.

675
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,588
The truth is, it's only been born and exists
because of the past.

676
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:13,052
You think you represent
a brand new form of existence?

677
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:17,599
You're mistaken, kid.
You're no more advanced than the rest of us.

678
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:19,518
You were born from human parents.

679
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:22,353
So?

680
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:27,568
You're just a petulant child
throwing temper tantrums.

681
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,527
And just like a child, if you've been bad,

682
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,612
it's an adult's responsibility to correct you.

683
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,282
You would do that?

684
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,244
I don't think so.
Be quiet for a second.

685
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,472
Part of the system has been restored.

686
00:57:57,097 --> 00:57:59,766
Where? Search for
the area that's functional!

687
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:02,894
The missile!

688
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,980
Locked on target.

689
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:11,987
Foolish man.

690
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,532
Do you know what will be written
on the brass plate

691
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,742
that gets installed on your
exhibit in the museum?

692
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,079
"Here lies
a fragment of Iron Man."

693
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:30,672
But only if someone is able to identify

694
00:58:30,797 --> 00:58:33,257
those fragments after I blow you up.

695
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,429
You spoilt kid.

696
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:41,474
I don't want to put the curators of

697
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,434
the museum to that much trouble!

698
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,478
Perhaps if we had had more time,

699
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,438
I could have taught you a few things.

700
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,233
Well, it's time for goodbye, Tony Stark.

701
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,902
There's still quite a bit of work to do.

702
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,251
What's wrong, boy?

703
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:14,132
Invading technovore now being removed.

704
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,592
Restarting system, restoring circuits.

705
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:20,972
Energy charge in three, two, one, complete.

706
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:24,226
What's the matter, boy?
You look like you're in trouble.

707
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:27,228
Do you need the hand of an adult?

708
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,818
I don't believe I do.
The future is full of uncertain elements.

709
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:36,572
It's okay for a child to rely on adults.

710
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,449
Send energy to the reactor!
Force field deployed!

711
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,594
Hey, where did you go, boy?
Hide and seek time is over!

712
01:00:14,985 --> 01:00:18,195
You went too quickly.

713
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,871
You can't break me...

714
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,293
And you're unable to change the future

715
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:35,630
because that timeline's already written.

716
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:43,554
It's a blessing your father's not here
to witness this all play out.

717
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:45,222
That's enough, Stark!

718
01:00:46,516 --> 01:00:48,893
It took long enough
but we finally caught up with you!

719
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:51,021
You're coming in with us to see the Director

720
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,731
or I'm gonna add an extra hole in your head!

721
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,025
All right, William Tell.
You made your point.

722
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,735
I'll go, but only if she takes me in.

723
01:01:18,548 --> 01:01:20,759
You only got 98 on your test?

724
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,179
Without a perfect score,
you're the same as the other idiots!

725
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:28,474
Go to your room and reflect on your
shortcomings until dinner.

726
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:32,269
I thought you were much better than this!
You're a disappointment!

727
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,443
Did you listen to me?
I told you never to touch my Monger!

728
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,197
You little fool!
This Monger is worth 10 times as much as you!

729
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:03,969
My God!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

730
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,179
Rhodey survived that attack?
Has he woken up at all?

731
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,181
He's being kept alive
by the life-support system

732
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,599
but so far we haven't seen...

733
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,476
Hey, Rhodey!
Rhodey, can you hear me?

734
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:14,855
If you don't wake up you're gonna die a loser!

735
01:02:14,938 --> 01:02:17,690
You can't die without beating me
in a race at least once!

736
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,568
That would be shameful!
Tony...

737
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:21,152
Wait a minute! How 'bout this?

738
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:25,782
If you wake up,
I'll concede the next race to you!

739
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:27,826
I'll introduce you to a beautiful woman, too!

740
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,036
You just tell me which model on which page

741
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,121
of that magazine you were looking at!

742
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,541
Anyone at all!
Except the girl on page 10.

743
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,876
I've got dibs on her.
Just don't tell Pepper!

744
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,795
Other than that, anybody you want!

745
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,715
Hmm?

746
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,217
All stations!
An unknown program is hacking into our system!

747
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:46,927
Shutting off communications!

748
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:48,304
Starting antivirus program!

749
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:51,349
Initiating defense protocols!
How are the main servers?

750
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,480
We can't stop it.

751
01:02:56,563 --> 01:03:00,065
Someone breached our security
and is invading our systems.

752
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:01,735
Technovores.

753
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:05,112
Ezekiel's Technovores are the invaders.

754
01:03:05,197 --> 01:03:06,739
What?

755
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:11,452
I'm sure the servers have been taken over by now.
It's too late.

756
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,039
Damn it!

757
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:33,724
He's gone!
Where did he go?

758
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,436
The Howard is under attack!

759
01:03:38,188 --> 01:03:39,606
What's happening?

760
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:42,192
Initiate Guardian program!

761
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,903
It won't start!
The firewall is about to be breached!

762
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,030
If we don't do something immediately,

763
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:49,740
all the systems in Howard will be taken over!

764
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,621
I'm right here.
Look around for me.

765
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,342
My, my.

766
01:04:07,425 --> 01:04:10,637
You're not very observant.
I'm right beside you.

767
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:27,987
Above us!

768
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:36,746
Are you okay?

769
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,425
Yeah, here's the problem.

770
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,719
Howard has the power to access
every computer in the world.

771
01:04:52,012 --> 01:04:53,179
Including military satellites.

772
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:56,266
Exactly.
He's planning to make Howard

773
01:04:56,349 --> 01:04:57,766
the source to hack into the world's

774
01:04:57,851 --> 01:04:59,226
military satellites and control them.

775
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,855
Ezekiel called that the wind.

776
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,106
The wind?

777
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,983
He's planning to wipe out
everything that lives on this planet!

778
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:12,197
What happened to the server room?

779
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:13,992
I haven't been able to get a response.

780
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:16,827
Hmm.

781
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,331
Mmm?

782
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,460
Stark!
What are you planning to do?

783
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:26,170
I'm going to fix the computer so we can use it.

784
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:29,340
If I can divert the power of the arc reactor
and aim it at the Technovores,

785
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,884
I can annihilate them.

786
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,052
I'm pretty sure I can survive for five minutes

787
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,721
without this old heart of mine.

788
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,097
After that,

789
01:05:37,974 --> 01:05:40,976
I guess it's straight to heaven!

790
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:50,027
I can't tell the situation from here.
What do you want to do?

791
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,697
I guess we should return to the bridge.

792
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:01,039
Ezekiel is definitely coming here to target us.

793
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:05,376
Warning! Warning!
Power reserves decreasing rapidly!

794
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,880
Ezekiel!

795
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,590
He's here!

796
01:06:18,556 --> 01:06:21,101
Hi there, "Old Man" Tony!

797
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:22,226
Stop this, now!

798
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,186
Where are Clint and Natasha?

799
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,313
They're tucked away safe and sound.
What?

800
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:27,731
Don't worry about them.

801
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,067
Connect it.

802
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,501
Good, Maria.
Now re-boot the Howard.

803
01:06:46,793 --> 01:06:49,586
Rebooting Howard, sir!
The Guardian program has also been initiated!

804
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,715
You people are determined to try
and get in my way somehow.

805
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,054
Come here. Sit down.

806
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,972
You and I are gonna
have a talk! Right now!

807
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,101
No matter what you think about your father

808
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,855
I can tell you Obadiah loved you very much.

809
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,190
It was a pretty straightforward bargain.

810
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:12,443
He was human and you were his son!

811
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,487
Was that all?

812
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,739
Isn't that enough?
You'll achieve nothing

813
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,782
if you throw away your history.

814
01:07:19,284 --> 01:07:21,077
I have personal experience.
I was only able

815
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:22,911
to move forward by accepting my father.

816
01:07:22,996 --> 01:07:25,706
And you'll only create a new world

817
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,460
by accepting the past and building on it.

818
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:33,965
A relic like you is lecturing me

819
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,800
about the future?
How amusing...

820
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,219
Why should I listen to someone irrelevant?

821
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,733
The Technovores!

822
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:55,277
Why...
Why are you betraying me?

823
01:07:57,322 --> 01:07:59,949
Together, we could have defeated them.

824
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,621
I can't see anything, feel anything.

825
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:08,248
Sorry, Ezekiel.

826
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,751
The wind...

827
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,963
...has stopped.

828
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:30,063
I've lost all instruments!
I have no control over the helicarrier!

829
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,396
It's losing altitude!

830
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:38,113
Shoot him!

831
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,546
Come over here!
This way, you bastard!

832
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:01,552
Hurry up, Maria!

833
01:09:11,896 --> 01:09:15,149
Reactor detected.
Power reserve at 15 percent.

834
01:09:15,275 --> 01:09:16,818
I have that much?

835
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,907
That's it, pal.
Playtime is over!

836
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:31,373
Propulsive force still inoperable!

837
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,083
Too many engines are offline!

838
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,337
Where are we going to land?

839
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:37,881
Shanghai, China!

840
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:41,885
Contact the Chinese government!
Have them evacuate everyone!

841
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:50,059
Tony, what's going on up there?

842
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,654
Power dropping rapidly!
Now entering red zone!

843
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,283
Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!

844
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:10,412
Well, that's it!
This kid needs some serious disciplining!

845
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,185
System error! System error! Danger!

846
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:26,572
Is it really going to end here?
Am I done for?

847
01:11:27,073 --> 01:11:30,368
My body won't move.

848
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:55,059
Rhodey, is that you?

849
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,077
Rhodey...

850
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,123
Guess I must have overslept!

851
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:23,253
Remind me to reward you later
for waking up, old friend!

852
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,671
Rhodey...

853
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:25,922
How did he...

854
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:29,969
Rhodey!

855
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:50,823
What in the...

856
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,875
Wait, Rhodey!

857
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:18,600
What the hell...

858
01:13:18,935 --> 01:13:20,060
What's happening?

859
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:27,193
Whatever it is, we're gonna have to
put an end to it, right now!

860
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,653
Let's go!

861
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,536
Peace to everything.

862
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,498
Fear... Leave it to me,

863
01:13:41,707 --> 01:13:44,085
you powerless immature beings.

864
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,712
I will bring prosperity to all.

865
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:52,635
I will proceed with salvation for all.
I will break free.

866
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:56,680
I will realize the salvation of all.

867
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:00,935
I will break free.

868
01:14:02,061 --> 01:14:04,939
I will merge.

869
01:14:05,606 --> 01:14:07,649
Repeat, technology has already been released.
Stupid...

870
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:11,237
...has been closed.

871
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,072
Ezekiel!

872
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:15,323
Power reserves at seven percent!

873
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:19,119
Red zone!
Re-charge immediately! Re-charge immediately!

874
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:21,204
What is this guy saying?

875
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:27,127
Rhodey!
Do you understand what's going on?

876
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,546
We have to conserve our energy resources!

877
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:32,132
But we can't just let him destroy everything!

878
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:34,260
Stop wasting bullets!

879
01:14:34,427 --> 01:14:37,846
What are you talking about?
What are we supposed to do then?

880
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:44,520
I don't know what we can do!
I'm trying to think of something!

881
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:48,440
...final... universe... reincarnation...

882
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,078
We've lost control of the Howard!

883
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,622
Powerless and immature beings...

884
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,502
Prosperity...

885
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:11,463
I will proceed with the salvation of all.

886
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,298
He's replicated it!

887
01:15:14,926 --> 01:15:16,927
He's using the Howard to control

888
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:18,930
all the other military satellites in orbit!

889
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:22,432
I'm confused!
What's this all about?
Is he planning an attack?

890
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,523
Ezekiel, you said that a new wind
would create a new future.

891
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:31,317
Is this how you plan to reset the world?

892
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,819
Destroy everything and start all over?

893
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,738
All of the military satellites have been

894
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,657
repositioned!
He's preparing to attack!

895
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:46,039
... world... technology... I will start...

896
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:51,462
He's completely insane.
He's going to destroy the world.

897
01:15:52,046 --> 01:15:54,172
Tony, we should save our nail clippings.

898
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:56,300
What?

899
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,301
To be filed
with our wills. As keepsakes.

900
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,765
I hate to bring this up
but why would we do that?

901
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,601
There won't be anyone left to give them to.

902
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,188
I thought it might be something
Pepper could remember us by.

903
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:11,899
Wait a minute. Pepper!

904
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:15,860
Wills...

905
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,863
Leaving something behind...

906
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,158
Of course!

907
01:16:22,493 --> 01:16:25,246
Pepper!
Pepper, can you hear me?

908
01:16:25,329 --> 01:16:26,831
Yes, sir.

909
01:16:27,498 --> 01:16:29,875
Are you focused enough to help me one last time?

910
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,668
Anything but dictation.

911
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:36,591
You're an amazing secretary
but it's a little more complicated than that.

912
01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:44,556
I'm not surprised.
You can't do anything without my input.

913
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,143
I want to give you a present before I die.

914
01:16:47,226 --> 01:16:48,226
Huh?

915
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:51,439
What's the one thing
you've never had since I've known you?

916
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:53,983
What do you truly want, more than anything else?

917
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,779
What do I want more than anything else?

918
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,033
That's easy.
What I want is a vacation!

919
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,244
Vacation. Vacation.

920
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:11,751
Vacation. Vacation. Vacation.
Vacation. Vacation.

921
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:14,587
We're starting to regain control of the Howard!

922
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:18,256
Good job, Pepper!
I was able to get through Howard's back door!

923
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:19,341
What back door?

924
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,801
I'm not all-powerful.
I'm an imperfect human

925
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:25,597
and I realized a while ago
that I had to be careful.

926
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:28,725
I programmed a back door into the satellite

927
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,395
to protect it from unauthorized users.

928
01:17:32,021 --> 01:17:34,481
When did you set up my voice as the password?

929
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:37,652
You talked in your sleep
when you passed out at your desk.

930
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:40,154
I don't remember that.

931
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:41,655
You wouldn't.

932
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:45,033
But I was able to uplink my armor
to the Howard at the time.

933
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,952
You've earned that vacation twice over.

934
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,247
Thank you very much,
Mr. President.

935
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,041
The particle-beam
cannon on the Chinese

936
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,667
military satellite is about to shoot!

937
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,002
I'm only able to control one satellite

938
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:58,046
and I won't have control for long!

939
01:17:59,298 --> 01:18:02,092
I want to show this guy something
I have that he doesn't!

940
01:18:02,426 --> 01:18:04,552
Are you out of your mind?
What are you gonna do?

941
01:18:04,637 --> 01:18:06,846
This is gonna be our last chance,
so listen carefully!

942
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:12,978
The Technovores are trying to
take over the Howard by hacking in!

943
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,689
How much time do we have?

944
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:16,731
Tens of seconds, that's all.

945
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,859
I'm counting
on you Rhodey. Okay?

946
01:18:20,569 --> 01:18:22,779
All right, Jarvis, pull the trigger!

947
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,030
Affirmative!

948
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:26,742
Tony!

949
01:18:26,909 --> 01:18:30,287
Here we go!
Hope your little nap didn't affect your aim!

950
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,372
Aim at what?

951
01:18:52,351 --> 01:18:53,810
All right, it's aligned.

952
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:57,689
Rhodey! This is it!
You've only got one chance!

953
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,944
Let's do it!
Release the energy of the arc reactor!

954
01:19:06,323 --> 01:19:10,034
The Technovores reacted.
Aim for the crack!

955
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:11,662
Careful...

956
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,163
All missiles are ready to launch!

957
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:15,875
Rhodey, we have no time!
You have to shoot!

958
01:19:16,542 --> 01:19:19,670
Do it now!
It's our last chance before the world ends.

959
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:21,881
Shoot!

960
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:24,507
All missiles, armed and ready!

961
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,094
Rhodey!

962
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:38,146
Bear down and shoot!
Everything should work now!

963
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:46,988
Launching!

964
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,748
Tony!

965
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,939
Yeah, the last thing I can remember
is watching the bombs go off.

966
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,859
I guess the Technovores decided
they needed to repair you

967
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,529
before they could override your system.

968
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,323
And in the process, it looks to me
like they saved your life.

969
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:13,742
That was fortunate.

970
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:15,994
Now it's your turn to recover!

971
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:18,663
At least you'll be taken care of
by a bunch of hot nurses!

972
01:21:18,747 --> 01:21:20,291
I'm glad you're okay, Tony,

973
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,542
but if you do anything like that again,
I'll kill you myself.

974
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:26,755
I hear you, Pepper.
When a child is bad, you need to scold him.

975
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,844
So, you're finally getting it.
You're an obstinate child...

976
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:33,761
...who needs discipline.

977
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:37,557
And it's an adult's duty
to provide that discipline.

978
01:21:37,975 --> 01:21:39,518
Do you hate women who scold?

979
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,979
Not really.
All boys look up to authority figures.

980
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:45,733
Especially when they're as beautiful as you.

981
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,197
Don't forget, now.
You promised me a vacation.

982
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:54,867
Of course.
So where do you want to go?

983
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,034
I'll take some days off, too.

984
01:21:56,118 --> 01:21:57,161
What?

985
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:01,247
Let's take a vacation.
Just the two of us.
How 'bout it?

986
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,626
Is that an order, sir?

987
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,377
No.
It's more like a suggestion.

988
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:13,426
Well then, I suggest you and I pack up.

989
01:22:19,725 --> 01:22:22,519
The insane man shut up
and looked at the audience.

990
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,021
The audience also shut up and looked at him.

991
01:22:25,105 --> 01:22:27,983
He regained consciousness last night.

992
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,069
He has a visitor today but there's been

993
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,112
no change. He's still
mentally deranged.

994
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:35,573
He finally threw his light against the ground.

995
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,118
The light shattered and died out.

996
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:42,038
This tremendous event is

997
01:22:42,998 --> 01:22:45,708
still on its way, still wandering.

998
01:22:46,877 --> 01:22:51,047
It has not yet reached the ears of men.

999
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,927
Deeds, though done,
still require time to be seen and heard.

1000
01:22:57,346 --> 01:23:00,306
This deed is still more distant from them

1001
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:03,394
than the most distant of stars.

1002
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:08,106
Still, they were able to do the deed.

1003
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,693
According to the people, this insane man

1004
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:18,283
forced his way into various churches
that day singing, "Requiem."

1005
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:21,996
The wind!
