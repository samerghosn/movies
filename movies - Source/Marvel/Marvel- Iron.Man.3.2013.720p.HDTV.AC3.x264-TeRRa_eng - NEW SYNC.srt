1
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:04,541
"We create our own Demons".

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,970
Who said that? What does
that even mean? Doesn't matter.

3
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:11,195
I said it cause he said it.

4
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:14,696
So now he was famous and basically
getting said by two well known guys.

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,949
I don't, uh...I'm gonna
start again.

6
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,277
Let's track this from the beginning.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

8
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:00,112
Half-hour 'till the
ball drops.

9
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:03,688
Tony Stark, great
speech man!

10
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,317
I gave a speech?

11
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,356
How was it?
- Edifying. - Unintelligible.

12
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,593
Really? That's my favorite
kind, a winning combo.

13
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:11,182
- Hey, uh, where are we going?
- Uh, to town on each other,

14
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:13,236
probably back at your house.
I want to see your research.

15
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:14,831
Okay, you can see my
research, but that's...

16
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:16,543
I'm not going to show
you my "town".

17
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:20,713
- Mr. Stark, Ho Yinsen.
- Oh, I finally met a man called Ho.

18
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:24,338
I'd like to introduce you to our
guest, Doctor Wu.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,701
- Oh this guy.
- Mr. Stark.

20
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:27,121
Hey.

21
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,248
She's going to need a cardiologist
right away.

22
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:31,885
- Bye!
- Perhaps another time?

23
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:36,150
It started in Bern,
Switzerland, 1999.

24
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:39,670
The old days.

25
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:42,271
I never thought they'd come back to bite me.

26
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,606
Hey Tony! Aldrich Killian,
I'm a big fan of your work.

27
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,206
- My work?
- Who isn't? She needs me.

28
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:52,700
Well, of course, but Miss
Hansen my organization

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,477
has been tracking your research since
year two of MIT.

30
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,689
Oh wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

31
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:01,641
- What floor you going to, pal?
- Well now, that is an appropriate question.

32
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:04,927
The ground floor, actually, of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

33
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:08,556
It's a privately-funded think tank called
"Advanced Idea Mechanics".

34
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,638
Uh, she'll take both. One to throw
away and one to not call.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,069
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or AIM
for short, you get it?

36
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,281
I see that 'cause it's on
your T-shirt.

37
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:18,848
Oh!!

38
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:21,787
Ladies, follow the mullet.
Ladies first.

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,883
Thank you. I'll call you.

40
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,919
I am titillated by the notion
of working with you. - Yeah?

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,997
I'm going to ditch
these clowns.

42
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,223
I'll see you up on the roof
in five minutes.

43
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:34,186
I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick
if you know what I'm talkin' about.

44
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,430
I'll see you up there!

45
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,383
Damn betcha.

46
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:40,163
- Come on, I thought that was just a theory.
- Well... it was.

47
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,819
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

48
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,067
that governs repair and chemically recode it.
- That's incredible.

49
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,911
Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic
operating system of a

50
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,014
- living organism.
- Exactly.

51
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:56,234
Can you not touch my plant?
It's not... she doesn't like it. She perfers -

52
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:57,423
She's not like the others.

53
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,915
Come on, let's go to
the bedroom.

54
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,127
Happy, leave her
ficus alone.

55
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:02,837
No, seriously, don't

56
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,509
- And you're starting with plants?
- For now, yes.

57
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm calling it "Extremis".

58
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,361
- Well, its -
- Human application.

59
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:13,413
Exactly! Exactly!
Dentra-degree vitalization.

60
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,256
Disease prevention.

61
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:16,489
Even limb regrowth.

62
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,938
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

63
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,028
- Wow!
- In Switzerland.

64
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,191
- That's better.
- This week.

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,641
You almost bought it,
didn't you?

66
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,520
This is what I'm talking
about, the glitch.

67
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,030
Have you checked the telomerase
algorithm?

68
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:46,674
- We're good.
- Stay down.

69
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:48,873
You're right on me...

70
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:50,996
What the hell was that?

71
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:53,792
What the hell was that?

72
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:54,475
It's a glitch in my work.

73
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,868
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

74
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,409
Oh, it's not Y2K...

75
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,966
Hey, Happy New
Year!

76
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:00,820
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

77
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,962
Alright, I'll see you in the morning,
Okay? Good night.

78
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:03,314
You good?

79
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:04,824
- Yep. - I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

80
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:30,689
So, why am I telling you this? Because I
had just created demons.

81
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:33,240
And I didn't even know it.

82
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,992
Yeah, those were good times.

83
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,144
Then I moved on.

84
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:45,026
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said "Goodbye" to the party scene.

85
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,408
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

86
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,579
These days I'm a changed man.

87
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,442
I'm different now.

88
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,863
I'm... well, you know
who I am.

89
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:56,832
Sir, please may I request

90
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,656
just a few hours to calibrate -
- Nope!

91
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:05,499
Micro-repeater implanting
sequence complete!

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,326
As you wish, sir. I've
also prepared a

93
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:09,339
safety briefing for you
to enitrely ignore.

94
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,992
Which I will.

95
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,413
Alright, let's do this.

96
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:17,386
Dummy. Hi Dummy.
How did you get that cap on your head?

97
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,495
You earned it.

98
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,822
Hey. Hey!

99
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,269
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

100
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,612
Blood on my mat, handle it.

101
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,834
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours.

102
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,995
Focus up ladies.
Good evening

103
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:34,807
And welcome to the
birthing suite.

104
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,552
I am pleased to announce the
imminent arrival

105
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:40,420
of your bouncing,
badass baby brother.

106
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,675
Start titan and go white.
Stamp date and time.

107
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:47,545
Mark 42 autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.

108
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,149
Initialize sequence.

109
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,447
Jarvis, drop my needle.

110
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,521
Crap.

111
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,004
Alright, I think we got this.
Send them all.

112
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,572
Probably just a little fast, slow it down.
Slow it down just a... little bit.

113
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,158
Cool it, will you Jarvis?

114
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:12,682
Come on.

115
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:14,576
I ain't scared of you.

116
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,350
I'm the best.

117
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:33,545
As always sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.

118
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:37,247
I guess 72 hours is a long
time between siestas.

119
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,319
Didn't think it could
get any worse.

120
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,851
Then they had to go and
turn on the TV.

121
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,564
That's when 'He' happened.

122
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,701
Some people call me a terrorist.

123
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:04,744
I consider myself a teacher.

124
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:09,266
America...

125
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:13,778
Ready for another lesson.

126
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,630
In 1864 in Sand Creek, Colorado.

127
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:21,682
The U.S. military waited until the friendly
Cheyenne Braves had all gone hunting.

128
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:25,935
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind.

129
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:29,567
And claim their land.

130
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:35,663
39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem Air Base
in Kuwait was attacked.

131
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,724
I did that.

132
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:42,466
A quaint military church, filled with
wives and children of course.

133
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:48,149
The soliders were out
on manuvers.

134
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,731
The "Braves" were away.

135
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:58,326
President Ellis, you continue to resist
my attempts to educate you, sir.

136
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,748
And now, you've missed
me again.

137
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:08,091
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.

138
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:12,374
And you'll never
see me coming.

139
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:18,086
... and now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening developments in this story.

140
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,399
American airways
were hijacked.

141
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,919
The nation remains
on high alert.

142
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,490
All attempts to find the Mandarin have
so far proved unsuccessful.

143
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,514
Central to my administration's response to this
terrorist event is a newly-minted resource.

144
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:33,395
I know him as Colonel
James Rhodes.

145
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:37,227
The American people will soon
know him as the Iron Patriot.

146
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:40,269
And how is President
Ellis responding?

147
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:44,722
By taking the guy they call "War Machine"
and giving him a paint job.

148
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:48,975
The same suit but painted red,
white and blue, look at that.

149
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,875
And they've also renamed
him Iron Patriot.

150
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:55,408
You know, just in case the
paint was too subtle.

151
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,429
It tested well with focus
groups, alright?

152
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,201
- I am Iron Patriot.
- Listen.

153
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,188
War Machine was a little too
aggressive, alright.

154
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,331
This sends a better message.

155
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:07,865
So what's really going on?
With Mandarin.

156
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,398
Seriously, can we talk
about this guy?

157
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,559
It's classified information,
Tony.

158
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,743
- Okay, there've been nine bombings.
- Nine.

159
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,375
The public only knows about three.

160
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,514
But here's the thing...
nobody can ID a device.

161
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:25,986
There's no bomb casings.

162
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,096
You know I can help.

163
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:31,570
Just ask. I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit. I got

164
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:32,091
Bomb disposal.

165
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,532
Catches explosions mid-air.

166
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,334
When's the last time you got
a good night's sleep?

167
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,202
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

168
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,349
People are concerned about
you, Tony.

169
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,394
I'm concerned about you.

170
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:41,572
You gonna come at
me like that?

171
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,437
No, look, I'm not trying
to be a dic-

172
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,638
-tator.
- Would you mind signing my drawing?

173
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,274
If Richard doesn't mind. You alright
with this, Dick?

174
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:50,672
Fine with me.

175
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:53,943
- What is your name?
- Erin.

176
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,975
I loved you in "A Christmas Story"
by the way.

177
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,937
Listen, the Pentagon
is scared.

178
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,907
After New York, aliens,
come on.

179
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,318
They need to look strong.

180
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,611
Stopping the Mandarin is a
priority, but it's not-

181
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,422
It's not superhero business.

182
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:11,323
No, it's not. Quite frankly.

183
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,714
It's American business.

184
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,840
That's why I said.
I...got it.

185
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,235
Are you okay?

186
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:18,418
I broke the crayon.

187
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:20,048
Are you okay,
Mr. Stark?

188
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,187
Take it easy. Tony...

189
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,311
How did you get out
of the wormhole?

190
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,043
- Tony
- What did you say?

191
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:34,235
Sorry. Have to check on
the suit... make sure...okay.

192
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,309
Check the heart, check the,
check the, is it the brain?

193
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,601
No sign of cardiac analomy
or unusual brain activity.

194
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,624
Okay, so I was
poisoned?

195
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:50,426
My diagnosis is that you've experienced
a severe anxiety attack.

196
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:54,057
Me?

197
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,818
Come on man, this isn't a
good look. Open up.

198
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,970
Sorry, I gotta split.

199
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:06,585
Badge... Badge... Badge.

200
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,966
Badge, guys. I put a memo in
the toliet, come on.

201
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,086
Tony has got them in his basement,
they're wearing

202
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:14,028
party hats, this is an asset
we can put to use.

203
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,269
Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting
that I replace

204
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,552
the entire janitorial
staff with robots?

205
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,703
What I'm saying is that the human
element of Human

206
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,715
Resources is our biggest
point of vulnerability.

207
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:25,556
We should start phasing it
out immediately.

208
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,476
- What!?
- Excuse me, Bambi

209
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,840
- Did you just say that?
- Security

210
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:33,209
Happy, okay, I am thrilled that you're
now the Head of Security.

211
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,951
Okay, it is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

212
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:36,522
- However,
- I do appreciate it.

213
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,024
- Since you've taken the post,
- You don't have to thank me.

214
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,125
We've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300 percent.

215
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,787
- Thank you.
- That's not a compliment.

216
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:46,638
"That's not a compliment"?
It is a compliment!

217
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,448
Clearly somebody is trying
to hide something.

218
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:49,298
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

219
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,461
Miss Potts, your four o'clock
is here.

220
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:53,149
Did you clear this four o'clock
with me?

221
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,602
Happy, we'll talk about
this later

222
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:57,235
But right now I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

223
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,495
How so?

224
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:00,668
I used to work with him, and he
used to ask me

225
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,477
out all the time, so it's a
little awkward.

226
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:03,938
I don't like the
sound of that.

227
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,614
- Pepper.
- Killian?

228
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:15,355
You look great...
you look really great.

229
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:18,462
God, you look great.

230
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,778
I... I... I can't...What on Earth have
you been doing?

231
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,150
Nothing fancy, just five years in the
hands of physical therapists

232
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,371
And please, call me Aldrich.

233
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:30,036
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge?

234
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:30,803
Happy, it's okay.

235
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:32,205
- Yes?
- We're good.

236
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,525
- You sure?
- Yes.

237
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,307
- Stand down.
- I'm going to linger.

238
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:36,738
- Thank you.
- Right here, okay.

239
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,567
It's very nice to see
you, Killian.

240
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,553
Hey, guy

241
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,078
Merry Christmas.

242
00:13:56,663 --> 00:14:01,047
After years dodging the president's ban
on "Immoral Biotech Research",

243
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:06,907
My think tank now has a little
something in the pipeline.

244
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:12,104
It's an idea we like to call
"Extremis".

245
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,677
I'm gonna turn your
lights down.

246
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,169
Regard the human brain.

247
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,900
Uh, wait, hold on, hold on, that's, that's
the universe, my bad.

248
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,581
But if I do that...

249
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,606
That's the brain, strangely memetic
though, wouldn't you say?

250
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,926
- Wow, that's amazing!
- Thanks, it's mine.

251
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,138
- What?
- This... you're inside my head.

252
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,786
It's a live feed. Come on up,
I'll prove it to you.

253
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,496
Come on.

254
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:59,679
Now, pinch my arm. I can take it.
Pinch me.

255
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:02,816
What is that?

256
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,894
The primary somatosensory
cortex.

257
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:10,038
It's the brain's pain center, but this...
is what I wanted to show you.

258
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:16,080
Now, "Extremis" harnesses our
bioelectrical potential.

259
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,759
And it goes... here.

260
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:22,940
This is essentially an empty slot,
and what this tells us is that

261
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:27,731
our mind, our entire DNA in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.

262
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:29,158
Wow.

263
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,013
Hello? Is this forehead
of Security?

264
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,938
What? You know, look, I got a real job.
What do you want?

265
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,395
I'm working. I got something
going on here.

266
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:45,993
- What? Harassing interns?
- Let me tell you something,

267
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,963
You know what happened when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

268
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:49,586
They would laugh
in my face.

269
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:52,046
I had to leave while I still
had a shred of dignity.

270
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,769
Now I got a real job. I'm
watching Pepper.

271
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,985
What's going on?
Fill me in.

272
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:57,475
- For real?
- Yeah.

273
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,894
Alright, so she's meeting up with this
scientist rich guy, handsome.

274
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,432
I couldn't make his face
at first, right?

275
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:03,370
And you know I'm good
with faces.

276
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,687
- Oh yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah, so I run his credentials

277
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,604
I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually
met the guy back in -

278
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:11,206
Where were we in '99? The
Science Conference?

279
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,388
Uh,  Switzerland.

280
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:13,942
Right, right, exactly.

281
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:16,147
- Killian, I don't remember that guy.
- Of course you don't remember,

282
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:17,198
he's not a blonde with a big rack.

283
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,495
At first it was fine, they were
talking business, but now

284
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:22,105
it's like getting weird. He's showing
her his big brain.

285
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:25,062
- His what?
- Big brain, and she likes it.

286
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:27,284
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?

287
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:31,258
Look at what? You watching them? Flip the
screen and then we can get started.

288
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,331
I'm not a tech genius like you, just
trust me, get down here.

289
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:35,880
Flip the screen, then I can see
what they're doing.

290
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,245
I don't know how to flip
the screen!

291
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,594
Don't talk to me like that anymore.
You're not my boss.

292
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:43,746
Alright, I don't work for you, and
I don't trust this guy.

293
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,548
He's got another guy with
him, he's shifty.

294
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,749
Relax. I'm just asking you to
secure the perimeter.

295
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,436
Tell him to go out for a
drink or something.

296
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:51,537
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

297
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,432
This woman is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

298
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,355
- And you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?

299
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:57,482
Yeah, there's a giant brain,
there's a shifty character...

300
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,967
I'm going to follow this guy.
I'm going to run

301
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,576
his plates and if it
gets rough, so be it.

302
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:03,311
I miss you, Happy.

303
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:05,692
Yeah, I miss you too but the
way it used to be.

304
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:06,931
Now you're off with
the 'superfriends'

305
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:08,486
I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

306
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,378
The world's gettin' weird.

307
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,692
Hey I hate to cut you off, do you have
your taser on you?- Why?

308
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:12,900
I think there's a gal in HR
who is trying

309
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:16,355
to steal some printer ink. You should probably
go over there and zap her.

310
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,439
Yeah, nice.

311
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,726
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of

312
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,798
any living organism and
recode its DNA.

313
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,851
It would be incredible.

314
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,298
Unfortunately, to my ears it also
sounds highly weaponizable.

315
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,218
As in enhanced soldiers, private
armies, and Tony is not -

316
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,431
Tony, Tony.

317
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,685
You know, I invited Tony
to join AIM.

318
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:43,173
13 years ago and he
turned me down.

319
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:48,209
But something tells me now there is a new genius
on the throne, who doesn't have to

320
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:52,669
answer to Tony anymore and who
has slightly less of an ego.

321
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:59,381
It's going to be a no, Aldrich...
as much as I'd like to help you.

322
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:06,700
I can't say that I'm not disappointed,
but as my father used to say,

323
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:09,012
"Failure is the fog through which
we glimpse triumph."

324
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:12,893
It's very deep, and I have no
idea what it means.

325
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:15,088
Well, he was kind of an
idiot, my old man.

326
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,373
I'm sure I'll see you again,
Pepper.

327
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:30,256
Happy!

328
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:33,964
The car is ready... if you're
ready to go.

329
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:42,506
Yes, I just um, God, I forgot my other
thing so I'm just gonna...

330
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:13,845
I'm sorry I'm late. I was..
What is that?!

331
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,096
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like Mark 15?

332
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:21,856
Yeah, something like that. You know
everybody needs a hobby.

333
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:24,708
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

334
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:29,190
Just breaking it in, you know, it's always a little
pinchy in the GUI-bagger at first.

335
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,622
Oh hey, did you see your
Christmas present?

336
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:35,926
Yes, I did. I don't know how I could have
missed that Christmas present.

337
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:37,544
Is it gonna fit through
the door?

338
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,759
Well actually, uh, that's a good question,
I got a team of

339
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,858
guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna
blow out that wall.

340
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,454
So, uh, tense?
Good day?

341
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,097
Oh shoulders, a little naughty.
Naughty girl.

342
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:51,022
I don't want to harp on this, but did you
like the custom rabbit?

343
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,115
Did I like it?

344
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,707
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

345
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,786
I appreciate the thought
very much.

346
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:02,619
So why don't you lift up that facemask
and give me a kiss.

347
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:06,825
Huh, yup, damnit.
No can do.

348
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:11,329
You want to just kiss it on
the, uh, facial slit?

349
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,722
Why don't I run down to the
garage and see if

350
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:15,768
I can't find a crowbar to jimmy
that thing open?

351
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:19,942
A crowbar? Yeah. Oh, except there's
been a radiation leak.

352
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,817
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

353
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,855
At least let me get you
like a Hazmat suit.

354
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:27,923
Or a Geiger counter or
something like that.

355
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:33,753
- Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.

356
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:37,020
- Sorry.
- You ate without me, already? On date night?

357
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,077
- He was just.
- You mean you.

358
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,337
Well yeah, I just mean
we were just...

359
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:44,203
just hosting you while I
finished up a little work.

360
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:44,539
Uh Huh..

361
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,119
And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know
if you were coming home

362
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,240
Or you were having drinks with
Aldrich Killian.

363
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,135
What?

364
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,076
Aldrich Killian? What are you
checking up on me?

365
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,973
- Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.

366
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:02,704
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on. Come on. Pep-

367
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:06,416
Hey, I admit it! My fault.
Sorry.

368
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:08,881
I'm a piping hot mess.

369
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,924
It's been going on for a while...
I haven't said anything.

370
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,298
- Nothing's been the same since New York.
- Oh really?

371
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,230
I didn't notice
that, at all.

372
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:27,246
You experience things and then they're over
and you still can't explain them.

373
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:31,308
Gods, aliens, other dimensions...
I'm just a man in a can.

374
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:36,155
The only reason I haven't cracked up is
probably because you've moved in.

375
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:38,662
Which is great. I love
you, I'm lucky.

376
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:42,580
But honey... I can't sleep.

377
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,482
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know, I tinker.

378
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:51,101
The threat is imminent.

379
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,743
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

380
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:58,413
That's you. And my suits,
they're uh...

381
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,891
- Machines.
- They're part of me.

382
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:06,050
- A distraction.
- Maybe.

383
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:26,750
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

384
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:33,846
- And you're going to join me.
- Better.

385
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:53,814
Tony!

386
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,045
Power down!

387
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:15,522
I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.

388
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,907
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

389
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:28,738
Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my
breath, okay? Don't go, alright? Pepper?

390
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,749
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.

391
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:01,204
- Can you regulate?
- Yes, I can regulate.

392
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:03,145
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

393
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,548
It's a decent batch.

394
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,863
Don't say I never did
nothing for you.

395
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:21,840
Thank you. I mean for
understanding.

396
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:32,675
I'm sorry, buddy.

397
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,340
What're ya doing, buddy?

398
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,259
You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching
your favorite chick flick maybe?

399
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,730
Yeah, a little movie called
"The Party's Over"

400
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,847
Starring you and your junkie girlfriend,
and here's the ticket.

401
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,132
No kidding. That doesn't
belong to you.

402
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:31,329
Savin! Help!
Help me!

403
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:59,309
A true story about fortune cookies.

404
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:02,973
They look Chinese. They
sound Chinese.

405
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:07,689
But they're actually an
American invention.

406
00:27:08,015 --> 00:27:15,250
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies,
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

407
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:21,368
My disciples just destroyed another
cheap American knock-off.

408
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:26,491
The Chinese Theater.
Mr. President.

409
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:30,057
I know this must be
getting frustrating.

410
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:34,052
But this season of terror is
drawing to a close.

411
00:27:34,817 --> 00:27:41,172
And don't worry, the big one is
coming, your graduation.

412
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,162
- Hi.
- Oh, uh.

413
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:59,288
- Mind leaving that on?
- Sure.

414
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:09,299
Sunday night's PBS,
"Downtown Abbey"

415
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:12,977
That's the show. He thinks
it's elegant.

416
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:19,555
One more thing, make sure everyone wears
their badges. He's a stickler

417
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:22,009
for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't
let anyone in without them.

418
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:25,362
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

419
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:27,452
We're hoping he'll give
us the reaction.

420
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:29,476
His reaction to the
latest attack.

421
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:31,096
Mr. Stark!

422
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:35,134
Our sources are telling us that this is
another Mandarin attack.

423
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,933
Anything else you can tell us?

424
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:42,300
Hey Mr. Stark! When is somebody going
to kill this guy? Just sayin'.

425
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:46,671
Is that what you want?

426
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:52,890
Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been
wanting to send to the Mandarin.

427
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:55,830
I just didn't know how to
phrase it until now.

428
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:59,201
My name is Tony Stark and
I'm not afraid of you.

429
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,607
I know that you're a coward,
so I've decided

430
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,519
That you just died, pal.

431
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,346
I'm gonna come get the body.

432
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,461
There's no politics here, it's just good
old-fashioned revenge.

433
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,963
There's no Pentagon. It's just
you and me.

434
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,011
And on the off-chance you're a man,
here's my home address:

435
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:22,455
10880, Malibu Port, 90265.

436
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:26,615
I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what
you wanted, right?

437
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:30,839
Bill me.

438
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,730
I've compiled a Mandarin
database for you, sir.

439
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:42,401
Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I.
and C.I.A. intercepts.

440
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,729
Initiating virtual crimescene
reconstruction.

441
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,500
Okay, what do we got here?

442
00:29:50,938 --> 00:29:53,549
His name is an ancient
Chinese war mantle

443
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:55,130
Meaning "Advisor to the King".

444
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:57,943
South American insurgency tactics.

445
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:00,337
Talks like a Bapist
preacher.

446
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:04,558
There's lots of pagentry going
on here, lots of theatre.

447
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,587
Close. - The heat from the blast was
in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius.

448
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:13,304
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporized instantly.

449
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:17,185
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile radius
of the Chinese theatre. - No, sir.

450
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,036
Talk to me, Happy.

451
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:42,038
When is a bomb not a bomb?

452
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:56,055
- Any military victims?
- Not according to public records, sir.

453
00:30:56,555 --> 00:31:00,126
Bring up the thermogenic signatures
again, factor in 3000 degrees.

454
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:02,738
The oracle cloud has
completed analysis.

455
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:07,903
Accessing satellites and plotting the last 12
months of thermogenic occurances now.

456
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:11,749
Take away everywhere that there's
been a Mandarin attack.

457
00:31:16,397 --> 00:31:17,566
Nope.

458
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,251
That. You sure that's
not one of his?

459
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,665
It predates any known
Mandarin attack.

460
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,709
The incident was the use of a
bomb to assist a suicide.

461
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,734
Bring it around.

462
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:38,756
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3000 degrees Celsius.

463
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,179
That's two military guys.

464
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:44,840
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

465
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,957
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

466
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:58,085
Are we still at 'Ding-Dong'? We're supposed
to be on total security lockdown.

467
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:00,695
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

468
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:05,748
There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give
the world's press your home address.

469
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:17,561
Right there's fine.

470
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,833
You're not the Mandarin, are you?
Are you?

471
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:30,795
You don't remember. Why I
am not surprised?

472
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,460
Don't take it personally, I don't remember
what I had for breakfast.

473
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:34,951
- Gluten-free waffles, sir.
- That's right.

474
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:39,763
Look, I need to be alone with you, someplace
not here... it's urgent.

475
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:45,259
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now
I'm in a committed relationship

476
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:49,367
- It's... with her.
- Tony

477
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:53,390
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

478
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:58,697
Old botanist pal that I used
to know, barely.

479
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:02,169
Please don't tell me that there is a 12-year-old
kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

480
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,403
- He's 13. No, I need your help.
- What for? Why now?

481
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:09,851
Because I read the papers, and, frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

482
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,380
- I'll be fine.
- I'm sorry.

483
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:14,659
With Happy in the hospital, I didn't
know we were expecting guests.

484
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,507
We weren't.

485
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,362
- And old girlfriends!
- She's not really.

486
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:20,192
No, not really. It was
just one night.

487
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,596
- Yep.
- That's how you did it, isn't it?

488
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:24,584
It was a great night

489
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,842
- Well... you know
- Yeah.

490
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:27,720
You have saved yourself
a world of pain.

491
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:28,594
- What?
- Trust me.

492
00:33:28,595 --> 00:33:29,730
We're going out of town.

493
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,596
- Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
- Yep!

494
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:33,998
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

495
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:35,593
- Great idea. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

496
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:37,876
That's a terrible idea. Please don't
touch her bags.

497
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:39,782
Tony, this is how normal
people behave.

498
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,914
I can't protect you out there.
I challenged-

499
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:43,526
- Is this normal?
- Sadly, that

500
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:44,859
Yes, this is normal!

501
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:47,710
- Is very normal
- It's a big bunny, relax about it!

502
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:50,159
- Calm down!
- I got this for you.

503
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,489
- I'm aware of that.
- You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

504
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,019
- I don't like it!
- I asked you three- You don't like it?!

505
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,392
We are leaving the house, that's not
even up for discussion. - Guys... do we umm...

506
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:01,736
- What?
- Do we need to worry about that?

507
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:52,909
- I got you.
- I got you first.

508
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,878
Like I said, we can't
stay here.

509
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,081
Move! I'm right behind.

510
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,132
Get her, I'm going to
find a way around.

511
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:16,269
Stop stopping! Get her.
Get outside! Go!

512
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,161
Oh my God.
Tony!

513
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:56,905
Sir, Miss Potts is clear
of the structure.

514
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,742
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

515
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:33,766
Working on it, sir. This is
a prototype.

516
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:49,869
That's one.

517
00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:54,547
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

518
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,036
That's two.

519
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,574
Tony!

520
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:02,005
Sir, take a deep breath.

521
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,394
Flight power restored.

522
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:37,079
Sir. Sir!

523
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:40,170
Alright, kill the
alarm. I got it.

524
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,684
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

525
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:24,389
Snow? Where are we,
upstate?

526
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:27,043
We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hills, Tennessee.

527
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,192
Why?

528
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,253
Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we
doing here, this is

529
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:36,132
thousands of miles away? I've gotta get
Pepper, I've got to -

530
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,324
I prepared a flight plan.

531
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:39,777
This was the location.

532
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:42,054
Who asked you? Open
the suit.

533
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:44,789
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

534
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:45,791
Open Eject.

535
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,295
That's brisk!

536
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:03,284
Maybe I'll just cozy back
up for a bit.

537
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:06,394
I actually think I need
to sleep now, sir.

538
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,222
Jarvis.

539
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:10,998
Jarvis?

540
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:15,503
Don't leave me, buddy.

541
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:41,014
Stark Secure Server: Now transferring
to all known receivers.

542
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,233
Pepper, it's me.

543
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:47,327
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not
a lot of time, so first off.

544
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:49,836
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

545
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,166
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

546
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:56,626
Also, it's Christmas time. The
rabbit's too big. Done.

547
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:58,155
Sorry.

548
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:02,690
And I'm sorry in advance because...
I can't come home yet.

549
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:07,768
I need to find this guy. You
gotta stay safe.

550
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:09,228
That's all I know.

551
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:12,494
I just stole a poncho from
a wooden Indian.

552
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:38,626
Let's get you comfy.

553
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:42,083
You happy now?

554
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:55,233
Freeze!

555
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,500
- Don't move.
- You got me.

556
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,126
Nice potato gun.

557
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,369
Barrel's a little long.

558
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:09,262
Between that and the wide gauge, it's
going to diminish your FPS.

559
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:14,849
And now you're out of ammo.

560
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:16,867
What's that thing on
your chest?

561
00:43:18,282 --> 00:43:22,317
It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've
got a box of them right here.

562
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:24,092
What does it power?

563
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,282
Oh my God!

564
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:42,960
- Is that Iron Man?
- Technically, I am.

565
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,041
Technically, you're dead.

566
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:50,501
- A valid point.
- What happened to him?

567
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,246
Life. I built him. I take
care of him.

568
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:58,250
I'll fix him.

569
00:43:58,251 --> 00:43:59,414
- Like a mechanic.
- Yeah.

570
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:04,340
If I was building Iron Man
and War Machine,

571
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,811
- It's Iron Patriot now.
- That's way cooler!

572
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:07,974
No, it's not.

573
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:11,949
Anyway, I would have
added in the retro-

574
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,753
- Retroreflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

575
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,085
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

576
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,614
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

577
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:20,898
Not a good idea!

578
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:22,971
What are you doing? You're going
to break his finger?

579
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:24,889
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

580
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,780
- Sorry.
- Are you?

581
00:44:28,657 --> 00:44:30,449
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

582
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,288
So, uh, who's home?

583
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:37,347
Well, my mom already left for the diner and
dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

584
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:40,643
I guess he won 'cause that
was six years ago.

585
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:45,826
Which happens, dads leave. No need to
be a pussy about it.

586
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:50,355
Here's what I need: a laptop, a
digital watch, a cell phone,

587
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:53,445
The pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

588
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:56,311
a map of town, a big spring,
and a tunafish sandwich.

589
00:44:56,313 --> 00:45:00,224
- What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?

590
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:04,016
- Who?
- The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

591
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:06,534
How'd you know that?

592
00:45:06,614 --> 00:45:08,293
I got just the thing.

593
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:15,422
This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding.
it's a very powerful weapon.

594
00:45:15,824 --> 00:45:18,436
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

595
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:20,175
It discourages bullying.

596
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:23,230
Non-lethal, just to cover
one's ass.

597
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,032
- Deal. Deal? What'd you say?
- Deal.

598
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,335
- What's your name?
- Harley

599
00:45:31,335 --> 00:45:32,485
Tony

600
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:36,548
You know what keeps going
through my head?

601
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:38,789
Where's my sandwich?

602
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:20,146
Stark Secure Server. Retinal
scan verified.

603
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:21,527
Pepper, it's me.

604
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:23,603
I've got a lot of apologies
to make

605
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:25,338
and not a lot of time,
so first off.

606
00:46:25,677 --> 00:46:27,615
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

607
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:30,371
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

608
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:34,969
Why were you at the
house tonight?

609
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:38,431
What was so important that you
had to speak to Tony?

610
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,005
I think that my boss is working
for the Mandarin.

611
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:47,525
So if you still want
to talk about it,

612
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:49,708
I suggest we get ourselves
someplace safe.

613
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:54,213
Your boss works for the
Mandarin you think,

614
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:57,103
but Tony says you're a botanist.

615
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,594
That figures. What I actually am is a biological
DNA coder running a team of

616
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:04,132
40 out of a privately-funded think tank, but
sure you can call me a "botanist".

617
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,489
This boss of yours, does
he have a name?

618
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:11,077
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

619
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:16,931
Well we took the house down sir, but
there's no sign of a body.

620
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,543
- I see.
- No Stark.

621
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:19,817
I have to go.

622
00:47:20,652 --> 00:47:23,074
The Master is about to record
and he's a little...

623
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,621
Well you know how he gets.

624
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:28,615
Keep your appointment tonight and
call me when it's done.

625
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:37,103
Alright everybody. No talking and
no eye contact,

626
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:39,077
unless you wanna get
shot in the face.

627
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:01,498
The Master is travelling.

628
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:18,181
Well then, what are we waiting for?

629
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:23,282
The sandwich was fair, the
spring was a little

630
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:25,434
rusty, the rest of the materials
I'll make do.

631
00:48:26,255 --> 00:48:28,798
By the way, when you said your
sister had a watch, I

632
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,090
was kinda hoping for something
a little more than that.

633
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:34,793
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

634
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:38,978
- When can we talk about New York?
- Maybe never, relax about it.

635
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,547
- What about the Avengers, can you talk about them?
- I don't know. later.

636
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:41,777
Hey kid, give me more space.

637
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:50,101
What's the official story here?
What happened?

638
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:54,260
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,
used to live roundabouts.

639
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:58,052
Won a bunch of medals in the army.

640
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:02,342
One day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

641
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:05,862
Then he blew himself
up right here.

642
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,780
- Six people died, right?
- Yes.

643
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,429
- Including Chad Davis?
- Yea.

644
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,260
Doesn't make sense.

645
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,454
Think about it. Six dead,
only five shadows.

646
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:34,778
Yeah, but people said these shadows are
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven

647
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:40,782
Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on
account of he didn't get a shadow.

648
00:49:41,135 --> 00:49:44,284
- That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?

649
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:45,885
That's what everyone says.

650
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:51,858
You know what this crater
reminds me of?

651
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,893
I have no idea. I don't care.

652
00:49:55,315 --> 00:50:00,673
That giant wormhole, in
um, in New York.

653
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:02,021
Does it remind you?

654
00:50:02,822 --> 00:50:04,744
That's manipulative. I don't want
to talk about it.

655
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:07,190
Are they coming back?
The aliens?

656
00:50:07,192 --> 00:50:08,753
Maybe, can you stop?

657
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,134
Remember when I told you that
I have an anxiety issue?

658
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,202
Does this subject make
you edgy?

659
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:14,724
Yeah, a little bit.

660
00:50:14,726 --> 00:50:16,976
Can I just catch my breath
for a second?

661
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:21,014
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you need
a plastic bag to breathe into?

662
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,650
- Do you have medication?
- Nope.

663
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:24,271
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

664
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:26,309
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

665
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:28,025
Are you going completely
mental?

666
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:30,010
I can stop, do you want
me to stop?

667
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:31,775
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

668
00:50:31,777 --> 00:50:33,713
I swear to God, you're going
to freak me out.

669
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:37,813
Ah man, you did it, didn't you?

670
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:40,068
- You happy now?
- What did I say?

671
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,382
Hey, wait up!
Wait, wait.

672
00:50:49,443 --> 00:50:51,161
What the hell was that?

673
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:57,516
Your fault, you spazzed
me out.

674
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:01,086
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

675
00:51:01,612 --> 00:51:06,391
The guy who died... relatives?Mom?
Ms. Davis, where is she?

676
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:09,400
- Where she always is.
- See, now you're being helpful.

677
00:51:15,164 --> 00:51:20,206
Sorry. Lady, this uh,

678
00:51:21,608 --> 00:51:23,217
Thank you.

679
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,842
Nice haircut, suits you.

680
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,114
- Nice watch.
- Yeah, limited edition.

681
00:51:31,514 --> 00:51:33,001
Oh, I don't doubt it.

682
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,318
Well have a good evening.

683
00:51:59,418 --> 00:52:03,255
Ms. Davis, Mind if
I join you?

684
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:05,862
- Free country.
- It sure is.

685
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:11,989
Alright

686
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:18,204
- Where'd you like to start?
- I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

687
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:20,791
I want to know what you
think happened

688
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,695
I brought your damn file.
You take it and go.

689
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:31,920
Whatever was in here, he
wanted no part of it.

690
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:37,396
Clearly, you were waiting for someone else.
Supposed to meet somebody here?

691
00:52:38,398 --> 00:52:39,407
Yeah.

692
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:56,327
Ms. Davis, your son didn't kill
himself. I guarantee

693
00:52:56,327 --> 00:53:00,318
you he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.

694
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:04,632
- What?
- As a weapon.

695
00:53:08,423 --> 00:53:11,889
You're not the person who called
me after all, are you?

696
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,844
Actually, I am.

697
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:21,717
Hey, hey! What's all this about?
The hell's going on here?

698
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:23,427
It's called an arrest.

699
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:27,539
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

700
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:31,983
- Homeland Security. We good here?
- No, we're not good.

701
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:35,987
- I need a little more information than that.
- Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

702
00:53:35,987 --> 00:53:40,289
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the
horn to Nashville and upgrade me?

703
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:43,351
Alright, you know what, I was hoping
to do this the smart way, but uh,

704
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,632
The fun way's always good.

705
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,034
Deputy, get this woman and-

706
00:54:02,121 --> 00:54:04,842
Hey hot wings, you wanna party?
You and me, let's go.

707
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:19,978
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

708
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:22,739
Watch this.

709
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:31,519
You walked right into this one. I've dated
hotter chicks than you.

710
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:37,804
That's all you got? Cheap trick
and a cheesy one-liner?

711
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:40,166
Sweetheart, that could be the name
of my autobiography.

712
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:44,242
- Let me go!
- Help me! Help me!

713
00:56:50,447 --> 00:56:52,927
Hey kid, what would you
like for Christmas?

714
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:54,628
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

715
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,769
No, no, I think he was trying to say
"I want my goddamn file."

716
00:56:58,092 --> 00:57:00,052
It's not your fault kid.

717
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:03,994
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

718
00:57:09,817 --> 00:57:13,219
You like that, West World? That's
the thing about smart guys.

719
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:15,900
We always cover our ass.

720
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:41,954
You're welcome!

721
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:46,699
- For what? Did I miss something?
- Me saving your life.

722
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,300
A: Saved you first
B: Thanks, sort of

723
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,461
And C: If you do someone a solid, don't
be a yutz alright,

724
00:57:52,463 --> 00:57:54,983
just play it cool otherwise you
come off grandiose.

725
00:57:56,684 --> 00:57:58,326
Unlike you?

726
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:02,588
Admit it: you need me.
We're connected.

727
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:04,989
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

728
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,851
keep your trap shut, and
guard the suit.

729
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,567
And stay connected to the
telephone because

730
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:10,871
if I call you better
pick up. Okay?

731
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:13,574
Can you feel that?
We're done here.

732
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:16,677
Move out of the way or I'm going to
run you over. Bye kid.

733
00:58:23,786 --> 00:58:27,347
I'm sorry kid. You
did good.

734
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:30,648
So now you're just going to leave
you here, like my dad?

735
00:58:31,664 --> 00:58:35,891
Yeah. Wait, you're guilt-tripping
me, aren't you?

736
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:37,648
I'm cold

737
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,731
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

738
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,492
'Cause we're connected.

739
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:48,875
It was worth a shot.

740
00:59:06,806 --> 00:59:08,746
What happened to the picture?

741
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:20,733
The entire East coast.. the
satellites are down.

742
00:59:23,114 --> 00:59:24,597
We have an unauthorized broadcast

743
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:27,170
Mr. Vice President, I think
you should see this.

744
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:31,742
Oh my God, not again.

745
00:59:32,943 --> 00:59:34,974
Is the President getting this?

746
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:47,394
Mr. President.

747
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:49,496
Only two lessons remain.

748
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:52,978
I intend to finish this before
Christmas morning.

749
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:58,661
Meet Thomas Richards. Good strong
name, good strong job.

750
01:00:00,023 --> 01:00:04,626
Thomas here is an accountant for
the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

751
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:09,949
And I'm sure he's a
really good guy.

752
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,992
I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on
your television, in 30 seconds.

753
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:23,476
The number for this telephone is in your
cell phone. Exciting, isn't it?

754
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:25,838
Imagining how it got there.

755
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:32,262
America, if your president calls me in
the next half-minute, Tom lives.

756
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:33,521
Go.

757
01:00:35,804 --> 01:00:37,059
How did he hack my phone?

758
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:38,965
We can't allow terrorists
to dictate

759
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:40,172
I have to make this call.

760
01:00:40,173 --> 01:00:41,766
I'd strongly advise
against that.

761
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:43,367
This is the right
thing to do.

762
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:13,737
There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis,

763
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,945
so run away and kiss your
children goodbye

764
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:18,083
Because nothing, not your army,
not your red,

765
01:01:18,085 --> 01:01:19,989
white, and blue attack dog,
can save you.

766
01:01:23,632 --> 01:01:24,831
I'll see you soon.

767
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:30,485
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic
right now.

768
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:33,157
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

769
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:36,076
We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

770
01:01:36,077 --> 01:01:36,920
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

771
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:09,538
Don't move!

772
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:17,744
Uh, hang on a second.

773
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:19,496
Hello.

774
01:02:19,496 --> 01:02:24,744
You ever look up and everything starts glowing from
the inside out, a kind of bright orange.

775
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:27,789
- Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
- It's me, pal.

776
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:30,990
Now last time I went missing, if I remember
correctly, you went looking for me.

777
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:34,108
- What are you doing?
- A little talking, making friends in Pakistan.

778
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,414
What are you doing?

779
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:38,795
Your re-design, your big re-brand,
that was AIM, right? - Yeah.

780
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:43,077
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comsat
right now, I need your login.

781
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:45,257
Same as it's always been,
War Machine 68.

782
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:46,219
And password please?

783
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,806
Well, look, I gotta change it every time
you hack in, Tony.

784
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,842
It's not the eighties, nobody says "hack"
anymore, give me your login.

785
01:02:53,364 --> 01:02:56,425
"War Machine Rox" with
an X, all caps.

786
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:04,130
- Yeah okay.
- That is so much better than Iron Patriot.

787
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:47,782
That ain't gonna cut it.

788
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:52,625
Excuse me sir, I don't know who...

789
01:03:55,346 --> 01:03:58,027
Mom, I need to call you back. Something
magical is happening.

790
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:00,684
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

791
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:02,670
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

792
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,065
I knew you were still alive!

793
01:04:04,067 --> 01:04:05,711
Come on in and close the door.

794
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,317
- Wow, can I just say sir?
- Yeah.

795
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:14,581
I am your biggest fan.

796
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:17,119
First, is this your van or
is anyone else gonna come in?

797
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:18,309
No, no, it's just us.

798
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:19,440
What's your name?

799
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,635
- Gary.
- Gary.

800
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:22,960
Oh wow.

801
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:27,003
Right there's fine. I get a
lot of this, it's okay.

802
01:04:27,005 --> 01:04:28,324
Can I just say?

803
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:32,088
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you can tell but I have like

804
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:35,592
Patterned my whole look after you. My
hair's a little,

805
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:38,251
it's not right because there's
some product in it.

806
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:38,411
Right.

807
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:42,487
I don't want to make things
awkward for you

808
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,695
- No.
- But I do have to show you... boom!

809
01:04:45,936 --> 01:04:47,436
Hispanic Scott Baio?

810
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:50,137
- Oh, I'm sorry, is that me?
- Yeah.

811
01:04:50,538 --> 01:04:53,436
It's... I mean. I had them do it
off a doll that I made,

812
01:04:53,438 --> 01:04:56,661
so it's not like it's off a picture. So
it's a little bit-

813
01:04:56,663 --> 01:04:59,182
Jerry, for a moment, listen
to me here.

814
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,853
I don't want to clip your
wings here.

815
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,545
We're both a little over-excited.

816
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:06,389
I have an issue. I'm chasing bad
guys, trying to grapple

817
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:08,469
with something from some
hard-crypt data files.

818
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,090
I don't have enough juice.

819
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:13,951
I need you to jump on the roof,
recalibrate the ISDNs

820
01:05:14,552 --> 01:05:17,688
- Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.

821
01:05:17,688 --> 01:05:18,474
Alright, it's a mission.

822
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,273
Yeah.

823
01:05:19,275 --> 01:05:20,936
Tony needs Gary.

824
01:05:21,436 --> 01:05:22,387
And Gary needs Tony.

825
01:05:22,387 --> 01:05:23,436
Be quiet about it.

826
01:05:23,637 --> 01:05:24,737
Go.

827
01:05:47,331 --> 01:05:50,253
What would you regard as the defining
moment of your life?

828
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:54,215
Well uh, I think that would be the day I decided
not to let my injury beat me.

829
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:59,500
- Can you please state your name for the camera?
- Ellen Brandt.

830
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:04,181
Okay, so, the injections are
administered periodically.

831
01:06:04,182 --> 01:06:08,664
Addiction will not be tolerated and those who cannot
regulate will be cut from the program.

832
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:16,949
Once misfits, cripples... you are the next
iteration of human evolution.

833
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:25,163
Hi everybody. Before we start, I promise you, looking back
at your life there will be

834
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:29,275
nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk that
you prudently elected to forego.

835
01:06:30,777 --> 01:06:32,998
Today is your glory. Let's begin!

836
01:06:44,324 --> 01:06:47,206
We gotta get out of here! Gotta get out of here!
Get 'em out! Get 'em out of here!

837
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,572
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

838
01:06:59,012 --> 01:07:01,295
This stuff doesn't always
work, right, pal?

839
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:03,795
It's faulty, but you found a
buyer, didn't ya?

840
01:07:04,338 --> 01:07:06,358
Sold it to the Mandarin.

841
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:15,222
What happened? Fun fact.

842
01:07:16,224 --> 01:07:18,985
Before he built rockets
for the Nazis.

843
01:07:19,344 --> 01:07:28,309
The idealistic Werner von Braun dreamed
of space travel... he stargazed.

844
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:33,313
You know what he said when the
first V2 hit London?

845
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:37,356
The rocket performed perfectly.

846
01:07:39,157 --> 01:07:41,438
It just landed on the wrong planet.

847
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:48,041
See we all begin wide-eyed...
"pure science".

848
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:52,804
Then the ego steps in,
the obsession

849
01:07:54,365 --> 01:08:00,608
And when you look up, you're
a long way from shore.

850
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:07,773
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean
you gave your research to a think tank.

851
01:08:07,775 --> 01:08:11,206
Yeah but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

852
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:13,177
That's exactly what we used to do.

853
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:15,298
So don't judge yourself.

854
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,738
Thank you, Pepper.

855
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:22,181
I really appreciate that.

856
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:30,582
Hi, good evening

857
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:31,847
- Good evening.
- Come on in.

858
01:08:34,228 --> 01:08:35,390
Maya, run!

859
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:38,832
Hi Pepper.

860
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:43,273
So you want to tell me why you were
at Stark's manison last night?

861
01:08:43,354 --> 01:08:46,755
I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and
the Master were gonna blow the place up.

862
01:08:47,277 --> 01:08:51,256
Oh I see, so you were trying to save Stark...
when he threatened us

863
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:52,680
I told you, Killian, we can use him.

864
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,805
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper

865
01:08:55,805 --> 01:08:59,364
Look if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

866
01:08:59,725 --> 01:09:02,823
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now he has one.

867
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:12,828
This is Support Team Blue 0, sending coordinates for
suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

868
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:13,404
Copy.

869
01:09:21,738 --> 01:09:22,817
Nobody move!

870
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,847
Support Blue 0, unless the Mandarin's
next attack on the U.S.

871
01:09:30,849 --> 01:09:33,904
involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think
you messed up again.

872
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:40,386
Yes, you're free, if you weren't
before. Yes ma'am.

873
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:44,350
Iron Patriot on the job, happy to help,no need
to thank me, it's my pleasure.

874
01:09:53,395 --> 01:09:55,898
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

875
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:59,838
You want this suit? You're going ot have
to pry my cold, dead body out of it.

876
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,319
That's the plan, Colonel.

877
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,216
Harley, tell me what is happening,
give me a full report.

878
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:08,923
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy, do you
want me to keep eating it?

879
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:10,324
How much did you have?

880
01:10:10,326 --> 01:10:11,326
Two or three bowls.

881
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:13,631
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.

882
01:10:13,631 --> 01:10:15,606
That means you're fine,
give me Jarvis.

883
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:17,109
Jarvis, how are we?

884
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:19,536
It's totally fine sir. I seem to do quite
well for a stretch and

885
01:10:19,537 --> 01:10:21,731
then at the end of the sentence I
say the wrong cranberry.

886
01:10:22,112 --> 01:10:25,458
And sir, you were right. Once I factored
in available AIM downlink

887
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,756
facilities I was able to pinpoint the
Mandarin's broadcast signal.

888
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:33,559
What're we talkin'? The Far East, Europe, North
Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

889
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,180
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

890
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,791
Okay, kid, I'm going to have to walk
you through rebooting Jarvis's

891
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:40,922
speech drive, but not right now.

892
01:10:41,347 --> 01:10:42,422
Harley, where is he really?

893
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:44,104
Just look on the screen and
tell me where it is.

894
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:47,310
Um...it does say Miami, Florida.

895
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:49,868
Okay, first things first,
I need the armor.

896
01:10:50,108 --> 01:10:51,381
Where are we at with it?

897
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:52,550
Uh, it's not charging.

898
01:10:59,474 --> 01:11:03,259
Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power
source is questionable.

899
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,797
It may not succeed in revitalizing
the Mark 42.

900
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:08,087
What's questionable about electricity?

901
01:11:08,088 --> 01:11:11,201
Alright, it's my suit and I can't...
I'm not gonna...

902
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,603
- Oh God, not again.
- Tony

903
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:20,786
Are you having another attack? I didn't even
mention New York.

904
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:24,569
Right, and then you just said it, by name,
while denying having said it.

905
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:25,748
Okay, um, uh

906
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:30,104
Oh God, what am I gonna do?

907
01:11:30,104 --> 01:11:32,252
Just breathe, really just breathe.

908
01:11:33,453 --> 01:11:36,975
- You're a mechanic, right?
- Right.

909
01:11:38,176 --> 01:11:41,537
- You said so.
- Yes, I did.

910
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:44,539
What don't you just build something?

911
01:11:57,347 --> 01:12:00,149
Okay, thanks kid.

912
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:48,412
Why is it so hot in here? I told
you to put it at 68.

913
01:13:49,212 --> 01:13:53,015
My fault again...let me tell you something
sweetheart, I am not your personal-

914
01:14:56,131 --> 01:14:58,014
I wouldn't go in there for twenty minutes!

915
01:14:59,434 --> 01:15:02,655
- Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.

916
01:15:02,668 --> 01:15:04,871
Ah, Nessie.

917
01:15:05,157 --> 01:15:09,743
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

918
01:15:09,743 --> 01:15:12,161
There's some guy over here.

919
01:15:12,162 --> 01:15:15,583
They're made by Americans, based
on the Japanese recipes. - Hey!

920
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:19,712
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

921
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:21,337
- Don't move.
- I am not moving.

922
01:15:21,346 --> 01:15:24,033
If you want something, take it, although
the guns are all fake

923
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:26,550
because those wankers wouldn't trust
me with the real ones.

924
01:15:26,551 --> 01:15:28,930
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

925
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:34,033
Heard enough. You're not him, the Mandarin,
the real guy, where?

926
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:39,356
- Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
- He's here. He's here.

927
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,378
- But he's not here. He's here but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

928
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,865
It's complicated, hey, it's
complicated, alright?

929
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,201
- It is?
- It's complicated.

930
01:15:46,202 --> 01:15:47,746
Uncomplicate it. Ladies out, get out
of the bed

931
01:15:47,747 --> 01:15:49,082
get in the bathroom.

932
01:15:51,832 --> 01:15:52,442
Sit.

933
01:16:02,289 --> 01:16:05,474
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

934
01:16:05,475 --> 01:16:06,814
What are you?

935
01:16:07,974 --> 01:16:10,001
What're you a decoy? You're
a double, right?

936
01:16:10,002 --> 01:16:11,855
What? No. An understudy?
Absolutely not.

937
01:16:12,617 --> 01:16:14,457
Don't hurt me please!
I'm an actor.

938
01:16:15,556 --> 01:16:18,310
You got a minute to live, fill it
with words.

939
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:22,302
It's just a role. "The Mandarin", see,
it's not real.

940
01:16:22,622 --> 01:16:24,222
Then how did you get here,
Trevor?

941
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:32,529
Um, well, uh, I have a little problem
with, um, substances,

942
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:37,310
and I ended up doing things...
no two ways about it

943
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:40,592
- In the street that a man shouldn't do.
- Next!

944
01:16:40,594 --> 01:16:45,996
Then, they approached me about the role
and they knew about the drugs.

945
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:47,613
What'd they say they'd get
you off them?

946
01:16:47,613 --> 01:16:48,637
Said they'd give me more.

947
01:16:48,997 --> 01:16:52,061
They gave me things. They gave
me this palace.

948
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:55,322
They gave me plastic surgery. They
gave me things.

949
01:16:57,042 --> 01:16:58,443
Did you just nod off?

950
01:16:59,604 --> 01:17:03,686
No, the lovely speedboat! And the
thing was, he needed someone.

951
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:07,689
To take credit for some
"accidental explosions".

952
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,091
"He"?

953
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:16,934
- Killian?
- Killian.

954
01:17:16,935 --> 01:17:19,256
- He created you?
- He created me.

955
01:17:20,457 --> 01:17:22,658
- Custom-made terror threat
- Yes!

956
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:28,261
Yes, his think tank thinked it up, the
pathology of the serial killer.

957
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:31,743
The manipulation of Western
iconography.

958
01:17:32,182 --> 01:17:36,386
Ready for another lesson?
Blah blah blah.

959
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:41,146
Of course, it was my performance that
brought the Mandarin to life.

960
01:17:41,368 --> 01:17:46,712
Your performance? Where
people die?

961
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:50,173
No, no, look around you,
costumes, green screen.

962
01:17:50,474 --> 01:17:54,716
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff,
and when I was, movie magic, love.

963
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:58,398
I'm sorry but I got a best friend who's in
a coma and he might not wake up.

964
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,881
So you're going to have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.

965
01:18:08,262 --> 01:18:11,065
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

966
01:18:11,766 --> 01:18:13,846
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

967
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:18,090
- No.
- You should have pressed the panic button.

968
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,971
Well I panicked, but then
I handled it.

969
01:18:43,394 --> 01:18:45,113
Just like old times, huh?

970
01:18:45,114 --> 01:18:47,796
Oh yeah, with zip-ties.
It's a ball.

971
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:49,340
It wasn't my idea.

972
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,798
Okay, so you took
Killian's card

973
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,748
I took his money.

974
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,560
And here you are 13 years
later in a dungeon.

975
01:18:55,761 --> 01:18:56,641
- No.
- Yeah.

976
01:18:56,742 --> 01:19:00,764
- No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
- Yeah...

977
01:19:04,645 --> 01:19:08,998
A lot's happened Tony,
and I'm close.

978
01:19:09,288 --> 01:19:12,350
Extremis is pratically stable.

979
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:12,689
I'm telling you it isn't.

980
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:17,354
I saw him on the street, people are going 'bang', they're
painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

981
01:19:17,354 --> 01:19:20,234
Then help me fix it.

982
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,260
Did I do that?

983
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:29,823
- Yes.
- I remember the night, not the morning

984
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:31,724
Is this what you've been
chasing around?

985
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:32,904
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

986
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:40,229
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.

987
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:44,992
Wanted to help people, now
look at you.

988
01:19:46,592 --> 01:19:48,814
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who...

989
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:52,740
still has a soul.

990
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:03,722
Get me out of here,
come on.

991
01:20:05,564 --> 01:20:10,646
You know what my old man used to say to me?
His favorite of many sayings.

992
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:16,128
"The early bird gets the worm, the second
mouse gets the cheese".

993
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:18,743
You're not still pissed about the Switzerland
thing, are you?

994
01:20:18,743 --> 01:20:20,091
How can I be pissed you, Tony?

995
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:22,983
I'm here to thank you. You've
given me the

996
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,255
greatest gift that anybody's
ever given me.

997
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:29,027
Desperation. If you think
back to Switzerland,

998
01:20:29,028 --> 01:20:31,779
you said you'd meet me on
the rooftop, right?

999
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,893
Well for the first 20 minutes, I actually
thought you'd show up.

1000
01:20:38,194 --> 01:20:40,243
For the next hour, I uhh...

1001
01:20:40,842 --> 01:20:47,507
Well I considered taking that one step shortcut
to the lobby, if you know I mean.

1002
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,430
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1003
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:54,246
But as I looked out over that city, nobody
knew I was there,

1004
01:20:54,346 --> 01:20:56,974
nobody could see me, no one
was even looking.

1005
01:20:57,173 --> 01:21:02,318
I had a thought that would guide
me for years to come.

1006
01:21:03,237 --> 01:21:04,557
Anonymity, Tony.

1007
01:21:06,038 --> 01:21:09,222
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra
ever since, right?

1008
01:21:09,224 --> 01:21:11,521
You simply rule from behind
the scenes.

1009
01:21:11,523 --> 01:21:13,844
Because the second you
give evil a face

1010
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:17,666
Bin Laden, Gaddafi, The Mandarin

1011
01:21:17,846 --> 01:21:18,988
You hand the people a target.

1012
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:19,966
You're something else.

1013
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,288
You have met him, I assume?

1014
01:21:24,289 --> 01:21:25,613
Yeah, Sir Lawrence Oblivion.

1015
01:21:25,894 --> 01:21:29,055
I know he's a little over the top sometimes...
it's not entirely my fault.

1016
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:31,217
He has a tend...he's
a stage actor.

1017
01:21:32,016 --> 01:21:34,578
They say his Lear was the toast of
Croydon, wherever that is.

1018
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:39,581
Anyway, the point is ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky.

1019
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,264
Subtlety's kinda had its day.

1020
01:21:42,582 --> 01:21:44,144
What's next for you in your world?

1021
01:21:44,145 --> 01:21:48,988
Well, I wanted to repay you for the same gift
you so graciously imparted to me.

1022
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:01,313
Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not
sure if you can tell.

1023
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:07,557
But at this moment the body is trying to decide
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1024
01:22:07,617 --> 01:22:13,238
And if it gives up, I have to say the denotation
is quite spectactular.

1025
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:17,844
But until that point, it's really
just a lot of pain.

1026
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:22,247
We haven't even talked
salary yet.

1027
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:25,931
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1028
01:22:26,033 --> 01:22:27,170
Let him go.

1029
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:34,092
- Hold on, hold on. Maya
- I said let him go!

1030
01:22:34,774 --> 01:22:36,082
What are you doing?

1031
01:22:36,082 --> 01:22:39,256
1200ccs, a dose half of this
size and I'm dead.

1032
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:43,380
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1033
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:45,460
Maya, give me the injector.

1034
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:50,903
If I die Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1035
01:22:50,904 --> 01:22:52,103
We're not doing this, okay?

1036
01:22:52,104 --> 01:22:54,545
What happens to you? What happens
if you go too hot?

1037
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:12,475
The good news is, a high level position
has just been vacated.

1038
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:23,721
-You're a maniac.
- No, I'm a visionary.

1039
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:30,246
But I do own a maniac, and he takes
the stage tonight.

1040
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:37,612
When we get the Iron Patriot, it'll take me
nine to ten minutes for a take down.

1041
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:41,172
That's great. The last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.

1042
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,297
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1043
01:23:52,338 --> 01:23:55,020
Hello Colonel.

1044
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,662
Step aside.

1045
01:24:04,787 --> 01:24:07,550
We'll get you out of there,
don't worry.

1046
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,628
You'll damage the armor.

1047
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:13,912
Yes, I will, but you can
fix it, right?

1048
01:24:14,792 --> 01:24:18,033
I'm going to take the suit up to base
camp, and I want Potts with me.

1049
01:24:18,635 --> 01:24:20,756
She's still in Phase 2.

1050
01:24:21,536 --> 01:24:24,057
You're not going deaf, are ya?

1051
01:24:39,527 --> 01:24:41,608
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1052
01:24:42,128 --> 01:24:44,368
Hey, uh, ponytail express.

1053
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:47,850
What is the mileage count between Tennessee
and Miami? - 832 miles.

1054
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,212
Very nice.

1055
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:54,295
- Are you gonna stop that?
- Break it you bought it.

1056
01:24:57,057 --> 01:25:00,252
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away, that
belongs to my friend's sister,

1057
01:25:00,252 --> 01:25:03,502
and that's why I'm gonna
kill you first.

1058
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,101
- What're ya gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1059
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:09,024
- You're zip-tied to a bed.
- This.

1060
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:13,947
That.

1061
01:25:18,269 --> 01:25:19,711
Are you comin' out?

1062
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:26,673
Do not open, do not open, don't open, don't
open, don't- Alright, let's go.

1063
01:25:33,957 --> 01:25:36,680
You breathe fire? Okay.

1064
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:43,283
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1065
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:49,247
This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most
powerful leader in one hand.

1066
01:25:49,248 --> 01:25:52,448
And the world's most feared
terrorist in the other.

1067
01:25:53,289 --> 01:25:55,411
I'll own the War on Terror.

1068
01:25:56,891 --> 01:26:01,775
Creates supply and demand for you
and your brothers and sisters.

1069
01:26:04,936 --> 01:26:10,140
Trust me, you're going in a puddle of blood on
the ground in 5, 4, 3, Come on!, 2

1070
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:13,652
How did we get this shooot?

1071
01:26:13,653 --> 01:26:16,503
Alright, I'm going to give you a chance to
escape, put down your weapons.

1072
01:26:17,503 --> 01:26:21,265
And tie yourselves into those chairs
and I'll let you live. In 5, 4

1073
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:26,001
You should be gone by now, you
should have already been gone.

1074
01:26:26,002 --> 01:26:27,109
I'm just beyond terrified.

1075
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:28,588
Here it comes.

1076
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,592
3, 4

1077
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:32,592
Shut up. - 54321

1078
01:26:33,391 --> 01:26:34,592
I told you.

1079
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,603
Where's the rest?

1080
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:49,877
Honestly, I hate working here...
they are so weird.

1081
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:56,801
Better late than never.

1082
01:28:02,809 --> 01:28:04,569
Not this time. Not the face.

1083
01:28:06,426 --> 01:28:08,722
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello,
by the way.

1084
01:28:08,724 --> 01:28:09,519
Oh, hello sir.

1085
01:28:15,643 --> 01:28:17,956
All personnel, Stark is loose and
somewhere in the compound.

1086
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:19,965
Repeat: Stark is loose and somewhere
in the compound.

1087
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,780
Ah, crap.

1088
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:38,748
- Tony.
- Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1089
01:28:38,769 --> 01:28:40,048
No, you got yours?

1090
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:43,311
Uh, um, kind of. Main house
as fast as you can.

1091
01:28:43,353 --> 01:28:44,632
Somebody I'd like you to meet.

1092
01:28:50,085 --> 01:28:52,105
You, you. Move!
Get out!

1093
01:28:52,106 --> 01:28:54,078
The room is secure. I have eyes
on the Mandarin.

1094
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,588
What's this? I had winner's.

1095
01:29:04,988 --> 01:29:06,194
What've you come as?

1096
01:29:06,195 --> 01:29:08,430
Make a move and I'll break
your face.

1097
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:13,393
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1098
01:29:14,073 --> 01:29:15,295
This is the Mandarin?

1099
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:17,154
I know, it's, it's embarrassing.

1100
01:29:17,155 --> 01:29:19,117
Hi, I'm Trevor,
Trevor Slattery.

1101
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:23,052
I know I'm shorter in person, I'm a bit small,
everyone says that but, uh, hey

1102
01:29:23,054 --> 01:29:26,600
if you're here to arrest me, there are
some people who I'd like to roll on.

1103
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,780
Here's how it works,
Meryl Streep.

1104
01:29:27,782 --> 01:29:29,601
You tell him where Pepper
is and he'll stop doing it.

1105
01:29:30,242 --> 01:29:33,564
Doing what? Oh, I get it! Ow!
That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1106
01:29:33,564 --> 01:29:37,487
I do not know about any Pepper,
but I know the plan.

1107
01:29:37,488 --> 01:29:39,649
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1108
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:43,594
What? No. But I do know what's happening
off the coast.

1109
01:29:43,595 --> 01:29:47,372
Something to do with uh... a big boat.
I can take you there.

1110
01:29:51,536 --> 01:29:54,056
Tony, I swear to God, I'm going
to blow his face off.

1111
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:57,578
Oh this next bit may include the
Vice President as well.

1112
01:29:58,619 --> 01:30:00,375
- Is that important?
- Somewhat.

1113
01:30:00,376 --> 01:30:01,662
Yeah, a little bit.

1114
01:30:04,846 --> 01:30:06,551
- So?
- Uh, what are we gonna do.

1115
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:10,369
We don't have any transport.

1116
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:14,795
Hey, Ringo, didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1117
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,664
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes
from where Pepper is.

1118
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:21,880
But we also have to figure out this
Vice President thing, right?

1119
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,202
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1120
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:29,643
- Hello.
- Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1121
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,712
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

1122
01:30:31,713 --> 01:30:33,953
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign,

1123
01:30:33,954 --> 01:30:36,088
and we've got to get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1124
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:40,850
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast ham
surrounded by the agency's finest.

1125
01:30:40,851 --> 01:30:43,952
And the President is safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1126
01:30:44,051 --> 01:30:45,514
I think we're good here.

1127
01:30:45,515 --> 01:30:47,453
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1128
01:30:47,595 --> 01:30:49,472
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a trojan horse.

1129
01:30:49,573 --> 01:30:50,435
They're gonna take out

1130
01:30:50,436 --> 01:30:53,097
the President somehow. We have to
immediately alert that plane.

1131
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:55,798
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security
lock it down. If need be,

1132
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,981
they can have F22s in the air in 30 seconds.
Thank you, Colonel.

1133
01:30:59,079 --> 01:30:59,974
Rhodes and Stark out.

1134
01:31:01,882 --> 01:31:03,199
Everything okay, sir?

1135
01:31:04,702 --> 01:31:06,225
Couldn't be better.

1136
01:31:12,909 --> 01:31:15,570
I love you, baby.

1137
01:31:34,962 --> 01:31:38,023
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see
you could make it, son.

1138
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:39,206
I feel safer already.

1139
01:31:44,807 --> 01:31:46,088
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save

1140
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:48,090
the President or Pepper.
We can't do both.

1141
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:49,990
Sir, I have an update
from Malibu.

1142
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:52,197
The cranes have finally
arrived and the

1143
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:54,293
cellar doors are being
cleared as we speak.

1144
01:31:54,854 --> 01:31:56,274
And what about the suit
I'm wearing?

1145
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:57,975
The armor is now at 92%.

1146
01:31:59,034 --> 01:32:00,355
That's gonna have to do.

1147
01:32:10,023 --> 01:32:11,752
Oh, here he comes, here he comes,
get a quick picture.

1148
01:32:11,752 --> 01:32:12,184
Sure.

1149
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:32,037
Is everything all right,
Colonel?

1150
01:33:02,853 --> 01:33:05,416
It is an honor,
Mr. President.

1151
01:33:05,895 --> 01:33:08,237
If you're gonna do it,
do it.

1152
01:33:08,436 --> 01:33:09,829
Woh. Cool your boots, Sir.

1153
01:33:09,831 --> 01:33:11,759
That's not how the
Mandarin works.

1154
01:33:11,828 --> 01:33:14,430
Sir. Air Force One's
been compromised.

1155
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:16,344
Internal shots, temperature
spikes.

1156
01:33:16,345 --> 01:33:17,506
Get me eyes on it now.

1157
01:33:17,507 --> 01:33:19,153
Image coming through
now, Sir.

1158
01:33:21,836 --> 01:33:24,176
Is that Rhodes?

1159
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:55,493
The President.
Now.

1160
01:33:55,975 --> 01:33:57,456
He's not here.

1161
01:34:00,979 --> 01:34:02,943
Try the jet stream.

1162
01:34:04,645 --> 01:34:06,740
Speaking of which,
go fish!

1163
01:34:29,094 --> 01:34:31,534
Walk away from that, you
son of a bitch.

1164
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:46,845
- How many in the air?
- Thirteen, sir.

1165
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:50,105
- How many can I carry
- Four, sir.

1166
01:35:00,113 --> 01:35:03,376
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's
your name? Heather..

1167
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,913
Listen to me, see
that guy?

1168
01:35:13,914 --> 01:35:15,332
I'm gonna swing
by him

1169
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,423
and you're just gonna
grab him.

1170
01:35:16,623 --> 01:35:17,842
You got it?

1171
01:35:19,805 --> 01:35:21,796
I will electrify your arm,

1172
01:35:21,797 --> 01:35:23,565
you won't be able to open
your hand.

1173
01:35:24,992 --> 01:35:26,192
You can do this,
Heather.

1174
01:35:35,012 --> 01:35:37,753
Easy, see? Eleven
more to go.

1175
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:42,511
Remember that game called
Barrel of Monkeys?

1176
01:35:42,512 --> 01:35:43,819
That's what we're
going to do.

1177
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:44,690
18,000 feet.

1178
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:47,261
Come on, people! Everybody, grab
your monkey!

1179
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:55,225
- Nice!
- 10,000 feet.

1180
01:35:58,466 --> 01:36:00,427
- 6,000 feet.
- Come on, people.

1181
01:36:01,269 --> 01:36:02,909
Come on, come on, come on

1182
01:36:06,752 --> 01:36:10,114
- Yeah!
- 1000 feet.

1183
01:36:11,635 --> 01:36:14,380
400 feet. 200 feet,
sir.

1184
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:16,257
It's a tricky monkey,
let's get him.

1185
01:36:16,597 --> 01:36:18,359
Hello.

1186
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:42,581
Nice work guys.
Excellent.

1187
01:36:42,582 --> 01:36:44,974
Good team effort all around.
Go us.

1188
01:36:45,614 --> 01:36:48,136
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,
we still gotta get Pepp-

1189
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,662
That came out of nowhere.

1190
01:36:59,502 --> 01:37:00,420
Gimme some good
news man.

1191
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:01,925
- I think they all made it.
- Thank God.

1192
01:37:02,144 --> 01:37:03,984
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1193
01:37:04,386 --> 01:37:05,903
You couldn't save the President
with the suit,

1194
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:07,226
how are you gonna save Pepper
without it?

1195
01:37:08,068 --> 01:37:09,998
Uh, say Jarvis, is it
that time?

1196
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,109
The "house party"
protocol, sir?

1197
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,211
Correct.

1198
01:37:44,105 --> 01:37:45,985
Hi.

1199
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:56,893
You think he's gonna help you...
he won't.

1200
01:38:01,636 --> 01:38:04,453
Having you here is not just
to motivate Tony Stark,

1201
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:07,819
it's actually more embarrassing
than that.

1202
01:38:08,519 --> 01:38:13,322
- You're here as my, um
- Trophy.

1203
01:38:25,288 --> 01:38:27,408
Good evening, sir.

1204
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:33,333
Welcome aboard,
Mr. President.

1205
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:45,384
You ever heard of an elephant
graveyard?

1206
01:38:45,385 --> 01:38:49,662
Well, two years ago, the elephant in
the room was this scow.

1207
01:38:52,413 --> 01:38:53,373
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1208
01:38:53,673 --> 01:38:57,077
Of course you remember when she spilled 100
million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

1209
01:38:57,136 --> 01:38:59,698
Thanks to you, not one fat
cat saw a day in court.

1210
01:39:00,278 --> 01:39:01,599
What do you want from me?

1211
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,542
Uh, nothing, sir.

1212
01:39:04,581 --> 01:39:07,703
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1213
01:39:08,271 --> 01:39:12,835
You see, I've moved on. I've found myself
a new political patron, and

1214
01:39:13,055 --> 01:39:15,536
At this time tomorrow, he'll
have your job.

1215
01:39:17,237 --> 01:39:18,938
String him up.

1216
01:39:37,509 --> 01:39:38,770
Come on.

1217
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:44,993
You're not gonna freak out
on me, right?

1218
01:39:44,994 --> 01:39:45,554
I hope not.

1219
01:40:11,649 --> 01:40:13,189
Oh my God.

1220
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:17,038
He's strung up over the oil tank, they're
gonna light him up, man.

1221
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:18,092
Viking funeral.

1222
01:40:18,552 --> 01:40:21,314
- Public execution.
- Yeah, death by oil.

1223
01:40:27,596 --> 01:40:30,679
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.

1224
01:40:31,819 --> 01:40:33,028
Okay, that's good.

1225
01:40:33,029 --> 01:40:35,902
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1226
01:40:37,985 --> 01:40:39,072
Is your gun up?

1227
01:40:39,497 --> 01:40:40,990
Yup, what do I do?

1228
01:40:40,992 --> 01:40:43,720
Stay on my six, cover high, and don't
shoot me in the back.

1229
01:40:43,721 --> 01:40:45,094
Six, high, back. Alright.

1230
01:40:55,252 --> 01:40:56,355
You see that? Nailed it.

1231
01:40:56,356 --> 01:40:58,055
Yeah, you really killed
the glass.

1232
01:40:58,056 --> 01:40:59,173
I was aiming for the bulb?

1233
01:40:59,175 --> 01:41:00,636
You can't hit a bulb from
this distance.

1234
01:41:05,338 --> 01:41:07,664
I'm out. Gimme, gimme, you got
an extra magazine?

1235
01:41:07,666 --> 01:41:08,939
They're not universal, Tony.

1236
01:41:09,261 --> 01:41:10,570
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Gimme another one.

1237
01:41:11,434 --> 01:41:13,024
I don't have one that
fits that gun.

1238
01:41:13,204 --> 01:41:13,728
You've got like five of them.

1239
01:41:13,729 --> 01:41:15,886
Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spot. Ready?

1240
01:41:16,886 --> 01:41:18,131
What'd you see?

1241
01:41:18,132 --> 01:41:20,849
Too fast, nothing.
Here we go.

1242
01:41:25,192 --> 01:41:27,153
Three guys, one girl,
all armed.

1243
01:41:37,106 --> 01:41:38,801
God, I'd kill for some
armor right now.

1244
01:41:38,802 --> 01:41:40,708
- You're right, we need backup.
- Yeah, much.

1245
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:44,010
You know what?

1246
01:41:47,472 --> 01:41:49,033
- Is that?
- Yep.

1247
01:41:50,515 --> 01:41:51,635
- Are those?
- Yeah.

1248
01:42:08,965 --> 01:42:10,405
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1249
01:42:15,569 --> 01:42:17,952
Jarvis, target Extremis heat
signatures.

1250
01:42:17,953 --> 01:42:19,739
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1251
01:42:19,841 --> 01:42:21,212
Yes, sir.

1252
01:42:25,774 --> 01:42:28,856
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1253
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:31,219
Take 'em to church.

1254
01:42:52,832 --> 01:42:54,851
Jarvis, get Igor to steady
this thing.

1255
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:09,268
This is how you've been managing
your downtime, huh?

1256
01:43:09,269 --> 01:43:10,320
Everybody needs a hobby.

1257
01:43:16,685 --> 01:43:18,725
Heartbreaker? Help Red Snapper
out, will ya?

1258
01:43:46,984 --> 01:43:47,536
Nice timing.

1259
01:43:47,537 --> 01:43:49,743
Oh yeah, that's awesome. Give me
a suit, okay?

1260
01:43:51,907 --> 01:43:53,707
Oh, I'm sorry. They're
only coded to me.

1261
01:43:54,106 --> 01:43:54,894
What's that mean?

1262
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:55,868
I got you covered.

1263
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:02,792
- Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
- Very funny.

1264
01:44:20,603 --> 01:44:22,885
- Sir, I've located Miss Potts.
- About time.

1265
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:38,613
Stop, put it down, put it
down, put it down.

1266
01:44:41,253 --> 01:44:43,256
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1267
01:44:46,136 --> 01:44:47,006
You're such a jerk.

1268
01:44:47,006 --> 01:44:48,618
Yup, we'll talk about
it at dinner.

1269
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:53,180
Come on, a little more,
baby.

1270
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:10,471
Is this guy bothering you?

1271
01:45:12,032 --> 01:45:14,755
Don't get up!

1272
01:45:17,756 --> 01:45:19,716
Is it hot there?

1273
01:45:21,078 --> 01:45:22,757
Stuck? Feel a little stuck?

1274
01:45:23,759 --> 01:45:27,041
Like a little turtle, cooking in
his little turtle suit?

1275
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:29,242
Tony

1276
01:45:29,243 --> 01:45:30,884
She's watching.

1277
01:45:32,085 --> 01:45:33,605
I think you should close
your eyes.

1278
01:45:33,606 --> 01:45:34,605
Close your eyes.

1279
01:45:35,206 --> 01:45:38,167
Close your eyes. You don't
want to see this.

1280
01:45:45,613 --> 01:45:47,132
Yeah, you take a minute.

1281
01:46:20,192 --> 01:46:21,873
Jarvis, give me a suit
right now!

1282
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,439
Aw, come on!

1283
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:38,802
Mr. President! Just hold on,
alright? I'm coming.

1284
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:42,324
Just hold on.
Hold on.

1285
01:47:04,137 --> 01:47:05,597
Buh-bye.

1286
01:47:17,305 --> 01:47:19,067
Brace yourself!

1287
01:47:29,552 --> 01:47:33,234
You look damn good, Mr. President, but
I'm gonna need that suit back.

1288
01:47:46,323 --> 01:47:48,404
The President is secure, Tony.
I'm clearing the area.

1289
01:47:48,404 --> 01:47:49,418
Nice work.

1290
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:51,765
- Ready sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1291
01:48:00,731 --> 01:48:04,971
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you.
Just look at me.

1292
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:09,452
Honey, I can't reach any further, and
you can't stay there, alright?

1293
01:48:09,453 --> 01:48:10,476
You gotta let go.

1294
01:48:10,576 --> 01:48:13,378
You gotta let go. I'll catch
you, I promise.

1295
01:48:43,876 --> 01:48:47,759
What a shame, I would
have caught her.

1296
01:49:18,069 --> 01:49:19,170
Eject.

1297
01:50:04,844 --> 01:50:07,284
Well here we are,
on the roof.

1298
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:19,452
- Mark 42 inbound.
- Well I'll be damned.

1299
01:50:20,252 --> 01:50:21,813
The prodigal son returns.

1300
01:50:37,983 --> 01:50:39,143
Whatever.

1301
01:50:40,144 --> 01:50:42,024
You really didn't deserve
her, Tony.

1302
01:50:43,266 --> 01:50:47,028
It's a pity. I was so close to having
her... perfect.

1303
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,115
Okay, okay, wait, wait, slow down,
slow down.

1304
01:50:52,417 --> 01:50:54,351
You're right. I don't
deserve her.

1305
01:50:55,632 --> 01:50:57,154
But here's where
you're wrong.

1306
01:50:57,873 --> 01:51:00,235
She was already perfect.

1307
01:51:06,798 --> 01:51:11,220
Jarvis, do me a favor and
blow Mark 42.

1308
01:51:11,344 --> 01:51:15,257
NOOOO!!

1309
01:52:26,685 --> 01:52:28,645
No more false faces.

1310
01:52:29,228 --> 01:52:31,627
You said you wanted
the Mandarin.

1311
01:52:32,228 --> 01:52:34,331
You're looking right
at him.

1312
01:52:35,332 --> 01:52:38,770
It was always me, Tony, right
from the start.

1313
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:40,514
I am the Mandarin!

1314
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,702
I got nothing.

1315
01:52:59,545 --> 01:53:02,707
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1316
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:13,313
What? Oh what, are
you mad at me?

1317
01:53:38,688 --> 01:53:39,948
Honey.

1318
01:53:44,612 --> 01:53:45,872
Oh my God.

1319
01:53:47,273 --> 01:53:49,755
I was really violent.

1320
01:53:50,515 --> 01:53:53,050
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were

1321
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:55,457
I was dead. Why? Because I
fell two hundred feet?

1322
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:02,162
- Who's the hot mess now?
- Still debatable.

1323
01:54:03,222 --> 01:54:04,391
Probably tipping your way
a little bit.

1324
01:54:04,393 --> 01:54:05,503
Why don't you dress like
this at home?

1325
01:54:06,064 --> 01:54:08,064
Hmm? Sports bra, the
whole deal.

1326
01:54:08,405 --> 01:54:11,606
You know I think I understand why you
don't want to give up the suits.

1327
01:54:12,189 --> 01:54:14,149
What I am gonna complain
about now?

1328
01:54:15,509 --> 01:54:18,990
Well, it's me. I'll think
of something.

1329
01:54:20,592 --> 01:54:23,634
- Don't touch me. No, I'm gonna burn you!
- No, no.

1330
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,376
You're not hot.

1331
01:54:27,395 --> 01:54:29,078
Am I gonna be okay?

1332
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:32,239
No, you're in a relationship with me,
everything will never be okay.

1333
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:35,081
But I think I can figure
this out, yeah.

1334
01:54:35,082 --> 01:54:39,564
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was
drunk. I think I can get you better.

1335
01:54:40,722 --> 01:54:42,324
That's what I do.
I fix things.

1336
01:54:43,565 --> 01:54:45,766
And all your distractions?

1337
01:54:46,167 --> 01:54:48,408
Uh, I'm gonna shave them
down a little bit.

1338
01:54:48,409 --> 01:54:51,956
- Jarvis, hey.
- All wrapped up here, sir.

1339
01:54:51,957 --> 01:54:54,412
Will there be anything else?

1340
01:54:54,412 --> 01:54:55,412
You know what to do.

1341
01:54:56,113 --> 01:54:58,895
The "clean slate" protocol,
sir?

1342
01:54:58,895 --> 01:55:02,197
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1343
01:55:38,837 --> 01:55:40,939
Okay so far?
You like it?

1344
01:55:42,439 --> 01:55:44,521
It'll do.

1345
01:55:52,485 --> 01:55:57,408
And so, as Christmas morning began, my
journey had reached its end.

1346
01:56:01,811 --> 01:56:06,094
You start with something pure,
something exciting.

1347
01:56:06,774 --> 01:56:09,536
Then come the mistakes.

1348
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:12,217
The compromises.

1349
01:56:18,501 --> 01:56:20,863
"We create our own Demons".

1350
01:56:26,426 --> 01:56:28,426
It's great to see you.

1351
01:56:33,277 --> 01:56:35,979
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous.

1352
01:56:36,479 --> 01:56:39,881
But I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live
with a chest full of shrapnel.

1353
01:56:40,442 --> 01:56:43,344
And now... neither will I.

1354
01:56:44,363 --> 01:56:48,125
Let me tell you, that was the best
sleep I'd had in years.

1355
01:57:09,149 --> 01:57:12,911
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No!

1356
01:58:30,677 --> 01:58:34,199
So if I were to wrap this up tight
with a bow or whatever.

1357
01:58:34,358 --> 01:58:40,783
I guess I'd say my armor was never
a distraction or a hobby.

1358
01:58:41,304 --> 01:58:43,224
It was a cocoon.

1359
01:58:44,244 --> 01:58:49,247
And now, I'm a
changed man.

1360
01:58:58,293 --> 01:59:00,474
You can take away
my house,

1361
01:59:00,873 --> 01:59:02,314
All my tricks and toys.

1362
01:59:02,895 --> 01:59:05,097
One thing you can't take away...

1363
01:59:08,259 --> 01:59:10,360
I am Iron Man.

1364
02:08:51,554 --> 02:08:53,855
You know, and thank you, by
the way, for listening.

1365
02:08:53,856 --> 02:08:56,845
There's just something about getting
it off my chest and putting

1366
02:08:56,845 --> 02:08:59,559
it out there in the atmosphere
instead of holding this in.

1367
02:08:59,889 --> 02:09:02,791
I mean, this is what gets people
sick, you know?

1368
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:05,893
Wow, I had no idea you were
such a good listener.

1369
02:09:05,993 --> 02:09:09,603
To be able to share all of my intimate
thoughts and my experiences

1370
02:09:09,604 --> 02:09:12,896
with someone, it just cuts the weight
of it in half, you know.

1371
02:09:12,898 --> 02:09:14,252
It's like a snake swallowing
its own tail.

1372
02:09:14,354 --> 02:09:15,297
Everything comes full circle.

1373
02:09:15,797 --> 02:09:18,699
And...and the fact that you've been
able to help me process-

1374
02:09:21,271 --> 02:09:22,671
- So, uh...?
- You with me?

1375
02:09:22,672 --> 02:09:24,873
I was, yeah. Mm-hmm. We were...
uh, we were at, uh...

1376
02:09:24,875 --> 02:09:26,274
You actively napping?

1377
02:09:26,274 --> 02:09:28,676
I...I was...I... I...
I drifted.

1378
02:09:28,975 --> 02:09:30,277
Where did I lose you?

1379
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:34,378
Elevator in Switzerland.

1380
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:36,479
So you heard none of it?

1381
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:40,203
I'm sorry, I'm not that
kind of doctor.

1382
02:09:40,203 --> 02:09:42,884
I'm not a therapist, it's not
my training.

1383
02:09:42,885 --> 02:09:44,284
- So?
- I don't have the...

1384
02:09:44,385 --> 02:09:46,987
- What? The time?
- Temperament.

1385
02:09:47,087 --> 02:09:49,122
You know what? Now that I
think about it,

1386
02:09:49,122 --> 02:09:52,689
Oh God my original wound.
1983, alright?

1387
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:53,390
Yes.

1388
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:56,091
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny?
That was weird.

1389
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,087
