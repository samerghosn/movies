184
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,191
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

185

Oh, God.

189
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,513
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

190
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,238
Except one woman.

191
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,033
My Ovette.

192
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,875
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

193
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,634
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

194
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,554
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

195
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,515
Wouldn't move a muscle.

196
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,399
One might assume she was dead.

197
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,958

198
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,198

Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

you stupid raccoon.

You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

would learn how to properly lie.

I bet it's the one-inch man.

Yondu kept you.

kicked the crap out of me

To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

512
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,993
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

513

and you would tell
all the other children...

Over millions of years...

719
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,275
I learned to control

I grew smarter and stronger.

721
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,717

of finding it.

make a baby with your mother?

He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

1245
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:04,193
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

1246
01:20:05,479 --> 01:20:08,916
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1247
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,676
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1248
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,954
No, Peter...

1249
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:15,070
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

1250
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,630
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

1251
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,715
I'm immortal?

1252
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,239
Mmm-hmm.

1253
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:23,074
Really?

1254
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:26,073
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1255
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:30,310
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1256
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:32,788
like how you made this whole planet?

1257
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,314
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

1258
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:37,755
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

1259
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,920
What!

1260
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,670

I'm gonna make some weird shooot.

1264

But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1265
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,673
Only we can remake the universe.

1266
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,307
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1267
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:58,313
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1268
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:00,515

the type of thing you are.

what he wanted.

which is why you're here.

1298

I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

when I finally did find it...

to a profound realization.

My innate desire to seek out other life...

1306
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:07,631
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

It's a complete mess.

1954
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,359
I am Groot.

1955
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,470
I am not boring. You're boring.

1956
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,470
You know what's boring?

1957
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,791
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1958
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,555
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1959
02:14:23,079 --> 02:14:24,307
I'm not boring!

1960
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:25,479
I am Groot.

1961
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:29,627
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1962
02:15:05,479 --> 02:15:07,675
HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...

1963
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,836
just remember...

1964
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:15,519
We. Are. Groot.

1965
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,993
Hey, fellas.

1966
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:21,832
Wait, where are you going?

1967
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,354
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1968
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,192
How will I get out of here?

1969
02:15:26,359 --> 02:15:27,679
Hey! Aw, gee...

1970
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,479
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1971
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,873
Aw, guys.

1972
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:34,349
Oh, gee...
