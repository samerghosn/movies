1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,358
<i>Who am I? You sure you want to know?</i>

3
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,819
<i>The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

4
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,614
<i>If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...</i>

5
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:22,286
<i>if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

6
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,246
<i>somebody lied.</i>

7
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,709
<i>But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...</i>

8
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,294
<i>is all about a girl.</i>

9
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,632
<i>That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

10
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,885
<i>The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.</i>

11
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,722
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.</i>

12
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,890
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

13
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,811
Hey! Stop the bus!

14
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,979
<i>That's me.</i>

15
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,064
Tell him to stop! Please!

16
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,483
Stop!

17
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,902
Hey! Stop the bus!

18
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,156
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

19
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,574
Catch a cab, Parker!

20
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,830
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

21
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,545
What a geek!

22
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,425
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

23
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,177
Would you date him?

24
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,281
Midtown High seniors.

25
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,159
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

26
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,913
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

27
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,543
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

28
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,961
So behave accordingly.

29
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,173
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

30
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,007
Come on, stay together.

31
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,095
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

32
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,307
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

33
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,018
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

34
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,606
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?

35
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,608
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,487
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

37
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,031
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

38
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,994
because you flunked out
of private school?

39
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,329
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,334
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

41
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,836
It's just...

42
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,463
Just what, Harry?

43
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,173
Forget it.

44
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,511
Pete!

45
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,430
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

46
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,516
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.

47
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:55,439
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

48
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:59,108
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

49
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,196
I'm something of a scientist myself.

50
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,531
I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

51
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,744
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

52
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,247
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

53
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,959
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

54
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,797
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

55
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,637
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

56
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,764
I think he wants to adopt you.

57
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,644
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

58
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,648
<i>They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.</i>

59
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,941
That's amazing!

60
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:43,028
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

61
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,404
It's unreal.

62
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,367
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

63
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,079
varying strengths
to help them search for food.

64
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,500
<i>For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...</i>

65
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,838
has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

66
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,755
For the school paper?

67
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:12,266
<i>Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...</i>

68
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,350
<i>genus Kukulcania.</i>

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,939
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

70
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:24,403
proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in Bridges.

71
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,529
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

72
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,699
Or his father will fire your father.

73
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,451
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

74
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,122
What is going on?

75
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,375
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

76
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,586
- This spider...
- Let's go.

77
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,923
Hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

78
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,634
that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

79
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,971
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.

80
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,930
A spider-sense.

81
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,225
Hey, look at that spider.

82
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,812
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

83
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,982
It's a defense mechanism.

84
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,444
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

85
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,819
Who wouldn't?

86
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,824
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...

87
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,370
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

88
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,334
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

89
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,213
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

90
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,797
I love them!

91
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,007
Yeah, me too.

92
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,846
You know, spiders can change
their color...

93
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,850
- to blend into their environment.
- Really?

94
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,145
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

95
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,732
Transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

96
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,028
combining the genetic
information from all three...

97
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:52,865
into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

98
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,534
There's 14.

99
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,370
I beg your pardon?

100
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,081
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,628
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

102
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,841
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

103
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:14,096
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

104
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,014
Let's talk about listening.

105
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,188
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

106
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,274
but at Midtown High...

107
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,495
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

108
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,121
- Sure.
- Great.

109
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,624
Where do you want me?
Over here?

110
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,168
Yeah, that's great.

111
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,253
Don't make me look ugly.

112
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,462
That's impossible.

113
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,971
Perfect.

114
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,273
- Is that good?
- Great.

115
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,197
That's great.

116
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,787
M.J., let's go!

117
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,917
Wait. Thanks!

118
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,140
Parker, let's do it.

119
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,327
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

120
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,038
I've already seen the glider.

121
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,500
That's not what I'm here for.

122
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,378
General Slocum, good to see you again.

123
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,380
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

124
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,466
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

125
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,177
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

126
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,807
I want the report on human
performance enhancers.

127
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:26,477
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

128
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,522
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

129
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,773
Once.

130
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,609
All the tests since
have been successful.

131
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,529
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

132
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,032
Violence, aggression...

133
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,951
and insanity.

134
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,870
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,957
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

136
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,043
- ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

137
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,048
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

138
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,720
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

139
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,722
I'll be frank with you.

140
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,811
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

141
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,730
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

142
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,817
to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

143
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,071
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

144
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,326
have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

145
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,955
I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

146
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,417
Gentlemen. Ladies.

147
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:40,927
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

148
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,263
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

149
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,268
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

150
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,020
I'm already on my ass, May.

151
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,692
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

152
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,570
what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

153
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,114
Hand me that dish. The green one.

154
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,116
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

155
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,452
and upsizing their profits.

156
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,623
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

157
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,543
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

158
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,463
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

159
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,258
Computer...

160
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,220
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

161
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,139
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

162
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:32,729
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

163
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,816
I love you. And Peter loves you.

164
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,318
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

165
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,990
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

166
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,413
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

167
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,164
How you doing? How was the field trip?

168
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,168
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

169
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,837
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.

170
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,423
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

171
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,094
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

172
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,096
What's that all about?

173
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,578
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

174
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:35,375
<i>we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

175
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,629
<i>combining the genetic
information from all three...</i>

176
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:43,634
<i>into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

177
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,068
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

178
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,572
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

179
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,408
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

180
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,787
Don't be a coward.

181
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,831
Risks are part of laboratory science.

182
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,751
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

183
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,421
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?

184
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:26,092
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

185
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,011
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

186
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,849
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

187
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,769
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

188
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,356
40,000 years of evolution...

189
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,278
and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

190
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,459
Oh, that's cold.

191
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,186
Norman?

192
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,982
Norman!

193
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,037
Oh, my God.

194
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,957
Oh, my God!

195
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,461
Oh, my God! Norman!

196
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,479
Back to formula?

197
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,598
Weird.

198
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,903
- Peter?
- Yeah?

199
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,863
Are you all right?

200
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,407
I'm fine.

201
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,369
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

202
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,289
Yep. Big change.

203
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:47,461
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

204
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,230
Okay.

205
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:15,739
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

206
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,615
- I got better.
- See?

207
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,161
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

208
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,998
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

209
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,960
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

210
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,253
And don't start up with me.

211
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,509
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

212
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:40,180
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

213
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,933
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

214
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,994
Hi, M.J.

215
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,372
Hey, M.J.

216
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:10,169
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

217
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,672
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

218
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,173
I got the car. Hop in.

219
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,218
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

220
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,263
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

221
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,765
Or not.

222
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,940
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

223
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,028
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

224
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,070
Tell him to stop.

225
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,740
- Check him out!
- Dork!

226
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,472
Dad!

227
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,807
Dad, are you all right?

228
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:08,935
Harry.

229
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
What are you doing on the floor?

230
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,776
I don't know.

231
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,945
Have you been there all night?

232
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,199
Last night I was...

233
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:25,786
What?

234
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,455
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

235
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,333
Sir, I asked her to wait.

236
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,837
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

237
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,047
What?

238
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,800
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

239
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,346
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

240
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,515
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.

241
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,209
Wow! Great reflexes!

242
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,253
- Thanks.
- No problem.

243
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,259
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

244
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,678
You just get contacts?

245
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,604
Well, see you.

246
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,898
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

247
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,733
Did you see that?

248
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,987
Parker?

249
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,271
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?

250
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,441
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

251
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,361
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.

252
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,948
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

253
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:28,176
Help him, Harry.

254
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,641
How'd he do that?

255
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:36,977
Which one?

256
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,519
He's all yours, man.

257
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,746
Flash, get up!

258
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,500
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

259
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,921
That was amazing.

260
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,839
I'm out of here. Come on.

261
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,070
Go, web!

262
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,282
Fly.

263
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,952
Up, up and away, web.

264
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,955
Shazam!

265
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,790
Go! Go!

266
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,792
Go, web, go!

267
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,662
Tallyho.

268
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,165
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

269
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,625
Bring me some beer.

270
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,378
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

271
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,047
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

272
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,549
You're as stupid as your mother.

273
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,012
Where's she going?
Where you going?

274
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,433
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

275
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,936
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

276
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:53,275
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

277
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,986
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

278
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,573
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

279
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,491
I guess you can always hear us.

280
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,952
Everybody shouts.

281
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,538
Your aunt and uncle don't.

282
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,250
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

283
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,881
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

284
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,758
You really freaked us out.

285
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,219
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

286
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,472
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

287
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,770
So where are you going
after you graduate?

288
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,818
I wanna move into the city.

289
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:43,534
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

290
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,537
Work my way through college.

291
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,872
What about you?

292
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,040
Headed for the city too.

293
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,001
Can't wait to get out of here.

294
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,672
I wanna...

295
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,423
What?

296
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,512
No, come on. Try me.

297
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,932
I wanna...

298
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,393
act...

299
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,061
on-stage.

300
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,480
Really?

301
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,025
Oh, that's perfect.

302
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,862
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

303
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,029
- Really?
- Yeah.

304
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,659
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

305
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,369
Peter, that was first grade.

306
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:30,372
Well...

307
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,415
even so.

308
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,335
Sometimes...

309
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,837
you know people.

310
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:42,593
You can just see what's coming.

311
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,432
What do you see coming for you?

312
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,685
I don't know.

313
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:59,692
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

314
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,200
And what for me?

315
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,701
For you?

316
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,872
You're gonna light up Broadway.

317
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,708
You know...

318
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,714
you're taller than you look.

319
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,424
I hunch.

320
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,179
Don't.

321
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:34,269
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

322
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,646
Come on.

323
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,066
I gotta go.

324
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,067
Bye.

325
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,403
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

326
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,573
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

327
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,991
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

328
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,826
Pretty tight, huh?

329
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:55,582
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

330
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,585
Cool car.

331
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,346
What's going on in there?

332
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:36,182
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

333
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:40,019
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

334
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,396
Okay. Thanks.

335
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,556
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

336
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,393
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

337
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,228
I just don't know anymore.

338
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,190
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

339
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:28,777
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.

340
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:32,197
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

341
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,711
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.

342
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,257
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

343
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,385
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

344
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:58,599
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.

345
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:03,769
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

346
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:08,065
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.

347
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:11,235
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

348
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:14,447
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

349
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:19,161
You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

350
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,371
No. Not exactly.

351
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:25,458
These are the years
when a man changes...

352
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:29,630
into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

353
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,882
Just be careful who you change into.

354
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:38,931
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

355
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:42,184
But just because you can
beat him up...

356
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,894
doesn't give you the right to.

357
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:50,817
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

358
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,405
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

359
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,992
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

360
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:04,498
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.

361
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:07,501
Then stop pretending to be!

362
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:12,840
Right.

363
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,760
I'll pick you up here at 10.

364
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:54,840
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

365
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:03,599
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

366
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,938
Ladies and gentlemen...

367
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:14,650
give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

368
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:21,407
For $3000...

369
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:25,204
is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

370
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,083
for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

371
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,755
Who?

372
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,882
I know who.

373
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,887
The Flying Dutchman!

374
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,679
Next.

375
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:47,809
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

376
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,811
No, no. Sign me up.

377
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:53,648
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

378
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:58,027
for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

379
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:01,364
And you're participating
under your own free will?

380
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:05,577
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

381
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,414
Told you! Told you!

382
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,416
Winner!

383
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,835
Next victim!

384
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,590
Are you ready for more?

385
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,302
Bone Saw is ready!

386
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:30,393
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

387
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:35,315
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

388
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:39,945
the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

389
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,824
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

390
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,784
That's it? That's the best you got?

391
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,079
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

392
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,750
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

393
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:57,170
the terrifying, the deadly...

394
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,632
the amazing Spider-Man!

395
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,637
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.

396
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:08,849
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

397
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,896
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

398
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,190
I hope you brought your mommy.

399
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:20,610
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

400
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:26,282
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

401
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,827
Oh, my God!

402
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,661
Oh, my legs!

403
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,456
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

404
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:35,626
Kill! Kill! Kill!

405
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,385
Cage! Cage! Cage!

406
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,762
Cage!

407
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,563
Hello? Guys?

408
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:03,570
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

409
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:08,574
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

410
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,246
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

411
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,248
Hey, freak show!

412
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:17,083
You're going nowhere.

413
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,628
I got you for three minutes.

414
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,088
Three minutes of playtime.

415
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,181
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

416
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:36,436
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

417
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:43,652
Finish him off!

418
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,369
Smash him!

419
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:01,295
- Hit him!
- Harder!

420
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:05,632
Kick his spider ass!

421
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,802
Hit him!

422
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,025
One, two, three!

423
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:27,028
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

424
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:32,284
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

425
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,344
Now get out of here.

426
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,806
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

427
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,393
Well, check it again, webhead.

428
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,438
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

429
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:06,025
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

430
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,568
I need that money.

431
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:11,114
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

432
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:22,543
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

433
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,711
Hurry up!

434
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,137
Hey! He stole the gate!

435
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,264
Stop that guy!

436
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:39,101
Stop him! He's got my money!

437
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,561
Thanks.

438
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:44,188
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

439
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:46,608
Cut him off and call the cops!

440
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,820
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

441
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:54,365
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

442
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:15,679
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

443
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,306
Old dude, man.

444
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:22,686
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

445
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:25,688
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

446
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:31,277
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

447
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,614
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

448
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,409
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

449
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:42,079
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

450
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,664
Uncle Ben?

451
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,083
Uncle Ben.

452
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,172
Uncle Ben?

453
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,302
Peter.

454
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,972
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

455
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:05,811
Peter.

456
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:30,838
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

457
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:35,759
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

458
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,793
Get a unit to the rear!

459
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:19,380
I got the back!

460
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:33,644
Who's there?

461
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:03,050
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

462
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:07,721
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

463
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,389
Answer me!

464
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,061
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

465
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:21,235
<i>Thanks.</i>

466
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,246
See you.

467
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:57,396
<i>Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

468
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:42,565
Oh, no. My God.

469
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:48,155
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

470
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:59,458
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

471
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,128
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

472
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:08,717
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

473
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:12,971
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?

474
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:15,431
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

475
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,936
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

476
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:23,023
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

477
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,402
Preflight complete. Mark.

478
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:35,159
<i>An unidentified object
is closing fast.</i>

479
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,411
What's that?

480
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:38,079
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

481
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:39,914
Oh, my God!

482
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:53,052
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

483
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:55,429
Peter!

484
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:00,184
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

485
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:03,856
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

486
00:51:04,021 --> 00:51:05,565
- Great!
- You made it.

487
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,655
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

488
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:15,242
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

489
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:18,244
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

490
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:19,954
Yeah.

491
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:26,295
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

492
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,715
but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

493
00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:31,465
Commencement:

494
00:51:31,632 --> 00:51:35,762
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

495
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:41,268
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

496
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:44,021
You know what? Whatever.

497
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:46,023
Your loss.

498
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:50,277
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

499
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:54,280
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

500
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,422
Can I fix you something?

501
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,090
No, thanks.

502
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:59,054
I missed him a lot today.

503
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,141
I know.

504
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,728
I miss him too.

505
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,815
But he was there.

506
00:53:13,985 --> 00:53:19,199
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

507
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:24,413
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

508
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,250
You loved him...

509
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:32,170
and he loved you.

510
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:36,717
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

511
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:40,344
How you were meant for great things.

512
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:43,222
You won't disappoint him.

513
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:20,927
<i>With great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

514
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:24,306
<i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>

515
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:35,567
Hurry up!

516
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:51,708
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

517
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:55,086
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

518
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:01,927
Bobby. Get a load of this!

519
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:09,351
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

520
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:13,771
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

521
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:16,567
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

522
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:19,485
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

523
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:21,697
He stinks and I don't like him.

524
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:23,990
Don't move, lady!

525
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:34,835
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

526
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:37,170
Those tights and that tight little...

527
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:40,673
<i>Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug.</i>

528
00:55:40,882 --> 00:55:44,635
<i>But we should all just give him
One big hug.</i>

529
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:49,432
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man.</i>

530
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:56,856
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

531
00:55:57,023 --> 00:56:01,045
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

532
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:02,528
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

533
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,699
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

534
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:08,409
- Well?
- He's news.

535
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:11,121
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

536
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:15,291
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

537
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,630
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

538
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:23,759
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

539
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:26,719
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

540
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:29,931
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

541
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:32,559
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:

542
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:36,563
We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...

543
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,900
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

544
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,275
Every copy.

545
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:45,655
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

546
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:48,742
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.

547
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,577
- That can't be done.
- Get out!

548
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:55,623
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

549
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,918
Aw, what is he, shy?

550
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:02,088
If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

551
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:05,675
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider-Man picture."

552
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:09,304
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

553
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,193
Buzz off.

554
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:26,864
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

555
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:33,452
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

556
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:37,666
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

557
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,876
Yeah.

558
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:42,963
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

559
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,297
That's great.

560
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:48,092
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

561
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,887
Your drawer was short $6!

562
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:52,681
Next time, I'll take it
from your check.

563
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:57,561
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

564
00:57:57,768 --> 00:58:00,063
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

565
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:04,358
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

566
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:13,034
Some dream, huh?

567
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:16,538
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

568
00:58:16,704 --> 00:58:19,498
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

569
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:24,505
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

570
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,507
Oh, yeah. Right.

571
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:29,842
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

572
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,431
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

573
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:39,101
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

574
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:42,523
No, I guess not.

575
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:49,112
Thanks, Pete.

576
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,449
We should catch up sometime.

577
00:58:56,661 --> 00:58:59,206
Let's get some lunch some evening.

578
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:04,961
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

579
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,880
- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.

580
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:09,298
I won't.

581
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:13,219
I won't tell Harry.

582
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,983
Timing's perfect. Hey.

583
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:30,487
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

584
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:35,324
Norman's making his weekly inspection.

585
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,369
Spent half of it on the phone.

586
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:43,666
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

587
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,793
Are you all right?

588
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:51,675
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

589
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:55,929
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

590
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:57,639
You were late again?

591
00:59:58,264 --> 01:00:02,226
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

592
01:00:02,393 --> 01:00:03,644
Around.

593
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:05,521
Peter Parker.

594
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:08,358
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?

595
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:11,612
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

596
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:13,655
When do I get to meet her?

597
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:17,117
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

598
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:23,248
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

599
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:26,293
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

600
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,797
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.

601
01:00:30,963 --> 01:00:35,260
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn
what I get. I'll find work.

602
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,094
I respect that.

603
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,931
You want to make it on your own.

604
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,934
That's great.

605
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:45,144
What other skills do you have?

606
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:47,481
I was thinking about photography.

607
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:51,693
Hello.

608
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:55,905
Let's go! Move it!

609
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:58,742
Watch the street!

610
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:15,550
Cheese!

611
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:25,768
They're crap.

612
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:28,938
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

613
01:01:29,146 --> 01:01:32,317
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.

614
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:34,277
Take them somewhere else.

615
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:38,782
- <i>Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
- We'll put a rug there.</i>

616
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:41,117
Sit down. Give me that.

617
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:45,246
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.

618
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,748
- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?

619
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,253
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."

620
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,547
- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...

621
01:01:54,755 --> 01:01:57,425
I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

622
01:01:57,592 --> 01:01:59,594
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

623
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:03,556
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

624
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:06,809
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

625
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:08,644
Best thing for you.

626
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:13,150
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.

627
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:16,320
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

628
01:02:16,485 --> 01:02:20,782
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

629
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,577
- Hi.
- Hi.

630
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:27,206
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

631
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:31,418
- <i>Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.</i>

632
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,336
I'm Peter Parker.

633
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:38,007
I'm a photographer.

634
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,344
Yes. I can see that.

635
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:50,896
As of today...

636
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:55,067
OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

637
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:59,737
as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

638
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:02,740
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

639
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:06,077
costs are down, revenues are up...

640
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:09,164
and our stock
has never been higher.

641
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:13,751
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

642
01:03:14,585 --> 01:03:15,838
What?

643
01:03:16,045 --> 01:03:21,175
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

644
01:03:21,425 --> 01:03:24,179
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

645
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,514
Why wasn't I told?

646
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,768
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

647
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:32,353
The deal is off if you come with it.

648
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:35,940
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

649
01:03:36,148 --> 01:03:38,110
You can't do this to me.

650
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,574
I started this company.

651
01:03:44,615 --> 01:03:47,034
You know how much I sacrificed?!

652
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:56,335
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

653
01:03:56,878 --> 01:04:00,882
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

654
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:02,550
I'm sorry.

655
01:04:03,552 --> 01:04:05,679
You're out, Norman.

656
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:17,065
Am I?

657
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:27,784
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

658
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:07,740
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

659
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:12,454
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

660
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:17,166
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

661
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:20,086
I think you're beautiful.

662
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:36,143
I forgot my drink inside.

663
01:05:46,362 --> 01:05:48,489
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

664
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:54,746
- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

665
01:06:06,757 --> 01:06:09,260
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

666
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,434
What is that?

667
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,518
That's our glider!

668
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:29,364
What the hell was that?

669
01:06:57,768 --> 01:06:59,186
Code three!

670
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,371
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

671
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:26,797
Harry! Help me! Harry!

672
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,512
Out, am I?

673
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,271
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

674
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:46,148
Hello, my dear.

675
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,985
It's Spider-Man!

676
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:02,456
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

677
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,297
Somebody help him!

678
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:10,548
No!

679
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,092
Mommy!

680
01:08:15,094 --> 01:08:17,055
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

681
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:20,141
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

682
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:27,190
Impressive.

683
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:54,926
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

684
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:21,328
Hold on!

685
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:23,997
Watch out!

686
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:36,926
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

687
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,100
Well, beats taking the subway.

688
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:28,561
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

689
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:29,854
Wait.

690
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:31,273
Who are you?

691
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:34,025
- You know who I am.
- I do?

692
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,862
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

693
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:52,461
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

694
01:10:53,628 --> 01:10:57,298
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.

695
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,635
No, I'm gonna come...

696
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:03,387
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

697
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:06,557
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

698
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:09,019
I want to buy you something.

699
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:12,523
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

700
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:17,235
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

701
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:22,448
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

702
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,368
Don't let the bedbugs...

703
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:33,085
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

704
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:38,422
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

705
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:42,426
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

706
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:45,639
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

707
01:11:46,722 --> 01:11:48,225
You're right.

708
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:50,644
I didn't.

709
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:57,067
I'm gonna get some rest.

710
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,570
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

711
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:03,407
What was that thing?

712
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,324
I don't know.

713
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:10,122
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

714
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:27,180
Somebody there?

715
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,975
<i>Somebody.</i>

716
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,853
Who said that?

717
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,856
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

718
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:41,987
<i>You've known all along.</i>

719
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,367
Where are you?

720
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:51,579
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

721
01:12:58,462 --> 01:13:00,296
<i>I'm right here.</i>

722
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:04,051
I don't understand.

723
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:08,221
Did you think it was coincidence?

724
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:12,016
So many good things,
all happening for you.

725
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:15,854
All for you. Norman.

726
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:19,815
What do you want?

727
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,402
To say what you won't.

728
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:25,238
To do what you can't.

729
01:13:25,404 --> 01:13:29,993
To remove those in your way.

730
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:35,916
The board members.

731
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:38,585
You killed them.

732
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:40,295
We killed them.

733
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:41,671
We?

734
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,422
Remember?

735
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,260
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

736
01:13:48,136 --> 01:13:49,930
The performance enhancers.

737
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:55,394
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

738
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:59,398
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

739
01:13:59,564 --> 01:14:02,442
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

740
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,112
And it's only the beginning.

741
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:10,951
There's only one who can stop us.

742
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:15,122
Or imagine if he joined us.

743
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:23,130
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

744
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,632
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

745
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,802
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...

746
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,637
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

747
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:36,601
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

748
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,104
How about "Green Meanie"?

749
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:42,149
Spider-Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.

750
01:14:42,315 --> 01:14:44,650
It is not. I resent that.

751
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:47,654
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

752
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,488
You don't trust anybody.

753
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:51,699
I trust my barber.

754
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:54,036
Are you his lawyer?

755
01:14:54,243 --> 01:14:58,998
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

756
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:09,635
Jameson, you slime.

757
01:15:09,842 --> 01:15:13,137
Who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

758
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:16,265
- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!

759
01:15:16,432 --> 01:15:19,435
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

760
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:22,523
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

761
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:24,983
Set him down, tough guy.

762
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:29,820
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!

763
01:15:30,029 --> 01:15:32,615
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

764
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:35,284
Sleep...

765
01:15:49,757 --> 01:15:53,761
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

766
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:58,350
No, you're not dead yet.

767
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,726
Just paralyzed...

768
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:02,854
temporarily.

769
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:06,942
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

770
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:09,819
You and I are not so different.

771
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:13,865
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

772
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,952
Well, to each his own.

773
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:20,079
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

774
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:25,377
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

775
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:28,838
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

776
01:16:29,046 --> 01:16:32,634
is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

777
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:37,346
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

778
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:38,599
Why bother?

779
01:16:38,806 --> 01:16:43,520
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

780
01:16:43,936 --> 01:16:46,939
There are eight million people
in this city.

781
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:51,444
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

782
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:55,615
of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

783
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,201
You, me...

784
01:16:57,783 --> 01:16:59,703
we're exceptional.

785
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:04,625
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

786
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:08,503
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

787
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:12,256
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

788
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:15,219
What we could create.

789
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:17,804
Or we could destroy.

790
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:21,934
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

791
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:27,021
again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

792
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:31,902
Think about it, hero.

793
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:49,211
<i>In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

794
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:01,014
It's me again.

795
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:02,807
How was your audition?

796
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:06,019
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

797
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:08,145
told my aunt, told me.

798
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:09,939
So you just came by?

799
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:13,777
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

800
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:18,532
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

801
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:20,283
So how'd it go?

802
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:25,037
They said I needed acting lessons.

803
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:28,958
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

804
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:34,463
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

805
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:37,885
I'd like a cheeseburger.

806
01:18:38,342 --> 01:18:41,805
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

807
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:43,640
Come with us.

808
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:46,560
No, thanks. How's it going with?

809
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:50,980
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

810
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,983
It's not?

811
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,069
Why so interested?

812
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,238
I'm not.

813
01:18:58,488 --> 01:18:59,864
You're not?

814
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:04,243
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

815
01:19:04,493 --> 01:19:06,287
Why would you be?

816
01:19:08,164 --> 01:19:10,501
I, that's a...

817
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,211
I don't know.

818
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:17,256
Sorry you won't come with us.

819
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:21,677
I'd better run, tiger.

820
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:32,396
Hey, check it out, man.

821
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:34,233
Come on, man.

822
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:41,030
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

823
01:19:58,923 --> 01:20:00,384
Get off me!

824
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:35,168
Wait!

825
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:42,384
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

826
01:20:42,551 --> 01:20:46,930
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

827
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:49,015
I was in the neighborhood.

828
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:53,520
You are amazing.

829
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,190
Some people don't think so.

830
01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:01,278
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

831
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:05,239
Do I get to say thank you this time?

832
01:21:06,115 --> 01:21:07,618
Wait.

833
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:18,729
Let me in! My baby's in there!

834
01:22:18,896 --> 01:22:21,024
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!

835
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:24,694
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

836
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:26,238
Look! Up there!

837
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:34,662
Save my baby, please!

838
01:22:58,395 --> 01:22:59,520
No!

839
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:11,283
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

840
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:15,244
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

841
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:17,206
Don't let him get away!

842
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:20,667
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

843
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:24,171
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

844
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:26,965
I'm going.

845
01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:31,677
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.

846
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:33,221
Go! Go!

847
01:23:42,146 --> 01:23:43,856
Where are you?

848
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,485
Where are you?

849
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:55,243
I'm gonna get you out of here!

850
01:23:57,828 --> 01:23:59,331
It's okay.

851
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,966
You're pathetically predictable.

852
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:11,051
Like a moth to the flame.

853
01:24:11,926 --> 01:24:14,387
What about my generous proposal?

854
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,266
Are you in or are you out?

855
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:24,398
- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

856
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:26,315
Oh, great.

857
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:07,774
No one says no to me!

858
01:25:15,114 --> 01:25:18,534
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

859
01:25:21,037 --> 01:25:22,288
He's here.

860
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,582
Are you ready?

861
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:29,087
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

862
01:25:29,296 --> 01:25:32,381
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

863
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:36,011
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

864
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:38,971
Who is this lovely young lady?

865
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:43,435
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

866
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:46,313
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

867
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:50,234
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

868
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:52,778
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

869
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:02,119
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

870
01:26:05,122 --> 01:26:06,625
Peter?

871
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:16,385
Is that you?

872
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:26,019
How strange. There's nobody here.

873
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:36,947
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

874
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:12,190
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

875
01:27:12,356 --> 01:27:14,109
It's a jungle out there.

876
01:27:14,275 --> 01:27:18,197
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these Cranberries.

877
01:27:18,654 --> 01:27:21,490
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

878
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:23,243
and we can say grace.

879
01:27:26,787 --> 01:27:28,539
Here we go.

880
01:27:35,506 --> 01:27:37,841
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

881
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:43,930
Will you do the honors?

882
01:27:55,609 --> 01:27:58,862
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

883
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:07,037
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

884
01:28:07,203 --> 01:28:08,747
Well, let me see.

885
01:28:08,956 --> 01:28:10,457
Oh, my goodness.

886
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:13,126
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

887
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:16,421
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

888
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:21,926
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

889
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:25,972
How did you say that happened?

890
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:28,100
Bike messenger.

891
01:28:28,307 --> 01:28:30,269
Knocked me down.

892
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:39,319
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

893
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:43,614
Something has come to my attention.

894
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:45,074
Are you all right?

895
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:48,787
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

896
01:28:49,412 --> 01:28:51,789
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

897
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:57,753
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

898
01:28:57,962 --> 01:28:59,631
I've got to go.

899
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:04,094
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

900
01:29:04,302 --> 01:29:08,265
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

901
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:11,518
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.

902
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:17,106
They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.

903
01:29:17,315 --> 01:29:18,567
You're wrong, Dad.

904
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:22,320
A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:

905
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:26,365
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

906
01:29:36,752 --> 01:29:39,296
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

907
01:29:39,505 --> 01:29:42,466
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

908
01:29:42,673 --> 01:29:46,552
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

909
01:29:46,802 --> 01:29:49,139
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

910
01:29:49,305 --> 01:29:50,974
Harry Osborn!

911
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,101
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

912
01:29:57,064 --> 01:30:00,399
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

913
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:03,694
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

914
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,238
I can't.

915
01:30:05,404 --> 01:30:08,408
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

916
01:30:08,658 --> 01:30:10,911
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

917
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:14,372
What do I do?

918
01:30:14,581 --> 01:30:18,668
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

919
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:21,880
<i>Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.</i>

920
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,422
Yes?

921
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:25,509
<i>And then Grant his wish.</i>

922
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:27,719
But how?

923
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:32,224
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

924
01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:33,600
Tell me how!

925
01:30:33,766 --> 01:30:35,935
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

926
01:30:36,185 --> 01:30:39,230
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

927
01:30:41,108 --> 01:30:44,610
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

928
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:47,780
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

929
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:51,868
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

930
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:02,171
Deliver us!

931
01:31:02,378 --> 01:31:03,755
Finish it!

932
01:31:04,046 --> 01:31:07,967
- Finish it!
- From evil!

933
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:15,850
Two milligrams IV.

934
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:18,895
Get the BP.

935
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:22,899
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

936
01:31:23,108 --> 01:31:24,443
You have to leave.

937
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:26,319
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

938
01:31:26,485 --> 01:31:30,573
Those horrible yellow eyes!

939
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:37,956
He knows who I am.

940
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,502
I'm sorry.

941
01:32:27,213 --> 01:32:29,675
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.

942
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:32,511
She's been sleeping all day.

943
01:32:33,511 --> 01:32:36,265
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

944
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:43,354
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

945
01:32:43,521 --> 01:32:47,234
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

946
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:50,404
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

947
01:32:50,863 --> 01:32:53,030
I haven't called him back.

948
01:32:55,117 --> 01:32:56,827
The fact is...

949
01:32:57,994 --> 01:33:00,831
- I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

950
01:33:00,997 --> 01:33:03,207
At least I think I am.

951
01:33:04,877 --> 01:33:07,921
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

952
01:33:08,087 --> 01:33:11,341
Would I know his name, this guy?

953
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:14,427
You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.

954
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:15,970
Trust me.

955
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:17,471
It's funny.

956
01:33:19,474 --> 01:33:23,436
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

957
01:33:23,604 --> 01:33:26,981
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

958
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:30,152
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

959
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:34,655
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

960
01:33:34,823 --> 01:33:37,743
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

961
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:39,578
I know him a little bit.

962
01:33:39,786 --> 01:33:42,663
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

963
01:33:42,872 --> 01:33:46,001
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

964
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:47,793
What'd he say?

965
01:33:48,377 --> 01:33:49,712
I said...

966
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:55,092
He asked me what I thought about you.

967
01:33:56,011 --> 01:33:58,055
And what did you say?

968
01:33:58,764 --> 01:34:02,850
I said, "Spider-Man."

969
01:34:03,185 --> 01:34:08,064
I said, "The great thing about M.J..."

970
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:09,815
is...

971
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:13,987
when you look in her eyes...

972
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:19,743
and she's looking back in yours...

973
01:34:20,743 --> 01:34:23,747
everything feels...

974
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:26,792
not quite normal.

975
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,837
Because you feel...

976
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:32,005
stronger...

977
01:34:33,548 --> 01:34:37,176
and weaker at the same time.

978
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:40,346
You feel excited...

979
01:34:41,222 --> 01:34:43,266
and at the same time...

980
01:34:43,891 --> 01:34:45,519
terrified.

981
01:34:47,854 --> 01:34:52,149
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

982
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:57,197
except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

983
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:01,784
It's as if you've...

984
01:35:02,411 --> 01:35:05,581
reached the unreachable...

985
01:35:07,164 --> 01:35:09,877
"...and you weren't ready for it."

986
01:35:13,337 --> 01:35:15,090
You said that?

987
01:35:15,882 --> 01:35:18,217
Well, something like that.

988
01:36:02,512 --> 01:36:04,014
Dad?

989
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:11,438
Dad, is that you?

990
01:36:18,028 --> 01:36:19,529
What is it?

991
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:26,787
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

992
01:36:27,787 --> 01:36:30,498
She's in love with Peter.

993
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:32,583
- Parker?
- Yeah.

994
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:35,878
And how does he feel about her?

995
01:36:37,296 --> 01:36:39,841
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

996
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:46,055
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

997
01:36:48,975 --> 01:36:50,726
I'm so sorry.

998
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:56,649
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

999
01:36:58,402 --> 01:37:01,613
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1000
01:37:01,779 --> 01:37:03,614
That's no excuse.

1001
01:37:04,615 --> 01:37:06,409
I'm proud of you.

1002
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:11,832
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1003
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:15,252
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1004
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:31,185
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

1005
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,853
Wake up.

1006
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:35,771
Go home, dear.

1007
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,315
You look awful.

1008
01:37:37,524 --> 01:37:39,818
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1009
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:43,322
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1010
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:46,199
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1011
01:37:46,365 --> 01:37:51,913
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1012
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:54,416
A smile. Finally.

1013
01:37:54,582 --> 01:37:58,921
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1014
01:37:59,087 --> 01:38:01,381
You were supposed to be asleep.

1015
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:06,970
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1016
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:11,182
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1017
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:17,648
you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1018
01:38:17,855 --> 01:38:21,400
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1019
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:26,823
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1020
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:30,786
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1021
01:38:30,993 --> 01:38:35,582
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1022
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,918
You're so mysterious all the time.

1023
01:38:39,168 --> 01:38:41,921
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1024
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:46,092
to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1025
01:38:46,551 --> 01:38:48,970
Everybody else knows.

1026
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:53,182
I'll be right back.

1027
01:38:53,891 --> 01:38:55,185
But...

1028
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,528
Come on, pick up.

1029
01:39:04,694 --> 01:39:07,989
- <i>Hey M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1030
01:39:09,032 --> 01:39:11,076
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1031
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:14,203
Hello? You there?

1032
01:39:14,704 --> 01:39:19,208
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1033
01:39:19,376 --> 01:39:20,793
All right, well...

1034
01:39:21,211 --> 01:39:22,253
Don't...

1035
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:25,256
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1036
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:26,966
Hello?

1037
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:33,097
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

1038
01:39:33,306 --> 01:39:35,057
Where is she?

1039
01:40:21,313 --> 01:40:22,980
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1040
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:27,819
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout.</i>

1041
01:40:27,985 --> 01:40:32,157
<i>Down came the goblin
And took the spider out.</i>

1042
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:50,716
Goblin, what have you done?

1043
01:41:33,176 --> 01:41:37,055
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1044
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:39,099
Because you never know...

1045
01:41:39,265 --> 01:41:44,020
when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1046
01:41:45,146 --> 01:41:47,774
Let die the woman you love...

1047
01:41:52,069 --> 01:41:57,158
or suffer the little children.

1048
01:41:59,536 --> 01:42:02,038
- Spider-Man!
- Save us!

1049
01:42:02,538 --> 01:42:04,832
Save us!

1050
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:07,711
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1051
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,297
and see how a hero is rewarded.

1052
01:42:11,465 --> 01:42:13,550
Don't do it, Goblin!

1053
01:42:13,716 --> 01:42:16,636
We are who we choose to be.

1054
01:42:16,886 --> 01:42:19,640
- Now, choose!
- No!

1055
01:42:48,335 --> 01:42:49,920
Everybody stay still!

1056
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:00,721
Ahoy up there!

1057
01:43:00,889 --> 01:43:03,850
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1058
01:43:11,358 --> 01:43:15,487
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1059
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:17,154
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1060
01:43:22,243 --> 01:43:25,288
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1061
01:43:25,454 --> 01:43:27,039
Trust me.

1062
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:32,378
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1063
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:38,760
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1064
01:43:38,969 --> 01:43:40,636
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1065
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:11,710
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1066
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:24,805
It's time to die.

1067
01:44:31,813 --> 01:44:35,650
- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!

1068
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:39,238
Leave Spider-Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

1069
01:44:39,904 --> 01:44:43,408
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1070
01:44:43,574 --> 01:44:47,119
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1071
01:44:59,632 --> 01:45:01,426
Spider-Man, watch out!

1072
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:37,546
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1073
01:45:38,462 --> 01:45:41,091
I offered you friendship...

1074
01:45:41,257 --> 01:45:43,135
and you spat in my face.

1075
01:46:34,228 --> 01:46:37,898
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1076
01:46:38,064 --> 01:46:41,400
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

1077
01:46:41,568 --> 01:46:43,237
would have been quick.

1078
01:46:43,403 --> 01:46:46,823
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1079
01:46:47,073 --> 01:46:51,953
I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1080
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:58,585
M.J. and I...

1081
01:46:59,418 --> 01:47:02,713
we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1082
01:47:56,518 --> 01:47:58,060
Peter, stop!

1083
01:47:58,228 --> 01:48:00,689
Stop! It's me.

1084
01:48:09,655 --> 01:48:11,158
Mr. Osborn.

1085
01:48:11,324 --> 01:48:12,868
Thank God for you.

1086
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:15,412
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1087
01:48:15,578 --> 01:48:18,623
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1088
01:48:18,789 --> 01:48:20,542
Don't let him take me again.

1089
01:48:20,708 --> 01:48:22,752
I beg you. Protect me.

1090
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,506
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1091
01:48:26,672 --> 01:48:28,175
But not you.

1092
01:48:28,841 --> 01:48:32,804
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1093
01:48:33,012 --> 01:48:35,097
I would never hurt you.

1094
01:48:35,306 --> 01:48:37,225
I knew from the beginning...

1095
01:48:37,434 --> 01:48:40,354
if anything ever happened to me...

1096
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,648
it was you I could count on.

1097
01:48:42,814 --> 01:48:46,193
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1098
01:48:46,777 --> 01:48:48,612
Thank God for you.

1099
01:48:49,613 --> 01:48:51,030
Give me your hand.

1100
01:48:52,198 --> 01:48:55,618
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1101
01:48:57,037 --> 01:48:59,831
I've been like a father to you.

1102
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:03,042
Be a son to me now.

1103
01:49:04,837 --> 01:49:06,712
I have a father.

1104
01:49:07,463 --> 01:49:09,966
His name was Ben Parker.

1105
01:49:11,844 --> 01:49:13,302
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1106
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:33,739
Peter.

1107
01:49:36,076 --> 01:49:37,911
Don't tell Harry.

1108
01:50:09,609 --> 01:50:11,319
What have you done?

1109
01:50:11,485 --> 01:50:13,070
What have you done?!

1110
01:50:41,225 --> 01:50:43,268
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1111
01:50:44,185 --> 01:50:47,314
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1112
01:50:49,483 --> 01:50:52,778
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1113
01:50:54,363 --> 01:50:56,657
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1114
01:50:58,533 --> 01:51:01,662
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1115
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:08,502
Thank God for you, Peter.

1116
01:51:09,211 --> 01:51:11,671
You're the only family I have.

1117
01:51:36,195 --> 01:51:38,489
<i>No matter what I do...</i>

1118
01:51:38,657 --> 01:51:41,784
<i>no matter how hard I try...</i>

1119
01:51:42,368 --> 01:51:46,206
<i>the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1120
01:51:56,925 --> 01:51:59,261
You must miss him so much.

1121
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:03,265
It's been so hard without him.

1122
01:52:06,185 --> 01:52:09,061
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1123
01:52:10,855 --> 01:52:12,649
When I was up there...

1124
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:16,194
and I thought I was gonna die...

1125
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:21,658
there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1126
01:52:22,951 --> 01:52:26,162
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1127
01:52:27,622 --> 01:52:30,042
It was you, Pete.

1128
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:32,793
I kept thinking:

1129
01:52:33,212 --> 01:52:36,006
"I hope I make it through this...

1130
01:52:37,466 --> 01:52:41,845
so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1131
01:52:43,221 --> 01:52:44,722
Really?

1132
01:52:45,097 --> 01:52:50,895
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1133
01:52:52,146 --> 01:52:54,106
who makes me feel...

1134
01:52:54,565 --> 01:52:58,278
like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1135
01:53:00,404 --> 01:53:02,073
That I'm just...

1136
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:04,243
me.

1137
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:07,246
And that's okay.

1138
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:10,916
The truth is...

1139
01:53:13,042 --> 01:53:14,837
I love you.

1140
01:53:16,963 --> 01:53:18,881
I love you so much, Peter.

1141
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:44,365
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1142
01:53:44,533 --> 01:53:46,451
I can't...

1143
01:53:48,578 --> 01:53:50,122
You can't what?

1144
01:53:51,247 --> 01:53:52,707
Tell you...

1145
01:53:54,417 --> 01:53:58,755
everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1146
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,760
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1147
01:54:04,677 --> 01:54:06,637
I want you to know...

1148
01:54:07,055 --> 01:54:09,725
that I will always be there
for you.

1149
01:54:09,932 --> 01:54:13,895
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1150
01:54:14,896 --> 01:54:16,899
I promise you that.

1151
01:54:20,194 --> 01:54:22,487
I will always be your friend.

1152
01:54:25,407 --> 01:54:27,283
Only a friend...

1153
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,703
Peter Parker?

1154
01:54:31,872 --> 01:54:34,707
That's all I have to give.

1155
01:55:01,068 --> 01:55:03,737
<i>Whatever life holds in store for me...</i>

1156
01:55:03,904 --> 01:55:06,782
I will never forget these words:

1157
01:55:06,989 --> 01:55:12,037
<i>"With great power
comes great responsibility."</i>

1158
01:55:12,203 --> 01:55:14,456
<i>This is my gift.</i>

1159
01:55:14,622 --> 01:55:16,750
<i>My curse.</i>

1160
01:55:17,251 --> 01:55:19,168
<i>Who am I?</i>

1161
01:55:19,545 --> 01:55:20,921
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>
