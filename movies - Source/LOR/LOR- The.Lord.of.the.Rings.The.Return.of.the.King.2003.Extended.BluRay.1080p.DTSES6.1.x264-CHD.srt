1
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,123
Smeagol!

2
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,534
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,164
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!

4
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,459
Pull it in. Go on. Go on.
Go on. Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:37,510
Deagol!

6
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,735
Deagol?

7
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,528
Deagol.

8
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,423
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:05,675
Why?

10
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:09,014
Because...

11
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,939
it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:52,237
My precious.

13
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,716
They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,259
Murderer.

15
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:06,884
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:11,846
They cursed us and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,685
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:16,562
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,687
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,237
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,988
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,362
- and cool
- So nice for feet

23
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,752
And we only wish To catch a fish

24
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:44,172
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,057
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:57,843
the sound of trees...

27
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,934
the softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:08,237
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:22,790
My precious.

30
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,288
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,002
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,968
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,009
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,850
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:25,478
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,230
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,355
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,024
No.

39
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,108
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:40,319
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:43,069
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,543
Come on!

43
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:54,206
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,755
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,798
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:09,845
Here.

47
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,896
What about you?

48
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:18,439
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,408
Sam.

50
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:24,538
All right.

51
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,196
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,245
We have to be careful or
we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,338
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,918
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,086
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,461
For what?

57
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,884
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,057
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,318
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,739
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,577
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,903
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,005
It's good.

64
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,668
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,010
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:18,682
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:23,024
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:27,774
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,817
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,668
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,086
to Isengard!

72
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:54,220
You young rascals! A merry
hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:59,385
and now we find you feasting and...
and smoking!

74
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:02,730
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,399
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:11,320
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,240
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,870
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,875
who's taken over management of Isengard.

80
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:27,422
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:32,169
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,758
Wood and water, stock
and stone I can master.

83
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:40,599
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,763
locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,769
Show yourself.

86
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,734
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,197
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,488
Well, let's just have his
head and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:56,697
No.

90
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,360
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,946
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:09,046
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

93
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,707
and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:15,841
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:19,216
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,299
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,350
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:29,566
when you answer for the
burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,485
and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:37,402
We shall have peace when the
lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,652
whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,363
against the gates of the
Hornburg, are avenged!

103
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:50,503
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,663
we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,130
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:00,716
Dotard!

107
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,017
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,510
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,605
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

110
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,772
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,899
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

112
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,446
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,990
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,450
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,908
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,620
I have some for you.

117
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:41,046
Something festers in the
heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,461
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,474
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,221
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:59,317
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,654
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,410
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:14,206
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:20,462
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:25,466
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,595
those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:34,184
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:37,390
before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:44,528
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,024
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,027
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,196
No.

134
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,870
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,990
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,498
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,179
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:14,390
your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,730
Grima, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,577
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,580
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,993
Come down.

143
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:39,870
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:43,036
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:46,879
but a thatched barn where
brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,750
and their brats roll on
the floor with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:57,716
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:02,931
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:06,984
Grima...

150
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:09,693
come down.

151
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,442
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:15,614
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

153
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:18,616
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:21,654
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,455
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:27,120
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:33,875
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:37,588
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,251
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,336
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,000
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:36,144
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:40,153
is washing away.

164
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:44,869
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,531
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,914
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

167
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,546
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,596
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,387
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,434
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:04,196
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,906
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,488
Hail!

174
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,374
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,713
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,881
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,136
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,473
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,060
To victory!

180
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,529
Westu, Aragorn, hál.
(Be thou, Aragorn, well.)

181
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,686
I am happy for you.

182
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,479
He is an honorable man.

183
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:31,362
You are both honorable men.

184
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:38,540
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

185
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:48,541
Don't listen to me.

186
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,878
You are young.

187
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,378
And tonight is for you.

188
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,395
Here, here.

189
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:16,825
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

190
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,452
I feel something.

191
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,076
A slight tingle in my fingers.

192
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,375
I think it's affecting me.

193
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,009
What did I say?

194
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:37,511
He can't hold his liquor.

195
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,183
Game over.

196
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:49,772
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

197
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,893
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

198
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:58,449
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

199
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:02,532
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

200
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:05,872
But the only brew for the brave and true

201
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:09,782
Pippin!

202
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:13,290
But the only brew for the brave and true

203
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,337
Comes from The Green Dragon

204
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,890
Thank you! I win!

205
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,134
No news of Frodo?

206
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,811
No word. Nothing.

207
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,807
We have time.

208
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,605
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

209
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:40,442
Do we know that?

210
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:45,996
What does your heart tell you?

211
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:56,380
That Frodo is alive.

212
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,343
Yes.

213
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,088
Yes, he's alive.

214
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,186
Too risky. Too risky.

215
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,599
Thieves.

216
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,811
They stole it from us.

217
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:17,482
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

218
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:22,365
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

219
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:25,070
Mustn't ruin it now.

220
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:27,320
But they knows.

221
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,369
They knows.

222
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,161
They suspects us.

223
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,911
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

224
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:40,671
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

225
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:43,714
No. Not.

226
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:48,134
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

227
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:53,135
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

228
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:55,851
And we will.

229
00:23:56,023 --> 00:24:00,068
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

230
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:06,076
It's ours!

231
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,912
Ours!

232
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,907
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

233
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:16,498
Patience! Patience, my love.

234
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,047
First we must lead them to her.

235
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:26,917
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

236
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:29,765
Yes, the stairs. And then?

237
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:32,932
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

238
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:39,519
until we come to the tunnel.

239
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,019
And when they go in...

240
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:45,981
there's no coming out.

241
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:49,778
She's always hungry.

242
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:54,746
She always needs to feed.

243
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:56,325
She must eat.

244
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,622
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

245
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,545
And they doesn't taste very
nice, does they, precious?

246
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,796
No.

247
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:08,673
Not very nice at all, my love.

248
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,632
She hungers for sweeter meats.

249
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,633
Hobbit meat.

250
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:18,635
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

251
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:21,896
then we will find it.

252
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:26,394
And take it for me!

253
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:29,566
For us.

254
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:33,075
Yes. We meant "for us."

255
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:36,694
Gollum. Gollum.

256
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:41,367
The precious will be ours...

257
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:46,038
once the Hobbitses are dead!

258
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,007
You treacherous little toad!

259
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,007
No! No! Master!

260
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,804
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

261
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,351
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

262
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,681
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,762
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

264
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,520
who hates Smeagol...

265
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,481
and who makes up nasty lies.

266
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:14,324
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

267
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,980
Sam!

268
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,656
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

269
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:23,535
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

270
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,875
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

271
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,540
You don't see it, do you?

272
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,374
He's a villain.

273
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,000
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

274
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,715
I need you on my side.

275
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

276
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,307
I know, Sam. I know.

277
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,848
Trust me.

278
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,396
Come, Smeagol.

279
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,801
What time is it?

280
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:04,633
Not yet dawn.

281
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:14,598
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

282
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:18,772
climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

283
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:22,484
I stood upon the brink.

284
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:26,575
It was utterly dark in the
abyss before my feet.

285
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:31,282
A light shone behind me...

286
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:34,324
but I could not turn.

287
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:37,917
I could only stand there, waiting.

288
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,086
Night changes many thoughts.

289
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:44,626
Sleep, Eowyn.

290
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,421
Sleep...

291
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,016
while you can.

292
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,455
The stars are veiled.

293
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:22,961
Something stirs in the east.

294
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,751
A sleepless malice.

295
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:31,549
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

296
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:47,692
What are you doing?

297
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:53,786
Pippin!

298
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,038
Pippin?

299
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:17,261
Pippin.

300
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:20,605
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

301
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:21,885
Just one more time.

302
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:24,223
Put it back.

303
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:36,285
Pippin.

304
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,288
No!

305
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:50,627
Pippin.

306
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,169
He is here.

307
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:57,634
I see you.

308
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,268
Pippin!

309
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,661
Help! Gandalf, help!

310
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,287
Someone help him!

311
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:30,869
Pippin!

312
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,251
Fool of a Took!

313
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,568
Look at me.

314
00:31:58,532 --> 00:32:02,661
Gandalf, forgive me.

315
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:04,702
Look at me.

316
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,700
What did you see?

317
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,287
A tree.

318
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:15,130
There was a white tree...

319
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,794
in a courtyard of stone.

320
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,875
It was dead.

321
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:26,884
The city was burning.

322
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,430
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

323
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:33,144
I saw...

324
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,903
I saw him.

325
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,150
I could hear his voice in my head.

326
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:45,733
And what did you tell him?

327
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:47,739
Speak!

328
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,084
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

329
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,713
He hurt me.

330
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:59,336
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

331
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,300
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

332
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,382
A fool...

333
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:10,847
but an honest fool he remains.

334
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:14,846
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

335
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,271
We've been strangely fortunate.

336
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:22,310
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

337
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,190
Sauron moves to strike the
city of Minas Tirith.

338
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,535
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

339
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:34,031
He knows the heir of
Elendil has come forth.

340
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,332
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

341
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:40,287
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

342
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,381
Sauron fears this.

343
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,880
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

344
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:50,463
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

345
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:54,141
before he sees a king return
to the throne of Men.

346
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:58,226
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

347
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,355
Tell me...

348
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:05,310
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

349
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,027
What do we owe Gondor?

350
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:14,202
- I will go.
- No!

351
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:17,539
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

352
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:23,501
You must come to Minas
Tirith by another road.

353
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:28,510
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

354
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:31,429
Understand this:

355
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:35,262
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

356
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,844
I ride for Minas Tirith...

357
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,777
and I won't be going alone.

358
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:49,193
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

359
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,860
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:54,778
Where are we going?

361
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,199
Why did you look?

362
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:59,123
Why do you always have to look?

363
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,375
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

364
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:04,246
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,257
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

366
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,967
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

367
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:15,885
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

368
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,978
And you...? You're coming with me?

369
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:23,599
Merry?

370
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,054
Come on.

371
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:31,947
How far is Minas Tirith?

372
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:34,735
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

373
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:38,409
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

374
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,615
Here.

375
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:42,581
Something for the road.

376
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,416
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

377
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:49,583
I know you've run out. You
smoke too much, Pippin.

378
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:52,248
But... But we'll see each other soon.

379
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:58,086
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

380
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:02,139
I don't know what's going to happen.

381
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,018
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

382
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:05,646
Show us the meaning of haste.

383
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:07,724
Merry!

384
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,315
Merry!

385
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,289
He's always followed me...

386
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:34,003
everywhere I went...

387
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,132
since before we were tweens.

388
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:41,217
I would get him into the
worst sort of trouble...

389
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,465
but I was always there to get him out.

390
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,811
Now he's gone.

391
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:52,398
Just like Frodo and Sam.

392
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,777
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

393
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,606
They're a most hardy folk.

394
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:01,856
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

395
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,628
Take her by the safest road.

396
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:21,293
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

397
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:25,338
It waits to carry her across the sea.

398
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:28,885
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

399
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,585
There is nothing for you here...

400
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:40,293
only death.

401
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:48,876
Lady Arwen...

402
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,715
we cannot delay.

403
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:55,429
My lady!

404
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,452
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

405
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,581
You have the gift of foresight.

406
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,543
What did you see?

407
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,505
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

408
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,172
But there is also life.

409
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:34,139
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

410
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:37,304
That future is almost gone.

411
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,469
But it is not lost.

412
00:39:42,065 --> 00:39:44,271
Nothing is certain.

413
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:48,690
Some things are certain.

414
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:55,327
If I leave him now...

415
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:58,115
I will regret it forever.

416
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:01,532
It is time.

417
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:10,581
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

418
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,175
A light from the shadow shall spring

419
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,632
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

420
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,226
The crownless again shall be king

421
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:34,027
Re-forge the sword.

422
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,380
Ada.
(Father.)

423
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:11,603
Your hands are cold.

424
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:18,108
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

425
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:23,445
This was my choice.

426
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,579
Whether by your will or not...

427
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:33,213
there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

428
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,262
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

429
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,141
Minas Tirith.

430
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,061
City of kings.

431
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:13,226
Make way!

432
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:44,251
It's the tree.

433
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:46,085
Gandalf. Gandalf.

434
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,501
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

435
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,505
The tree of the king.

436
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:53,351
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

437
00:43:53,518 --> 00:43:56,186
He is a steward only, a
caretaker of the throne.

438
00:43:56,936 --> 00:44:00,472
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

439
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:04,809
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

440
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:08,730
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

441
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:12,367
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

442
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:18,070
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

443
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:54,737
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

444
00:45:00,248 --> 00:45:04,956
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

445
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,289
Perhaps you come to explain this.

446
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,472
Perhaps you come to tell
me why my son is dead.

447
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:36,947
Boromir died to save us...

448
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:38,777
my kinsman and me.

449
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:42,452
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

450
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:51,411
I offer you my service, such as it is...

451
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,958
in payment of this debt.

452
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:59,469
This is my first command to you.

453
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:03,632
How did you escape and my son did not...

454
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:06,302
so mighty a man as he was?

455
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,313
The mightiest man may be
slain by one arrow...

456
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,476
and Boromir was pierced by many.

457
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:18,322
Get up.

458
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,117
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

459
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,322
but it is not now.

460
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,246
War is coming.

461
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,996
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

462
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:37,335
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

463
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:42,385
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

464
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:47,052
Send word to Theoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

465
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:52,179
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

466
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:55,393
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

467
00:46:57,528 --> 00:47:01,692
Do you think the eyes of
the White Tower are blind?

468
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:04,951
I have seen more than you know.

469
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,322
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

470
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,367
And with your right you'd
seek to supplant me.

471
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,242
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

472
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,376
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

473
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:26,380
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

474
00:47:26,556 --> 00:47:31,052
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

475
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:37,063
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

476
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:41,646
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

477
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:48,617
Come.

478
00:47:56,545 --> 00:47:59,117
All has turned to vain ambition.

479
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:02,748
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

480
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:08,422
A thousand years this city has stood.

481
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:11,922
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

482
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:15,349
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

483
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,063
will never bloom again.

484
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:20,599
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

485
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:23,943
A faint and fading hope that
one day it will flower.

486
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:28,858
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

487
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,951
before it fell into decay.

488
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:35,371
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

489
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:39,833
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

490
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,954
and counted the old names
of their descent...

491
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,916
dearer than the names of their sons.

492
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:50,132
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

493
00:48:50,304 --> 00:48:55,643
or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

494
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:59,594
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

495
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:02,889
The line of kings failed.

496
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,981
The White Tree withered.

497
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,858
The rule of Gondor was
given over to lesser men.

498
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:22,829
Mordor.

499
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:27,001
Yes, there it lies.

500
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,175
This city has dwelt ever in
the sight of its shadow.

501
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,838
A storm is coming.

502
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,432
This is not the weather of the world.

503
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,807
This is a device of Sauron's making.

504
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,726
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

505
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,771
The Orcs of Mordor have
no love of daylight...

506
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,771
so he covers the face of the sun...

507
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,693
to ease their passage
along the road to war.

508
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:57,152
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

509
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,577
it will begin.

510
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,826
Well...

511
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,536
Minas Tirith...

512
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,873
very impressive.

513
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:10,668
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

514
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,047
There's no leaving this city.

515
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,590
Help must come to us.

516
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,769
It must be getting near teatime.

517
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,637
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

518
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,398
We're not in decent places.

519
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,193
Mr. Frodo?

520
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:41,442
What is it?

521
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:46,286
It's just a feeling.

522
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,869
I don't think I'll be coming back.

523
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,922
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

524
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:00,427
That's just morbid thinking.

525
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:03,344
We're going there and back again...

526
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:05,806
just like Mr. Bilbo.

527
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,893
You'll see.

528
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:20,690
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

529
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,123
Long ago, when there was a king.

530
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:52,605
Mr. Frodo, look.

531
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:56,983
The king has got a crown again.

532
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:12,367
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now.
This way.

533
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:33,269
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

534
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:37,684
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

535
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:41,775
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

536
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:45,315
You'll have to do as you're
told, Peregrin Took.

537
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,860
Ridiculous Hobbit.

538
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,246
Guard of the Citadel.

539
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,585
Thank you.

540
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:18,219
There's no more stars.

541
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:19,929
Is it time?

542
00:53:21,108 --> 00:53:22,851
Yes.

543
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:27,148
It's so quiet.

544
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:32,403
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

545
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:36,449
I don't want to be in a battle...

546
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:42,248
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

547
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,418
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

548
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:53,882
There never was much hope.

549
00:53:55,851 --> 00:53:57,594
Just a fool's hope.

550
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:06,269
Our enemy is ready.

551
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,114
His full strength's gathered.

552
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,778
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

553
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:15,987
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

554
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:18,865
mercenaries from the coast.

555
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:21,612
All will answer Mordor's call.

556
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,333
Come on.

557
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,795
This will be the end of
Gondor as we know it.

558
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,333
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

559
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:36,632
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

560
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,472
the last defense of this city will be gone.

561
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:44,688
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

562
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,148
Gandalf?

563
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:59,532
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

564
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,827
the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

565
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,159
The one they say no living man can kill.

566
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:12,331
The Witch King of Angmar.

567
00:55:13,425 --> 00:55:15,797
You've met him before.

568
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:19,043
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

569
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,309
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

570
00:55:28,773 --> 00:55:31,230
the greatest of the Nine.

571
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,019
Minas Morgul is his lair.

572
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:42,025
The Dead City.

573
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:47,411
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

574
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:56,791
Quick. Quick.

575
00:55:56,967 --> 00:56:00,965
They will see. They will see.

576
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,521
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

577
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:19,561
The way into Mordor.

578
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:24,070
The secret stair.

579
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,865
Climb.

580
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,893
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

581
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:57,603
- What's it doing?
- No.

582
00:56:57,777 --> 00:57:00,860
- They're calling me.
- No.

583
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:33,471
Hide! Hide!

584
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,856
I can feel his blade.

585
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:33,657
We come to it at last.

586
00:58:35,496 --> 00:58:38,367
The great battle of our time.

587
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:20,786
Come away, Hobbits. We climb.
We must climb.

588
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:33,675
The board is set.

589
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,382
The pieces are moving.

590
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:41,603
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

591
00:59:41,768 --> 00:59:44,438
And then it's into the tunnel.

592
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:47,809
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

593
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:51,110
You listen to me, and you
listen good and proper.

594
00:59:51,277 --> 00:59:54,195
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

595
00:59:54,364 --> 00:59:55,942
One sniff something's not right...

596
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:59,282
one hair stands up on the
back of my head, it's over.

597
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:02,164
No more slinker. No more stinker.

598
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:05,119
You're gone. Got it?

599
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:07,992
I'm watching you.

600
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,333
What was that about?

601
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,916
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

602
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,431
Peregrin Took, my lad, there
is a task now to be done.

603
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:32,182
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

604
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,608
You must not fail me.

605
01:01:12,856 --> 01:01:15,940
It's been very quiet across the river.

606
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,434
The Orcs are lying low.

607
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:20,605
The garrison may have moved out.

608
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,445
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

609
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:27,903
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

610
01:01:53,228 --> 01:01:54,427
Quiet.

611
01:01:58,525 --> 01:02:00,483
We need 10 more.

612
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:23,340
Kill him!

613
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,057
They're not coming from the north.

614
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:48,817
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

615
01:02:52,286 --> 01:02:53,864
Faster.

616
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,382
Draw swords.

617
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,512
Hold! Hold them!

618
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:28,686
What?

619
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:42,652
Amon Din

620
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,494
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

621
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:58,967
Hope is kindled.

622
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:35,726
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

623
01:07:36,938 --> 01:07:38,561
Gondor calls for aid.

624
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:51,992
And Rohan will answer.

625
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:55,197
Muster the Rohirrim.

626
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:12,260
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

627
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:16,807
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

628
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:22,266
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

629
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:24,560
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

630
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,061
- Gamling.
- My lord.

631
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,813
Make haste across the Riddermark.

632
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:30,109
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

633
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,859
I will.

634
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:39,119
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

635
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:43,203
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

636
01:08:49,757 --> 01:08:51,667
The men have found their captain.

637
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:55,176
They will follow you into
battle, even to death.

638
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:56,925
You have given us hope.

639
01:09:00,143 --> 01:09:02,100
Excuse me.

640
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:04,931
I have a sword.

641
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:06,606
Please accept it.

642
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:12,229
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

643
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,734
And gladly I accept it.

644
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:22,908
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

645
01:09:27,795 --> 01:09:28,993
Horse-Men.

646
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:35,295
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

647
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:38,631
Your kinsmen may have
no need to ride to war.

648
01:09:38,805 --> 01:09:42,221
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

649
01:10:00,702 --> 01:10:04,153
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

650
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:08,198
the doom of our time will be decided.

651
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:16,335
Now is the hour. Riders of
Rohan, oaths you have taken.

652
01:10:16,509 --> 01:10:20,042
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

653
01:11:03,136 --> 01:11:05,095
Faramir!

654
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:15,095
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

655
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,774
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

656
01:11:27,536 --> 01:11:29,778
Nazgul.

657
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,621
Take cover!

658
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:37,331
Nazgul!

659
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:41,168
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

660
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:49,637
Fall back!

661
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:01,268
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

662
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:29,837
The age of Men is over.

663
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:35,636
The time of the Orc has come.

664
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,345
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

665
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,354
Take cover, my lord!

666
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:45,980
It's coming!

667
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,903
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

668
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,243
Pull!

669
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,377
Mithrandir.

670
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:58,298
They broke through our defenses.

671
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:00,680
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

672
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:03,838
Battalions of Orcs are
crossing the river.

673
01:14:03,851 --> 01:14:05,931
It is as the Lord
Denethor predicted.

674
01:14:06,105 --> 01:14:10,649
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

675
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:16,439
Faramir?

676
01:14:18,368 --> 01:14:22,199
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

677
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:24,578
No.

678
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:27,458
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

679
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:31,752
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

680
01:14:31,922 --> 01:14:33,998
Not two days ago.

681
01:14:34,466 --> 01:14:38,926
Gandalf, they're taking the
road to the Morgul Vale.

682
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:42,260
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

683
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:46,849
What does that mean?

684
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:51,930
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

685
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:54,148
Tell me all you know.

686
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,735
This is how you would serve your city?

687
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:02,193
You would risk its utter ruin?

688
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:04,822
I did what I judged to be right.

689
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:08,538
What you judged to be right.

690
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:15,039
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

691
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:23,837
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

692
01:15:25,475 --> 01:15:27,016
Hidden.

693
01:15:27,435 --> 01:15:30,186
Dark and deep in the vaults...

694
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:32,512
not to be used.

695
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:41,569
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

696
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,072
I would not use the Ring.

697
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:47,328
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

698
01:15:47,662 --> 01:15:52,489
Ever you desire to appear
lordly and gracious...

699
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,909
as a king of old.

700
01:15:56,712 --> 01:16:00,462
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

701
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:03,340
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

702
01:16:03,552 --> 01:16:06,091
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

703
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:08,063
He would have stretched
out his hand to this

704
01:16:08,076 --> 01:16:09,634
thing and taken it.
He would've fallen.

705
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,051
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

706
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:16,096
And when he returned...

707
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:18,893
you would not have known your son.

708
01:16:19,068 --> 01:16:21,605
Boromir was loyal to me!

709
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,351
Not some wizard's pupil!

710
01:16:32,497 --> 01:16:33,826
Father?

711
01:16:46,511 --> 01:16:48,421
My son.

712
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,038
Leave me.

713
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:52,152
Careful, master. Careful.

714
01:17:52,492 --> 01:17:55,409
Very far to fall.

715
01:17:57,913 --> 01:18:01,828
Very dangerous are the stairs.

716
01:18:04,503 --> 01:18:07,042
Come, master.

717
01:18:12,845 --> 01:18:16,011
Come to Smeagol.

718
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:23,847
Mr. Frodo.

719
01:18:24,856 --> 01:18:26,399
Get back, you!

720
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,773
Don't touch him!

721
01:18:32,905 --> 01:18:35,740
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

722
01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:39,609
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

723
01:18:39,787 --> 01:18:42,159
Master?

724
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:46,408
Master carries heavy burden.

725
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:52,006
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

726
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:55,425
Fat one cannot know.

727
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:00,222
Smeagol look after master.

728
01:19:01,434 --> 01:19:03,640
He wants it.

729
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:08,354
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

730
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:13,979
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

731
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:18,021
The fat one will take it from you.

732
01:19:25,247 --> 01:19:29,578
Send forth all legions.

733
01:19:29,752 --> 01:19:33,797
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

734
01:19:34,507 --> 01:19:37,627
Slay them all.

735
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:45,092
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

736
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:50,845
Where are Theoden's riders?

737
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:53,596
Will Rohan's army come?

738
01:19:53,775 --> 01:19:56,018
Mithrandir.

739
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,938
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

740
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:08,451
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

741
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:16,247
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

742
01:20:16,422 --> 01:20:17,917
It was well-done.

743
01:20:21,094 --> 01:20:25,139
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

744
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,429
You are to join the tower guard.

745
01:20:28,976 --> 01:20:31,976
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

746
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:34,601
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

747
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:36,315
A very foolish one...

748
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:40,730
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

749
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:43,657
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

750
01:20:43,824 --> 01:20:45,615
My father had it made for me.

751
01:20:46,661 --> 01:20:47,989
Well...

752
01:20:48,162 --> 01:20:50,154
I'm taller than you were then.

753
01:20:50,331 --> 01:20:53,664
Though I'm not likely to grow
anymore, except sideways.

754
01:20:56,628 --> 01:20:58,668
Never fitted me either.

755
01:20:58,838 --> 01:21:01,675
Boromir was always the soldier.

756
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:07,086
They were so alike, he and my father.

757
01:21:09,182 --> 01:21:10,807
Proud.

758
01:21:10,975 --> 01:21:12,173
Stubborn even.

759
01:21:13,938 --> 01:21:15,431
But strong.

760
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:20,106
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

761
01:21:20,735 --> 01:21:23,190
And one day your father will see it.

762
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:31,150
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

763
01:21:31,328 --> 01:21:32,823
in peace or war...

764
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:35,912
in living or dying...

765
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,537
from...

766
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:44,001
From this hour henceforth...

767
01:21:44,175 --> 01:21:46,083
until my lord release me...

768
01:21:47,595 --> 01:21:49,801
or death take me.

769
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:52,880
And I shall not forget it...

770
01:21:53,057 --> 01:21:56,427
nor fail to reward that which is given.

771
01:22:04,028 --> 01:22:06,315
Fealty with love.

772
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:09,065
Valor with honor.

773
01:22:10,658 --> 01:22:13,992
Disloyalty with vengeance.

774
01:22:22,628 --> 01:22:26,708
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

775
01:22:26,882 --> 01:22:29,635
defenses that your brother
long held intact.

776
01:22:29,801 --> 01:22:32,292
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

777
01:22:32,471 --> 01:22:35,259
the river in Pelennor unfought.

778
01:22:35,432 --> 01:22:37,092
Osgiliath must be retaken.

779
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:39,307
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

780
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:42,765
Much must be risked in war.

781
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,350
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

782
01:22:55,577 --> 01:22:58,827
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

783
01:22:59,789 --> 01:23:02,625
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

784
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:07,788
Yes.

785
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:10,671
I wish that.

786
01:23:19,057 --> 01:23:21,548
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

787
01:23:23,395 --> 01:23:26,314
I will do what I can in his stead.

788
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:38,949
If I should return, think
better of me, Father.

789
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:44,655
That will depend on the
manner of your return.

790
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:10,280
What are you up to?

791
01:25:10,457 --> 01:25:11,703
Sneaking off, are we?

792
01:25:12,418 --> 01:25:14,244
Sneaking?

793
01:25:15,253 --> 01:25:17,412
Sneaking?

794
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:22,006
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

795
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:27,253
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

796
01:25:27,432 --> 01:25:29,591
and they say "sneak."

797
01:25:30,226 --> 01:25:32,801
Sneak?

798
01:25:33,438 --> 01:25:36,143
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

799
01:25:36,315 --> 01:25:38,938
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

800
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:42,400
You just startled me is all.

801
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:44,733
What were you doing?

802
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,489
Sneaking.

803
01:25:48,869 --> 01:25:51,954
Fine. Have it your own way.

804
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,699
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

805
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:59,042
We have to be moving on.

806
01:26:04,217 --> 01:26:05,796
It's dark still.

807
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,176
It's always dark here.

808
01:26:12,435 --> 01:26:14,342
It's gone!

809
01:26:15,563 --> 01:26:18,432
- The Elven bread.
- What?

810
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,065
That's all we have left.

811
01:26:24,154 --> 01:26:26,645
He took it. He must have!

812
01:26:27,157 --> 01:26:30,408
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

813
01:26:30,577 --> 01:26:33,494
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

814
01:26:33,663 --> 01:26:36,829
You're a lying rat! What
did you do with it?!

815
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,542
He doesn't eat it.

816
01:26:39,545 --> 01:26:41,869
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

817
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:44,750
What's this?

818
01:26:47,426 --> 01:26:50,761
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

819
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:53,132
He took it.

820
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:58,185
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

821
01:26:58,354 --> 01:27:00,145
That's a filthy lie!

822
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,520
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

823
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:03,936
- Sam!
- Call me...

824
01:27:04,109 --> 01:27:05,354
Stop it!

825
01:27:06,362 --> 01:27:07,560
Sam!

826
01:27:08,863 --> 01:27:12,481
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

827
01:27:13,536 --> 01:27:19,074
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

828
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:21,372
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

829
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:23,618
- I'm all right.
- No.

830
01:27:23,795 --> 01:27:26,880
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

831
01:27:27,047 --> 01:27:29,171
It's that Gollum.

832
01:27:29,341 --> 01:27:31,051
It's this place.

833
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,792
It's that thing around your neck.

834
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:38,588
I could help a bit.

835
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:41,436
I could carry it for a while.

836
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:43,347
Carry it for a while.

837
01:27:43,523 --> 01:27:44,768
I could carry it... I could carry it.

838
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:50,855
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

839
01:27:51,029 --> 01:27:52,229
Get away!

840
01:27:52,407 --> 01:27:53,984
I don't want to keep it.

841
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,569
I just want to help.

842
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:04,246
See? See?

843
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:07,833
He wants it for himself.

844
01:28:08,006 --> 01:28:09,712
Shut up, you!

845
01:28:10,256 --> 01:28:12,083
Go away! Get out of here!

846
01:28:12,259 --> 01:28:14,086
No, Sam.

847
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:15,506
It's you.

848
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:21,431
I'm sorry, Sam.

849
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:24,478
But he's a liar.

850
01:28:24,645 --> 01:28:27,314
He's poisoned you against me.

851
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:30,641
You can't help me anymore.

852
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:34,484
You don't mean that.

853
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:38,783
Go home.

854
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,612
Faramir!

855
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,689
Faramir!

856
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:06,240
Your father's will has turned to madness.

857
01:30:07,412 --> 01:30:09,452
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

858
01:30:10,207 --> 01:30:12,532
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

859
01:30:13,167 --> 01:30:16,086
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

860
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:19,500
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

861
01:30:19,673 --> 01:30:22,877
her memory, her wisdom.

862
01:30:25,262 --> 01:30:28,679
Your father loves you, Faramir.

863
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:32,393
He will remember it before the end.

864
01:31:42,003 --> 01:31:43,546
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

865
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,023
Well...

866
01:31:48,573 --> 01:31:50,197
yes.

867
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:54,657
At least, well enough for my own people.

868
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,695
But we have no songs for great halls...

869
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,994
and evil times.

870
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:05,002
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

871
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,211
Come, sing me a song.

872
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:23,604
Home is behind

873
01:32:23,773 --> 01:32:27,521
The world ahead

874
01:32:29,945 --> 01:32:35,782
And there are many paths to tread

875
01:32:37,578 --> 01:32:41,113
Through shadow

876
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:45,453
To the edge of night

877
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:52,207
Until the stars are all alight

878
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:59,548
Mist and shadow

879
01:32:59,725 --> 01:33:04,018
Cloud and shade

880
01:33:06,398 --> 01:33:09,731
All shall fade

881
01:33:12,112 --> 01:33:16,109
All shall

882
01:33:21,872 --> 01:33:24,243
Fade

883
01:33:48,646 --> 01:33:52,099
March! March!

884
01:33:52,275 --> 01:33:57,483
March! March! March!

885
01:34:00,952 --> 01:34:03,277
Make way for the king.

886
01:34:04,788 --> 01:34:06,779
Make way.

887
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,289
The king is here.

888
01:34:13,255 --> 01:34:14,878
My lord.

889
01:34:16,132 --> 01:34:18,088
Hail to you, sire.

890
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:19,748
Grimbold, how many?

891
01:34:19,927 --> 01:34:22,382
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

892
01:34:23,347 --> 01:34:26,016
We have 300 more from
Fenmarch, Theoden King.

893
01:34:27,143 --> 01:34:31,091
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

894
01:34:48,163 --> 01:34:50,287
Six thousand spears.

895
01:34:51,332 --> 01:34:53,326
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

896
01:34:53,627 --> 01:34:56,996
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

897
01:34:59,757 --> 01:35:01,501
More will come.

898
01:35:01,885 --> 01:35:04,838
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

899
01:35:05,012 --> 01:35:07,586
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

01:35:27,076 --> 01:35:29,400
The horses are restless...

902
01:35:29,578 --> 01:35:31,073
and the men are quiet.

903
01:35:31,538 --> 01:35:34,658
They grow nervous in the
shadow of the mountain.

904
01:35:37,127 --> 01:35:39,001
That road there...

905
01:35:39,921 --> 01:35:41,997
where does that lead?

906
01:35:42,757 --> 01:35:46,590
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

907
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:50,305
None who venture there ever return.

908
01:35:51,515 --> 01:35:53,390
That mountain is evil.

909
01:36:16,332 --> 01:36:18,158
Aragorn.

910
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:20,827
Let's find some food.

911
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,721
There.

912
01:36:39,688 --> 01:36:42,689
A true esquire of Rohan.

913
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:48,311
I'm ready.

914
01:36:49,907 --> 01:36:51,185
Sorry.

915
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:53,606
It isn't all that dangerous.

916
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:56,444
It's not even sharp.

917
01:36:57,122 --> 01:37:00,537
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

918
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:02,203
Come on.

919
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,872
To the smithy. Go!

920
01:37:10,342 --> 01:37:12,881
You should not encourage him.

921
01:37:13,054 --> 01:37:15,509
You should not doubt him.

922
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:18,966
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

923
01:37:21,688 --> 01:37:23,265
Why should Merry be left behind?

924
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,060
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

925
01:37:28,234 --> 01:37:31,400
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

926
01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:37,658
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

927
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:40,988
When the fear takes him...

928
01:37:41,163 --> 01:37:46,206
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

929
01:37:46,586 --> 01:37:48,743
do you think he would stand and fight?

930
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,923
He would flee.

931
01:37:53,092 --> 01:37:55,131
And he would be right to do so.

932
01:37:57,346 --> 01:38:01,296
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

933
01:38:36,967 --> 01:38:40,668
I choose a mortal life.

934
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,470
I wish I could've seen him...

935
01:38:47,604 --> 01:38:50,309
one last time.

936
01:39:01,492 --> 01:39:02,903
Sir?

937
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:07,319
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

938
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:30,057
I take my leave.

939
01:39:44,699 --> 01:39:45,945
My lord Elrond.

940
01:39:46,536 --> 01:39:50,034
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

941
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,118
Arwen is dying.

942
01:39:59,922 --> 01:40:03,967
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

943
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:08,088
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

944
01:40:08,265 --> 01:40:12,262
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

945
01:40:12,435 --> 01:40:16,184
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

946
01:40:16,939 --> 01:40:19,512
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

947
01:40:19,902 --> 01:40:21,560
The end has come.

948
01:40:21,945 --> 01:40:24,565
It will not be our end, but his.

949
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,905
You ride to war, but not to victory.

950
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:33,576
Sauron's armies march on
Minas Tirith, this you know.

951
01:40:33,747 --> 01:40:38,161
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

952
01:40:38,627 --> 01:40:42,043
A fleet of Corsair ships
sails from the south.

953
01:40:42,673 --> 01:40:44,750
They'll be in the city in two days.

954
01:40:45,259 --> 01:40:48,094
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

955
01:40:48,804 --> 01:40:50,927
You need more men.

956
01:40:51,306 --> 01:40:53,051
There are none.

957
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:58,724
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

958
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:09,898
Murderers...

959
01:41:10,074 --> 01:41:11,485
traitors.

960
01:41:13,953 --> 01:41:16,112
You would call upon them to fight?

961
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:17,867
They believe in nothing.

962
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,163
They answer to no one.

963
01:41:20,335 --> 01:41:23,418
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

964
01:41:30,552 --> 01:41:35,677
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

965
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:54,402
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

966
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:13,210
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

967
01:42:13,386 --> 01:42:15,793
The man who can wield the
power of this sword...

968
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:19,838
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

969
01:42:21,685 --> 01:42:23,844
Put aside the Ranger.

970
01:42:24,021 --> 01:42:27,354
Become who you were born to be.

971
01:42:27,524 --> 01:42:29,518
Take the Dimholt road.

972
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:35,430
Ónen i-Estel Edain.
(I give hope to the Dúnedain.)

973
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:43,439
Ú-chebin Estel anim.
(I have kept no hope for myself.)

974
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:57,212
Why are you doing this?

975
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,881
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

976
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,385
You cannot abandon the men.

977
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,265
Eowyn...

978
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:10,645
We need you here.

979
01:43:11,775 --> 01:43:13,649
Why have you come?

980
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,278
Do you not know?

981
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:29,582
It is but a shadow and a
thought that you love.

982
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:35,913
I cannot give you what you seek.

983
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:53,351
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

984
01:44:12,502 --> 01:44:14,789
Just where do you think you're off to?

985
01:44:14,962 --> 01:44:16,291
Not this time.

986
01:44:16,463 --> 01:44:18,670
This time you must stay, Gimli.

987
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:24,220
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

988
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:28,052
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

989
01:44:50,372 --> 01:44:52,529
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

990
01:44:52,873 --> 01:44:54,747
Where's he going?

991
01:44:57,337 --> 01:44:59,376
I don't understand.

992
01:45:03,801 --> 01:45:05,592
Lord Aragorn!

993
01:45:06,011 --> 01:45:08,716
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

994
01:45:09,932 --> 01:45:12,009
He leaves because there is no hope.

995
01:45:12,685 --> 01:45:14,807
He leaves because he must.

996
01:45:14,978 --> 01:45:16,686
Too few have come.

997
01:45:16,855 --> 01:45:19,014
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

998
01:45:21,527 --> 01:45:23,186
No...

999
01:45:23,612 --> 01:45:24,856
we cannot.

1000
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:31,524
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

1001
01:45:45,966 --> 01:45:47,711
I have left instruction.

1002
01:45:50,387 --> 01:45:53,637
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

1003
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:02,472
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1004
01:46:03,734 --> 01:46:06,569
Long may you defend Edoras...

1005
01:46:06,738 --> 01:46:09,063
if the battle goes ill.

1006
01:46:10,157 --> 01:46:13,573
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1007
01:46:15,787 --> 01:46:17,744
Duty?

1008
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:21,244
No.

1009
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:31,673
I would have you smile again...

1010
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:40,092
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1011
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:48,439
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1012
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:55,533
and no more despair.

1013
01:47:01,748 --> 01:47:05,448
What kind of army would
linger in such a place?

1014
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,454
One that is cursed.

1015
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,961
Long ago, the Men of the
Mountains swore an oath...

1016
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:15,136
to the last king of Gondor...

1017
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,297
to come to his aid...

1018
01:47:17,471 --> 01:47:19,180
to fight.

1019
01:47:19,682 --> 01:47:21,841
But when the time came...

1020
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,097
when Gondor's need was dire...

1021
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:27,145
they fled...

1022
01:47:27,314 --> 01:47:30,685
vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain.

1023
01:47:31,735 --> 01:47:34,060
And so Isildur cursed them...

1024
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:39,481
never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1025
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:46,956
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1026
01:47:47,417 --> 01:47:49,659
The forgotten people.

1027
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:52,328
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1028
01:47:52,798 --> 01:47:54,671
From the north shall he come.

1029
01:47:55,176 --> 01:47:56,835
Need shall drive him.

1030
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:01,426
He shall pass the door to
the Paths of the Dead.

1031
01:48:19,908 --> 01:48:23,194
The very warmth of my
blood seems stolen away.

1032
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,707
The way is shut.

1033
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:33,417
It was made by those who are dead.

1034
01:48:34,046 --> 01:48:36,287
And the Dead keep it.

1035
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:38,382
The way is shut.

1036
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:51,222
Brego!

1037
01:48:54,734 --> 01:48:57,438
I do not fear death.

1038
01:49:09,747 --> 01:49:12,155
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1039
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:16,996
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1040
01:49:17,171 --> 01:49:18,500
Oh.

1041
01:49:18,672 --> 01:49:21,507
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1042
01:49:36,524 --> 01:49:38,765
We must ride light and swift.

1043
01:49:38,943 --> 01:49:40,685
It is a long road ahead.

1044
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:43,945
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1045
01:49:49,453 --> 01:49:52,453
Little Hobbits do not belong
in war, Master Meriadoc.

1046
01:49:52,788 --> 01:49:54,782
All my friends have gone to battle.

1047
01:49:54,957 --> 01:49:56,832
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1048
01:49:57,002 --> 01:49:59,125
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1049
01:49:59,296 --> 01:50:01,667
And none of my riders can
bear you as a burden.

1050
01:50:02,673 --> 01:50:04,796
I want to fight.

1051
01:50:05,301 --> 01:50:07,293
I will say no more.

1052
01:50:24,112 --> 01:50:26,069
Ride with me.

1053
01:50:27,532 --> 01:50:28,942
My lady.

1054
01:50:29,115 --> 01:50:31,488
Form up! Move out!

1055
01:50:31,661 --> 01:50:34,863
Form up! Move out!

1056
01:50:37,957 --> 01:50:39,155
Ride!

1057
01:50:39,335 --> 01:50:42,288
Ride now to Gondor!

1058
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,662
What is it?

1059
01:51:25,837 --> 01:51:27,380
What do you see?

1060
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:29,753
I see shapes of men.

1061
01:51:32,427 --> 01:51:33,802
And of horses.

1062
01:51:34,555 --> 01:51:35,752
Where?

1063
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:38,885
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1064
01:51:41,311 --> 01:51:43,516
Spears rise...

1065
01:51:44,146 --> 01:51:47,599
like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1066
01:51:48,859 --> 01:51:51,018
The Dead are following.

1067
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:53,733
They have been summoned.

1068
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:56,234
The Dead?

1069
01:51:56,618 --> 01:51:58,326
Summoned?

1070
01:51:58,744 --> 01:52:00,618
I knew that.

1071
01:52:03,957 --> 01:52:05,702
Very good.

1072
01:52:06,418 --> 01:52:08,494
Very good! Legolas!

1073
01:52:46,457 --> 01:52:47,868
Do not look down.

1074
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:45,594
Who enters my domain?

1075
01:53:49,353 --> 01:53:51,557
One who will have your allegiance.

1076
01:53:54,523 --> 01:53:59,862
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1077
01:54:00,195 --> 01:54:02,864
You will suffer me.

1078
01:54:26,386 --> 01:54:29,756
The way is shut.

1079
01:54:30,934 --> 01:54:35,394
It was made by those who are dead.

1080
01:54:35,771 --> 01:54:39,935
And the Dead keep it.

1081
01:54:49,076 --> 01:54:52,161
The way is shut.

1082
01:54:53,914 --> 01:54:56,536
Now you must die.

1083
01:55:00,421 --> 01:55:03,256
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1084
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:08,547
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1085
01:55:14,143 --> 01:55:16,300
That line was broken.

1086
01:55:18,939 --> 01:55:21,145
It has been remade.

1087
01:55:29,073 --> 01:55:30,615
Fight for us...

1088
01:55:30,783 --> 01:55:33,322
and regain your honor.

1089
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:38,827
What say you?

1090
01:55:51,052 --> 01:55:52,595
What say you?

1091
01:55:53,346 --> 01:55:55,139
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1092
01:55:55,307 --> 01:55:58,474
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

1093
01:55:58,978 --> 01:56:01,469
I am Isildur's heir.

1094
01:56:02,023 --> 01:56:03,979
Fight for me...

1095
01:56:04,565 --> 01:56:08,149
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1096
01:56:12,073 --> 01:56:14,030
What say you?

1097
01:56:21,957 --> 01:56:24,164
You have my word!

1098
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:28,458
Fight, and I will release
you from this living death!

1099
01:56:29,925 --> 01:56:31,418
What say you?!

1100
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:37,675
Stand, you traitors!

1101
01:57:04,623 --> 01:57:05,655
Out!

1102
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:28,599
Legolas!

1103
01:57:29,733 --> 01:57:30,930
Run!

1104
01:58:37,256 --> 01:58:39,331
We fight.

1105
01:58:49,685 --> 01:58:52,257
Open the gate! Quick!

1106
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:25,292
Quick! Hurry!

1107
01:59:39,064 --> 01:59:40,689
Faramir!

1108
01:59:41,694 --> 01:59:44,943
Say not that he has fallen.

1109
01:59:46,114 --> 01:59:47,657
They were outnumbered.

1110
01:59:48,073 --> 01:59:49,652
None survived.

1111
01:59:50,368 --> 01:59:52,360
Fear.

1112
01:59:52,912 --> 01:59:56,115
The city is rank with it.

1113
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:00,914
Let us ease their pain.

1114
02:00:01,171 --> 02:00:02,913
Release the prisoners.

1115
02:00:03,088 --> 02:00:05,046
Catapults!

1116
02:00:18,395 --> 02:00:21,846
My sons are spent.

1117
02:00:22,899 --> 02:00:25,817
My line has ended.

1118
02:00:28,655 --> 02:00:30,067
He's alive!

1119
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:33,407
The House of Stewards has failed.

1120
02:00:33,577 --> 02:00:35,034
He needs medicine, my lord.

1121
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:38,747
My line has ended!

1122
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,243
My lord!

1123
02:00:55,765 --> 02:00:57,591
Rohan...

1124
02:00:58,350 --> 02:01:00,757
has deserted us.

1125
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:18,403
Theoden's betrayed me.

1126
02:01:29,547 --> 02:01:31,375
Abandon your posts!

1127
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:36,340
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1128
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,023
Prepare for battle!

1129
02:01:48,565 --> 02:01:51,731
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1130
02:01:52,904 --> 02:01:54,860
Over here!

1131
02:01:55,614 --> 02:01:57,987
Return to your posts!

1132
02:02:08,793 --> 02:02:11,414
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1133
02:02:21,597 --> 02:02:23,056
Stay where you are.

1134
02:02:40,032 --> 02:02:41,443
We need more rubble!

1135
02:02:41,617 --> 02:02:43,490
Watch out!

1136
02:02:43,661 --> 02:02:46,198
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1137
02:02:48,082 --> 02:02:49,623
Double up, men!

1138
02:03:58,609 --> 02:04:01,609
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1139
02:04:02,113 --> 02:04:05,610
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1140
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:47,904
Not at the towers!

1141
02:04:48,073 --> 02:04:51,073
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1142
02:04:51,827 --> 02:04:53,654
Bring them down!

1143
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:30,819
Fight them back!

1144
02:05:30,989 --> 02:05:32,983
Peregrin Took!

1145
02:05:33,868 --> 02:05:37,033
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1146
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:55,091
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1147
02:06:20,829 --> 02:06:22,288
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1148
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:26,248
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1149
02:06:37,595 --> 02:06:40,550
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1150
02:06:40,724 --> 02:06:42,681
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1151
02:06:49,024 --> 02:06:51,430
Get back there and smash it down.

1152
02:06:51,609 --> 02:06:53,601
But nothing can breach it.

1153
02:06:56,530 --> 02:06:58,773
Grond will breach it.

1154
02:07:02,203 --> 02:07:04,279
Bring up the wolf's head.

1155
02:07:07,457 --> 02:07:12,796
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:07:13,131 --> 02:07:16,962
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1157
02:07:18,886 --> 02:07:22,301
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1158
02:07:23,015 --> 02:07:26,680
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1159
02:07:27,101 --> 02:07:31,265
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1160
02:07:31,439 --> 02:07:35,140
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1161
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:58,073
You may go no further.

1162
02:08:01,512 --> 02:08:04,015
You will not enter Gondor.

1163
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:07,060
Who are you to deny us passage?

1164
02:08:07,144 --> 02:08:11,105
Legolas, fire a warning
shot past the bosun's ear.

1165
02:08:12,878 --> 02:08:14,443
Mind your aim.

1166
02:08:21,177 --> 02:08:23,722
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1167
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:25,912
Prepare to be boarded.

1168
02:08:27,685 --> 02:08:28,820
Boarded?

1169
02:08:28,832 --> 02:08:30,813
By you and whose army?

1170
02:08:32,273 --> 02:08:34,045
This army.

1171
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:52,708
In there.

1172
02:08:54,795 --> 02:08:56,515
What is this place?

1173
02:09:01,051 --> 02:09:04,335
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1174
02:09:06,003 --> 02:09:09,497
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1175
02:09:12,154 --> 02:09:13,876
It's the only way.

1176
02:09:16,483 --> 02:09:18,255
Go in...

1177
02:09:18,734 --> 02:09:20,940
or go back.

1178
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:26,402
I can't go back.

1179
02:09:39,212 --> 02:09:41,756
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1180
02:09:41,768 --> 02:09:44,715
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1181
02:09:50,318 --> 02:09:51,569
Hurry.

1182
02:09:56,833 --> 02:09:58,398
This way.

1183
02:10:01,421 --> 02:10:03,037
Smeagol?

1184
02:10:04,185 --> 02:10:06,166
Over here.

1185
02:10:15,289 --> 02:10:17,636
It's sticky. What is it?

1186
02:10:18,417 --> 02:10:20,137
You will see.

1187
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:22,588
Oh, yes.

1188
02:10:23,057 --> 02:10:25,921
You will see.

1189
02:10:35,204 --> 02:10:36,769
Smeagol?

1190
02:10:38,542 --> 02:10:39,567
Smeagol!

1191
02:10:42,190 --> 02:10:43,859
Smeagol!

1192
02:10:53,452 --> 02:10:54,908
Sam.

1193
02:12:35,375 --> 02:12:37,689
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1194
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:42,636
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

1195
02:12:43,872 --> 02:12:47,095
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1196
02:12:47,136 --> 02:12:50,728
when all other lights go out.

1197
02:12:50,753 --> 02:12:54,612
Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!
(Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!)

1198
02:14:07,234 --> 02:14:10,051
Naughty little fly.

1199
02:14:10,676 --> 02:14:14,012
Why does he cry?

1200
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:17,609
Caught in a web

1201
02:14:18,027 --> 02:14:20,237
Soon you'll be...

1202
02:14:20,613 --> 02:14:22,439
Eaten.

1203
02:15:00,569 --> 02:15:02,487
Got away, did it, precious?

1204
02:15:02,914 --> 02:15:04,686
Not this time.

1205
02:15:04,895 --> 02:15:07,864
- Not this time!
- No!

1206
02:15:15,166 --> 02:15:18,041
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1207
02:15:18,971 --> 02:15:21,527
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

1208
02:15:21,682 --> 02:15:23,206
We promised.

1209
02:15:23,663 --> 02:15:26,113
You must believe us.

1210
02:15:26,219 --> 02:15:27,760
It was the precious.

1211
02:15:28,564 --> 02:15:32,720
The precious made us do it.

1212
02:15:50,148 --> 02:15:52,743
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

1213
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:05,087
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1214
02:16:15,537 --> 02:16:16,595
No!

1215
02:16:40,145 --> 02:16:42,239
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1216
02:16:47,130 --> 02:16:49,287
I'm so sorry.

1217
02:17:15,595 --> 02:17:19,861
This task was appointed to
you, Frodo of the Shire.

1218
02:17:21,382 --> 02:17:23,521
If you do not find a way...

1219
02:17:25,032 --> 02:17:26,648
no one will.

1220
02:18:00,379 --> 02:18:02,495
The scouts report Minas
Tirith is surrounded.

1221
02:18:02,986 --> 02:18:04,951
The lower level's in flames.

1222
02:18:05,697 --> 02:18:07,870
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

1223
02:18:08,668 --> 02:18:09,868
Time is against us.

1224
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,165
Make ready!

1225
02:18:11,432 --> 02:18:13,165
Take heart, Merry.

1226
02:18:13,518 --> 02:18:15,550
It will soon be over.

1227
02:18:16,613 --> 02:18:17,844
My lady...

1228
02:18:18,594 --> 02:18:20,972
you are fair and brave...

1229
02:18:21,494 --> 02:18:23,736
and have much to live for...

1230
02:18:25,352 --> 02:18:27,384
and many who love you.

1231
02:18:30,566 --> 02:18:32,899
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1232
02:18:34,058 --> 02:18:36,646
I know there is not much
point now in hoping.

1233
02:18:38,021 --> 02:18:41,618
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1234
02:18:41,619 --> 02:18:44,570
But
- I'm not.

1235
02:18:45,006 --> 02:18:46,581
I'm a Hobbit.

1236
02:18:49,729 --> 02:18:51,795
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1237
02:18:55,590 --> 02:18:57,497
I just want to help my friends.

1238
02:18:59,916 --> 02:19:01,087
Frodo.

1239
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:03,679
Sam.

1240
02:19:05,755 --> 02:19:07,306
Pippin.

1241
02:19:09,093 --> 02:19:12,325
More than anything, I wish
I could see them again.

1242
02:19:16,287 --> 02:19:18,352
Prepare to move out!

1243
02:19:18,727 --> 02:19:21,969
Make haste. We ride through the night.

1244
02:19:38,391 --> 02:19:39,382
To battle.

1245
02:19:40,059 --> 02:19:41,363
To battle.

1246
02:20:04,667 --> 02:20:06,031
Back to the gate!

1247
02:20:06,753 --> 02:20:08,484
Hurry!

1248
02:20:28,649 --> 02:20:32,885
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

1249
02:20:33,342 --> 02:20:35,531
Thus have I walked.

1250
02:20:36,990 --> 02:20:39,911
And thus now will I sleep.

1251
02:20:46,114 --> 02:20:47,904
Gondor is lost.

1252
02:20:48,617 --> 02:20:51,817
There is no hope for Men.

1253
02:21:06,968 --> 02:21:09,261
Why do the fools fly?

1254
02:21:11,191 --> 02:21:13,889
Better to die sooner than late.

1255
02:21:16,352 --> 02:21:18,094
For die we must.

1256
02:21:30,742 --> 02:21:34,077
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

1257
02:21:34,912 --> 02:21:40,439
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1258
02:21:41,115 --> 02:21:45,745
We shall burn, like the
heathen kings of old.

1259
02:21:49,875 --> 02:21:51,253
Bring wood and oil.

1260
02:21:54,514 --> 02:21:55,424
Steady.

1261
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:57,638
Steady.

1262
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:14,795
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1263
02:22:15,316 --> 02:22:19,643
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

1264
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,921
Run!

1265
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:30,644
Volley!

1266
02:22:31,550 --> 02:22:32,966
Fire!

1267
02:24:26,643 --> 02:24:28,362
Let him go, you filth.

1268
02:24:30,416 --> 02:24:31,804
Let him go!

1269
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:35,504
You will not touch him again.

1270
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,250
Come on and finish it.

1271
02:26:30,408 --> 02:26:31,532
Back!

1272
02:26:42,764 --> 02:26:43,912
Mr. Frodo.

1273
02:26:53,712 --> 02:26:55,174
Oh, no.

1274
02:26:55,799 --> 02:26:57,307
Frodo.

1275
02:26:57,935 --> 02:26:59,476
Mr. Frodo.

1276
02:27:04,422 --> 02:27:05,548
Wake up.

1277
02:27:09,665 --> 02:27:11,804
Don't leave me here alone.

1278
02:27:13,629 --> 02:27:15,765
Don't go where I can't follow.

1279
02:27:20,198 --> 02:27:21,344
Wake up.

1280
02:27:28,278 --> 02:27:30,207
Not asleep.

1281
02:27:32,552 --> 02:27:34,273
Dead.

1282
02:27:53,199 --> 02:27:55,075
You get back, you scum!

1283
02:28:04,512 --> 02:28:06,075
What's this?

1284
02:28:06,931 --> 02:28:09,828
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1285
02:28:11,654 --> 02:28:14,000
Killed another one, has she?

1286
02:28:14,313 --> 02:28:16,138
No.

1287
02:28:19,057 --> 02:28:21,157
This fellow ain't dead.

1288
02:28:21,163 --> 02:28:23,332
Not dead?

1289
02:28:23,852 --> 02:28:29,274
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1290
02:28:29,952 --> 02:28:32,559
Then she has her way with them.

1291
02:28:33,132 --> 02:28:35,166
That's how she likes to feed.

1292
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:37,252
Fresh blood.

1293
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:39,649
Get him to the tower!

1294
02:28:43,352 --> 02:28:45,102
Samwise, you fool.

1295
02:28:45,145 --> 02:28:47,992
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1296
02:28:48,304 --> 02:28:50,546
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1297
02:29:15,049 --> 02:29:18,073
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1298
02:29:19,429 --> 02:29:20,680
He is burning.

1299
02:29:21,983 --> 02:29:23,338
Already burning.

1300
02:29:23,703 --> 02:29:25,268
He's not dead.

1301
02:29:26,049 --> 02:29:27,613
He's not dead!

1302
02:29:29,699 --> 02:29:31,376
No! No!

1303
02:29:31,888 --> 02:29:33,870
No! No!

1304
02:29:34,338 --> 02:29:36,319
He's not dead!

1305
02:29:36,841 --> 02:29:40,126
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1306
02:29:40,334 --> 02:29:43,462
I release you from my service.

1307
02:29:44,817 --> 02:29:49,145
Go now and die in what
way seems best to you.

1308
02:29:51,502 --> 02:29:53,556
Pour oil on the wood!

1309
02:29:55,452 --> 02:29:57,316
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1310
02:29:58,059 --> 02:30:00,737
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1311
02:30:01,397 --> 02:30:02,647
Where is Gandalf?

1312
02:30:04,108 --> 02:30:05,149
Gandalf!

1313
02:30:10,936 --> 02:30:11,979
Retreat!

1314
02:30:14,170 --> 02:30:15,889
The city is breached!

1315
02:30:16,046 --> 02:30:18,966
Fall back! To the second level!

1316
02:30:22,824 --> 02:30:24,595
Get the women and children out!

1317
02:30:24,700 --> 02:30:26,369
Get them out!

1318
02:30:26,639 --> 02:30:27,985
Retreat!

1319
02:30:28,088 --> 02:30:30,070
Come on. Come on, move.

1320
02:30:30,279 --> 02:30:34,605
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1321
02:30:42,686 --> 02:30:44,929
Take them down!

1322
02:31:05,729 --> 02:31:08,546
Fight! Fight to the last man!

1323
02:31:08,701 --> 02:31:10,213
Fight for your lives!

1324
02:31:10,623 --> 02:31:11,557
Gandalf!

1325
02:31:15,813 --> 02:31:16,990
Gandalf!

1326
02:31:17,095 --> 02:31:19,754
Denethor has lost his mind!

1327
02:31:19,962 --> 02:31:22,153
He's burning Faramir alive!

1328
02:31:22,193 --> 02:31:24,134
Up! Quickly!

1329
02:31:31,224 --> 02:31:32,423
Go back to the abyss.

1330
02:31:34,247 --> 02:31:37,584
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

1331
02:31:37,936 --> 02:31:44,257
Do you not know death
when you see it, old man?

1332
02:31:44,466 --> 02:31:48,502
This is my hour.

1333
02:31:58,751 --> 02:31:59,740
Gandalf!

1334
02:32:08,989 --> 02:32:12,201
You have failed.

1335
02:32:13,264 --> 02:32:18,145
The world of Men will fall.

1336
02:33:15,335 --> 02:33:16,430
Courage, Merry.

1337
02:33:17,004 --> 02:33:19,090
Courage for our friends.

1338
02:33:22,916 --> 02:33:26,045
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1339
02:33:26,075 --> 02:33:29,255
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1340
02:33:37,493 --> 02:33:40,673
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

1341
02:33:40,913 --> 02:33:41,977
Flank ready.

1342
02:33:42,445 --> 02:33:44,896
Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

1343
02:33:45,052 --> 02:33:48,859
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

1344
02:33:49,171 --> 02:33:51,569
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1345
02:33:51,986 --> 02:33:55,636
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

1346
02:33:56,011 --> 02:34:01,162
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

1347
02:34:01,475 --> 02:34:04,968
a sword-day, a red day...

1348
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:08,645
and the sun rises!

1349
02:34:16,698 --> 02:34:21,182
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1350
02:34:27,386 --> 02:34:29,418
Ride now!

1351
02:34:30,931 --> 02:34:32,792
Ride now!

1352
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:36,457
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1353
02:34:36,665 --> 02:34:39,845
and the world's ending!

1354
02:34:41,253 --> 02:34:45,164
- Death!
- Death!

1355
02:34:46,257 --> 02:34:49,334
- Death!
- Death!

1356
02:34:50,105 --> 02:34:51,941
- Death!
- Death!

1357
02:34:52,358 --> 02:34:56,632
- Death!
- Death!

1358
02:35:00,752 --> 02:35:03,254
For Eorlingas!

1359
02:35:46,369 --> 02:35:47,673
Fire!

1360
02:35:51,895 --> 02:35:53,719
Death!

1361
02:35:57,264 --> 02:35:58,986
Charge!

1362
02:35:59,038 --> 02:36:00,125
Fire at will!

1363
02:36:58,105 --> 02:37:00,972
Set a fire in our flesh.

1364
02:37:18,876 --> 02:37:20,523
Stay this madness!

1365
02:37:24,944 --> 02:37:29,281
You may triumph in the field
of battle for a day...

1366
02:37:29,917 --> 02:37:33,452
but against the power that
has risen in the east...

1367
02:37:33,817 --> 02:37:36,684
there is no victory.

1368
02:38:06,245 --> 02:38:07,914
No!

1369
02:38:07,976 --> 02:38:10,833
You will not take my son from me!

1370
02:38:10,863 --> 02:38:12,970
No!

1371
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:25,586
Faramir.

1372
02:38:39,403 --> 02:38:43,103
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1373
02:39:11,048 --> 02:39:13,134
Drive them to the river!

1374
02:39:15,479 --> 02:39:17,773
Make safe the city!

1375
02:39:57,551 --> 02:39:59,272
Re-form the line!

1376
02:40:00,471 --> 02:40:02,347
Re-form the line!

1377
02:40:09,542 --> 02:40:12,306
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1378
02:40:12,774 --> 02:40:14,965
Charge!

1379
02:41:33,791 --> 02:41:35,042
Cut him down!

1380
02:42:02,049 --> 02:42:04,498
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1381
02:42:06,897 --> 02:42:07,992
Left!

1382
02:42:25,770 --> 02:42:27,229
Aim for their heads!

1383
02:42:33,277 --> 02:42:36,613
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1384
02:42:42,296 --> 02:42:43,235
Merry!

1385
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,888
Merry!

1386
02:44:05,345 --> 02:44:07,274
I didn't think it would end this way.

1387
02:44:08,630 --> 02:44:10,090
End?

1388
02:44:11,467 --> 02:44:13,688
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1389
02:44:15,970 --> 02:44:18,900
Death is just another path...

1390
02:44:19,766 --> 02:44:21,769
one that we all must take.

1391
02:44:22,737 --> 02:44:26,304
The grey rain curtain of
this world rolls back...

1392
02:44:26,407 --> 02:44:29,849
and all turns to silver glass.

1393
02:44:32,143 --> 02:44:33,915
And then you see it.

1394
02:44:35,834 --> 02:44:38,346
What, Gandalf?

1395
02:44:39,514 --> 02:44:40,953
See what?

1396
02:44:42,075 --> 02:44:44,082
White shores...

1397
02:44:45,959 --> 02:44:48,200
and beyond.

1398
02:44:49,764 --> 02:44:51,640
A far green country...

1399
02:44:52,403 --> 02:44:55,134
under a swift sunrise.

1400
02:44:59,305 --> 02:45:01,025
Well...

1401
02:45:01,077 --> 02:45:02,641
that isn't so bad.

1402
02:45:02,663 --> 02:45:03,944
No.

1403
02:45:06,290 --> 02:45:07,906
No, it isn't.

1404
02:45:24,225 --> 02:45:27,613
Rally to me! To me!

1405
02:45:48,572 --> 02:45:52,950
Feast on his flesh.

1406
02:45:57,382 --> 02:45:59,520
I will kill you if you touch him.

1407
02:45:59,531 --> 02:46:05,047
Do not come between the
Nazgul and his prey.

1408
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:17,408
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1409
02:47:17,643 --> 02:47:19,441
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1410
02:47:19,494 --> 02:47:23,313
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

1411
02:47:38,444 --> 02:47:40,820
There's plenty for the both of us.

1412
02:47:40,921 --> 02:47:43,266
May the best Dwarf win.

1413
02:48:00,628 --> 02:48:02,854
You fool.

1414
02:48:03,025 --> 02:48:06,441
No man can kill me.

1415
02:48:08,813 --> 02:48:11,989
Die now.

1416
02:48:22,629 --> 02:48:24,663
I am no man.

1417
02:48:41,189 --> 02:48:44,688
- 15! 16!
- 17!

1418
02:48:52,490 --> 02:48:54,400
Merry!

1419
02:49:36,408 --> 02:49:38,200
Legolas!

1420
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:02,971
33, 34.

1421
02:50:50,065 --> 02:50:52,436
That still only counts as one!

1422
02:50:52,566 --> 02:50:54,766
Come on, then. Come on!

1423
02:51:38,486 --> 02:51:41,322
I know your face...

1424
02:51:43,105 --> 02:51:45,027
Eowyn.

1425
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:49,993
My eyes darken.

1426
02:51:51,083 --> 02:51:52,521
No.

1427
02:51:53,334 --> 02:51:55,023
No.

1428
02:51:57,031 --> 02:51:59,538
I am going to save you.

1429
02:52:00,862 --> 02:52:03,209
You already did.

1430
02:52:06,889 --> 02:52:08,513
Eowyn...

1431
02:52:09,966 --> 02:52:12,509
my body is broken.

1432
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:20,022
You have to let me go.

1433
02:52:25,887 --> 02:52:28,481
I go to my fathers...

1434
02:52:29,933 --> 02:52:32,789
in whose mighty company...

1435
02:52:33,207 --> 02:52:36,582
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1436
02:52:53,154 --> 02:52:54,808
Eowyn.

1437
02:53:41,273 --> 02:53:43,771
Release us.

1438
02:53:45,627 --> 02:53:47,402
Bad idea.

1439
02:53:47,556 --> 02:53:51,282
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

1440
02:53:51,308 --> 02:53:53,567
You gave us your word.

1441
02:53:55,245 --> 02:53:57,434
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1442
02:53:58,659 --> 02:54:00,119
Go.

1443
02:54:00,824 --> 02:54:02,661
Be at peace.

1444
02:54:45,961 --> 02:54:47,900
Merry.

1445
02:54:48,475 --> 02:54:51,810
No!

1446
02:54:55,355 --> 02:54:58,119
No!

1447
02:55:21,768 --> 02:55:25,698
With a sigh.

1448
02:55:25,813 --> 02:55:29,575
You turn away.

1449
02:55:29,712 --> 02:55:33,747
With a deepening heart.

1450
02:55:33,779 --> 02:55:38,680
No more words to say.

1451
02:55:38,805 --> 02:55:42,328
You will find.

1452
02:55:42,380 --> 02:55:50,879
That the world has changed forever.

1453
02:56:15,569 --> 02:56:23,379
And the trees are now
turning from green to gold.

1454
02:56:27,247 --> 02:56:32,065
And the sun is now fading.

1455
02:56:32,170 --> 02:56:42,242
I wish I could hold you closer.

1456
02:56:45,073 --> 02:56:46,350
Merry!

1457
02:56:47,893 --> 02:56:50,000
Merry!

1458
02:57:01,343 --> 02:57:03,171
Merry.

1459
02:57:05,639 --> 02:57:06,885
Merry, it's me.

1460
02:57:09,497 --> 02:57:11,060
It's Pippin.

1461
02:57:13,564 --> 02:57:15,852
I knew you'd find me.

1462
02:57:16,024 --> 02:57:17,222
Yes.

1463
02:57:19,654 --> 02:57:21,729
Are you going to leave me?

1464
02:57:22,281 --> 02:57:23,988
No, Merry.

1465
02:57:25,283 --> 02:57:27,525
I'm going to look after you.

1466
02:58:11,225 --> 02:58:12,948
Hands off!

1467
02:58:13,102 --> 02:58:16,289
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1468
02:58:16,541 --> 02:58:20,706
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1469
02:58:22,225 --> 02:58:26,135
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1470
02:58:26,916 --> 02:58:32,077
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1471
02:58:52,566 --> 02:58:54,495
The scum tried to knife me.

1472
02:58:54,548 --> 02:58:56,489
Kill him!

1473
03:00:39,650 --> 03:00:41,717
That's for Frodo!

1474
03:00:41,996 --> 03:00:44,224
And for the Shire!

1475
03:00:47,628 --> 03:00:49,938
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1476
03:01:19,377 --> 03:01:22,763
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1477
03:01:23,861 --> 03:01:28,601
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1478
03:01:35,852 --> 03:01:37,605
Not if I stick you first.

1479
03:01:37,728 --> 03:01:39,292
Sam!

1480
03:01:44,350 --> 03:01:46,434
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1481
03:01:46,486 --> 03:01:48,620
Sorry for everything.

1482
03:01:48,833 --> 03:01:52,790
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1483
03:01:52,899 --> 03:01:55,833
They've taken it. Sam...

1484
03:01:56,601 --> 03:01:58,127
they took the Ring.

1485
03:01:58,843 --> 03:02:01,588
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1486
03:02:13,545 --> 03:02:15,772
I thought I'd lost you.

1487
03:02:16,152 --> 03:02:17,859
So I took it.

1488
03:02:19,019 --> 03:02:21,104
Only for safekeeping.

1489
03:02:22,355 --> 03:02:24,109
Give it to me.

1490
03:02:27,620 --> 03:02:29,869
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1491
03:02:34,503 --> 03:02:35,789
Sam.

1492
03:02:37,370 --> 03:02:39,337
Give me the Ring.

1493
03:03:00,049 --> 03:03:01,350
You must understand.

1494
03:03:04,844 --> 03:03:06,692
The Ring is my burden.

1495
03:03:07,869 --> 03:03:10,027
It will destroy you, Sam.

1496
03:03:13,185 --> 03:03:15,164
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1497
03:03:16,470 --> 03:03:18,127
We best find you some clothes.

1498
03:03:18,296 --> 03:03:21,332
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

1499
03:03:43,069 --> 03:03:45,275
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1500
03:03:45,781 --> 03:03:48,068
We made it to Mordor.

1501
03:03:49,408 --> 03:03:51,068
There are so many of them.

1502
03:03:52,037 --> 03:03:54,610
We'll never get through unseen.

1503
03:03:59,742 --> 03:04:03,085
It's him, the Eye.

1504
03:04:10,805 --> 03:04:13,426
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1505
03:04:13,891 --> 03:04:15,931
There's nothing for it.

1506
03:04:18,938 --> 03:04:23,351
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1507
03:04:32,534 --> 03:04:35,951
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1508
03:04:37,227 --> 03:04:40,093
The darkness is deepening.

1509
03:04:40,146 --> 03:04:42,440
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1510
03:04:42,450 --> 03:04:44,876
It's only a matter of time.

1511
03:04:46,350 --> 03:04:48,789
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

1512
03:04:49,843 --> 03:04:54,326
behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1513
03:04:54,483 --> 03:04:56,255
Let him stay there.

1514
03:04:56,265 --> 03:04:59,144
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1515
03:04:59,207 --> 03:05:04,545
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1516
03:05:11,218 --> 03:05:13,772
I've sent him to his death.

1517
03:05:15,284 --> 03:05:16,606
No.

1518
03:05:17,110 --> 03:05:19,528
There is still hope for Frodo.

1519
03:05:19,872 --> 03:05:24,001
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1520
03:05:25,085 --> 03:05:27,658
- We can give him that.
- How?

1521
03:05:28,005 --> 03:05:30,709
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1522
03:05:30,872 --> 03:05:33,005
Empty his lands.

1523
03:05:33,218 --> 03:05:36,302
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1524
03:05:36,868 --> 03:05:39,932
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1525
03:05:40,101 --> 03:05:41,677
Not for ourselves.

1526
03:05:41,872 --> 03:05:47,480
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1527
03:05:49,275 --> 03:05:53,059
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1528
03:05:53,811 --> 03:05:55,021
A diversion.

1529
03:05:55,167 --> 03:05:56,989
Certainty of death...

1530
03:05:57,096 --> 03:05:59,911
small chance of success...

1531
03:06:00,745 --> 03:06:02,364
what are we waiting for?

1532
03:06:02,935 --> 03:06:05,363
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1533
03:06:06,167 --> 03:06:08,207
He will not take the bait.

1534
03:06:09,712 --> 03:06:12,203
Oh, I think he will.

1535
03:06:46,520 --> 03:06:49,230
Long have you hunted me.

1536
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:51,420
Long have I eluded you.

1537
03:06:53,037 --> 03:06:54,833
No more.

1538
03:06:56,477 --> 03:06:58,958
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1539
03:07:43,450 --> 03:07:45,961
The city has fallen silent.

1540
03:07:47,620 --> 03:07:50,677
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1541
03:07:51,478 --> 03:07:53,186
It grows so cold.

1542
03:07:56,171 --> 03:07:59,227
It's just the damp of
the first spring rain.

1543
03:08:05,608 --> 03:08:08,820
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

1544
03:08:37,408 --> 03:08:39,024
Look, the Orcs...

1545
03:08:39,495 --> 03:08:41,559
they're moving off.

1546
03:08:42,611 --> 03:08:44,688
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1547
03:08:44,864 --> 03:08:47,190
some luck at last.

1548
03:08:47,367 --> 03:08:49,193
Move it, you slugs!

1549
03:08:50,442 --> 03:08:53,863
Come on! Faster!

1550
03:09:01,755 --> 03:09:04,987
Come along, you coldhearted
wretched scum...

1551
03:09:04,998 --> 03:09:09,548
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1552
03:09:12,391 --> 03:09:14,059
Come on!

1553
03:09:14,227 --> 03:09:16,438
What have I told you?

1554
03:09:16,458 --> 03:09:18,752
No evation...

1555
03:09:19,742 --> 03:09:21,566
Now move it!

1556
03:09:23,391 --> 03:09:24,896
Get up!

1557
03:09:25,269 --> 03:09:27,948
Come on, you slugs!

1558
03:09:28,084 --> 03:09:31,733
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1559
03:09:31,911 --> 03:09:37,207
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

1560
03:09:49,772 --> 03:09:53,577
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

1561
03:10:03,013 --> 03:10:06,606
Don't you know we're at war?

1562
03:10:28,924 --> 03:10:31,795
Company, halt!

1563
03:10:35,597 --> 03:10:39,007
Inspection!

1564
03:10:39,143 --> 03:10:41,639
Sam, help me.

1565
03:10:41,801 --> 03:10:43,638
Mr. Frodo!

1566
03:10:46,336 --> 03:10:48,896
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

1567
03:10:49,048 --> 03:10:50,896
It's so heavy.

1568
03:10:59,996 --> 03:11:01,200
Oh, no.

1569
03:11:06,825 --> 03:11:08,828
What do I do? What do we do?

1570
03:11:11,882 --> 03:11:13,046
- Hit me.
- What?

1571
03:11:13,186 --> 03:11:15,256
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1572
03:11:15,427 --> 03:11:17,005
Get off of me!

1573
03:11:17,670 --> 03:11:20,005
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1574
03:11:28,618 --> 03:11:30,689
Get off of me!

1575
03:11:31,590 --> 03:11:33,520
Break it up! Break it up!

1576
03:11:36,074 --> 03:11:40,693
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

1577
03:11:40,713 --> 03:11:43,153
Go, Sam. Now!

1578
03:11:52,078 --> 03:11:53,630
Move along, scum!

1579
03:11:53,799 --> 03:11:55,708
Back in the line!

1580
03:11:56,197 --> 03:11:58,010
You maggots!

1581
03:11:58,647 --> 03:12:01,680
Get back into the line, you slugs!

1582
03:12:04,018 --> 03:12:07,551
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1583
03:12:56,255 --> 03:12:58,399
I can't...

1584
03:12:58,549 --> 03:13:02,318
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1585
03:13:02,407 --> 03:13:03,647
It's... It's...

1586
03:13:03,816 --> 03:13:06,398
It's such a weight to carry.

1587
03:13:07,255 --> 03:13:08,318
It's...

1588
03:13:08,456 --> 03:13:10,453
Such a weight.

1589
03:13:15,388 --> 03:13:17,891
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

1590
03:13:19,246 --> 03:13:22,479
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

1591
03:13:37,546 --> 03:13:39,477
Mr. Frodo.

1592
03:13:40,934 --> 03:13:42,480
Look.

1593
03:13:44,950 --> 03:13:46,900
There is light...

1594
03:13:47,243 --> 03:13:48,807
and beauty up there...

1595
03:13:49,067 --> 03:13:51,537
that no shadow can touch.

1596
03:14:42,558 --> 03:14:44,213
Take mine.

1597
03:14:44,694 --> 03:14:46,838
There's a few drops left.

1598
03:15:02,004 --> 03:15:04,639
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1599
03:15:05,549 --> 03:15:08,736
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1600
03:16:01,593 --> 03:16:03,782
Frodo, get down!

1601
03:16:05,503 --> 03:16:07,453
Hide!

1602
03:16:17,599 --> 03:16:19,638
Frodo!

1603
03:16:25,418 --> 03:16:26,891
Where are they?

1604
03:17:02,954 --> 03:17:06,013
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1605
03:17:06,917 --> 03:17:09,773
Let justice be done upon him!

1606
03:17:53,212 --> 03:17:57,225
My master, Sauron the
Great, bids thee welcome.

1607
03:18:03,066 --> 03:18:06,777
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

1608
03:18:07,132 --> 03:18:10,283
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1609
03:18:10,416 --> 03:18:12,971
faithless and accursed.

1610
03:18:12,981 --> 03:18:16,986
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

1611
03:18:17,090 --> 03:18:19,906
He is to depart these
lands, never to return.

1612
03:18:20,843 --> 03:18:23,424
Old Greybeard.

1613
03:18:24,754 --> 03:18:29,141
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

1614
03:18:34,148 --> 03:18:35,477
Frodo.

1615
03:18:38,318 --> 03:18:39,778
Frodo.

1616
03:18:40,498 --> 03:18:41,977
- Silence.
- No!

1617
03:18:42,584 --> 03:18:44,152
Silence!

1618
03:18:45,921 --> 03:18:49,700
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1619
03:18:50,612 --> 03:18:54,787
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1620
03:19:00,153 --> 03:19:06,052
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

1621
03:19:08,650 --> 03:19:10,805
And he did, Gandalf.

1622
03:19:10,944 --> 03:19:12,719
He did.

1623
03:19:19,652 --> 03:19:21,228
And who is this?

1624
03:19:21,319 --> 03:19:23,478
Isildur's heir?

1625
03:19:23,613 --> 03:19:26,656
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1626
03:19:31,381 --> 03:19:33,986
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1627
03:19:36,126 --> 03:19:37,324
I do not believe it.

1628
03:19:39,306 --> 03:19:40,712
I will not.

1629
03:19:56,771 --> 03:19:58,603
Pull back.

1630
03:19:58,855 --> 03:20:00,938
Pull back!

1631
03:20:13,140 --> 03:20:15,201
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1632
03:20:17,102 --> 03:20:20,648
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1633
03:20:20,753 --> 03:20:22,668
Something's drawn its gaze.

1634
03:20:40,147 --> 03:20:42,940
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1635
03:20:44,787 --> 03:20:49,023
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1636
03:20:51,825 --> 03:20:53,781
I see in your eyes...

1637
03:20:54,119 --> 03:20:58,204
the same fear that would
take the heart of me.

1638
03:21:00,165 --> 03:21:03,920
A day may come when the
courage of Men fails...

1639
03:21:03,941 --> 03:21:07,539
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

1640
03:21:07,568 --> 03:21:10,385
But it is not this day.

1641
03:21:10,645 --> 03:21:13,712
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

1642
03:21:13,878 --> 03:21:16,759
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

1643
03:21:16,900 --> 03:21:19,388
But it is not this day.

1644
03:21:19,559 --> 03:21:21,219
This day we fight!

1645
03:21:23,314 --> 03:21:27,353
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1646
03:21:27,525 --> 03:21:31,772
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1647
03:23:00,231 --> 03:23:03,777
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1648
03:23:04,245 --> 03:23:06,570
What about side by side with a friend?

1649
03:23:10,084 --> 03:23:11,870
Aye.

1650
03:23:12,691 --> 03:23:14,504
I could do that.

1651
03:23:44,806 --> 03:23:46,903
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

1652
03:23:49,862 --> 03:23:52,115
It'll be spring soon.

1653
03:23:52,887 --> 03:23:55,622
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1654
03:23:55,754 --> 03:23:59,460
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1655
03:24:00,811 --> 03:24:04,841
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

1656
03:24:05,869 --> 03:24:10,266
and eating the first of the
strawberries with cream.

1657
03:24:12,176 --> 03:24:14,677
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

1658
03:24:16,243 --> 03:24:17,983
No, Sam.

1659
03:24:18,120 --> 03:24:21,104
I can't recall the taste of food...

1660
03:24:22,238 --> 03:24:25,523
nor the sound of water...

1661
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:29,282
nor the touch of grass.

1662
03:24:30,215 --> 03:24:31,789
I'm...

1663
03:24:32,665 --> 03:24:34,040
naked in the dark.

1664
03:24:35,689 --> 03:24:37,998
There's... there's nothing.

1665
03:24:38,139 --> 03:24:42,879
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

1666
03:24:44,135 --> 03:24:46,043
I can see him...

1667
03:24:46,429 --> 03:24:48,130
with my waking eyes.

1668
03:24:49,139 --> 03:24:51,637
Then let us be rid of it...

1669
03:24:52,216 --> 03:24:54,468
once and for all.

1670
03:24:55,188 --> 03:24:57,263
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1671
03:24:57,429 --> 03:25:00,060
I can't carry it for you...

1672
03:25:00,452 --> 03:25:02,523
but I can carry you.

1673
03:25:03,059 --> 03:25:04,814
Come on!

1674
03:25:35,227 --> 03:25:38,181
Aragorn.

1675
03:25:49,719 --> 03:25:53,474
Elessar.

1676
03:26:04,317 --> 03:26:06,745
For Frodo.

1677
03:26:41,698 --> 03:26:43,202
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1678
03:26:43,888 --> 03:26:46,125
A doorway.

1679
03:26:46,702 --> 03:26:48,372
We're almost there.

1680
03:26:50,717 --> 03:26:54,666
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1681
03:27:08,599 --> 03:27:10,270
Mustn't go that way.

1682
03:27:11,779 --> 03:27:14,277
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1683
03:27:14,438 --> 03:27:16,191
You swore!

1684
03:27:16,367 --> 03:27:18,442
You swore on the precious!

1685
03:27:20,328 --> 03:27:22,287
Smeagol promised!

1686
03:27:23,197 --> 03:27:25,200
Smeagol lied.

1687
03:28:17,676 --> 03:28:19,593
Frodo!

1688
03:28:46,664 --> 03:28:48,449
Eagles.

1689
03:28:49,843 --> 03:28:51,369
The eagles are coming!

1690
03:29:14,191 --> 03:29:16,064
Frodo!

1691
03:29:21,281 --> 03:29:22,602
I'm here, Sam.

1692
03:29:30,040 --> 03:29:31,706
Destroy it!

1693
03:29:42,238 --> 03:29:45,545
Go on! Now!

1694
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:48,259
Throw it in the fire!

1695
03:30:01,632 --> 03:30:04,323
What are you waiting for?

1696
03:30:06,168 --> 03:30:08,572
Just let it go!

1697
03:30:41,775 --> 03:30:44,018
The Ring is mine.

1698
03:30:47,563 --> 03:30:49,316
No.

1699
03:30:49,700 --> 03:30:51,022
No.

1700
03:30:59,450 --> 03:31:02,129
No!

1701
03:32:46,533 --> 03:32:48,439
Yes!

1702
03:32:49,610 --> 03:32:51,316
Yes!

1703
03:32:52,424 --> 03:32:55,316
Precious! Precious!

1704
03:32:55,449 --> 03:32:58,656
Precious! Precious!

1705
03:33:51,545 --> 03:33:53,414
Give me your hand!

1706
03:34:01,763 --> 03:34:04,171
Take my hand!

1707
03:34:06,819 --> 03:34:08,180
No!

1708
03:34:15,423 --> 03:34:17,399
Don't you let go.

1709
03:34:21,990 --> 03:34:23,568
Don't let go.

1710
03:34:25,172 --> 03:34:26,662
Reach!

1711
03:35:55,833 --> 03:35:58,703
Frodo!

1712
03:35:59,273 --> 03:36:02,296
Frodo!

1713
03:37:23,627 --> 03:37:25,495
It's gone.

1714
03:37:29,934 --> 03:37:31,709
It's done.

1715
03:37:32,176 --> 03:37:34,211
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1716
03:37:35,566 --> 03:37:38,004
It's over now.

1717
03:38:03,665 --> 03:38:06,038
I can see the Shire.

1718
03:38:08,254 --> 03:38:10,578
The Brandywine River.

1719
03:38:12,685 --> 03:38:14,709
Bag End.

1720
03:38:17,013 --> 03:38:19,759
Gandalf's fireworks.

1721
03:38:20,140 --> 03:38:23,931
The lights in the Party Tree.

1722
03:38:25,406 --> 03:38:28,557
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1723
03:38:29,681 --> 03:38:32,396
She had ribbons in her hair.

1724
03:38:35,311 --> 03:38:38,275
If ever I was to marry someone...

1725
03:38:39,170 --> 03:38:41,442
it would've been her.

1726
03:38:42,870 --> 03:38:44,947
It would've been her.

1727
03:38:57,051 --> 03:39:00,301
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

1728
03:39:04,558 --> 03:39:07,518
here at the end of all things.

1729
03:40:57,168 --> 03:40:59,250
Gandalf?

1730
03:41:18,856 --> 03:41:20,890
Frodo!

1731
03:41:40,648 --> 03:41:42,496
Gimli!

1732
03:43:25,439 --> 03:43:29,228
Now come the days of the king.

1733
03:43:34,198 --> 03:43:36,564
May they be blessed.

1734
03:43:56,824 --> 03:43:59,513
This day does not belong to one man...

1735
03:43:59,638 --> 03:44:01,555
but to all.

1736
03:44:03,183 --> 03:44:06,143
Let us together rebuild this world...

1737
03:44:06,311 --> 03:44:10,558
that we may share in the days of peace.

1738
03:44:22,682 --> 03:44:26,852
Et Earello...
(Out of the Great Sea...)

1739
03:44:27,113 --> 03:44:34,465
Endorenna utulien.
(to Middle-Earth I am come.)

1740
03:44:36,029 --> 03:44:39,887
Sinome maruvan...
(In this place will I abide...)

1741
03:44:40,720 --> 03:44:46,664
ar Hildinyar...
(and my heirs...)

1742
03:44:47,497 --> 03:44:56,569
tenn' Ambar-metta.
(unto the ending of the world.)

1743
03:45:05,014 --> 03:45:06,475
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

1744
03:46:45,009 --> 03:46:47,127
My friends...

1745
03:46:52,412 --> 03:46:55,102
you bow to no one.

1746
03:47:39,228 --> 03:47:41,393
And thus it was.

1747
03:47:41,522 --> 03:47:45,182
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1748
03:47:45,327 --> 03:47:47,897
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1749
03:47:48,039 --> 03:47:52,566
though eternally bound by
friendship and love...

1750
03:47:52,730 --> 03:47:55,148
was ended.

1751
03:48:00,135 --> 03:48:04,958
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

1752
03:48:05,086 --> 03:48:09,340
we found ourselves looking
upon a familiar sight.

1753
03:48:11,864 --> 03:48:14,590
We were home.

1754
03:48:21,145 --> 03:48:23,018
Hi.

1755
03:48:40,174 --> 03:48:42,411
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1756
03:49:30,483 --> 03:49:32,082
More of the same, Rosie.

1757
03:49:32,255 --> 03:49:34,247
Good night, lads.

1758
03:50:31,792 --> 03:50:35,811
How do you pick up the
threads of an old life?

1759
03:50:37,111 --> 03:50:39,359
How do you go on...

1760
03:50:39,509 --> 03:50:44,736
when in your heart you
begin to understand...

1761
03:50:45,974 --> 03:50:48,948
there is no going back?

1762
03:50:49,622 --> 03:50:53,329
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1763
03:50:53,793 --> 03:50:56,753
some hurts that go too deep...

1764
03:50:58,486 --> 03:51:01,342
that have taken hold.

1765
03:51:39,462 --> 03:51:41,379
Mr. Frodo?

1766
03:51:44,676 --> 03:51:46,093
What is it?

1767
03:51:47,908 --> 03:51:51,879
It's been four years to the
day since Weathertop, Sam.

1768
03:51:52,549 --> 03:51:55,263
It's never really healed.

1769
03:51:59,221 --> 03:52:04,487
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

1770
03:52:05,165 --> 03:52:09,023
And "The Lord of the
Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

1771
03:52:09,493 --> 03:52:11,692
You finished it.

1772
03:52:14,549 --> 03:52:16,075
Not quite.

1773
03:52:16,843 --> 03:52:19,454
There's room for a little more.

1774
03:52:22,057 --> 03:52:26,299
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1775
03:52:26,435 --> 03:52:29,753
that each of us must come
and go in the telling.

1776
03:52:30,606 --> 03:52:33,472
Bilbo's story was now over.

1777
03:52:33,943 --> 03:52:36,891
There would be no more journeys for him...

1778
03:52:37,020 --> 03:52:38,602
save one.

1779
03:52:39,314 --> 03:52:42,962
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1780
03:52:43,066 --> 03:52:45,101
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1781
03:52:45,256 --> 03:52:47,981
The Elves have accorded
you a special honor...

1782
03:52:48,123 --> 03:52:50,777
a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1783
03:52:52,450 --> 03:52:54,153
Frodo...

1784
03:52:55,578 --> 03:53:00,121
any chance of seeing that
old Ring of mine again?

1785
03:53:00,740 --> 03:53:02,993
The one I gave you.

1786
03:53:06,631 --> 03:53:08,790
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1787
03:53:11,324 --> 03:53:13,966
I'm afraid I lost it.

1788
03:53:14,138 --> 03:53:15,931
Oh.

1789
03:53:16,485 --> 03:53:18,016
Pity.

1790
03:53:20,760 --> 03:53:24,638
I should like to have
held it one last time.

1791
03:53:53,761 --> 03:53:58,843
Well, here's a sight I
have never seen before.

1792
03:54:12,998 --> 03:54:16,363
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1793
03:54:17,117 --> 03:54:19,945
The time has come...

1794
03:54:20,088 --> 03:54:23,373
for the dominion of Men.

1795
03:54:23,895 --> 03:54:27,376
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The sea calls us home.)

1796
03:54:35,781 --> 03:54:37,960
I think I'm...

1797
03:54:38,128 --> 03:54:42,514
quite ready for another adventure.

1798
03:55:13,578 --> 03:55:15,878
Farewell...

1799
03:55:16,029 --> 03:55:18,801
my brave Hobbits.

1800
03:55:20,720 --> 03:55:22,754
My work is now finished.

1801
03:55:26,559 --> 03:55:31,560
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

1802
03:55:32,191 --> 03:55:35,067
comes the end of our Fellowship.

1803
03:55:38,602 --> 03:55:41,104
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1804
03:55:41,782 --> 03:55:45,781
for not all tears are an evil.

1805
03:56:03,315 --> 03:56:05,254
It is time, Frodo.

1806
03:56:10,770 --> 03:56:12,804
What does he mean?

1807
03:56:15,254 --> 03:56:18,145
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1808
03:56:19,736 --> 03:56:22,488
And it has been saved.

1809
03:56:26,149 --> 03:56:28,828
But not for me.

1810
03:56:29,746 --> 03:56:32,202
You don't mean that.

1811
03:56:33,396 --> 03:56:35,493
You can't leave.

1812
03:56:43,927 --> 03:56:46,674
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1813
04:00:19,763 --> 04:00:22,634
My dear Sam

1814
04:00:24,559 --> 04:00:27,893
You cannot always be torn in two.

1815
04:00:28,052 --> 04:00:32,191
You will have to be one
and whole for many years.

1816
04:00:32,797 --> 04:00:38,398
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1817
04:00:39,522 --> 04:00:42,824
Your part in the story will go on.

1818
04:00:43,537 --> 04:00:45,322
Well...

1819
04:00:47,185 --> 04:00:48,915
I'm back.
