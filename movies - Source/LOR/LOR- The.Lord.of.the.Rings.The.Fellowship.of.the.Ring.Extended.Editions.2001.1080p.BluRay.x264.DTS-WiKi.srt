1
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,640
I amar prestar aen.

2
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,939
The world is changed.

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,939
Han mathon ne nen.

4
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,239
I feel it in the water.

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,640
Han mathon ne chae.

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,339
I feel it in the earth.

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,239
A han noston ned 'wilith.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,340
I smell it in the air.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
Much that once was...

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,440
is lost.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,139
For none now live who remember it.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,640
The Lord of the Rings.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,340
It began with the forging
of the great rings.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,540
Three were given to the elves:

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,440
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,239
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,740
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,540
And nine...

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,640
nine rings were gifted
to the race of men...

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,740
who, above all else, desire power.

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,940
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,740
But they were all of them deceived.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,140
For another ring was made.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,440
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,340
the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,640
to control all others.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,740
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,140
and his will to dominate all life.

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,040
One ring to rule them all.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,639
One by one...

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,340
the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,640
But there were some who resisted.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,740
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

34
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,640
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,739
Tangado haid! (Hold positions!)

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,440
Leithio I philinn! (Fire the arrows!)

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,640
Victory was near.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,740
But the power of the ring...

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
could not be undone.

40
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,940
It was in this moment...

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,540
when all hope had faded...

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,740
that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,240
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

44
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,540
The ring passed to Isildur...

45
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,840
who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

46
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
But the hearts of men...

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,440
are easily corrupted.

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,240
And the ring of power
has a will of its own.

49
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,140
It betrayed Isildur...

50
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,440
to his death.

51
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,440
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

52
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,940
were lost.

53
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,040
History became legend...

54
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,240
legend became myth.

55
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,240
And for two and a half thousand years...

56
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,240
the ring passed out of all knowledge.

57
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,640
Until, when chance came...

58
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
it ensnared a new bearer.

59
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,540
My precious.

60
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,440
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

61
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,440
who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

62
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,740
And there it consumed him.

63
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,940
It came to me.

64
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,540
My own. My love. My own.

65
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,440
My precious.

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,540
The ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.

67
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,540
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

68
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,240
And in the gloom of
Gollum's cave, it waited.

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,840
Darkness crept back into
the forests of the world.

70
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,940
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

71
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,940
whispers of a nameless fear.

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,440
And the ring of power perceived...

73
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,440
its time had now come.

74
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,540
It abandoned Gollum.

75
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,540
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

76
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,040
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

77
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
What's this?

78
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,139
A hobbit.

79
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,940
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

80
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,039
A ring.

81
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Lost!

82
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,439
The 22nd day of September...

83
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,140
My precious is lost!

84
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,740
For the time will soon come...

85
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,040
when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,340
In the year 1400...

87
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,939
by Shire-reckoning.

88
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,740
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

89
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,040
the Shire...

90
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,040
Middle-earth.

91
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,940
The third age of this world.

92
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,340
The Fellowship of the Ring.

93
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,240
There and back again.

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,940
A Hobbit's tale.

95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,040
By Bilbo Baggins.

96
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,540
Now...

97
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,340
where to begin?

98
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Ah, yes...

99
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,040
"Concerning...

100
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,740
Hobbits."

101
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,340
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

102
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,639
for many hundreds of years...

103
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,939
quite content to
ignore and be ignored...

104
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,040
by the world of the big folk.

105
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,940
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

106
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,440
Hobbits must seem of
little importance...

107
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,540
being neither renowned
as great warriors...

108
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,940
nor counted among the very wise.

109
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,340
Frodo! Someone at the door.

110
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,140
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

111
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,640
that Hobbits' only
real passion is for food.

112
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,340
A rather unfair observation...

113
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,040
as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

114
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,340
and the smoking of pipe-weed.

115
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,640
But where our hearts truly lie...

116
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
is in peace and quiet...

117
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
and good, tilled earth.

118
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,140
For all Hobbits share a
love of things that grow.

119
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,640
And yes, no doubt to others
our ways seem quaint.

120
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,040
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

121
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,540
It is no bad thing to
celebrate a simple life.

122
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,040
Frodo, the door!

123
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,839
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,740
Frodo!

125
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,940
Down from the door where it began

126
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,540
And I must follow if I can

127
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,740
The road goes ever on and on

128
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,240
Down from the door where it began

129
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,440
Now far ahead the road has gone

130
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,940
And I must follow if I can
You're late.

131
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,040
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

132
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,440
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

133
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,840
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

134
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,440
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

135
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,340
How is the old rascal?

136
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,440
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

137
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,040
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

138
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,239
Well, that should please him.

139
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Half the Shire's been invited.

140
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,140
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

141
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,540
And so life in the Shire goes on...

142
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,840
very much as it has this past age.

143
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,440
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

144
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,640
If it comes at all.

145
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,340
For things are made to
endure in the Shire...

146
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,940
passing from one generation to the next.

147
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,340
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

148
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,040
in Bag End.

149
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,540
And there always will be.

150
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,540
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

151
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,140
I mean, more than usual.

152
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

153
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,740
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

154
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,240
Where's it gone?

155
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
He's up to something.

156
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,640
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

157
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,700
But I know you have
something to do with it.

158
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Good gracious me.

159
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,040
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

160
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,240
Indeed.

161
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,740
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,228
If you're referring to the
incident with the dragon.

163
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:09,040
I was barely involved.

164
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,940
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

165
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

166
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,640
Oh, really?

167
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,240
Gandalf! Gandalf!

168
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Fireworks, Gandalf!

169
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,240
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

170
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Gandalf?

171
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,740
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

172
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,140
So am I.

173
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,439
No, thank you!

174
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,340
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

175
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,140
And what about very old friends?

176
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,140
Gandalf?

177
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,140
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

178
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,440
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

179
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,340
You haven't aged a day.

180
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,940
Come on, come in!

181
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,540
Welcome, welcome.

182
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,240
Oh, here we are.

183
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,439
Tea... or maybe something
a little stronger?

184
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,340
I've got a few bottles of
the old winyard left 1296.

185
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,440
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

186
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,140
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

187
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,040
Just tea, thank you.

188
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,201
I was expecting you sometime last week.

189
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,640
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

190
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,428
You caught me a bit
unprepared I'm afraid. We've

191
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,940
only got cold chicken
and a bit of pickle...

192
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,540
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

193
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,740
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart...

194
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,440
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

195
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,440
I've just found some sponge cake.

196
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,180
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

197
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,240
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

198
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,540
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

199
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,640
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

200
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm not at home!

201
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,040
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

202
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,380
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

203
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,440
They've never forgiven
me for living this long.

204
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,439
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

205
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,540
never giving me a moment's peace.

206
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,840
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

207
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,540
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

208
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,640
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

209
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,140
All the arrangements are made.

210
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,740
Oh, thank you.

211
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Frodo suspects something.

212
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

213
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,040
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

214
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,440
You will tell him, won't you?

215
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

216
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,140
I know.

217
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,840
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

218
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,740
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

219
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,740
The woods, the fields.

220
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Little rivers.

221
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,440
I am old, Gandalf.

222
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

223
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,839
I feel thin.

224
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,740
Sort of stretched...

225
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,240
like butter scraped over too much bread.

226
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,940
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

227
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,340
And I don't expect I shall return.

228
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,840
In fact, I mean not to.

229
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,440
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

230
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,539
Gandalf, my old friend...

231
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,440
this will be a night to remember.

232
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,440
Hello, hello.

233
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,640
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

234
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

235
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,340
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

236
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,340
Go on!

237
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,240
So there I was...

238
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,540
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

239
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,739
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

240
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,240
about how they were going to cook us.

241
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,440
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

242
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,040
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

243
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,840
that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

244
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,340
and turned them all to stone!

245
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,140
Quickly.

246
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Up they go!

247
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,540
No no, the big one - big one

248
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,439
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

249
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,539
Are all these children yours?

250
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,640
Good gracious, you have been productive.

251
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,040
Bilbo?

252
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,440
Sackville-Bagginses!

253
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Quickly, hide!

254
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,840
Thank you, my boy.

255
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,640
You're a good lad, Frodo.

256
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,740
I'm very selfish, you know.

257
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,640
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

258
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,240
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

259
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,940
but it wasn't out of charity.

260
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,939
I think it was because...

261
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,340
of all my numerous relations...

262
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,140
you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

263
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
Bilbo, have you been at
the Gaffer's home brew?

264
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
No.

265
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,040
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

266
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,540
The point is, Frodo...

267
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,640
you'll be all right.

268
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,148
Done!

269
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,180
You're supposed to
stick it in the ground.

270
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,839
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

271
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,540
This was your idea.

272
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,940
Bilbo.

273
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,740
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

274
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,340
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

275
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,340
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

276
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,140
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

277
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
I might've known.

278
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Speech, Bilbo!

279
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,639
Speech!

280
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,840
Speech!

281
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,340
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

282
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,240
Tooks and Brandybucks...

283
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,940
Grubbs, Chubbs...

284
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Hornblowers...

285
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
Bolgers...

286
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,040
Bracegirdles...

287
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,840
- and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

288
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Today is my 111th birthday!

289
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,539
Happy birthday!

290
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,840
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

291
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,040
such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

292
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,740
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

293
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,440
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

294
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,840
I have things to do.

295
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I've put this off for far too long.

296
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,140
I regret to announce this is the end!

297
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,540
I'm going now.

298
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,540
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

299
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,140
Goodbye.

300
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
I suppose you think that
was terribly clever.

301
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,040
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

302
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,139
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

303
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,439
and none of them should be used lightly.

304
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,640
It was just a bit of fun.

305
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,540
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

306
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,440
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

307
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,340
As often as I can spare them.

308
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,740
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

309
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,240
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

310
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,740
It's in an envelope over
there on the mantelpiece.

311
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,840
No. Wait, it's...

312
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,040
here in my pocket.

313
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,840
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

314
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,040
Yet, after all, why not?

315
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,340
- Why shouldn t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

316
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,040
Is that so hard?

317
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,640
Well, no.

318
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,540
And yes.

319
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel I ike parting with it.

320
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,640
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

321
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,940
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

322
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,140
It's mine.

323
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,040
My own.

324
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,240
- My precious.
- Precious?

325
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,340
It's been called that
before, but not by you.

326
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,140
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

327
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,140
I think you've had that
ring quite long enough.

328
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,140
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

329
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,540
Do not take me for some
conjurer of cheap tricks.

330
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,440
I am not trying to rob you.

331
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm trying to help you.

332
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,940
All your long years, we've been friends.

333
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,540
Trust me as you once did.

334
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,240
Let it go.

335
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,740
You're right, Gandalf.

336
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,540
The ring must go to Frodo.

337
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,940
It's late. The road is long.

338
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,640
Yes, it is time.

339
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,240
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

340
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,140
I've thought up an ending for my book:

341
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,640
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

342
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,440
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

343
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,940
Goodbye, Gandalf.

344
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,240
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

345
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,240
The road goes ever on and on...

346
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,340
Until our next meeting.

347
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,240
It's mine. My own.

348
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,940
My precious.

349
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,040
Riddles in the dark.

350
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,839
Bilbo!

351
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,440
Bilbo!

352
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,140
My precious.

353
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,840
Precious.

354
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,540
He's gone, hasn't he?

355
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,440
He talked for so long about leaving...

356
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,340
I didn't think he'd really do it.

357
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,840
Gandalf?

358
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,740
Bilbo's ring.

359
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,440
He's gone to stay with the elves.

360
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,640
He's left you Bag End.

361
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,939
Along with all his possessions.

362
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,940
The ring is yours now.

363
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,039
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

364
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,440
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

365
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,840
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

366
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,440
I don't understand.

367
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Neither do I.

368
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,439
Keep it secret.

369
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Keep it safe.

370
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,540
Shire!

371
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Baggins!

372
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,340
"The year 3434 of the second age.

373
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,840
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

374
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,840
and the finding of the ring of power."

375
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,240
"It has come to me.

376
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,840
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

377
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,440
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

378
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,440
for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

379
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
It is precious to me...

380
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,740
though I buy it with great pain.

381
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,940
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

382
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,940
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

383
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,240
A secret now that only fire can tell."

384
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Shire... Baggins.

385
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,540
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

386
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,740
That way.

387
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,639
"Hey ho to the dock I go

388
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,039
To heal my heart and drown my woe

389
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,539
Rain may fall and wind may blow

390
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,640
But there still be...

391
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,240
many miles to go

392
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,440
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

393
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,740
And the stream that falls
from hill to plain

394
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,840
Better than rain or rippling brook

395
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,440
Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"

396
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,640
There's been some strange
folk crossing the Shire.

397
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,840
Dwarves and others of a
less than savory nature.

398
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,940
War is brewing.

399
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,340
The mountains are fair
teeming with goblins.

400
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,339
Far-off tales and children s
stories, that's all that is.

401
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,939
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

402
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

403
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,739
And proud of it.

404
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,339
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

405
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

406
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

407
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,439
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

408
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,040
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

409
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,640
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

410
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,240
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

411
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,540
Does she?

412
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,140
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

413
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
Is it secret? Is it safe?

414
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
What are you doing?

415
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,640
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

416
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,040
It's quite cool.

417
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,240
What can you see?

418
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,440
Can you see anything?

419
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,640
Nothing.

420
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,140
There's nothing.

421
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,840
Wait.

422
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,140
There are markings.

423
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,040
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

424
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,740
There are few who can.

425
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,040
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

426
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Mordor!

427
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,140
In the common tongue, it says:

428
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,840
"One ring to rule them all...

429
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,440
One ring to find them...

430
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,840
One ring to bring them all...

431
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,140
and in the darkness bind them."

432
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,839
This is the One ring...

433
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,140
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

434
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,440
Taken by Isildur from the
hand of Sauron himself.

435
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,840
Bilbo found it.

436
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,240
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

437
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,940
For 60 years, the ring lay
quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

438
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,540
prolonging his life, delaying old age.

439
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,540
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

440
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,240
The ring has awoken.

441
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,140
It's heard its master's call.

442
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,140
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

443
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
No, Frodo.

444
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,340
The spirit of Sauron endured.

445
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,740
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

446
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,340
Sauron has returned.

447
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,340
His orcs have multiplied.

448
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,540
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

449
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,440
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

450
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
He is seeking it.

451
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,740
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

452
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,840
For the ring yearns above all else...

453
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,440
to return to the hand of its master.

454
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,640
They are one... the
ring and the Dark Lord.

455
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Frodo...

456
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,340
he must never find it.

457
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
All right.

458
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,240
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

459
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,140
No one knows it's here, do they?

460
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,040
Do they, Gandalf?

461
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,440
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

462
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,640
I looked everywhere for
the creature Gollum.

463
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
But the enemy found him first.

464
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,340
I don't know how long they tortured him.

465
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,940
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

466
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,340
Shire!

467
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,140
Baggins!

468
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,239
Shire.

469
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,140
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

470
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Who goes there?

471
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,140
Take it, Gandalf!

472
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,639
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

473
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

474
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,540
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

475
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,340
I dare not take it.

476
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,140
Not even to keep it safe.

477
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Understand, Frodo...

478
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,540
I would use this ring
from a desire to do good.

479
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,540
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

480
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,240
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

481
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,740
No, it can't.

482
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,540
What must I do?

483
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,540
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

484
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,140
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

485
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Bree.

486
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,440
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

487
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,140
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

488
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,040
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

489
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't have any answers.

490
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,140
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

491
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,640
He'll know what to do.

492
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,040
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

493
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,840
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

494
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,740
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

495
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,640
I can cut across country easily enough.

496
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,540
My dear Frodo.

497
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,839
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

498
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

499
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,440
And yet, after a hundred years...

500
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,640
they can still surprise you.

501
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,740
Get down.

502
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,240
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

503
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,280
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

504
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,180
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there... If you follow me.

505
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,640
A little late for trimming
the verge, don't you think?

506
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,739
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

507
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,040
Nothing important.

508
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,039
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

509
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,739
and something about the
end of the world but...

510
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,440
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

511
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,940
No?

512
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,340
Perhaps not.

513
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,940
I've thought of a better use for you.

514
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,640
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

515
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,440
Be careful, both of you.

516
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,440
The enemy has many spies in his service:

517
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,540
Birds, beasts.

518
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,240
Is it safe?

519
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,240
Never put it on...

520
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,839
for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

521
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,540
Always remember, Frodo...

522
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,140
the ring is trying to
get back to its master.

523
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
It wants to be found.

524
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,440
This is it.

525
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,940
This is what?

526
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
If I take one more step...

527
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,640
it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

528
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,540
Come on, Sam.

529
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,840
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

530
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,040
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

531
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,640
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

532
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,940
there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

533
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,740
Sam.

534
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,440
Wood-elves.

535
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,540
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

536
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,840
To the Grey Havens.

537
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,539
They're leaving Middle-earth.

538
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,840
Never to return.

539
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
I don't know why...

540
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,040
it makes me sad.

541
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,540
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

542
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,239
Just shut your eyes...

543
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,040
and imagine you're
back in your own bed...

544
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,240
with a soft mattress and
a lovely feather pillow.

545
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,239
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

546
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
I'm never going to be
able to sleep out here.

547
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,940
Me neither, Sam.

548
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,540
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

549
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,439
The hour grows late.

550
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

551
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,840
seeking my counsel.

552
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,940
For that is why you have come, is it not?

553
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,440
My old friend.

554
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,340
Saruman.

555
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,140
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

556
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,240
So the ring of power has been found.

557
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,540
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

558
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,040
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

559
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,940
Your love of the half ling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

560
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,840
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

561
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,640
Time?

562
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,240
What time do you think we have?

563
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,440
Sauron has regained much
of his former strength.

564
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,940
He cannot yet take physical form...

565
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,840
but his spirit has
lost none of its potency.

566
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,440
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

567
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,940
His gaze pierces cloud,
shadow, earth and flesh.

568
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,740
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

569
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,740
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

570
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,640
The eye of Sauron.

571
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,440
He is gathering all evil to him.

572
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,640
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

573
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,740
great enough for an
assault upon Middle-earth.

574
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,440
You know this?

575
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,540
How?

576
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,740
I have seen it.

577
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,340
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

578
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,640
Why?

579
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,740
Why should we fear to use it?

580
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,340
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

581
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,740
We do not know who else may be watching.

582
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,139
The hour is later than you think.

583
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,640
Sauron's forces are already moving.

584
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,640
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

585
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,039
The Nine?

586
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,140
They crossed the river
Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

587
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,140
disguised as riders in black.

588
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,240
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

589
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,140
And kill the one who carries it.

590
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,040
Frodo!

591
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,040
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

592
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,640
There are none who can.

593
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,840
Against the power of Mordor...

594
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,740
there can be no victory.

595
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,840
We must join with him, Gandalf.

596
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,440
We must join with Sauron.

597
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,740
It would be wise, my friend.

598
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,540
Tell me... friend...

599
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,440
when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

600
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,740
I gave you the chance of...

601
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,540
aiding me willingly...

602
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,840
but you have elected the way of pain!

603
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,740
Mr. Frodo?

604
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,140
Frodo? Frodo!

605
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,739
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

606
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,840
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

607
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,540
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

608
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,540
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

609
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,540
Frodo.

610
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,040
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

611
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,640
Get off him.

612
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,639
Come on, Frodo.

613
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,640
What's the meaning of this?

614
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,140
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

615
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,540
You get back here!

616
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,840
Get out of my field!

617
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,740
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

618
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,940
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

619
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,339
And some cabbages.

620
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,439
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

621
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,540
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

622
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,040
he's clearly overreacting.

623
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,740
Run!

624
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,740
Oh, that was close.

625
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,940
I think I've broken something.

626
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,339
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

627
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,040
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

628
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,640
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

629
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,840
That's mine.

630
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,240
That's nice, Merry.

631
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,839
Here's a nice one, Sam.

632
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,440
I think we should get off the road.

633
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,139
Get off the road!

634
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,740
Quick!

635
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,940
Be quiet!

636
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,440
What was that?

637
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,640
Anything?

638
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,840
Nothing.

639
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,840
What is going on?

640
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,040
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

641
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,940
Frodo?

642
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,740
Get down!

643
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,840
I have to leave the Shire.

644
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,239
Sam and I must get to Bree.

645
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,840
Right.

646
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,440
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

647
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,040
Run!

648
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,240
This way! Follow me!

649
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,940
Run!

650
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,940
Get the rope, Sam!

651
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,140
Frodo!

652
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,240
Run, Frodo!

653
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,739
- Go!
- Hurry!

654
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,440
Frodo, come on!

655
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,540
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

656
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,540
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

657
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,840
Come on.

658
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,340
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

659
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,739
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

660
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,740
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

661
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,440
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

662
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,040
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

663
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,740
It's my job to ask
questions after nightfall.

664
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,939
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

665
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,240
Can't be too careful.

666
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,340
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

667
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,040
Excuse me.

668
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,840
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

669
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:15,028
If you're looking for
accommodation, we got

670
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,940
some nice cozy hobbit-sized
rooms available.

671
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,940
Always proud to cater to
little folk, Mister...?

672
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

673
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,940
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

674
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,240
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

675
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,440
Gandalf.

676
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,940
Oh, yes...

677
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
I remember. Elderly chap.

678
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,540
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

679
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,740
Not seen him for six months.

680
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,940
What do we do now?

681
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,340
Sam... he'll be here.
He'll come.

682
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,240
Get out of my way!

683
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,339
What's that?

684
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,940
This, my friend, is a pint.

685
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,840
It comes in pints?

686
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,740
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

687
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,940
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

688
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,140
Excuse me.

689
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,840
That man in the corner. Who is he?

690
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,440
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

691
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:52,140
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

692
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,840
Strider.

693
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,040
Baggins...

694
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,140
Baggins...

695
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,840
Baggins...

696
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,540
Baggins...

697
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,140
Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

698
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,439
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

699
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,739
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

700
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,040
and my third cousin, twice removed...

701
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,340
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

702
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,340
You cannot hide.

703
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,340
I see you.

704
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,839
There is no life...

705
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,140
in the void.

706
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,840
Only...

707
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,340
death.

708
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:47,040
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

709
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,840
What do you want?

710
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,540
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

711
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,540
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

712
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,340
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

713
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,140
but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

714
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,340
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

715
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,639
Yes.

716
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,640
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

717
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,140
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

718
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,940
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

719
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,140
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

720
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,440
They're coming.

721
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,540
What are they?

722
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,840
They were once men.

723
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,240
Great kings of men.

724
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

725
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,640
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

726
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,140
One by one, falling into darkness.

727
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,840
Now they are slaves to his will.

728
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,939
They are the Nazgûl.

729
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,740
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

730
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,139
At all times they feel...

731
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,140
the presence of the ring...

732
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,740
drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

733
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,740
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

734
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:57,940
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

735
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,140
I think a servant of the
enemy would look fairer...

736
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:05,340
and feel fouler.
He's foul enough.

737
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,840
We have no choice but to trust him.

738
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:12,340
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

739
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,040
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

740
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,440
We're going to see the elves.

741
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:47,240
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

742
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,239
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

743
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,640
What about second breakfast?

744
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,040
Don't think he knows about
second breakfast, Pip.

745
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:04,540
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

746
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,940
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

747
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,140
Pippin!

748
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,940
What do they eat when
they can't get Hobbit?

749
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,740
"Tinúviel elvanui
(Tinúviel the elven-fair)

750
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,940
Elleth alfirin ethelhael
(Immortal maiden elven-wise)

751
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:10,240
O hon ring finnil fuinui
(About him cast her night-dark hair)

752
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,740
A renc gelebrin thiliol."
(And arms like silver glimmering.")

753
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,140
Who is she?

754
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,340
This woman you sing of.

755
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,239
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

756
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,440
The elf-maiden who gave her
love to Beren, a mortal.

757
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,540
What happened to her?

758
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,240
She died.

759
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,540
Get some sleep, Frodo.

760
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,940
The power of Isengard is at your command...

761
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,440
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

762
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,640
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

763
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:24,640
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

764
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,140
We have work to do.

765
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,440
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

766
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,840
Rip them all down.

767
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,040
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.

768
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,340
We shall rest here tonight.

769
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:06,440
These are for you.
Keep them close.

770
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,240
I'm going to have a look around.

771
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,540
Stay here.

772
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,339
My tomato's burst.

773
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,439
Could I have some bacon?

774
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,540
Want a tomato, Sam?

775
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,540
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

776
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,440
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

777
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,540
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

778
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,840
Go!

779
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,840
Back, you devils!

780
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,540
Frodo!

781
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,440
Oh, Sam.

782
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
Strider!

783
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:55,540
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

784
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:01,940
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

785
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,740
Hurry!

786
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,840
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

787
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,940
Hold on, Frodo.

788
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,540
Gandalf!

789
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,740
Gwaihir - Go.

790
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,640
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

791
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,640
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

792
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,340
Is he going to die?

793
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,340
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

794
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,340
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

795
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,139
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

796
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,340
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

797
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,640
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

798
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,140
What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

799
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,540
Frodo.

800
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,240
Im Arwen - Telin le thaed.
(I am Arwen - I've come to help you.)

801
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:23,640
Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad.
(Hear my voice... come back to the light.)

802
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,840
Who is she?

803
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,240
Frodo.

804
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,940
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

805
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,540
He's not going to last.

806
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,340
We must get him to my father.

807
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,940
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

808
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:54,140
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

809
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,628
Dartho guin Berian. Rych
le ad tolthathon. (Stay

810
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:58,039
with the Hobbits, I'll
send horses for you.)

811
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,801
Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.
(I'm the faster rider, I'll take him.)

812
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,139
Andelu I ven.
(The Road is too dangerous.)

813
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,340
What are they saying?

814
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,528
Frodo fîr. Ae athradon I hîr...
(Frodo is dying.

815
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,440
If I can get across
the river...)

816
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,040
tûr gwaith nîn beriatha hon. (...the
power of my people will protect him.)

817
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,040
I do not fear them.

818
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,240
Be iest lîn. (As you wish.)

819
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,640
Arwen... ride hard.
Don't Look back.

820
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,040
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

821
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,540
Noro lim, Asfaloth!
(Ride fast Asfaloth!)

822
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:33,140
Give up the half ling, She-elf.

823
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,940
If you want him, come and claim him.

824
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,239
Nîn o Chithaeglir...
(Waters of the Misty Mountains...)

825
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,639
lasto beth daer
(...listen to the great word.)

826
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,128
Rimmo nÆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
(Flow

827
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:53,639
waters of loudwater
against the ringwraiths)

828
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,239
Nîn o Chithaeglir...
(Waters of the Misty Mountains...)

829
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,739
lasto beth daer
(...listen to the great word.)

830
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,678
Rimmo nÆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
(Flow

831
01:22:58,691 --> 01:23:00,640
waters of loudwater
against the ringwraiths)

832
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,340
No. No!

833
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,840
Frodo, no.

834
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,340
Frodo, don't give in.

835
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,540
Not now.

836
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,040
What grace is given me...

837
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,540
let it pass to him.

838
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,940
Let him be spared.

839
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,540
Save him.

840
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,740
Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad.
(Hear my voice... come back to the light.)

841
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:21,040
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

842
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:27,840
And it is 10 o'clock in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

843
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:33,740
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

844
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,540
And you're lucky to be here too.

845
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,140
A few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid.

846
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:47,440
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

847
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,640
What happened, Gandalf?

848
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:03,940
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

849
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,440
I was delayed.

850
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:15,540
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

851
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,340
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

852
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,440
Embrace the power of the ring...

853
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,540
or embrace your own destruction!

854
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,640
There is only one lord of the ring.

855
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,940
Only one who can bend it to his will.

856
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,740
And he does not share power.

857
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,340
So you have chosen... death.

858
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:17,240
Gandalf? What is it?

859
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,140
Nothing, Frodo.

860
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,740
Frodo!

861
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,340
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

862
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:29,340
Sam has hardly left your side.

863
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:31,941
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

864
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:37,240
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

865
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,340
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

866
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,640
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

867
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,740
Bilbo.

868
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:37,765
SharePirate.Com Subs

869
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,639
There and back again

870
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,340
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

871
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,940
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

872
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,040
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

873
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,840
visit Lake-town...

874
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,440
see the Lonely Mountain again.

875
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:07,740
But age, it seems, has
finally caught up with me.

876
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,840
I miss the Shire.

877
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:27,240
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

878
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,140
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

879
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,640
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

880
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,140
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

881
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,640
My dear boy.

882
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,640
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

883
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,240
No harm in being prepared.

884
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,040
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

885
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,040
- More than anything.
- I did.

886
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,340
It's just...

887
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,640
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

888
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:15,440
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

889
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:19,040
seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

890
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,940
Off home.

891
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,040
You are right, Sam.

892
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:32,040
We did what we set out to do.

893
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,140
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

894
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,640
I am ready to go home.

895
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,340
His strength returns.

896
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:50,140
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

897
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,439
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the ring...

898
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,240
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

899
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,940
It is a burden he should
never have had to bear.

900
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:06,440
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

901
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:11,340
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

902
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,340
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

903
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,840
Our list of allies grows thin.

904
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,340
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

905
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:25,140
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

906
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,840
He's breeding an army in
the caverns of Isengard.

907
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,640
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

908
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,340
Saruman is coming for the ring.

909
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,740
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

910
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:44,340
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

911
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:49,340
Gandalf...

912
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,140
the ring cannot stay here.

913
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,940
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

914
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,940
They must decide now how to end it.

915
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,440
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

916
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,740
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

917
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:33,040
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

918
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,540
It is in men that we must place our hope.

919
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,640
Men?

920
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,640
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

921
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,240
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

922
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:52,140
It is because of men the ring survives.

923
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,040
I was there, Gandalf.

924
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,540
I was there 3000 years ago...

925
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,740
when Isildur took the ring.

926
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,740
I was there the day the
strength of men failed.

927
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,940
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

928
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,140
I led Isildur into the
heart of Mount Doom...

929
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,939
where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

930
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,640
Cast it into the fire!

931
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:36,540
- Destroy it!
- No.

932
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,140
Isildur!

933
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:45,240
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

934
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:53,640
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

935
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,240
There's no strength left
in the world of men.

936
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:03,240
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

937
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,840
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

938
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:12,340
He turned from that path a long time ago.

939
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,740
He has chosen exile.

940
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,740
You are no elf.

941
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,040
Men of the South are welcome here.

942
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:54,140
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

943
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:58,440
Then we are here on common purpose...

944
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,240
friend.

945
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,440
The shards of Narsil.

946
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,240
The blade that cut the
ring from Sauron's hand.

947
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,540
It's still sharp.

948
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,440
But no more than a broken heirloom.

949
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,440
Why do you fear the past?

950
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:19,440
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

951
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,240
You are not bound to his fate.

952
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,640
The same blood flows in my veins.

953
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,340
The same weakness.

954
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,840
Your time will come.

955
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:43,340
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

956
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,480
A si I-Dhuath ú-orthor, Aragorn. (The
shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn)

957
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,640
Ú or le a ú or nin.
(Not over you, not over me.)

958
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,740
Renich I lú I erui govannem?
(Do you remember when we first met?)

959
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,540
Nauthannen I ned ôl reniannen.
(I thought I had strayed into a dream.)

960
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,140
Gwenwin in enninath.
(Long years have passed.)

961
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:23,840
Ú-'arnech in naeth I si celich. (You did
not wear the troubles you carry now.)

962
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,321
Renech I beth I pennen?
(Do you remember what I told you?)

963
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,640
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

964
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,540
forsaking the immortal
life of your people.

965
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,739
And to that I hold.

966
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:50,440
I would rather share one
lifetime with you...

967
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:54,540
than face all the ages
of this world alone.

968
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,740
I choose a mortal life.

969
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,340
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

970
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,140
like my heart.

971
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,640
Strangers from distant
lands, friends of old...

972
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:41,740
you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

973
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,878
Middle-earth stands upon
the brink of destruction.

974
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:47,240
None can escape it.

975
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,040
You will unite, or you will fall.

976
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,540
Each race is bound to
this fate, this one doom.

977
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,840
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

978
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,740
So it is true.

979
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,040
The ring of power...

980
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,640
The doom of men...

981
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,240
In a dream...

982
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,140
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

983
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,140
but in the West a pale light lingered.

984
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,740
A voice was crying:

985
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,840
"Your doom is near at hand.

986
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,640
Isildur's bane is found."

987
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,440
Isildur s bane.

988
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,340
Boromir!

989
01:38:59,341 --> 01:39:02,740
"Ash nazg durbatulûk...
("One ring to rule them all...)

990
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,540
Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

991
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,140
Ash nazg thrakatulûk...
(...One ring to bring them all...)

992
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:17,440
agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."
(...and in the darkness bind them.")

993
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:27,240
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

994
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:31,140
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

995
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,440
for the black speech of Mordor...

996
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,140
may yet be heard...

997
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:38,240
in every corner of the West!

998
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:41,140
The ring is altogether evil.

999
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,040
It is a gift.

1000
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,740
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1001
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,440
Why not use this ring?

1002
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:51,440
Long has my father, the
Steward of Gondor...

1003
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:55,840
kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1004
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,440
are your lands kept safe.

1005
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,440
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1006
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,440
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1007
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:13,140
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1008
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,940
And what would a ranger
know of this matter?

1009
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,140
This is no mere ranger.

1010
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,740
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1011
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,240
You owe him your allegiance.

1012
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,340
Aragorn.

1013
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:37,940
This is Isildur s heir?

1014
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:43,040
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1015
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,840
Havo dad, Legolas.
(Sit down, Legolas.)

1016
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:52,740
Gondor has no king.

1017
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,340
Gondor needs no king.

1018
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,540
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1019
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,040
You have only one choice.

1020
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,640
The ring must be destroyed.

1021
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:21,440
What are we waiting for?

1022
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,540
The ring cannot be destroyed,
Gimli, son of Gloin...

1023
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,040
by any craft that we here possess.

1024
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:45,640
The ring was made in the
fires of Mount Doom.

1025
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:49,740
Only there can it be unmade.

1026
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,440
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1027
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:58,039
and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1028
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,539
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1029
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,640
One of you...

1030
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,340
must do this.

1031
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:11,940
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1032
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:16,440
Its black gates are guarded
by more than just orcs.

1033
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:21,340
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1034
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:25,840
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1035
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,640
It is a barren wasteland...

1036
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,340
riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1037
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,540
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1038
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,940
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1039
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,478
Have you heard nothing
Lord Elrond has said?

1040
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,640
The ring must be destroyed.

1041
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,440
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1042
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:53,240
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1043
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:58,740
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1044
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:03,340
Never trust an elf!

1045
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:10,240
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1046
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:13,540
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1047
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,939
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk
(One ring to rule them all...)

1048
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,439
Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

1049
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,539
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1050
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,539
Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

1051
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,539
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1052
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,739
Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

1053
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,840
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1054
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,340
I will take it.

1055
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,140
I will take it.

1056
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,940
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1057
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,340
Though...

1058
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:02,340
I do not know the way.

1059
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,440
I will help you bear this
burden, Frodo Baggins...

1060
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:12,140
as long as it is yours to bear.

1061
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,340
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1062
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:18,440
I will.

1063
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,940
You have my sword.

1064
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
And you have my bow.

1065
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:30,840
And my ax.

1066
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,840
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1067
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,540
If this is indeed the
will of the Council...

1068
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,640
then Gondor will see it done.

1069
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,528
Mr. Frodo's not going
anywhere without me.

1070
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:56,840
No indeed it is hardly
possible to separate you...

1071
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,940
even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1072
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,440
Oy. We're coming too!

1073
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,339
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1074
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,740
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1075
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,439
mission.

1076
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,990
Quest.

1077
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:17,490
Thing.

1078
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:21,990
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1079
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,490
Nine companions.

1080
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,090
So be it.

1081
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:32,490
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1082
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:34,990
Great!

1083
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:37,490
Where are we going?

1084
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:16,390
Anirne hene beriad I chen lîn.
(She wanted to protect her child.)

1085
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:19,398
Ned Imladris nauthant
e le beriathar aen.

1086
01:46:19,411 --> 01:46:21,130
(She thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.)

1087
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:27,490
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1088
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,790
That you'd never escape your fate.

1089
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:33,690
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

1090
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:38,090
but only you have the power to wield it.

1091
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:41,690
I do not want that power.

1092
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:44,590
I have never wanted it.

1093
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,390
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1094
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:55,290
My old sword! Sting.

1095
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:56,790
Here, take it. Take it.

1096
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:05,990
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

1097
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:10,790
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

1098
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:15,690
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1099
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:18,390
Here's a pretty thing.

1100
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:20,090
Mithril.

1101
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:25,190
As light as a feather, and
as hard as dragon scales.

1102
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:28,690
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1103
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:38,890
My old ring.

1104
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:43,990
I should very much like...

1105
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:48,190
to hold it again, one last time.

1106
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,190
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1107
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:13,590
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1108
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:21,290
I'm sorry for everything.

1109
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:40,490
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

1110
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:44,390
On you who travel with him, no oath...

1111
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:47,790
nor bond is laid to go
further than you will.

1112
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:53,690
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1113
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:57,990
May the blessings of elves and men...

1114
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:01,290
and all free folk go with you.

1115
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:08,290
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1116
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:29,390
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1117
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:31,790
Left.

1118
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:55,590
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1119
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:59,590
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1120
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:03,589
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1121
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,490
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1122
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:10,489
Move your feet.

1123
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:11,990
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1124
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,690
Faster!

1125
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:18,690
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1126
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:21,590
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1127
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:25,190
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

1128
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:29,590
My cousin Balin would
give us a royal welcome.

1129
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:35,190
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1130
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:45,790
Sorry!

1131
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,990
Get him!

1132
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:51,790
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1133
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:54,690
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1134
01:51:58,590 --> 01:52:00,090
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1135
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:03,190
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1136
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:06,090
It's moving fast.

1137
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:08,590
Against the wind.

1138
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,490
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1139
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:14,390
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1140
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:49,590
Spies of Saruman.

1141
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:53,490
The passage south is being watched.

1142
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:58,090
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

1143
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:12,290
Frodo!

1144
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,590
Boromir.

1145
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:38,089
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1146
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:41,290
over so small a thing.

1147
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:46,590
Such a little thing.

1148
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:48,290
Boromir!

1149
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,490
Give the ring to Frodo.

1150
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:03,390
As you wish.

1151
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:06,190
I care not.

1152
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:46,090
So, Gandalf, you try to
lead them over Caradhras.

1153
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:50,990
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1154
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:55,290
If the mountain defeats you...

1155
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:59,890
will you risk a more dangerous road?

1156
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:12,190
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1157
01:55:12,490 --> 01:55:15,189
There is a fell voice on the air.

1158
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,389
Nai yarvaxea rasselya!
(May your horn be bloodstained!)

1159
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:17,890
It's Saruman!

1160
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:31,290
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1161
01:55:31,690 --> 01:55:33,490
No!

1162
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:38,578
Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo,
nuitho I 'ruith! (Sleep

1163
01:55:38,591 --> 01:55:41,590
Caradhras, be still, lie
still, hold your wrath!)

1164
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:46,889
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1165
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:51,389
Nai yarvaxea rasselya...
(May your bloodstained horn...)

1166
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:55,090
taltuva notto-carinnar!
(...fall upon enemy heads!)

1167
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:41,790
We must get off the mountain!

1168
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:46,490
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1169
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:50,090
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1170
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:53,990
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1171
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:57,090
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1172
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:02,590
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1173
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:08,290
The dwarves delved too
greedily and too deep.

1174
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:14,090
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1175
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:18,790
Shadow and flame.

1176
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:24,990
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1177
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:31,889
We cannot stay here!

1178
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:34,790
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1179
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:36,690
Frodo?

1180
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:42,490
We will go through the mines.

1181
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:45,290
So be it.

1182
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:55,690
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1183
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:01,490
How is your shoulder?

1184
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:04,890
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1185
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:09,090
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1186
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:12,390
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1187
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:16,690
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

1188
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:19,490
And, I fear, from within.

1189
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:26,290
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1190
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:29,290
Trust your own strengths.

1191
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:32,189
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1192
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:34,390
for good or for evil.

1193
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:36,890
Some are greater than I am.

1194
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:40,890
And against some I have
not yet been tested.

1195
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,790
The walls...

1196
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,590
of Moria.

1197
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:55,290
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1198
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:59,790
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1199
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:02,790
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1200
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:13,990
Well, let's see.

1201
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:15,790
Ithildin.

1202
01:59:16,490 --> 01:59:19,690
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1203
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:38,290
It reads; "The Doors of
Durin, Lord of Moria.

1204
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:43,289
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1205
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:45,628
Oh It's quite simple. If
you are a friend, you

1206
01:59:45,641 --> 01:59:47,990
speak the password and
the doors will open.

1207
01:59:48,690 --> 01:59:53,790
Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen!
(Gate of the elves, open now for me!)

1208
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:08,390
lasto beth lammen.
(...listen to the word of my tongue.)

1209
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:12,890
Nothing's happening.

1210
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:24,090
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

1211
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:27,290
men and orcs.

1212
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,789
What are you going to do, then?

1213
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:31,190
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1214
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:33,390
And if that does not shatter them...

1215
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:36,290
and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

1216
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:39,890
I will try to find the opening words.

1217
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:45,490
Ando Eldarinwa...
(Gate of elves...)

1218
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:49,690
a lasta quettanya...
(...listen to my word...)

1219
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:52,390
Fenda Casarinwa...
(...threshold of dwarves...)

1220
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:55,290
Mines are no place for a pony.

1221
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:59,489
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1222
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:00,889
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

1223
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:03,590
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1224
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:07,790
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1225
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:17,090
Do not disturb the water.

1226
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:19,290
Oh, it's useless.

1227
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:34,090
It's a riddle.

1228
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:39,990
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1229
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:43,290
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1230
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:45,990
Mellon.

1231
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:08,790
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1232
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:14,890
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1233
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:19,590
This, my friend, is the
home of my cousin Balin.

1234
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:22,489
And they call it a mine.

1235
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:24,590
A mine!

1236
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:28,890
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1237
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:36,690
No...

1238
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:39,590
No!

1239
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:43,790
Goblins.

1240
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:51,890
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1241
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:55,590
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1242
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:00,790
- Frodo!
- Help!

1243
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:02,689
Strider!

1244
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:05,490
- Help!
- Get off him!

1245
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:06,790
Aragorn!

1246
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,290
Frodo!

1247
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,689
Into the mines!

1248
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:48,990
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1249
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:55,090
Run!

1250
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:15,590
We now have but one choice.

1251
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:20,490
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1252
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:22,890
Be on your guard.

1253
02:04:23,190 --> 02:04:26,490
There are older and fouler
things than orcs...

1254
02:04:26,890 --> 02:04:30,190
in the deep places of the world.

1255
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:41,990
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1256
02:04:42,490 --> 02:04:46,090
Let us hope that our
presence may go unnoticed.

1257
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:35,590
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1258
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:41,490
or jewels... but mithril.

1259
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:04,590
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1260
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:08,889
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1261
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:10,990
I never told him...

1262
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:15,990
but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

1263
02:06:28,490 --> 02:06:30,190
Pippin.

1264
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:53,390
I have no memory of this place.

1265
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,990
- Are we Lost?
- No.

1266
02:06:57,290 --> 02:06:59,690
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1267
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:01,390
- Merry?
- What?

1268
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:03,490
I'm hungry.

1269
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:19,190
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1270
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:23,490
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1271
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:27,990
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1272
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:30,390
or was set loose.

1273
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:34,490
Now the ring has brought him here.

1274
02:07:37,190 --> 02:07:39,890
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1275
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:45,690
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1276
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:50,790
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1277
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:56,890
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1278
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:00,790
Before it drove him mad.

1279
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,890
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1280
02:08:04,190 --> 02:08:05,290
Pity?

1281
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:09,290
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1282
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:15,290
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1283
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:19,390
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1284
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:25,690
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

1285
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:28,790
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1286
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:35,190
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1287
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:38,990
before this is over.

1288
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:44,290
The pity of Bilbo may
rule the fate of many.

1289
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:54,390
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1290
02:08:55,890 --> 02:08:57,889
I wish none of this had happened.

1291
02:08:57,890 --> 02:09:02,890
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1292
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:09,290
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1293
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:14,790
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1294
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:17,790
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1295
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:22,490
In which case, you also
were meant to have it.

1296
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:25,890
And that is an encouraging thought.

1297
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:32,790
It's that way.

1298
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:35,290
- He's remembered.
- No.

1299
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:39,190
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1300
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:44,490
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1301
02:09:59,590 --> 02:10:03,590
Let me risk a little more light.

1302
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:10,390
Behold...

1303
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:15,990
the great realm and
dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1304
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:21,890
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1305
02:10:46,990 --> 02:10:48,690
Gimli!

1306
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:57,690
No!

1307
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:03,390
Oh, no.

1308
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:06,490
No.

1309
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:15,790
"Here lies Balin...

1310
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:18,290
son of Fundin...

1311
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:21,190
Lord of Moria."

1312
02:11:22,290 --> 02:11:23,890
He is dead, then.

1313
02:11:25,790 --> 02:11:27,390
It's as I feared.

1314
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:48,490
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1315
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:53,290
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1316
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:57,090
We have barred the gates...

1317
02:11:57,790 --> 02:12:00,190
but cannot hold them for long.

1318
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:03,190
The ground shakes.

1319
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:05,190
Drums...

1320
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:08,890
drums in the deep.

1321
02:12:12,690 --> 02:12:14,590
We cannot get out.

1322
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:20,390
A shadow moves in the dark.

1323
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:24,690
We cannot get out.

1324
02:12:27,790 --> 02:12:29,590
They are coming."

1325
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:14,590
Fool of a Took!

1326
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:18,590
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1327
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:46,390
Frodo!

1328
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:50,190
Orcs.

1329
02:13:57,290 --> 02:13:59,190
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1330
02:14:06,490 --> 02:14:08,190
They have a cave-troll.

1331
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:25,190
Let them come!

1332
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:28,990
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1333
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:50,790
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1334
02:16:55,590 --> 02:16:57,290
Frodo!

1335
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:32,590
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1336
02:17:33,690 --> 02:17:35,490
Frodo!

1337
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:22,590
Frodo!

1338
02:19:22,890 --> 02:19:24,190
Oh, no.

1339
02:19:32,590 --> 02:19:34,390
He's alive.

1340
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:39,790
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1341
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:42,190
You should be dead.

1342
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:44,890
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1343
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:49,790
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

1344
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:56,890
Mithril.

1345
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:02,190
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1346
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:09,990
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1347
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:26,790
This way!

1348
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:40,090
What is this new devilry?

1349
02:21:56,290 --> 02:21:59,090
A Balrog.

1350
02:21:59,390 --> 02:22:02,490
A demon of the ancient world.

1351
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:07,090
This foe is beyond any of you.

1352
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:09,890
Run!

1353
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:18,690
Quickly!

1354
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:36,690
Gandalf.

1355
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:38,790
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1356
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:42,790
The bridge is near.

1357
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:48,790
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1358
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:19,690
Gandalf!

1359
02:23:38,090 --> 02:23:39,290
Merry! Pippin!

1360
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:51,890
Sam!

1361
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:57,790
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1362
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:02,390
Not the beard!

1363
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:17,590
Steady.

1364
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:21,190
Hold on!

1365
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:43,590
Hang on!

1366
02:24:54,290 --> 02:24:55,990
Lean forward!

1367
02:24:59,090 --> 02:24:59,990
Steady.

1368
02:25:01,390 --> 02:25:02,490
Come on!

1369
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:04,190
Now!

1370
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:23,090
Over the bridge!

1371
02:25:23,390 --> 02:25:24,890
Fly!

1372
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:11,590
You cannot pass!

1373
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:13,490
Gandalf!

1374
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:22,490
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1375
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:27,290
The dark fire will not
avail you, flame of Udûn!

1376
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:39,390
Go back to the Shadow.

1377
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:51,490
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

1378
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:22,490
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1379
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:32,690
Fly, you fools!

1380
02:27:36,890 --> 02:27:38,990
No!

1381
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:47,290
Aragorn!

1382
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:47,490
Legolas, get them up.

1383
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:53,390
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1384
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:57,190
By nightfall, these hills
will be swarming with orcs.

1385
02:28:57,590 --> 02:29:00,690
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1386
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:04,990
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1387
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:08,790
On your feet, Sam.

1388
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:10,590
Frodo?

1389
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:14,290
Frodo!

1390
02:30:06,890 --> 02:30:09,290
Stay close, young hobbits!

1391
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:14,190
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1392
02:30:14,490 --> 02:30:16,890
An elf-witch...

1393
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:20,390
of terrible power.

1394
02:30:21,090 --> 02:30:23,189
All who look upon her...

1395
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:25,190
fall under her spell.

1396
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:26,690
Frodo!

1397
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:30,989
And are never seen again.

1398
02:30:30,990 --> 02:30:35,490
Your coming to us is as
the footsteps of doom.

1399
02:30:35,890 --> 02:30:39,490
You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.

1400
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:41,490
Mr. Frodo?

1401
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:52,390
Well, here's one dwarf she
won't ensnare so easily.

1402
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:57,090
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1403
02:31:04,890 --> 02:31:09,290
The dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

1404
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:16,790
Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.
(Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil.)

1405
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:19,089
Govannas vîn gwennen le,
(Our fellowship stands in your debt, )

1406
02:31:19,090 --> 02:31:20,990
Haldir o Lórien.
(Haldir of Lórien.)

1407
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:24,789
A, Aragorn in Dúnedain...
(Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain...)

1408
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:27,289
istannen le ammen.
(...you are known to us.)

1409
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:28,089
Haldir.

1410
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:30,010
So much for the legendary
courtesy of the elves!

1411
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:31,989
Speak words we can all understand!

1412
02:31:31,990 --> 02:31:36,590
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

1413
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:39,390
And you know what this dwarf says to that?

1414
02:31:39,790 --> 02:31:44,390
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
(I spit upon your grave!)

1415
02:31:46,390 --> 02:31:48,290
That was not so courteous.

1416
02:31:54,890 --> 02:31:58,790
You bring great evil with you.

1417
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:02,890
You can go no further.

1418
02:32:09,090 --> 02:32:12,251
Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu I ven! (We
need your protection. The road is fell!)

1419
02:32:14,890 --> 02:32:16,190
Merin le telim.
(I wish we may come with you.)

1420
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:19,711
Henio, aníron boe ammen I dulu lîn!
(Please, understand, we need your support!)

1421
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:22,590
Aragorn!

1422
02:32:33,090 --> 02:32:35,090
Merin le telim.
(I wish we may come with you.)

1423
02:32:37,790 --> 02:32:39,470
Andelu I ven.
(The road is very dangerous.)

1424
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,790
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1425
02:32:44,090 --> 02:32:45,890
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1426
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:50,690
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1427
02:32:51,790 --> 02:32:54,790
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1428
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:59,690
You will follow me.

1429
02:33:11,490 --> 02:33:13,390
Cares Galeton.

1430
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:16,889
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1431
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:22,590
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1432
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:44,890
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1433
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:50,590
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1434
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:56,790
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1435
02:34:57,290 --> 02:34:59,089
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1436
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:02,290
For I much desire to speak with him.

1437
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:05,190
I can no longer see him from afar.

1438
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:11,190
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1439
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:13,990
He has fallen into shadow.

1440
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:23,090
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1441
02:35:24,990 --> 02:35:28,490
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1442
02:35:29,390 --> 02:35:32,690
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1443
02:35:34,890 --> 02:35:37,990
Needless were none of the
deeds of Gandalf in life.

1444
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:41,990
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1445
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:50,890
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1446
02:35:51,290 --> 02:35:53,490
Gimli, son of Gloin.

1447
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:57,990
For the world has grown full of peril...

1448
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:02,190
and in all lands...

1449
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:05,890
love is now mingled with grief.

1450
02:36:18,590 --> 02:36:21,290
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1451
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:24,790
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1452
02:36:27,890 --> 02:36:31,089
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1453
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:34,190
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1454
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:37,890
to the ruin of all.

1455
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:47,890
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

1456
02:36:49,690 --> 02:36:54,190
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1457
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:58,390
for you are weary with
sorrow and much toil.

1458
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:02,790
Tonight, you will sleep...

1459
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:06,490
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1460
02:37:08,090 --> 02:37:09,790
one who has seen the eye!

1461
02:37:24,490 --> 02:37:26,990
A lament for Gandalf.

1462
02:37:34,390 --> 02:37:35,790
What do they say about him?

1463
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:38,690
I have not the heart to tell you.

1464
02:37:41,690 --> 02:37:43,890
For me, the grief is still too near.

1465
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:49,690
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1466
02:37:50,090 --> 02:37:52,890
There should be a verse about them.

1467
02:37:56,390 --> 02:37:58,290
The finest rockets ever seen

1468
02:37:59,490 --> 02:38:02,290
They burst in stars of blue and green

1469
02:38:03,390 --> 02:38:08,390
Or after thunder, silver showers

1470
02:38:09,190 --> 02:38:11,890
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1471
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:15,990
Oh, that doesn't do them
justice by a long road.

1472
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:29,490
Take some rest.

1473
02:38:29,790 --> 02:38:32,390
These borders are well-protected.

1474
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:35,090
I will find no rest here.

1475
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:40,890
I heard her voice inside my head.

1476
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:44,890
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1477
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:50,390
She said to me; "Even now
there is hope Left."

1478
02:38:52,090 --> 02:38:54,690
But I cannot see it.

1479
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:58,590
It is long since we had any hope.

1480
02:39:08,890 --> 02:39:10,990
My father is a noble man.

1481
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:13,990
But his rule is failing...

1482
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:19,590
and our people lose faith.

1483
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:24,590
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1484
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:28,290
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1485
02:39:31,290 --> 02:39:34,190
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1486
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:36,790
The white tower of Ecthelion.

1487
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:40,790
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1488
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:44,990
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1489
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:49,989
Have you ever been called home...

1490
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:53,990
by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1491
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:57,790
I have seen the white city...

1492
02:39:58,290 --> 02:39:59,690
long ago.

1493
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:05,590
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1494
02:40:06,690 --> 02:40:09,490
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1495
02:40:10,190 --> 02:40:13,290
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1496
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:23,090
Will you look into the mirror?

1497
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:24,790
What will I see?

1498
02:41:27,890 --> 02:41:30,190
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1499
02:41:31,090 --> 02:41:32,890
For the mirror...

1500
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:35,590
shows many things.

1501
02:41:38,690 --> 02:41:40,890
Things that were...

1502
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:43,790
things that are...

1503
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:46,390
and some things...

1504
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:53,390
that have not yet come to pass.

1505
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:18,790
I know what it is you saw.

1506
02:43:21,290 --> 02:43:23,590
For it is also in my mind.

1507
02:43:25,590 --> 02:43:29,390
It is what will come to
pass if you should fail.

1508
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:36,590
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1509
02:43:37,490 --> 02:43:40,690
He will try to take the ring.

1510
02:43:40,990 --> 02:43:42,890
You know of whom I speak.

1511
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:48,390
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1512
02:43:50,190 --> 02:43:52,490
If you ask it of me...

1513
02:43:52,990 --> 02:43:55,890
I will give you the one ring.

1514
02:43:57,190 --> 02:43:59,290
You offer it to me freely.

1515
02:44:03,790 --> 02:44:07,590
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1516
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:17,390
In place of a dark lord,
you would have a queen...

1517
02:44:17,890 --> 02:44:21,490
not dark but beautiful
and terrible as the dawn!

1518
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:25,290
Treacherous as the sea!

1519
02:44:25,790 --> 02:44:30,590
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1520
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:33,590
All shall love me...

1521
02:44:33,890 --> 02:44:36,590
and despair.

1522
02:44:50,790 --> 02:44:54,990
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1523
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:57,690
and go into the West...

1524
02:44:58,090 --> 02:45:02,390
and remain Galadriel.
I cannot do this alone.

1525
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:10,090
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1526
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:12,590
is to be alone.

1527
02:45:16,090 --> 02:45:18,790
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

1528
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:20,590
And I am its keeper.

1529
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:27,390
This task was appointed to you.

1530
02:45:28,590 --> 02:45:31,290
And if you do not find a way...

1531
02:45:32,690 --> 02:45:34,590
no one will.

1532
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:38,090
Then I know what I must do.

1533
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:39,990
It's just...

1534
02:45:43,290 --> 02:45:45,490
I'm afraid to do it.

1535
02:45:48,990 --> 02:45:53,990
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1536
02:45:59,590 --> 02:46:05,090
Do you know how the orcs
first came into being?

1537
02:46:06,090 --> 02:46:09,190
They were elves once.

1538
02:46:10,490 --> 02:46:13,690
Taken by the dark powers...

1539
02:46:14,190 --> 02:46:17,190
tortured and mutilated.

1540
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:22,690
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1541
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:24,890
And now...

1542
02:46:26,490 --> 02:46:28,290
perfected.

1543
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:32,090
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1544
02:46:34,190 --> 02:46:36,390
whom do you serve?

1545
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:39,090
Saruman!

1546
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:03,290
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until, they are found.

1547
02:47:03,690 --> 02:47:06,490
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1548
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:09,590
You will taste man-flesh!

1549
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:18,290
One of the half lings carries
something of great value.

1550
02:47:18,690 --> 02:47:22,690
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1551
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:25,990
Kill the others.

1552
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:50,390
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1553
02:47:51,690 --> 02:47:55,390
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

1554
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:04,290
Lembas.

1555
02:48:04,590 --> 02:48:06,190
Elvish waybread.

1556
02:48:08,590 --> 02:48:11,490
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1557
02:48:18,090 --> 02:48:19,989
How many did you eat?

1558
02:48:19,990 --> 02:48:21,790
Four.

1559
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:30,190
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1560
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:34,390
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

1561
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:37,190
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1562
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:41,190
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

1563
02:48:41,590 --> 02:48:46,390
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1564
02:48:54,990 --> 02:48:57,190
Le aphadar aen.
(You are being tracked.)

1565
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:03,690
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

1566
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:25,790
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1567
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:29,490
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1568
02:49:35,090 --> 02:49:37,490
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1569
02:49:37,790 --> 02:49:41,590
They have already seen service in war.

1570
02:49:41,890 --> 02:49:44,090
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1571
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:47,490
You will find your courage.

1572
02:49:49,490 --> 02:49:51,489
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1573
02:49:51,490 --> 02:49:54,389
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1574
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:56,590
Thank you, my lady.

1575
02:49:58,490 --> 02:50:01,690
Have you run out of those
nice, shiny daggers?

1576
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:11,090
And what gift would a
dwarf ask of the elves?

1577
02:50:11,490 --> 02:50:13,590
Nothing.

1578
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:17,490
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1579
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:23,190
for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

1580
02:50:30,390 --> 02:50:31,890
Actually...

1581
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:33,790
There was one thing.

1582
02:50:34,690 --> 02:50:37,190
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1583
02:50:37,490 --> 02:50:40,190
Stupid to ask.

1584
02:50:42,890 --> 02:50:44,889
I have nothing greater to give...

1585
02:50:44,890 --> 02:50:48,590
than the gift you already bear.

1586
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:51,390
Am meleth dîn...
(For her love...)

1587
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:54,528
I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.
(...I fear

1588
02:50:54,541 --> 02:50:56,990
the grace of Arwen
Evenstar will diminish.)

1589
02:50:58,290 --> 02:51:02,790
Aníron I e broniatha, ad ae periatham...
(I would have her leave these shores...)

1590
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:06,390
athar I methid en-amar hen.
(...and be with her people.)

1591
02:51:08,090 --> 02:51:13,690
Aníron I e círatha na Valannor. (I would
have her take the ship to Valinor.)

1592
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:16,990
That choice is yet before her.

1593
02:51:17,890 --> 02:51:20,690
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1594
02:51:21,090 --> 02:51:26,590
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

1595
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:31,290
or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1596
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:40,690
Namárië. (Farewell.)

1597
02:51:44,190 --> 02:51:47,990
Nadath nâ I moe cerich.
(There is much you have yet to do.)

1598
02:51:49,690 --> 02:51:57,690
Dan, ú-'eveditham, Elessar.
(We shall not meet again, Elessar.)

1599
02:51:59,090 --> 02:52:02,189
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1600
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:05,690
I give you the light of Earendil...

1601
02:52:06,690 --> 02:52:08,890
our most beloved star.

1602
02:52:18,090 --> 02:52:22,290
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1603
02:52:22,690 --> 02:52:26,690
when all other lights go out.

1604
02:52:35,790 --> 02:52:38,790
I have taken my worst
wound at this parting...

1605
02:52:39,590 --> 02:52:43,590
having looked my last
upon that which is fairest.

1606
02:52:44,590 --> 02:52:47,790
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1607
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:50,090
What was her gift?

1608
02:52:50,390 --> 02:52:55,090
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1609
02:52:55,990 --> 02:52:58,790
She gave me three.

1610
02:54:41,090 --> 02:54:44,390
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1611
02:54:48,290 --> 02:54:51,190
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1612
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:54,590
But he's too clever a waterman.

1613
02:54:55,590 --> 02:54:58,789
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1614
02:54:58,790 --> 02:55:01,090
it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1615
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:03,390
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1616
02:55:03,690 --> 02:55:06,690
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1617
02:55:07,090 --> 02:55:09,990
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1618
02:55:10,990 --> 02:55:13,890
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

1619
02:55:14,190 --> 02:55:15,290
But you're not.

1620
02:55:15,690 --> 02:55:18,189
I'm here to help you.

1621
02:55:18,190 --> 02:55:19,990
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1622
02:55:26,090 --> 02:55:28,590
You can't help me, Sam.

1623
02:55:30,990 --> 02:55:32,590
Not this time.

1624
02:55:35,590 --> 02:55:37,590
Get some sleep.

1625
02:55:43,990 --> 02:55:46,090
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1626
02:55:46,690 --> 02:55:49,290
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1627
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:52,190
Strike out for Mordor
from a place of strength.

1628
02:55:52,590 --> 02:55:55,290
There is no strength in
Gondor that can avail us.

1629
02:55:55,990 --> 02:55:57,890
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

1630
02:55:59,790 --> 02:56:02,589
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1631
02:56:02,590 --> 02:56:05,590
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1632
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:09,190
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1633
02:56:09,490 --> 02:56:11,590
But you will not see that.

1634
02:56:12,090 --> 02:56:13,390
You are afraid!

1635
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:16,190
All your life, you have
hidden in the shadows.

1636
02:56:16,590 --> 02:56:19,890
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1637
02:56:22,490 --> 02:56:26,690
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1638
02:56:38,690 --> 02:56:39,990
Frodo.

1639
02:56:41,890 --> 02:56:43,290
The Argonath.

1640
02:56:46,890 --> 02:56:50,390
Long have I desired to look
upon the kings of old.

1641
02:56:51,290 --> 02:56:53,090
My kin.

1642
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:14,290
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1643
02:58:14,690 --> 02:58:17,090
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1644
02:58:17,390 --> 02:58:20,690
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1645
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:24,990
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1646
02:58:25,290 --> 02:58:28,390
an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1647
02:58:28,690 --> 02:58:31,690
And after that, it gets even better.

1648
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:36,890
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1649
02:58:37,390 --> 02:58:38,690
That is our road.

1650
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:43,390
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1651
02:58:43,690 --> 02:58:45,290
Recover my...

1652
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:50,290
- We should Leave now.
- No.

1653
02:58:50,590 --> 02:58:54,790
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1654
02:58:55,190 --> 02:58:58,590
It is not the eastern
shore that worries me.

1655
02:58:58,890 --> 02:59:02,690
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

1656
02:59:03,390 --> 02:59:07,390
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1657
02:59:09,590 --> 02:59:14,290
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1658
02:59:15,090 --> 02:59:16,690
Where's Frodo?

1659
02:59:42,390 --> 02:59:44,290
None of us should wander alone.

1660
02:59:45,590 --> 02:59:47,690
You, least of all.

1661
02:59:47,990 --> 02:59:50,290
So much depends on you.

1662
02:59:51,490 --> 02:59:53,390
Frodo?

1663
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:03,090
I know why you seek solitude.

1664
03:00:03,890 --> 03:00:07,190
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1665
03:00:08,090 --> 03:00:11,090
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1666
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:15,390
There are other ways, Frodo.

1667
03:00:15,690 --> 03:00:19,390
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1668
03:00:19,690 --> 03:00:23,290
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1669
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:26,690
Warning... against what?

1670
03:00:26,990 --> 03:00:28,990
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1671
03:00:29,290 --> 03:00:32,790
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1672
03:00:33,190 --> 03:00:36,790
don't you see that is madness?
There is no other way.

1673
03:00:38,790 --> 03:00:41,890
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1674
03:00:43,690 --> 03:00:45,590
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1675
03:00:46,890 --> 03:00:50,390
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1676
03:00:52,490 --> 03:00:55,590
What chance do you think you have?

1677
03:00:55,890 --> 03:01:00,390
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1678
03:01:00,790 --> 03:01:04,390
And you will beg for death before the end!

1679
03:01:06,690 --> 03:01:08,689
You fool!

1680
03:01:08,690 --> 03:01:12,790
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1681
03:01:13,090 --> 03:01:15,790
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1682
03:01:16,090 --> 03:01:17,290
- Give it to me!
- No!

1683
03:01:17,590 --> 03:01:19,390
- Give it to me!
- No.

1684
03:01:27,090 --> 03:01:28,990
I see your mind.

1685
03:01:29,390 --> 03:01:32,190
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1686
03:01:32,490 --> 03:01:34,290
You will betray us!

1687
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:37,690
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1688
03:01:38,190 --> 03:01:41,690
Curse you!
Curse you and all the half lings!

1689
03:01:48,890 --> 03:01:50,390
Frodo?

1690
03:01:54,690 --> 03:01:56,290
Frodo.

1691
03:02:00,290 --> 03:02:02,190
What have I done?

1692
03:02:02,490 --> 03:02:04,190
Please, Frodo.

1693
03:02:04,490 --> 03:02:06,990
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1694
03:02:37,390 --> 03:02:40,890
Ash Ghurûm (They will fall)

1695
03:02:55,690 --> 03:02:56,990
Frodo?

1696
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:01,290
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1697
03:03:01,690 --> 03:03:03,390
Stay away!

1698
03:03:03,790 --> 03:03:05,390
Frodo!

1699
03:03:07,690 --> 03:03:11,390
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1700
03:03:21,290 --> 03:03:23,590
Would you destroy it?

1701
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:30,590
Aragorn.

1702
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:36,290
Aragorn.

1703
03:03:38,290 --> 03:03:39,990
Elessar.

1704
03:03:47,690 --> 03:03:50,890
I would have gone with you to the end.

1705
03:03:51,690 --> 03:03:54,490
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1706
03:03:57,990 --> 03:03:59,090
I know.

1707
03:04:01,490 --> 03:04:06,790
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1708
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:12,390
Go, Frodo!

1709
03:04:15,490 --> 03:04:16,989
Run.

1710
03:04:16,990 --> 03:04:18,790
Run!

1711
03:04:43,390 --> 03:04:44,990
Mr. Frodo!

1712
03:04:54,490 --> 03:04:56,090
Find the half ling!

1713
03:04:57,790 --> 03:05:00,190
Find the half ling!

1714
03:05:03,890 --> 03:05:05,490
Elendil!

1715
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:13,490
Aragorn, go!

1716
03:05:35,190 --> 03:05:36,490
Frodo!

1717
03:05:37,090 --> 03:05:38,690
Hide here. Quick!

1718
03:05:39,390 --> 03:05:40,790
Come on!

1719
03:05:43,290 --> 03:05:45,290
What's he doing?

1720
03:05:49,490 --> 03:05:51,490
He's leaving.

1721
03:05:56,390 --> 03:05:59,190
- No!
- Pippin!

1722
03:06:04,190 --> 03:06:06,390
Run, Frodo. Go!

1723
03:06:07,090 --> 03:06:09,990
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1724
03:06:10,590 --> 03:06:12,090
- Over here!
- This way!

1725
03:06:23,090 --> 03:06:25,290
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1726
03:07:20,690 --> 03:07:23,590
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1727
03:08:06,890 --> 03:08:07,890
Run!

1728
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:41,090
No.

1729
03:11:45,190 --> 03:11:48,090
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1730
03:11:48,390 --> 03:11:50,390
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1731
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:53,790
I let Frodo go.

1732
03:11:54,490 --> 03:11:56,990
Then you did what I could not.

1733
03:11:58,090 --> 03:12:01,290
I tried to take the ring from him.

1734
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:05,990
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1735
03:12:06,390 --> 03:12:08,590
I did not see it.

1736
03:12:08,890 --> 03:12:11,990
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1737
03:12:12,590 --> 03:12:14,990
You fought bravely.

1738
03:12:15,390 --> 03:12:17,890
You have kept your honor.

1739
03:12:18,690 --> 03:12:20,390
Leave it.

1740
03:12:20,890 --> 03:12:22,890
It is over.

1741
03:12:24,190 --> 03:12:29,290
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

1742
03:12:29,890 --> 03:12:32,690
and my city to ruin.

1743
03:12:36,890 --> 03:12:39,589
I do not know what
strength is in my blood...

1744
03:12:39,590 --> 03:12:43,690
but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

1745
03:12:44,790 --> 03:12:47,190
nor our people fail.

1746
03:12:48,190 --> 03:12:49,590
Our people.

1747
03:12:53,490 --> 03:12:55,490
Our people.

1748
03:13:17,290 --> 03:13:20,190
I would have followed you, my brother.

1749
03:13:21,890 --> 03:13:23,790
My captain.

1750
03:13:26,590 --> 03:13:28,390
My king.

1751
03:13:48,090 --> 03:13:50,190
Be at peace...

1752
03:13:50,790 --> 03:13:52,590
son of Gondor.

1753
03:14:09,090 --> 03:14:12,290
They will look for his
coming from the white tower.

1754
03:14:12,990 --> 03:14:15,890
But he will not return.

1755
03:14:39,290 --> 03:14:41,190
Frodo!

1756
03:15:00,690 --> 03:15:03,890
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1757
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:07,990
I wish none of this had happened.

1758
03:15:11,190 --> 03:15:13,890
So do all who live to see such times...

1759
03:15:14,190 --> 03:15:17,490
but that is not for them to decide.

1760
03:15:17,890 --> 03:15:20,390
All you have to decide...

1761
03:15:20,690 --> 03:15:25,290
is what to do with the
time that is given to you.

1762
03:15:54,190 --> 03:15:56,190
Frodo, no!

1763
03:15:56,990 --> 03:15:58,190
Frodo!

1764
03:15:58,890 --> 03:16:01,490
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1765
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:07,090
Go back, Sam!

1766
03:16:07,690 --> 03:16:11,090
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1767
03:16:11,390 --> 03:16:14,090
And I'm coming with you!

1768
03:16:14,790 --> 03:16:17,090
You can't swim!

1769
03:16:20,890 --> 03:16:22,590
Sam!

1770
03:16:28,190 --> 03:16:29,590
Sam!

1771
03:17:10,490 --> 03:17:13,190
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1772
03:17:13,590 --> 03:17:17,690
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1773
03:17:18,990 --> 03:17:21,490
And I don't mean to.

1774
03:17:21,890 --> 03:17:23,990
I don't mean to.

1775
03:17:25,790 --> 03:17:27,490
Oh Sam.

1776
03:17:42,490 --> 03:17:44,090
Come on.

1777
03:18:12,490 --> 03:18:16,890
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

1778
03:18:31,990 --> 03:18:36,890
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1779
03:18:40,390 --> 03:18:45,090
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1780
03:18:57,090 --> 03:19:00,190
Not if we hold true to each other.

1781
03:19:01,690 --> 03:19:05,990
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1782
03:19:07,090 --> 03:19:12,190
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1783
03:19:13,690 --> 03:19:15,590
We travel light.

1784
03:19:15,890 --> 03:19:17,790
Let us hunt some orc.

1785
03:19:20,790 --> 03:19:22,790
Yes!

1786
03:19:41,790 --> 03:19:43,190
Mordor.

1787
03:19:43,890 --> 03:19:47,090
I hope the others find a safer road.

1788
03:19:48,190 --> 03:19:50,690
Strider will look after them.

1789
03:19:51,790 --> 03:19:54,990
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1790
03:19:55,490 --> 03:19:57,789
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1791
03:19:57,790 --> 03:19:59,490
We may.

1792
03:20:01,690 --> 03:20:02,790
Sam...

1793
03:20:06,390 --> 03:20:08,890
I'm glad you are with me.
