2
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,603
My dear Frodo:

3
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,605
You asked me once...

4
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,487
...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.

5
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,400
And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,920
...I may not have told you all of it.

7
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,008
I am old now, Frodo.

8
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,284
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.

9
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,087
I think it is time for you to know...

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,924
...what really happened.

11
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,887
It began long ago...

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,162
...in a land far away to the east...

13
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,325
...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.

14
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,885
There was the city of Dale.

15
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,485
Its markets known far and wide.

16
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,961
Full of the bounties of vine and vale.

17
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,641
Peaceful and prosperous.

18
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,808
For this city lay before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:

19
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,521
Erebor.

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,050
Stronghold of Thror,
King Under the Mountain.

21
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,009
Mightiest of the Dwarf Lords.

22
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,811
Thror ruled with utter surety...

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,439
...never doubting his house would endure...

24
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,650
...for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,688
...and grandson.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,122
Ah, Frodo. Erebor.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,567
Built deep within the mountain itself...

28
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,406
...the beauty of this fortress city was legend.

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,006
Its wealth lay in the earth...

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,966
...in precious gems hewn from rock...

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,407
...and in great seams of gold...

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,723
...running like rivers through stone.

33
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,766
The skill of the Dwarves was unequaled...

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,082
...fashioning objects of great beauty...

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,528
...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,079
Ever they delved deeper,
down into the dark.

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,365
And that is where they found it.

38
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,722
The Heart of the Mountain.

39
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,641
The Arkenstone.

40
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,324
Thror named it "The King's Jewel."

41
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,326
He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule was divine.

42
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,086
All would pay homage to him.

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,688
Even the great Elven King, Thranduil.

44
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,889
But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last.

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,088
Slowly the days turned sour...

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,846
...and the watchful nights closed in.

47
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,682
Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce.

48
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,091
A sickness had begun to grow within him.

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,605
It was a sickness of the mind.

50
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,204
And where sickness thrives...

51
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,730
...bad things will follow.

52
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,362
The first they heard
was a noise like a hurricane...

53
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,682
...coming down from the North.

54
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:13,084
The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked in the hot, dry wind.

55
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,084
Balin, sound the alarm.

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,369
Call out the guard. Do it now!

57
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,850
What is it?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,569
Dragon.

59
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,124
Dragon!

60
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,687
He was a firedrake from the North.

61
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,281
Smaug had come.

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,889
Such wanton death was dealt that day.

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,447
For this city of Men was nothing to Smaug.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,766
His eye was set on another prize.

65
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,161
For dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire.

66
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,487
Aah!

67
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,367
No!

68
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,084
Come on.

69
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,971
Erebor was lost.

70
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,490
For a dragon will guard his plunder...

71
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,007
...as long as he lives.

72
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,889
Run for your lives!

73
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,725
Ah! Help us!

74
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,201
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin
against the wrath of the dragon.

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,526
No help came from the Elves that day...

76
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,245
...nor any day since.

77
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,000
Robbed of their homeland...

78
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,528
...the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...

79
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,007
...a once mighty people brought low.

80
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,802
The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...

81
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,281
...laboring in the villages of Men.

82
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,005
But always he remembered...

83
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,639
...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...

84
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,043
...the trees like torches blazing bright.

85
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,562
For he had seen dragon fire in the sky...

86
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
...and a city turned to ash.

87
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,288
And he never forgave...

88
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,562
...and he never forgot.

89
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,484
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.

90
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,649
For, quite by chance,
and the will of a Wizard...

91
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,567
...fate decided I would become
part of this tale.

92
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,809
It began...

93
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,201
Well, it began as you might expect.

94
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,042
In a hole in the ground...

95
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,765
...there lived a Hobbit.

96
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,163
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.

97
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,481
This was a Hobbit hole.

98
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,965
And that means good food, a warm hearth...

99
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,130
...and all the comforts of home.

100
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,442
Thank you.

101
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,764
What's this?

102
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,844
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.

103
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,408
It's not ready yet.

104
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,125
Not ready for what?

105
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,326
Reading.

106
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,520
What on earth are these?

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,570
Replies to the party invitations.

108
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,489
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

109
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,004
They all say they're coming.

110
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.

111
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,328
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.

112
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,245
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels...

113
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,042
-...overflowing with gold.
- It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

114
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,802
And it still smells of Troll.

115
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,890
What on earth are you doing?

116
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,048
Taking precautions.

117
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,051
You know, I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

118
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,125
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

119
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,006
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

120
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,399
Dreadful woman.

121
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,042
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...

122
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,530
When I'm... When I'm...

123
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,961
When you're what?

124
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,008
It's nothing. Nothing.

125
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,763
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

126
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,571
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

127
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,286
Odd? Oh. Hm.

128
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,811
Unsociable.

129
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,884
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

130
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,519
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

131
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,725
- Do you think he'll come?
- Who?

132
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,246
Gandalf.

133
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,802
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers.

134
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,128
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

135
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,408
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

136
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,721
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

137
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,208
Well, go on, then. You don't want to be late.

138
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,566
He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.

139
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,961
Not that I ever was.

140
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,090
In those days, I was always on time.

141
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,690
I was entirely respectable.

142
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,530
And nothing unexpected...

143
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,162
...ever happened.


145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,321
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?

146
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,484
Do you wish me a good morning...

147
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,883
...or do you mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not?

148
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,121
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good
on this particular morning?

149
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,770
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

150
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,207
All of them at once, I suppose.

151
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,889
Hmm.

152
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,040
Can I help you?

153
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,283
That remains to be seen.

154
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,409
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

155
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,244
An adventure?

156
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,649
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

157
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,884
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

158
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,006
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

159
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,770
Mm. Huh.

160
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,923
Hmm.

161
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,126
Oh. Ah.

162
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,441
Good morning.

163
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,524
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

164
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,686
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

165
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,370
Beg your pardon?

166
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,206
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

167
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm sorry, do I know you?

168
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,802
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

169
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,610
I'm Gandalf.

170
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,966
And Gandalf means...

171
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,325
...me.

172
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,682
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

173
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,888
...who made such excellent fireworks?

174
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,885
Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

175
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,203
No idea you were still in business.

176
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,809
And where else should I be?

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,730
Where else...? Ahem.

178
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,446
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...

179
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,610
...even if it's only my fireworks.

180
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,759
Yes. Well, that's decided.

181
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,729
It'll be very good for you...

182
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,970
...and most amusing for me.

183
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,803
I shall inform the others.

184
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,248
Inform the who? What? No. No. No... Wait.

185
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,923
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not...

186
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,879
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.

187
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,683
Good morning.

188
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,763
Dwalin, at your service.

189
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,726
Hm. Uh...

190
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,925
Bilbo Baggins, at yours...

191
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,131
Do we know each other?

192
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,445
No.

193
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,410
Which way, laddie? Is it down here?

194
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,967
Is what down where?

195
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,166
Supper.

196
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,565
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

197
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,883
He... He said? Who said?

198
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,529
Mmm.

199
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,365
Mmm.

200
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,529
Very good, this. Any more?

201
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,726
What? Oh, yes, yes. Ah.

202
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,089
Help yourself.

203
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,204
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.

204
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,688
That'll be the door.

205
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,843
Balin, at your service.

206
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,609
- Good evening.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

207
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,566
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

208
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,925
Am I late?

209
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,324
Late for what?

210
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,525
Oh! Ha, ha!

211
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,449
Evening, brother.

212
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,922
By my beard...

213
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,084
...you're shorter and wider than last we met.

214
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,890
Wider, not shorter.

215
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,006
Sharp enough for both of us.

216
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,849
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

217
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,130
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.

218
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,366
Have you eaten?

219
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,480
It's not that I don't like visitors.
I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.

220
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,247
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

221
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,730
- What is this?
- I don't know.

222
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,769
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.

223
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,647
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest.

224
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,683
I don't mean to be blunt,
but I had to speak my mind.

225
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,847
- I'm sorry.
- You think...?

226
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,090
Apology accepted.

227
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,606
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother, don't stint.

228
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,362
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

229
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,088
- Fili.
- And Kili.

230
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,088
- At your service.
- At your service.

231
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,601
- You must be Mr. Boggins.
- Nope! You can't come in.

232
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,161
- You've come to the wrong house.
- What?

233
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,560
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

234
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,560
- Ca... No, nothing's been canceled.
- That's a relief.

235
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,601
Careful with these.
I just had them sharpened.

236
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,608
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.

237
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,009
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

238
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,049
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

239
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,851
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

240
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,320
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

241
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,124
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

242
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,009
"Everyone"? How many more are there?

243
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,241
- Where do you want this?
- Oh, no.

244
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,086
- It's really heavy.
- No. No. There's nobody home!

245
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,010
Go away and bother somebody else.

246
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,409
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

247
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,530
If this is some clot-head's idea of a joke, Ha, ha...

248
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,207
...I can only say it is in very poor taste.

249
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,568
Get off, you big lump!

250
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,486
Gandalf.

251
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,970
Those are my pri...! Excuse me, not my wine.
Put that back. Put that back.

252
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,201
Not the jam, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

253
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,131
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?

254
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,289
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.

255
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,761
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, and so is that. Take it back, please.

256
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,766
- I cannot hear what you're saying.
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

257
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,684
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.

258
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,922
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

259
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,730
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

260
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,767
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

261
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,288
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

262
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,003
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

263
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,241
Oin, Gloin.

264
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,443
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

265
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:45,250
- ...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

266
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,003
No, thank you.

267
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,685
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

268
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,161
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

269
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,769
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

270
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,681
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.

271
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,928
It's got a fruity bouquet.

272
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,366
Oh. Cheers.

273
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,365
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

274
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,126
Hmm.

275
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,046
No chance. Not from that distance.

276
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,405
Wanna bet?

277
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,049
Bombur, catch!

278
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,364
I'll help you with that.

279
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,448
Oh, you great galumphing git!

280
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,682
- Who wants an ale? There you go.
- Over here, brother.

281
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,083
I said have another drink. Here you go.

282
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,525
Ale on the count of three!

283
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,131
One, two...

284
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,326
Up!

285
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,049
I knew you had it in you!

286
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,931
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth.

287
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,126
But it's full of holes.

288
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,481
It's supposed to look like that. It's crochet.

289
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,564
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

290
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,688
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

291
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,730
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

292
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,723
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

293
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,490
What are they doing here?

294
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,405
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.

295
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,528
I don't want to get used to them.

296
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,883
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

297
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,451
They've pillaged the pantry.

298
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,040
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.

299
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,000
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

300
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,484
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

301
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,846
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

302
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,682
Take that back. Excuse me.

303
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,762
That's my mother's West Farthing pottery.

304
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,922
It's over 100 years old!

305
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,885
And can you not do that? You'll blunt them.

306
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,041
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

307
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,484
He says we'll blunt the knives.

308
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,563
♪ Blunt the knives, bend the forks.

309
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,240
♪ Smash the bottles and burn the corks.

310
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,643
♪ Chip the glasses and crack the plates.

311
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,643
♪ That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.

312
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,325
♪ Cut the cloth, tread on the fat.

313
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,409
♪ Leave the bones on the bedroom mat.

314
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,041
♪ Pour the milk on the pantry floor.

315
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,281
♪ Splash the wine on every door.

316
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,089
♪ Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl.

317
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,930
♪ Pound them up with a thumping pole.

318
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,289
♪ When you're finished, if they are whole.

319
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,599
Heh...Heh...Hey!

320
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,567
♪ Send them down the hall to roll.

321
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,161
♪ That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.

322
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,127
Bilbo.

323
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,848
He is here.

324
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,882
Gandalf.

325
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,566
I thought you said this place
would be easy to find.

326
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,721
I lost my way, twice.

327
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,326
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

328
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,369
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

329
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,922
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

330
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,644
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:

331
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,208
Thorin Oakenshield.

332
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,930
So...

333
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,328
...this is the Hobbit.

334
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,567
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?

335
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,210
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?

336
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,404
What's your weapon of choice?

337
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,041
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...

338
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,807
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.

339
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,809
Thought as much.

340
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,769
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

341
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,727
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?

342
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,969
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!

343
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,726
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

344
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,843
Is Dain with us?

345
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,690
They will not come.

346
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,284
They say this quest is ours and ours alone.

347
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,846
You're going on a quest?

348
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,884
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.

349
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,402
Far to the east...

350
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,525
...over ranges and rivers...

351
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,122
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

352
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,646
...lies a single, solitary peak.

353
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,969
"The Lonely Mountain."

354
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,643
Aye, Oin has read the portents...

355
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,247
...and the portents say it is time.

356
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,446
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain, as it was foretold.

357
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,570
"When the birds of yore return to Erebor...

358
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,201
...the reign of the beast will end."

359
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,607
Uh, what beast?

360
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,080
That would be a reference
to Smaug the Terrible...

361
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,086
...chiefest and greatest calamity of our age.

362
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,568
Airborne fire-breather.

363
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,529
Teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks.

364
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,762
- Extremely fond of precious metals.
- Yes, I know what a dragon is.

365
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,490
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

366
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,569
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!

367
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,250
- Good lad, Ori!
- Sit down.

368
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,369
The task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us...

369
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,721
...but we numberjust 13.

370
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,802
And not 13 of the best...

371
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,726
...nor brightest.

372
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,127
Here, who are you calling dim?

373
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,845
Sorry, what did he say?

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,923
We may be few in number...

375
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,526
...but we're fighters, all of us,
to the last Dwarf.

376
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,125
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.

377
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,089
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.

378
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,241
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

379
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,402
- How many, then?
- What?

380
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,926
Well, how many dragons have you killed?

381
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,326
Go on. Give us a number.

382
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,007
Excuse me. Please.

383
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,365
If we have read these signs...

384
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,211
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

385
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,086
Rumors have begun to spread.

386
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,204
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.

387
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,126
Eyes look east to the mountain, assessing...

388
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,281
...wondering, weighing the risk.

389
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,490
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

390
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,166
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?

391
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,690
Or do we seize this chance
to take back Erebor?

392
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,804
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

393
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,284
There is no way into the mountain.

394
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,761
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

395
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,211
How came you by this?

396
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,651
It was given to me by your father.

397
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,087
By Thrain. For safekeeping.

398
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,969
It is yours now.

399
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,770
If there is a key...

400
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,403
...there must be a door.

401
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,523
These runes speak of a hidden
passage to the Lower Halls.

402
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,882
There's another way in.

403
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,885
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

404
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,044
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...

405
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,201
...and I do not have the skill to find it.

406
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,769
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.

407
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,922
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...

408
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,208
...and no small amount of courage.

409
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,161
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

410
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,845
That's why we need a burglar.

411
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,646
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

412
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:25,126
And are you?

413
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,045
Am I what?

414
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,964
He said he's an expert. Hey!

415
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,326
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

416
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,204
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.

417
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,448
He's hardly burglar material.

418
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,646
Nope.

419
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,088
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk
who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

420
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,088
He's just fine.

421
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,925
Enough!

422
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,080
If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar,
then a burglar he is.

423
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,884
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.

424
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,282
In fact, they can pass unseen by most,
if they choose.

425
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,080
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...

426
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,323
...the scent of a Hobbit
is all but unknown to him...

427
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,689
...which gives us a distinct advantage.

428
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,242
You asked me to find the 14th member of
this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

429
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,529
There's a lot more to him
than appearances suggest.

430
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,523
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

431
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,444
Including himself.

432
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,645
You must trust me on this.

433
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,050
Very well.

434
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,003
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

435
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,560
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

436
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,840
It's just the usual.

437
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,968
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...

438
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,769
...time required, remuneration...

439
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,763
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

440
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,125
Funeral arrangements?

441
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,490
I cannot guarantee his safety.

442
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,405
Understood.

443
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,411
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

444
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,605
Agreed.

445
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,367
"Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not
exceeding one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

446
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,409
Hmm. Seems fair.

447
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,280
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...

448
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,730
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

449
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,848
...evisceration..."

450
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,447
Incineration?

451
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,609
Oh, Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

452
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,763
- You all right, laddie?
- Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

453
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,851
Feel a bit faint.

454
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,241
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.

455
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,845
I-I need air.

456
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,605
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.

457
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,761
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

458
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,325
Hmm.

459
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,207
Nope.

460
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,249
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

461
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,165
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

462
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:20,688
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

463
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,130
Tell me, when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

464
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,963
...become so important to you?

465
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,361
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

466
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,682
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

467
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,480
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

468
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,086
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...

469
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,642
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.

470
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,119
The world is not in your books and maps.

471
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,282
It's out there.

472
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,240
I can't just go running off into the blue.

473
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,608
I am a Baggins...hm... of Bag-end.

474
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,887
You are also a Took.

475
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,208
Did you know that your
great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...

476
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,010
...was so large, he could ride a real horse?

477
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,367
- Yes.
- Yes, well, he could.

478
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,409
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

479
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,405
He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

480
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,724
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.

481
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,643
And thus, the battle was won.

482
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,443
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.

483
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,847
I do believe you made that up.

484
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,721
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

485
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,210
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own
when you come back.

486
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,166
Can you promise that I will come back?

487
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,690
No.

488
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,887
And if you do...

489
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,007
...you will not be the same.

490
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,364
That's what I thought.

491
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,568
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

492
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,360
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

493
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,400
It appears we have lost our burglar.

494
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,442
Probably for the best.

495
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,007
The odds were always against us.

496
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,164
After all, what are we?

497
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,563
Merchants, miners...

498
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,327
...tinkers, toy-makers.

499
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,483
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

500
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,764
There are a few warriors amongst us.

501
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,329
Old warriors.

502
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,847
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...

503
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:50,202
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

504
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,284
For when I called upon them,
they answered.

505
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,606
Loyalty, honor...

506
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,882
...a willing heart.

507
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,090
I can ask no more than that.

508
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,806
You don't have to do this.

509
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,849
You have a choice.

510
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,003
You've done honorably by our people.

511
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,639
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

512
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,969
A life of peace and plenty.

513
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,760
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.

514
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,280
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

515
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,724
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves
of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

516
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,039
There is no choice, Balin.

517
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,090
Not for me.

518
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,128
Then we are with you, laddie.

519
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,360
We will see it done.

520
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,005
♪ Far over the misty mountains cold.

521
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,530
♪ To dungeons deep

00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,889
Hello?

531
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,206
Yes.

532
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,199
Yes.

533
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,159
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

534
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,005
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

535
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,284
I'm going on an adventure!

536
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,246
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.

537
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,003
That's true enough.

538
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,083
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Half ling?

539
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,684
Whose idea was it anyway?

540
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,887
Wait!

541
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,806
Wait!

542
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,530
Whoa, whoa.

543
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,481
Whoa, whoa.

544
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,603
I signed it.

545
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,606
Here.

546
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Everything appears to be in order.

547
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,001
Welcome, Master Baggins...

548
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,240
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

549
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,760
Give him a pony.

550
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,804
No, no, that won't be necessary.

551
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,166
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

552
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,925
I've done my fair share of walking holidays,
you know?

553
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,128
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

554
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,882
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

555
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,001
- One more.
- Thanks, lad.

556
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,730
What's that about?

557
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,447
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.

558
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,443
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

559
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,409
And what did you think?

560
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,170
Well...

561
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,807
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.

562
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,605
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

563
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,844
No, wait, wait, stop.

564
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,561
Stop! We have to turn around.

565
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,847
What on earth is the matter?

566
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,246
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.

567
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,967
Use this.

568
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,844
Move on.

569
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,844
You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs...

570
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,320
...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...

571
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:15,887
...before we reach our journey's end.

572
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,851
You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.

573
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,809
But home is now behind you.

574
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,168
The world is ahead.

575
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,242
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

576
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,643
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

577
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,807
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

578
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,601
What was that?

579
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,007
Orcs.

580
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:30,766
Orcs?

581
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,289
Throat-cutters.
There'll be dozens of them out there.

582
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,648
The lone-lands are crawling with them.

583
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,690
They strike in the wee small hours
when everyone's asleep.

584
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,003
Quick and quiet, no screams.
Just lots of blood.

585
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:50,289
You think that's funny?

586
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,567
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

587
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,771
We didn't mean anything by it.

588
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,724
No, you didn't.

589
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,367
You know nothing of the world.

590
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,240
Don't mind him, laddie.

591
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,121
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

592
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,009
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

593
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:25,007
...King Thror tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

594
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,282
But our enemy had got there first.

595
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,565
Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs

596
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,447
...led by the most vile of all their race:

597
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,048
Azog the Defiler.

598
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,050
The giant Gundabad Orc...

599
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:05,481
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

600
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,443
He began...

601
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,409
...by beheading the king.

602
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,565
No!

603
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,726
Thrain, Thorin's father,
was driven mad by grief.

604
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,530
He went missing. Taken prisoner or killed...

605
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:40,202
...we did not know.

606
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,565
We were leaderless.

607
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,847
Defeat and death...

608
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,842
...were upon us.

609
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,646
That is when I saw him.

610
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,608
A young Dwarf prince...

611
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,246
...facing down the pale Orc.

612
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,081
He stood alone against this terrible foe.

613
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,449
His armor rent...

614
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,047
...wielding nothing but an oaken branch
as a shield.

615
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,768
Azog the Defiler learned that day...

616
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,768
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

617
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,250
Our forces rallied...

618
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,920
...and drove the Orcs back.

619
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,090
And our enemy...

620
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,882
...had been defeated.

621
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,726
But there was no feast...

622
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,164
...nor song that night...

623
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,121
...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.

624
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,568
We few had survived.

625
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:55,643
And I thought to myself then...

626
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,688
...there is one who I could follow.

627
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,047
There is one...

628
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,682
...I could call king.

629
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:30,005
And the pale Orc?

630
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,885
What happened to him?

631
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,601
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

632
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:41,646
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

633
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,360
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something
about this deluge?

634
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

635
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,280
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.

636
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,965
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
you should find yourself another Wizard.

637
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:45,880
- Are there any?
- What?

638
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:48,690
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.

639
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,402
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.

640
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:56,005
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

641
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,726
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.

642
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,166
And who is the fifth?

643
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,291
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

644
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,206
Is he a great Wizard? Or is he more like you?

645
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,001
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.

646
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,764
He's a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others.

647
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,003
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...

648
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,731
...to the east. And a good thing too.

649
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,920
For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.

650
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,603
Not good. Not good at all.

651
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:51,326
Eww.

652
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,081
Oh, no. Sebastian.

653
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,847
Good gracious.

654
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:35,766
Come on.

655
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,088
Move back! Give him some air,
for goodness sake.

656
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,643
There. There.

657
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,644
I don't understand why it's not working.

658
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,246
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

659
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,567
Witchcraft.

660
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,724
Oh, but it is.

661
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:14,329
A dark and powerful magic.

662
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,728
Where on this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?

663
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,648
The old fortress?

664
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,360
Show me.

665
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,768
We'll camp here for the night.

666
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:36,603
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

667
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,889
A farmer and his family used to live here.

668
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,849
Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
Aye.

669
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,047
Right you are.

670
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,840
I think it would be wiser to move on.

671
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,730
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

672
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,889
I have told you already...

673
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:56,922
...I will not go near that place.

674
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,407
Why not? The Elves could help us.

675
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,641
We could get food, rest, advice.

676
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,961
I do not need their advice.

677
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:08,170
We have a map that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

678
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,684
Help?

679
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,842
A dragon attacks Erebor.

680
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,240
What help came from the Elves?

681
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,242
Orcs plunder Moria...

682
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,846
...desecrate our sacred halls.

683
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,889
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

684
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,929
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.

685
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,411
Who betrayed my father.

686
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,369
You are neither of them.

687
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,726
I did not give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.

688
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,927
I did not know that they were yours to keep.

689
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:47,891
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

690
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:51,442
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.

691
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,284
- And who's that?
- Myself, Mr. Baggins.

692
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,239
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

693
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:01,128
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

694
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,927
Is he coming back?

695
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,686
He's been a long time.

696
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,126
- Who?
- Gandalf.

697
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,481
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

698
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,688
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

699
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,804
Stop it. You've had plenty.

700
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,601
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.

701
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,807
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

702
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,240
Hilarious.

703
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,246
What's the matter?

704
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,849
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

705
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,889
We had 16.

706
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:48,849
Now there's 14.

707
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,521
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

708
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,489
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

709
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,291
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

710
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,364
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

711
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,762
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.

712
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,324
Well, uh...

713
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,050
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

714
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,728
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.

715
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:18,567
Hey.

716
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,730
There's a light.

717
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,764
Over here.

718
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:26,286
Stay down.

719
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,170
What is it?

720
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,771
Trolls.

721
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:54,126
Oh.

722
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,722
He's got Myrtle and Minty.

723
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,570
I think they're gonna eat them.
We have to do something.

724
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:09,528
Yes, you should.

725
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,804
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid,
and you're so small, they'll never see you.

726
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,927
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

727
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,721
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.

728
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,849
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown... Once like a...

729
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,967
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?

730
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,409
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

731
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,086
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.

732
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:35,161
Quit your griping.

733
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,563
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

734
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,085
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.
Not enough fat on them.

735
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,606
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.

736
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,128
All skin and bone, he was.
I'm still picking bits of him out of me teeth.

737
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,648
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

738
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,722
Might improve the flavor.

739
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,485
Ah. There's more where that came from.

740
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,925
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!

741
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,762
Sit down!

742
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,130
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

743
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,045
I don't like the stinky parts.

744
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,123
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

745
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,327
I'm starving!

746
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,608
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

747
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,809
Shut your cakehole.
You'll eat what I give you.

748
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:40,400
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

749
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,130
Everything tastes like chicken.

750
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,525
Except the chicken.

751
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:45,010
What tastes like fish!

752
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,487
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.

753
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,606
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.
Lovely stew, Bert."

754
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,731
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

755
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:02,010
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

756
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,043
Here, that's my grog.

757
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:10,690
Sorry. Ow!

758
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,809
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

759
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,409
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

760
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,407
Good, isn't it?

761
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,846
That's why I'm the cook.

762
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:38,844
Oh, me guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

763
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,731
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!

764
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:46,286
Blimey!

765
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:49,929
Beﬂ! Beﬂ!
Look what's come out of me hooter.

766
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,208
It's got arms and legs and everything.

767
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,005
What is it?

768
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,844
I don't know.
But I don't like the way it wriggles around.

769
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,048
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

770
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:05,923
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

771
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,208
A burglar Hobbit?

772
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,963
Can we cook him?

773
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,686
We can try.

774
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,561
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

775
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:20,530
Not when he's skinned and boned.

776
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:23,684
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits
around these parts.

777
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,929
Might be enough for a pie.

778
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,161
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.

779
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,688
Right. Come here, you little...

780
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,001
Gotcha.

781
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:38,001
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?

782
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,764
No.

783
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,364
He's lying.

784
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,844
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

785
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,731
Make him squeal!

786
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:53,246
Drop him!

787
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,811
You what?

788
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,090
I said...

789
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,407
...drop him.

790
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,041
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!

791
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,809
Aww!

792
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,561
Come on! Get up!

793
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,170
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

794
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,762
Lay down your arms...

795
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,248
...or we'll rip his off.

796
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,882
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

797
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,690
Don't bother cooking them.

798
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:47,083
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

799
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:51,483
They should be sauteed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.

800
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,210
Is this really necessary?

801
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,168
That does sound quite nice.

802
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,721
- Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.

803
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,362
Never mind the seasoning.

804
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,329
We ain't got all night.

805
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,802
Dawn ain't far away.
Let's get a move on.

806
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,400
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

807
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,451
Wait!

808
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:15,682
You are making a terrible mistake.

809
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,047
You can't reason with them. They're half-wits!

810
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:20,282
Half-wits? What does that make us?

811
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,730
I meant with the seasoning.

812
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:26,690
What about the seasoning?

813
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,079
Well, have you smelt them?

814
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,967
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

815
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:35,282
- Traitor!
- What do you know about cooking Dwarf?

816
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,847
Shut up.

817
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,840
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

818
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,684
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

819
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,003
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...

820
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,208
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

821
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,489
...to skin them first.

822
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:56,563
What? Skin us?

823
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,286
Tom, get me filleting knife.

824
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,123
I'll skin you, you little...!

825
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,168
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

826
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,686
What a load of rubbish.

827
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,764
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

828
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,320
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.

829
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,240
He's right.

830
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,005
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

831
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:21,927
Nice and crunchy.

832
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,806
Oh, not that one. He's infected.

833
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,724
- Huh?
- You what?

834
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,043
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

835
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:33,168
- Eww!
- Aah!

836
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,722
In fact, they all have.
They're infested with parasites.

837
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,849
It's a terrible business.
I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.

838
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,889
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?

839
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,849
We don't have parasites. You have parasites!

840
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,523
What are you talking about, laddie?

841
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,929
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

842
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:55,686
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

843
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,210
- We're riddled.
- Yes, I'm riddled.

844
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,646
Yes, we are, badly.

845
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,690
What would you have us do, then?

846
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,409
Let them all go?

847
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,128
- Well...
- You think I don't know what you're up to?

848
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,605
This little ferret is taking us for fools.

849
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,605
- Ferret?
- Fools?

850
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,769
The dawn will take you all.

851
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:21,809
- Who's that?
- No idea.

852
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,085
Can we eat him too?

853
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:51,766
Get your foot out of my back.

854
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,045
Ah.

855
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,442
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

856
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:05,289
To look ahead.

857
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:08,523
- What brought you back?
- Looking behind.

858
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:10,726
Nasty business.

859
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,369
Still, they're all in one piece.

860
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,050
No thanks to your burglar.

861
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:17,601
He had the nous to play for time.

862
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,400
None of the rest of you thought of that.

863
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,404
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.

864
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,369
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?

865
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,601
Ooh. Not for an age.

866
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,721
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

867
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,247
They could not have moved in daylight.

868
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,167
There must be a cave nearby.

869
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,087
Oh, what's that stench?

870
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,443
It's a Troll-hoard.

871
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,405
Be careful what you touch.

872
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,929
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.

873
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,970
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

874
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:28,804
- Nori.
- Yeah?

875
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,324
Get a shovel.

876
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,648
These swords were not made by any Troll.

877
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,929
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

878
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,681
These were forged in Gondolin...

879
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,322
...by the High Elves of the First Age.

880
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,046
You could not wish for a finer blade.

881
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,842
- Set it down.
- That's good.

882
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,484
All right, come on. Quick.

883
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,484
We're making a long-term deposit.

884
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:44,689
Let's get out of this foul place.

885
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:46,844
Come on, let's go.

886
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,967
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

887
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:10,203
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?

888
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,686
Here.

889
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,411
This is about your size.

890
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:22,444
I can't take this.

891
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,841
The blade is of Elvish make...

892
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,961
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

893
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:33,440
I have never used a sword in my life.

894
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,641
And I hope you never have to.

895
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,210
But if you do, remember this:

896
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:44,930
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

897
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,806
...but when to spare one.

898
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:54,685
Something's coming!

899
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,967
- Gandalf.
- Stay together!

900
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,202
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!

901
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,368
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

902
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,929
Radagast.

903
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,403
It's Radagast the Brown.

904
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,243
Well...

905
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:34,163
What on earth are you doing here?

906
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:35,845
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

907
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,411
Something's wrong.

908
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,688
Something's terribly wrong.

909
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,079
Yes?

910
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,760
Oh.

911
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:48,403
Just give me a minute.

912
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,604
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

913
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,202
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.

914
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,969
Oh. It's not a thought at all.

915
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:01,202
It's a silly old...

916
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,962
..stick insect.

917
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,605
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

918
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:14,287
A darkness has fallen over it.

919
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:16,488
Nothing grows anymore.

920
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,887
At least, nothing good.

921
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:21,730
The air is foul with decay.

922
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,689
But worse are the webs.

923
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,046
Webs? What do you mean?

924
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:28,328
Spiders, Gandalf.

925
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:29,925
Giant ones.

926
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:34,404
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.

927
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,847
I followed their trail.

928
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,844
They came from Dol Guldur.

929
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,404
Huh?

930
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,761
Dol Guldur?

931
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,128
But the old fortress is abandoned.

932
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,764
No, Gandalf.

933
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,082
'Tis not.

934
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,163
A dark power dwells in there...

935
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:09,041
...such as I have never felt before.

936
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,889
It is the shadow of an ancient horror.

937
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,282
One that can summon the spirits...

938
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:27,087
...of the dead.

939
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:44,484
I saw him, Gandalf.

940
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,291
From out of the darkness...

941
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,842
...a Necromancer has come

942
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,926
Radagast.

943
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:02,088
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

944
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,644
Wait for me!

945
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:21,565
Sorry.

946
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,166
Try a little Old Toby.

947
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,845
It'll help settle your nerves.

948
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:30,487
And out.

949
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:42,768
Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?

950
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:57,850
That is not...

951
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,085
...from the world of the living.

952
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:10,805
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?

953
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,923
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

954
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:20,845
Kili! Get your bow!

955
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:29,609
Warg scouts.

956
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,922
- Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.
- Orc pack?

957
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:35,923
Who did you tell about your quest
beyond your kin?

958
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:37,922
- No one.
- Who did you tell?

959
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:39,444
No one, I swear.

960
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,923
What in Durin's name is going on?

961
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:43,319
You are being hunted.

962
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:47,363
- We have to get out of here.
- We can't. We have no ponies.

963
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,449
They bolted.

964
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,011
I'll draw them off.

965
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:55,083
These are Gundabad Wargs.
They will outrun you.

966
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:57,162
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

967
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:01,563
I'd like to see them try.

968
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,367
Come on! Come on!

969
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,881
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

970
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,844
Come on.

971
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,841
Stay together.

972
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,046
Move!

973
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,725
Ori, no! Get back.

974
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,284
All of you, come on. Quick!

975
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,443
Where are you leading us?

976
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,086
Move!

977
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,485
Run!

978
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:49,010
There they are!

979
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,921
This way! Quickly!

980
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:05,725
There's more coming!

981
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,962
Kili! Shoot them!

982
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,363
We're surrounded!

983
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,130
Where's Gandalf?

984
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:23,442
He's abandoned us.

985
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,841
Hold your ground!

986
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:42,445
This way, you fools!

987
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:44,560
Come on, move!

988
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,809
Quickly! All of you!

989
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,411
Come on!

990
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,284
Go, go, go!

991
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,809
Eight, nine, 10.

992
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,207
Kili! Run!

993
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:49,645
Elves.

994
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,484
I cannot see where the pathway leads.
Do we follow it or no?

995
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,643
Follow it, of course.

996
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,962
I think that would be wise.

997
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:06,288
Come on now, brother.

998
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,002
The Valley of lmladris.

999
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,451
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

1000
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,728
Rivendell.

1001
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:18,966
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.

1002
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:22,805
This was your plan all along.

1003
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:25,368
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1004
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,887
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

1005
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:32,970
The only ill will to be found in this valley
is that which you bring yourself.

1006
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:37,483
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?

1007
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,051
They will try to stop us.

1008
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:44,251
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

1009
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,367
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

1010
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,930
And respect.

1011
01:23:53,079 --> 01:23:55,560
And no small degree of charm.

1012
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,805
Which is why you will leave the talking
to me.

1013
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,003
Mithrandir.

1014
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,331
Ah. Lindir.

1015
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,045
Stay sharp.

1016
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,403
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1017
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,523
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1018
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:12,764
Not here?

1019
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,766
Where is he?

1020
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,210
Close ranks!

1021
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:58,601
- Gandalf.
- Lord Elrond.

1022
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:19,489
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

1023
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,645
Something or someone
has drawn them near.

1024
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,087
That may have been us.

1025
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:34,481
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1026
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,086
I do not believe we have met.

1027
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,609
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1028
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,286
I knew Thror
when he ruled Under the Mountain.

1029
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,761
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1030
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,207
What is he saying?

1031
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:02,845
Does he offer us insult?

1032
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,685
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

1033
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:16,966
Well, in that case, lead on.

1034
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,006
Hey. Come on.

1035
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,123
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1036
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:23,884
I don't like green food.

1037
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:26,087
Where's the meat?

1038
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,210
Have they got any chips?

1039
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:32,686
Kind of you to invite us.

1040
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,409
Not really dressed for dinner.

1041
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,840
Well, you never are.

1042
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,645
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

1043
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,449
A famous blade...

1044
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:08,481
...forged by the High Elves of the West,
my kin.

1045
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,563
May it serve you well.

1046
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,161
And this is Glamdring...

1047
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,685
...the Foehammer.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.

1048
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,240
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.

1049
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:26,367
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are
named for the great deeds they do in war.

1050
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,761
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?

1051
01:28:29,319 --> 01:28:31,322
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1052
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,643
More of a letter opener, really.

1053
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,164
How did you come by these?

1054
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:40,289
We found them in a Troll-hoard
on the Great East Road...

1055
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:44,403
shortly before we were
ambushed by Orcs.

1056
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,167
And what were you doing
on the Great East Road?

1057
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:52,322
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1058
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:55,449
For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.

1059
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,688
It is the legacy of my people.

1060
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,400
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

1061
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,126
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

1062
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:07,250
Your pride will be your downfall.

1063
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,329
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

1064
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,166
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

1065
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:23,048
Thorin, no.

1066
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:34,043
Erebor.

1067
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:39,121
What is your interest in this map?

1068
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:41,886
It's mainly academic.

1069
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,360
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

1070
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,524
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

1071
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,086
Moon runes?

1072
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,923
Of course.

1073
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,649
An easy thing to miss.

1074
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,409
Well, in this case, that is true.

1075
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,086
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

1076
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:19,689
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.

1077
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:22,243
Can you read them?

1078
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,922
ELROND: These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

1079
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:34,368
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

1080
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,810
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

1081
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,721
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

1082
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,770
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

1083
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,167
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...

1084
01:31:08,319 --> 01:31:13,087
...and the setting sun with the last light
of Durin's Day...

1085
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:17,643
- ...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

1086
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,282
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

1087
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,329
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

1088
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,403
This is ill news.

1089
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,131
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1090
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:30,565
We still have time.

1091
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,199
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

1092
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:37,159
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

1093
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:41,324
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

1094
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:44,847
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?

1095
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,091
What of it?

1096
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:50,210
There are some
who would not deem it wise.

1097
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,921
What do you mean?

1098
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:58,967
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1099
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,448
No, you did the same thing.

1100
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:55,929
- It's not like you didn't do it.
- Dori! Here, take that.

1101
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:02,804
Bombur!

1102
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,130
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.

1103
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:16,203
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.

1104
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:21,525
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1105
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,408
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1106
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,405
It is not me you must answer to.

1107
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,002
Lady Galadriel.

1108
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:43,680
Mithrandir.

1109
01:35:02,039 --> 01:35:05,805
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1110
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,564
He didn't.

1111
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,842
I did.

1112
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:16,326
Ah.

1113
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,569
Saruman.

1114
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:24,203
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1115
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:26,766
Tell me, Gandalf...

1116
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:32,609
...did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed?

1117
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,728
Unnoticed?

1118
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:36,805
No.

1119
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,650
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1120
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,087
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1121
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,561
That is true, my lady.

1122
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,127
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1123
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:51,123
But if he should side with the enemy...

1124
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:54,203
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1125
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:55,930
What enemy?

1126
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,524
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1127
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:04,402
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

1128
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,930
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...

1129
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:12,970
...a hard-won, watchful peace.

1130
01:36:13,159 --> 01:36:16,130
Are we? Are we at peace?

1131
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:19,600
Trolls have come down
from the mountains.

1132
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,239
They are raiding villages,
destroying farms.

1133
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:24,686
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1134
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,689
Hardly a prelude to war.

1135
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,121
Always you must meddle...

1136
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:31,282
...looking for trouble where none exists.

1137
01:36:31,439 --> 01:36:33,841
Let him speak.

1138
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,720
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

1139
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,359
Something far more powerful.

1140
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:48,524
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1141
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,524
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1142
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,081
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.

1143
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:56,088
And they say...

1144
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:01,171
Well? Don't stop now.

1145
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:03,640
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1146
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,122
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.

1147
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:10,761
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1148
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,331
That's absurd.

1149
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:15,323
No such power exists in this world.

1150
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:19,609
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1151
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,399
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1152
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,203
And so I thought too.

1153
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:27,801
- But Radagast has seen...
- Radagast?

1154
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:31,402
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.

1155
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,403
He's a foolish fellow.

1156
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,770
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

1157
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,323
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

1158
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,925
They've addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth.

1159
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:48,730
I've warned him.

1160
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:52,207
It is unbefitting one of the lstari
to be wandering the woods...

1161
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:55,011
You carry something.

1162
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:59,130
It came to you from Radagast.

1163
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,806
He found it in Dol Guldur.

1164
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,849
Yes.

1165
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,887
Show me.

1166
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:10,600
...listen to me.

1167
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,600
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.

1168
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,081
By all means...

1169
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:20,729
What is that?

1170
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,610
A relic of Mordor.

1171
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:36,087
A Morgul Blade.

1172
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:39,403
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1173
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,082
And buried with him.

1174
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,927
When Angmar fell...

1175
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:50,606
...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...

1176
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,889
...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1177
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:57,043
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1178
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,002
...in a tomb so dark...

1179
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,804
...it would never come to light.

1180
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,485
This is not possible.

1181
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:08,850
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1182
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:10,929
They cannot be opened.

1183
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:15,926
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?

1184
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,324
- I have none.
- Because there is none.

1185
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,444
Let us examine what we know.

1186
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:25,447
A single Orc pack...

1187
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,926
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1188
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,802
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.

1189
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,329
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...

1190
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,729
has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

1191
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,291
It's not so very much after all.

1192
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:51,479
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however, troubles me deeply.

1193
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,368
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1194
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,002
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1195
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:01,729
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.

1196
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,962
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.

1197
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,770
They are leaving.

1198
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:10,805
Yes.

1199
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,564
You knew.

1200
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:22,569
No, I'm afraid there is nothing else for it.

1201
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,163
My Lord Elrond.

1202
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,449
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1203
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,643
Be on your guard.

1204
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,161
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

1205
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,081
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1206
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:43,844
Aye.

1207
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:51,488
Master Baggins...

1208
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,961
...I suggest you keep up.

1209
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,286
- You will follow them?
- Yes.

1210
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:13,569
You are right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.

1211
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,007
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

1212
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:20,686
...forces we do not yet understand.

1213
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,805
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.

1214
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,487
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.

1215
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,728
It will not show itself.

1216
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,689
Not yet.

1217
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,684
But every day it grows in strength.

1218
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,807
You must be careful.

1219
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:44,003
Mithrandir?

1220
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,801
Why the Half ling?

1221
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,721
I do not know.

1222
01:41:54,279 --> 01:41:58,079
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...

1223
01:41:58,239 --> 01:42:01,403
...that can hold evil in check.

1224
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,131
But that is not what I have found.

1225
01:42:05,239 --> 01:42:08,961
I have found it is the small things...

1226
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,520
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1227
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,842
...that keeps the darkness at bay.

1228
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:18,841
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1229
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,729
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1230
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,570
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1231
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:32,881
...and he gives me courage.

1232
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,082
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1233
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,204
You are not alone.

1234
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:27,164
Hey! Hold on!

1235
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:35,561
- Aah!
- Bilbo!

1236
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:41,130
We must find shelter!

1237
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:42,690
Look out!

1238
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:49,963
Look out, brother!

1239
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,329
Hold on!

1240
01:44:56,199 --> 01:44:57,804
This is no thunderstorm.

1241
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:00,890
It's a thunder-battle!

1242
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,408
Look!

1243
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,721
Well, bless me.

1244
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,689
The legends are true.

1245
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,810
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1246
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:25,006
Take cover, you fool!

1247
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,564
Hold on!

1248
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,451
What's happening?
Grab my hand!

1249
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:05,243
Go, go, go!
Run! Get off! Get off!

1250
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,171
- Run!
- Look out!

1251
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,645
Look out!

1252
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,564
Jump!

1253
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,841
Come on!

1254
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,371
Hold on!

1255
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:59,331
No!

1256
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:10,605
No! Kili!

1257
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:18,720
It's all right! They're alive!

1258
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:22,801
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?

1259
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:25,605
There!

1260
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,005
Get him!

1261
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,881
Aah!

1262
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:34,367
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!

1263
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:38,159
Ori, be careful!
Take it!

1264
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:40,845
I've got you, lad.
Grab on! Grab on!

1265
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,844
Come on. Get him.

1266
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,684
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1267
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,287
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1268
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,331
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1269
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:07,048
He should never have come.

1270
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,122
He has no place amongst us.

1271
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:12,724
Dwalin!

1272
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,286
It looks safe enough.
Search to the back.

1273
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,524
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

1274
01:48:28,039 --> 01:48:30,007
There's nothing here.

1275
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,962
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1276
01:48:34,119 --> 01:48:37,043
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1277
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,929
Get some sleep.

1278
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:41,605
We start at first light.

1279
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,480
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

1280
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:48,609
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.

1281
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,287
Bofur, take the first watch.

1282
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,404
Where do you think you're going?

1283
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,805
Back to Rivendell.

1284
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,240
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1285
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:19,404
You're par': of the company.
You're one of us.

1286
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,528
I'm not, though, am I?

1287
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,207
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.

1288
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:30,489
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1289
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:35,770
- I should never have run out my door.
- You're homesick. I understand.

1290
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,445
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

1291
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:41,364
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.

1292
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,286
To living on the road, never settling
in one place, not belonging anywhere!

1293
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:50,925
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

1294
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,408
No, you're right.

1295
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,648
We don't belong anywhere.

1296
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,081
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1297
01:51:17,319 --> 01:51:19,048
I really do.

1298
01:51:23,159 --> 01:51:24,604
What's that?

1299
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,211
Hmm?

1300
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:49,122
Wake up! Wake up!

1301
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,407
Whoa!

1302
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:14,770
Look out! Look out!

1303
01:52:18,039 --> 01:52:19,689
Get away!

1304
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,284
Filthy scum!

1305
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:27,521
Get back!

1306
01:52:31,239 --> 01:52:33,162
You'll pay for this!

1307
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,601
Got you.

1308
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,371
All right, all right. Don't push.

1309
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:48,923
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!

1310
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:56,481
Get off me!

1311
01:54:43,399 --> 01:54:48,850
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?

1312
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,527
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

1313
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,408
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.

1314
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,323
Dwarves?

1315
01:54:56,479 --> 01:54:58,243
We found them on the Front Porch.

1316
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:02,724
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

1317
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,485
Every crack. Every crevice.

1318
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:13,407
What are you doing in these pans?

1319
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:16,801
Speak!

1320
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:23,963
Very well. If they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk.

1321
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:25,689
Bring up the mangler.

1322
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,684
Bring up the bonebreaker.

1323
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:31,889
- Start with the youngest.
- Wait!

1324
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:37,768
Well, well, well.

1325
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,445
Look who it is.

1326
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:44,681
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1327
01:55:45,399 --> 01:55:48,563
...King Under the Mountain.

1328
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:53,404
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.

1329
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,210
And you're not a king...

1330
01:55:55,359 --> 01:55:59,729
...which makes you nobody, really.

1331
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:07,966
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.

1332
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,762
Just a head.

1333
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,649
Nothing attached.

1334
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,560
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

1335
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,484
An old enemy of yours.

1336
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:27,442
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1337
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:32,202
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1338
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:36,846
He was slain in battle long ago.

1339
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:40,880
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?

1340
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,365
Send word to the pale Orc.

1341
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:49,042
Tell him I have found his prize.

1342
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:27,161
Yes!

1343
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,331
Yes.

1344
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:34,131
Yes.

1345
01:57:35,319 --> 01:57:37,845
Yes!

1346
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,889
Gollum, gollum!

1347
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:05,805
Aah!

1348
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,603
Nasty Goblinses!

1349
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:15,091
Better than old bones, precious.

1350
01:58:15,239 --> 01:58:17,162
Better than nothing.

1351
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,327
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!

1352
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:54,121
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1353
01:58:55,039 --> 01:58:57,407
Start with its head.

1354
01:59:02,279 --> 01:59:06,001
♪ The cold hard lands,
They bites our hands.

1355
01:59:06,199 --> 01:59:09,521
♪ They gnaws our feet.

1356
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:13,287
♪ The rocks and stones,
They're like old bones.

1357
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:16,603
♪ All bare of meat.

1358
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,684
♪ Cold as death,
Without no breath.

1359
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,201
♪ It's good to eat.

1360
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:04,442
Bless us and splash us, precious.

1361
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,251
That's a meaty mouthful.

1362
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:11,805
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

1363
02:00:13,079 --> 02:00:15,400
Back. Stay back.

1364
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:20,048
I'm warning you, don't come any closer.

1365
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:25,801
It's got an Elfish blade.
But it's not an Elfs.

1366
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,042
Not an Elfs, no.

1367
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:30,969
What is it, precious?

1368
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:33,524
What is it?

1369
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:37,162
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

1370
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:40,202
Bagginses?

1371
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,247
What is a Bagginses, precious?

1372
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:48,805
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.

1373
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,284
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

1374
02:00:55,479 --> 02:00:58,449
Is it soft? ls itjuicy?

1375
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:02,201
Now, now, keep your distance!

1376
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:04,368
I'll use this if I have to.

1377
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,560
Aah!

1378
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:08,529
I don't want any trouble,
do you understand?

1379
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:11,762
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.

1380
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,842
Why? Is it lost?

1381
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,890
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.

1382
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:21,003
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.

1383
02:01:21,159 --> 02:01:23,242
Safe paths in the dark.

1384
02:01:23,399 --> 02:01:24,730
Shut up!

1385
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:27,890
- I didn't say anything.
- We wasn't talking to you.

1386
02:01:28,039 --> 02:01:30,805
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

1387
02:01:31,159 --> 02:01:34,323
Look, I don't know what your game is,
but I...

1388
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:36,050
Games?!

1389
02:01:36,199 --> 02:01:39,043
Oh, we love games,
doesn't we, precious?

1390
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:43,728
Does it like games? Does it, does it?
Does it like to play?

1391
02:01:44,279 --> 02:01:45,610
Maybe.

1392
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,448
What has roots as nobody sees?

1393
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:55,364
Is taller than trees?

1394
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,601
Up, up, up it goes

1395
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,684
And yet, never grows

1396
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:04,331
- The mountain.
- Yes, yes.

1397
02:02:04,479 --> 02:02:07,689
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

1398
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,282
Yes! Do it again, do it again. Ask us.

1399
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:14,488
No! No more riddles.

1400
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,724
Finish him off. Finish him now!

1401
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,404
Gollum, gollum!

1402
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,328
No! No. No.

1403
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:24,604
No. I want to play. I do.

1404
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,445
I want to play. I can see...

1405
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,320
...you are very good at this.

1406
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:33,689
So why don't we...

1407
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,926
...have a game of riddles? Yes?

1408
02:02:38,119 --> 02:02:39,770
Just you and me.

1409
02:02:40,279 --> 02:02:44,444
Yes. Yes, just us.

1410
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,648
Yes. Yes.

1411
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,006
And if I win...

1412
02:02:49,159 --> 02:02:52,163
...you show me the way out. Yes?

1413
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:54,083
Yes. Yes.

1414
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,962
And if it loses? What then?

1415
02:02:58,119 --> 02:03:01,601
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it!

1416
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:06,480
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

1417
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,684
Fair enough.

1418
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,444
Well, Baggins first.

1419
02:03:27,239 --> 02:03:29,765
Thirty white horses on a red hill

1420
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:33,363
First they champ, then they stamp

1421
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,123
Then they stand still

1422
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,162
Teeth?

1423
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:52,244
Teeth! Oh, yes, my precious!

1424
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:59,161
But we... We only have nine.

1425
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,291
Our turn.

1426
02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:06,810
Voiceless, it cries

1427
02:04:07,319 --> 02:04:09,765
Wingless flutters

1428
02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:13,569
Toothless bites

1429
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:17,007
Mouthless mutters

1430
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:22,645
Just a minute. Uh...

1431
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,045
Oh. Oh!

1432
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,884
We knows! We knows!

1433
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:28,529
Shut up!

1434
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,926
Wind.

1435
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:38,650
It's wind. Of course it is.

1436
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,770
Very clever, Hobbitses.

1437
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,002
Very clever.

1438
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:45,240
Ah-ah-ah.

1439
02:04:45,399 --> 02:04:50,280
A box without hinges, key or lid

1440
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:53,966
Yet golden treasure inside is hid

1441
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,890
Box.

1442
02:04:58,199 --> 02:05:00,600
Oh, um...

1443
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,927
Box. The lid and a key.

1444
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:06,402
- Well?
- It's nasty.

1445
02:05:08,439 --> 02:05:11,046
- Box. Key.
- Do you give up?

1446
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:14,886
Give us a chance, precious!
Give us a chance!

1447
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:28,725
Eggses!

1448
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:30,963
Eggses!

1449
02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:34,567
Wet, crunchy little eggses. Yes.

1450
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:39,282
Grandmother taught us
to suck them, yes!

1451
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:50,961
We have one for you.

1452
02:05:51,479 --> 02:05:55,529
All things it devours.

1453
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,810
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers.

1454
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,203
Gnaws iron, bites steel.

1455
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:09,159
Grinds hard stones to meal.

1456
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,283
Answer us.

1457
02:06:12,439 --> 02:06:17,127
Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.

1458
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:20,921
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.

1459
02:06:21,079 --> 02:06:22,490
I don't know this one.

1460
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:25,882
Is it tasty?

1461
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:30,408
Is it scrumptious?

1462
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,090
Is it crunchable?

1463
02:06:32,439 --> 02:06:35,250
Let me think.

1464
02:06:40,039 --> 02:06:42,122
It's stuck.

1465
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:47,681
Bagginses is stuck.

1466
02:06:51,239 --> 02:06:52,844
Time's up.

1467
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,449
Time.

1468
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:01,251
The answer is time.

1469
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:04,965
Actually it wasn't that hard.

1470
02:07:07,359 --> 02:07:08,690
Last question.

1471
02:07:10,359 --> 02:07:12,168
Last chance.

1472
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:14,003
Okay.

1473
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,561
Ask us.

1474
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:22,490
- Ask us!
- Yes, yes. All right.

1475
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:31,088
What have I got in my pocket?

1476
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:35,921
That's no fair.

1477
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:39,809
It's not fair! It's against the rules!

1478
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,204
Now ask us another one.

1479
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,965
No. No, no, no.

1480
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:49,091
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

1481
02:07:49,239 --> 02:07:51,606
What have I got in my pocket?

1482
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:56,603
Three guesses, precious.
It must give us three!

1483
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:59,081
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

1484
02:07:59,239 --> 02:08:00,525
Handses!

1485
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,408
Wrong. Guess again.

1486
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,925
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

1487
02:08:10,479 --> 02:08:12,608
Knife! Oh, shut up!

1488
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,569
Wrong again. Last guess.

1489
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:17,849
String. Or nothing.

1490
02:08:18,039 --> 02:08:21,965
Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.

1491
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,364
So...

1492
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,402
Come, then. I won the game.
You promised to show me the way out.

1493
02:08:32,119 --> 02:08:35,010
Did we say so, precious?

1494
02:08:35,159 --> 02:08:38,323
Did we say so?

1495
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:45,927
What has it got in its pocketses?

1496
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:48,844
That's no concern of yours.

1497
02:08:49,479 --> 02:08:51,528
You lost.

1498
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:53,648
Lost?

1499
02:08:55,439 --> 02:08:56,487
Lost?

1500
02:08:58,479 --> 02:08:59,890
Lost?

1501
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:08,326
Where is it?

1502
02:09:09,239 --> 02:09:10,650
Where is it?!

1503
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,001
No!

1504
02:09:15,319 --> 02:09:16,650
Where is it?!

1505
02:09:17,039 --> 02:09:19,690
No! No!

1506
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:22,770
Lost!

1507
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,207
Curse us and splash us!

1508
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:29,689
My precious is lost!

1509
02:09:31,039 --> 02:09:35,408
- What have you lost?
- Mustn't ask us! Not its business!

1510
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:37,483
No!

1511
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:40,166
Gollum, gollum!

1512
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,367
What has it got...

1513
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:59,251
...in its nasty...

1514
02:09:59,399 --> 02:10:02,164
...little pocketses?

1515
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:14,207
He stole it.

1516
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,409
He stole it!

1517
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,409
He stole it!

1518
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:30,922
♪ Bones will be shattered,

1519
02:10:31,079 --> 02:10:32,240
♪ Necks will be wrung.

1520
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:34,402
♪ You'll be beaten and battered,

1521
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,005
♪ From racks you'll be hung.

1522
02:10:36,159 --> 02:10:40,448
♪ You will die down here
and never be found.

1523
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:44,725
♪ Down in the deep of Goblin-town.

1524
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:51,610
I know that sword!
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

1525
02:10:52,199 --> 02:10:53,530
The Biter!

1526
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:57,247
The blade that sliced 1000 necks!

1527
02:10:57,399 --> 02:11:01,324
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!

1528
02:11:01,479 --> 02:11:03,208
Kill them all!

1529
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:05,010
Cut off his head!

1530
02:11:35,079 --> 02:11:37,320
Take up arms.

1531
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,291
Fight.

1532
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,886
Fight!

1533
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:51,649
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!

1534
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,082
Bright as daylight!

1535
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:04,810
Thofin!

1536
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,368
Follow me. Quick!

1537
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,250
Run!

1538
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,648
Give it to us!

1539
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,884
It's ours.

1540
02:12:58,039 --> 02:13:01,600
It's ours!

1541
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:27,886
Thief!

1542
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:32,048
Baggins!

1543
02:13:38,199 --> 02:13:40,680
Quickly!

1544
02:13:41,399 --> 02:13:43,323
Faster!

1545
02:13:53,159 --> 02:13:54,490
Post!

1546
02:13:57,119 --> 02:13:58,201
Charge!

1547
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:46,530
Cut the ropes!

1548
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:10,886
Come on, quickly!

1549
02:15:11,079 --> 02:15:13,127
Come on, move!
Bombur!

1550
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:21,488
Go, go, go!

1551
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,411
Jump!

1552
02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:33,445
Jump, lad!

1553
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,041
Come on!

1554
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,011
Push!

1555
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,802
Come on!

1556
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,930
Come on!

1557
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:36,325
- Watch your backs!
- You thought you could escape me.

1558
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:42,406
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1559
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:52,689
That'll do it.

1560
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:29,886
Well, that could have been worse.

1561
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,125
Haver!

1562
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:34,931
You've got to be joking!

1563
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:42,290
Gandalf!

1564
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:49,086
There's too many. We can't fight them.

1565
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:51,361
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

1566
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:54,523
Come on! Here! On your feet.

1567
02:17:57,079 --> 02:17:59,287
Balin.
Come on!

1568
02:18:01,239 --> 02:18:02,479
Wait!

1569
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:06,166
My precious. Wait!

1570
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:09,129
Gollum, gollum!

1571
02:18:13,479 --> 02:18:15,561
Quick, quick!

1572
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:18,681
This way.

1573
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:24,522
Come on.
Come on, come on. Quickly.

1574
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,849
Right, good!

1575
02:19:55,879 --> 02:19:57,290
Baggins!

1576
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:00,567
Thief!

1577
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:05,923
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

1578
02:20:18,559 --> 02:20:21,769
Five, six, seven, eight.

1579
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:24,441
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

1580
02:20:24,639 --> 02:20:27,120
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

1581
02:20:27,479 --> 02:20:30,689
And Bombur. That makes 13.

1582
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:32,888
Where's Bilbo?

1583
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,647
Where is our Hobbit?

1584
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:38,250
Where is our Hobbit?

1585
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,649
Curse that Half ling! Now he's lost?

1586
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:44,210
I thought he was with Dori!

1587
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:47,408
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?

1588
02:20:47,559 --> 02:20:50,290
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.

1589
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,885
And what happened, exactly?

1590
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:54,326
- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.

1591
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:57,324
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

1592
02:20:58,239 --> 02:21:01,244
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

1593
02:21:01,399 --> 02:21:03,800
...since first he stepped out of his door.

1594
02:21:03,959 --> 02:21:06,281
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

1595
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:08,564
He is long gone.

1596
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:23,365
No. He isn't.

1597
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,522
Bilbo Baggins.

1598
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:32,489
I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.

1599
02:21:34,559 --> 02:21:36,483
Bilbo. We'd given you up.

1600
02:21:36,639 --> 02:21:38,563
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?

1601
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:40,329
How, indeed.

1602
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,489
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

1603
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,443
It matters. I want to know.

1604
02:21:58,639 --> 02:22:00,369
Why did you come back?

1605
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,763
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

1606
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:11,290
And you're right, I often think of Bag-end.

1607
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,922
I miss my books.

1608
02:22:14,639 --> 02:22:17,405
And my armchair and my garden.

1609
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:19,805
See, that's where I belong.

1610
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:22,403
That's home.

1611
02:22:23,959 --> 02:22:26,041
And that's why I came back. Because...

1612
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:31,250
...you don't have one. A home.

1613
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,523
It was taken from you.

1614
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,409
But I will help you take it back if I can.

1615
02:23:12,639 --> 02:23:14,084
Out of the frying pan.

1616
02:23:14,239 --> 02:23:16,606
And into the fire. Run.

1617
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,728
Run!

1618
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:35,490
Go!

1619
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,364
Up into the trees!

1620
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,000
All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!

1621
02:24:06,959 --> 02:24:08,405
Quickly!

1622
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:19,166
They're coming!

1623
02:24:57,639 --> 02:24:59,369
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!

1624
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:22,284
Azog.

1625
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,808
It cannot be.

1626
02:26:43,639 --> 02:26:45,768
It's going!

1627
02:27:35,319 --> 02:27:36,559
Fili!

1628
02:28:01,159 --> 02:28:02,240
Yeah!

1629
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:12,930
No!

1630
02:28:19,639 --> 02:28:21,290
Oh, no.

1631
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:27,129
Mr. Gandalf!

1632
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,047
Oh, no, Dori!

1633
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,565
Help!

1634
02:30:04,360 --> 02:30:07,125
No!

1635
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:20,810
Thorin! No!

1636
02:33:19,159 --> 02:33:20,570
Look.

1637
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:09,929
Thorin!

1638
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:26,404
Thofin!

1639
02:35:30,159 --> 02:35:31,207
Thorin.

1640
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:49,841
The Half ling?

1641
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:52,968
It's all right.

1642
02:35:53,399 --> 02:35:56,609
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.

1643
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:07,527
You!

1644
02:36:11,479 --> 02:36:13,323
What were you doing?

1645
02:36:13,479 --> 02:36:16,050
You nearly got yourself killed!

1646
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,730
Did I not say that
you would be a burden?

1647
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:24,568
That you would not survive in the Wild?

1648
02:36:25,079 --> 02:36:27,003
That you had no place amongst us?

1649
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:36,729
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

1650
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:50,244
But I'm sorry I doubted you.

1651
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:53,290
No, I would have doubted me too.

1652
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:56,568
I'm not a hero or a warrior.

1653
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:00,328
Not even a burglar.

1654
02:37:19,719 --> 02:37:22,325
Is that what I think it is?

1655
02:37:37,239 --> 02:37:38,287
Erebor...

1656
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:41,843
...the Lonely Mountain...

1657
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,561
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms
of Middle-earth.

1658
02:37:49,079 --> 02:37:51,048
Our home.

1659
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,726
A raven!

1660
02:37:56,879 --> 02:38:00,088
The birds are returning to the mountain.

1661
02:38:03,399 --> 02:38:07,405
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

1662
02:38:08,399 --> 02:38:10,528
But we'll take it as a sign.

1663
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:14,002
- A good omen.
- You're right.

1664
02:38:14,159 --> 02:38:17,289
I do believe the worst is behind us.
