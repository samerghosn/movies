1
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:02,506
'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems...

2
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,468
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

3
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:08,262
For the story that you
are about to be told...

4
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:11,349
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

5
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,852
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

6
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:19,064
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!

7
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,207
Boys and girls
of every age

8
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,043
Wouldn't you like to see
something strange

9
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,921
Come with us
and you will see

10
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,758
This our town
of Halloween

11
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:48,635
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

12
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,514
Pumpkins scream
in the dead of night

13
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,391
This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene

14
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:57,311
Trick-or-treat till the
neighbor's gonna die of fright

15
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,147
It's our town
Everybody scream

16
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,525
In this town of Halloween

17
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:05,194
I am the one hiding
under your bed

18
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:08,155
Teeth ground sharp
and eyes glowing red

19
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,991
I am the one hiding
under your stairs

20
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:14,036
Fingers like snakes
and spiders in my hair

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,872
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

22
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,792
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

23
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:24,045
In this town we call home

24
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,882
Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

25
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,843
In this town
Don't we love it now

26
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:32,722
Everybody's waiting
for the next surprise

27
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:35,515
'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can

28
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,061
- Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll
- Scream

29
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:41,396
- This is Halloween - Red
and black - And slimy green

30
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,150
- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine

31
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:47,110
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice

32
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,947
Ride with the moon
in the dead of night

33
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:53,033
Everybody scream
Everybody scream

34
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:55,076
In our town of Halloween

35
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,872
I am the clown
with a tear-away face

36
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:00,750
Here in a flash
and gone without a trace

37
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,669
I am the who
when you call who's there

38
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:06,546
I am the wind blowing
through your hair

39
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:09,342
I am the shadow
on the moon at night

40
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:12,177
Filling your dreams
to the brim with fright

41
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,139
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

42
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:18,016
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

43
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:23,730
Tender lumplings everywhere

44
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,734
Life's no fun
without a good scare

45
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:29,527
- That's ourjob
- But we're not mean

46
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:32,448
In our town of Halloween

47
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,325
In this town
Don't we love it now

48
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,162
Everyone's waiting
for the next surprise

49
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:40,706
Skeleton Jack
might catch you in the back

50
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:44,168
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin

51
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,545
This is Halloween
Everybody scream

52
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:49,632
Won't you please make way
for a very special guy

53
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:52,509
Our man Jack is king
of the pumpkin patch

54
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:55,388
Everyone hail
to the Pumpkin King now

55
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:58,348
This is Halloween
This is Halloween

56
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:01,227
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween

57
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:05,522
In this town we call home

58
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:08,401
Everyone hail
to the pumpkin song

59
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:16,574
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween

60
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,911
La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee

61
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,261
- It's over!
- We did it!

62
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,848
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

63
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,141
Great Halloween, everybody.

64
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:45,771
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.

65
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,814
No! Thanks to you, Jack.

66
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,942
Without your
brilliant leadership...

67
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:53,946
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.

68
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,992
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.

69
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:03,456
Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

70
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:08,586
- The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!

71
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:13,298
- You're not ready for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!

72
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,509
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!

73
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,059
Come back here, you foolish...

74
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,644
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.

75
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:30,483
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

76
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:34,612
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!

77
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:39,699
Hold it. We haven't given out
the prizes yet.

78
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:42,661
Our first award
goes to the vampires...

79
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,538
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

80
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,875
Our second and
honorable mention...

81
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,713
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.

82
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,555
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

83
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,850
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year...

84
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,853
and the year before that,
and the year before that.

85
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:53,691
There are few who deny
at what I do I am the best

86
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:57,987
For my talents
are renowned far and wide

87
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,408
When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night

88
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,579
I excel without ever even trying

89
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:08,872
With the slightest little effort

90
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:11,166
Of my ghost-like charms

91
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,379
I have seen grown men
give out a shriek

92
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:19,925
With a wave of my hand
and a well-placed moan

93
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,262
I have swept the very bravest
off their feet

94
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:27,182
Yet year after year

95
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,851
It's the same routine

96
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:34,856
And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams

97
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,819
And I, Jack
the Pumpkin King

98
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:45,408
Have grown so tired
of the same old thing

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,290
Oh, somewhere deep

100
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,334
Inside of these bones

101
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,420
An emptiness

102
00:07:57,504 --> 00:08:00,423
Began to grow

103
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:04,011
There's something out there

104
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,680
Far from my home

105
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:10,141
A longing that

106
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:15,398
I've never known

107
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,067
I'm the master of fright

108
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:21,069
And a demon of light

109
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:25,408
And I'll scare you
right out of your pants

110
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,911
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky

111
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:34,125
And I'm known throughout
England and France

112
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:38,461
And since I am dead
I can take off my head

113
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:42,758
To recite Shakespearean quotations

114
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:47,388
No animal nor man
can scream like I can

115
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:51,767
With the fury
of my recitations

116
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,562
But who here

117
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:57,023
Would ever understand

118
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:02,028
That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin

119
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,198
Would tire of his crown
If they only understood

120
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,534
He'd give it all up

121
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:14,789
If he only could

122
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:18,210
Oh, there's an empty

123
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:20,921
Place in my bones

124
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:24,008
That calls out for

125
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,094
Something unknown

126
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:30,264
The fame and praise

127
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:33,267
Come year after year

128
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,270
Does nothing for

129
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:43,235
These empty tears

130
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,619
Jack.

131
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,580
I know how you feel.

132
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:18,019
Sally!

133
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:22,357
You've come back.

134
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:26,195
- I had to.
- For this!

135
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:32,076
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?

136
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,384
That's twice this month you've slipped
deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.

137
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:51,428
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!

138
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:55,850
I made you with my own hands.

139
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:58,644
You can make other creations.

140
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:01,563
I'm restless. I can't help it.

141
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:05,192
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.

142
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:08,863
We need to be patient, that's all.

143
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,615
But I don't want to be patient.

144
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,912
No, Zero, not now.

145
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,624
I'm not in the mood.

146
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,461
All right.

147
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,755
Here you go, boy.

148
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:48,193
Mornin', gents!

149
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:12,384
Jack, you home?

150
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:25,355
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

151
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:29,567
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

152
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,947
Jack, please! I'm only
an elected official here.

153
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,575
I can't make decisions by myself.

154
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:39,620
Jack, answer me!

155
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:46,543
- Huh?
- He's not home.

156
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,797
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.

157
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,934
Where are we?

158
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,693
It's someplace new!

159
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,912
What is this?

160
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,833
Whoa-oa-oa!

161
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:16,008
Whoa!

162
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:02,013
What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere

163
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,222
What's this
There's white things in the air

164
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,933
What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming

165
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:09,019
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this

166
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:14,609
What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong

167
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:17,445
What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this

168
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:20,947
The streets are lined with little
creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy

169
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:24,201
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this

170
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:27,245
What's this

171
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,081
There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads

172
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,168
They're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead

173
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:36,212
There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes

174
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,215
And in my bones
I feel the warmth

175
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:42,260
That's coming from inside

176
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:45,221
Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe

177
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:48,142
They kiss, why that looks
so unique, inspired

178
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,144
They're gathering around
to hear a story

179
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,938
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this

180
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:58,653
What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer

181
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,613
And who would ever think
And why

182
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,615
They're covering it
with tiny little things

183
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:05,784
They've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone

184
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:08,663
So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun

185
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:11,248
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this

186
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,504
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep

187
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,630
But look
There's nothing underneath

188
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:21,759
No ghouls, no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them

189
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:27,264
Only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland

190
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,229
What's this

191
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,106
The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found

192
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,067
And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around

193
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,861
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air

194
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:47,576
The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere

195
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:51,330
The sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around

196
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,499
I've never felt so good before

197
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:57,211
This empty place inside of me is
filling up I simply cannot get enough

198
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:59,838
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own

199
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:03,301
I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found

200
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:06,220
What is this

201
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,853
Christmas Town?

202
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,688
Hmm.

203
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,362
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

204
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:24,946
Hmm.

205
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,700
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

206
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,951
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.

207
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:33,079
Stand aside. Coming through.

208
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:41,505
We've got to find Jack!

209
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:45,718
There's only 35 days left
till next Halloween!

210
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,677
Three sixty-four!

211
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:51,222
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

212
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:53,808
I looked in every mausoleum.

213
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,894
We opened the sarcophagi!

214
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:58,814
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

215
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:01,692
I peeked behind
the cyclops' eye.

216
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,278
I did! But he wasn't there.

217
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:07,073
It's time to sound the alarms!

218
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,771
Frog's breath
will overpower any odor.

219
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,865
Bitter!

220
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:54,953
Worm's wart. But where,
where is that worm's wart?

221
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:59,541
Sally? Is that soup ready yet?

222
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,796
Ah. Coming!

223
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,638
Lunch!

224
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,184
Ah, what's that?

225
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,230
Worm's wart! Mmm!

226
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:25,067
And frog's breath?

227
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:29,321
Wh-What's wrong? I-I thought
you liked frog's breath.

228
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:32,991
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

229
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:37,913
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

230
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:40,833
I'm not hungry. Oops.

231
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,420
You want me to starve...

232
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:49,342
an old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

233
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:53,429
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

234
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:56,182
Oh, don't be silly.

235
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:02,395
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!

236
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:14,491
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

237
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:17,118
Oh, this morning.

238
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:22,666
- Hear that? -
Ah, what? - Shh.

239
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:26,545
Zero!

240
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,634
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!

241
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:46,231
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.

242
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:49,277
- When?
- Immediately!

243
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,244
Town meeting! Town meeting!

244
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:03,833
Town meeting tonight!

245
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:09,297
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!

246
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:29,775
Listen, everyone!

247
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:33,778
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

248
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:40,286
There were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed

249
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:43,830
All around things
to tantalize my brain

250
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:47,292
It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen

251
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,796
And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe

252
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,342
Like a most improbable dream

253
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:57,845
But you must believe
when I tell you this

254
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:03,308
It's as real as my skull
and it does exist

255
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:06,394
Here, let me show you.

256
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:10,482
Ooh!

257
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:13,109
This is a thing
called a present

258
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,153
The whole thing
starts with a box

259
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:17,740
- A box - Is it steel
- Are there locks

260
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:21,201
- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox

261
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,662
If you please.

262
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:25,373
Just a box with
bright colored paper

263
00:22:25,455 --> 00:22:28,041
And the whole thing's
topped with a bow

264
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,461
- A bow - But why - How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it

265
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:33,255
That's the point of the thing
Not to know

266
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:35,967
- It's a bat - Will it bend
- It's a rat - Will it break

267
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,760
Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake

268
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:41,346
Listen now
You don't understand

269
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,017
That's not the point
of Christmasland

270
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:48,895
Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock

271
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,648
And hang it like this
on the wall

272
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:53,651
Oh, yes, does it still
have a foot

273
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,903
- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook

274
00:22:56,988 --> 00:22:58,614
Um, let me explain.

275
00:22:58,698 --> 00:23:01,491
There's no foot inside
but there's candy

276
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:04,036
- Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
- Small toys

277
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,413
- Do they bite - Do they
snap - Or explode in the sack

278
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,250
Well, perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys

279
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,876
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun

280
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,713
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

281
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:17,215
Everyone, please
Now not so fast

282
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,385
There's something here
that you don't quite grasp

283
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,805
I don't know.
Do you get it?

284
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:26,142
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

285
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:29,936
And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last

286
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,398
For the ruler
of this Christmasland

287
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:36,943
Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice

288
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:40,405
Least, that's what
I've come to understand

289
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,909
And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold

290
00:23:43,992 --> 00:23:47,413
Like a lobster huge and red

291
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:50,958
When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on

292
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,461
Can'ting bulging sacks
with his big great arms

293
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:57,839
That is so I've heard it said

294
00:23:57,923 --> 00:24:01,676
And on a dark cold night
under full moonlight

295
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,182
He flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky

296
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,769
And they call him

297
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:15,982
Sandy Claws

298
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:22,615
Well, at least they're excited

299
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:25,284
But they don't understand

300
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:29,955
That special kind of feeling
in Christmasland

301
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:32,959
Oh, well.

302
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:44,636
Hmm.

303
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,105
Hmm.

304
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:10,288
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

305
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,430
You've poisoned me for the
last time, you wretched girl.

306
00:25:35,645 --> 00:25:39,275
Oh, my head!

307
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:45,615
The door is open!

308
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:49,535
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!

309
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:54,624
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment.

310
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:58,376
Is that so? Whatever for?

311
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,922
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

312
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:05,050
How perfectly marvelous!

313
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:09,387
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

314
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:13,558
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

315
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:16,228
Hmm. Experiments?

316
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,858
Zero, I'm home!

317
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:30,885
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?

318
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:15,449
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

319
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:19,537
Sally?

320
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:22,832
Oh, gone again!

321
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:39,015
Hmm.

322
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,065
Oh!

323
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:55,465
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

324
00:30:57,425 --> 00:31:00,512
Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back

325
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:05,726
He's all alone up there
locked away inside

326
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,022
- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died

327
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:14,026
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

328
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:25,371
Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull

329
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:28,457
Will it let me be
I cannot tell

330
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,626
There's so many things
I cannot grasp

331
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:34,755
When I think I've got it
and then at last

332
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,883
Through my bony fingers
it does slip

333
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:40,595
Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip

334
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:44,307
Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting

335
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,852
Like a memory
long since past

336
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,894
Here in an instant
Gone in a flash

337
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:53,356
What does it mean
What does it mean

338
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:56,736
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked

339
00:31:56,818 --> 00:32:01,156
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

340
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,076
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door

341
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:10,499
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see

342
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,251
What does it mean
What does it mean

343
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,087
What does it mean

344
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:21,344
Hmm. Hmm.

345
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:24,305
I've read these Christmas books
so many times

346
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:27,432
I know the stories
and I know the rhymes

347
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:30,519
I know the Christmas carols
all by heart

348
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:33,855
My skull's so full
it's tearing me apart

349
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,901
As often as I've read them
Something's wrong

350
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:39,945
It's so hard to put
my bony finger on

351
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,531
Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think

352
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:46,868
Am I trying much too hard

353
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:48,828
Of course
I've been too close to see

354
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:52,208
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

355
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,002
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air

356
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:59,632
Invisible but everywhere

357
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:04,135
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

358
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,765
You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems

359
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:11,227
And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone

360
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:15,064
Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree

361
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:18,526
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime

362
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:23,990
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do

363
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,536
Eureka!

364
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:33,290
This year,
Christmas will be ours!

365
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:43,049
Patience, everyone. Jack has
a special job for each of you.

366
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:48,263
Dr. Beetlestein.

367
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:51,349
Your Christmas assignment
is ready.

368
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,940
Dr. Beetlestein,
to the front of the line.

369
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:05,530
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

370
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:08,367
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!

371
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,244
I knew it!

372
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:13,914
Doctor, thank you for coming.

373
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,458
We need some of these.

374
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,710
Hmm.

375
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:22,380
Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.

376
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:25,885
How horrible
our Christmas will be.

377
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:28,596
No! How jolly!

378
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,641
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

379
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:38,563
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

380
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,690
- Specifically.
- By name.

381
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:43,443
- Lock. -
Shock. - Barrel.

382
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:47,530
Jack, Jack,
it's Boogie's boys.

383
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:52,119
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick-or-treaters.

384
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:55,581
The job I have for you
is top secret.

385
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:58,583
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

386
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:01,836
And we thought
you didn't like us, Jack.

387
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:07,175
Absolutely no one
is to know about it. Not a soul!

388
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,052
Now.

389
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:13,431
Tree.

390
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:17,103
Christmas Town.

391
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:20,773
Ow! Hmm.

392
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,275
And one more thing.

393
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,862
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

394
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:28,614
Whatever you say, Jack.

395
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:32,784
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

396
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:54,764
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

397
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,894
- I wanna do it - Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together

398
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:02,315
- Three of a kind - Birds of
a feather - Now and forever

399
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:09,487
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

400
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:13,117
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight

401
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,621
Throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights

402
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:20,166
First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait

403
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:23,668
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

404
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:26,963
Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man

405
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:30,635
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

406
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:34,096
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box

407
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:37,599
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks

408
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:42,855
And Mr. Oogie Boogie man

409
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:46,317
Can take the whole thing
over then

410
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,695
He'll be so pleased I do declare

411
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:52,614
That he will cook him rare
Whee

412
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:02,208
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then

413
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:05,878
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

414
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:09,297
You're so stupid Think now if
we blow him up to smithereens

415
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:12,717
We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green

416
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:16,097
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag

417
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:19,182
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

418
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:23,228
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around

419
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:28,442
- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town

420
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,655
He'll be so pleased
by our success

421
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:37,159
That he'll reward us too
I'll bet

422
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:40,579
Perhaps he'll make
his special brew

423
00:37:40,663 --> 00:37:42,498
Of snake and spider stew

424
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:45,835
We're his little henchmen
and we take ourjob with pride

425
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:49,380
We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side

426
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:52,132
- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one

427
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,925
- You're no fun -
Shut up - Make me

428
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,304
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see

429
00:37:57,387 --> 00:38:00,932
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read

430
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:04,269
Now in the box we'll wait
and hide until his curiosity

431
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:07,981
Entices him to look inside and then
we'll have him one, two, three

432
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:11,318
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick

433
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:14,947
Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick

434
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,409
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits

435
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,954
Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks

436
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:25,458
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see

437
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:29,085
Lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key

438
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:38,846
Sandy Claws, huh?

439
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:47,980
It goes something like this.

440
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,737
How about it?
Think you can manage?

441
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,239
A- one, and a-two,
and a-three, and a...

442
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:08,751
- Next!
- Fantastic!

443
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,672
Now, why don't you all practice on that,
and we'll be in great shape.

444
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:16,259
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

445
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:19,469
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

446
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,181
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.

447
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:27,394
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.

448
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:31,106
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy.

449
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,820
And this: My Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.

450
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:40,449
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.

451
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:43,786
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.

452
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,996
This part's red.
The trim is white.

453
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,458
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

454
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,295
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

455
00:39:52,378 --> 00:39:54,045
- Next!
- I have...

456
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,298
- Oh.
- Every confidence in you.

457
00:39:56,382 --> 00:40:00,969
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.

458
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:03,847
This device
is called a nutcracker.

459
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:06,559
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!

460
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:09,853
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!

461
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:15,318
That's not Sandy Claws!

462
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,820
- It isn't?
- Who is it?

463
00:40:20,572 --> 00:40:23,951
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.

464
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:26,704
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!

465
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:29,664
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.

466
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:33,001
Which door?
There's more than one.

467
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:37,172
Sandy Claws is behind the door
shaped like this.

468
00:40:37,255 --> 00:40:40,425
I told you!

469
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:42,762
- You knock it off!
- Get... Ow! Ow!

470
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:49,351
I'm very sorry
for the inconvenience, sir.

471
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:53,981
Take him home first!
And apologize again.

472
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:56,525
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.

473
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:58,277
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.

474
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,822
We'll get it right next time.

475
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:05,076
You will be a decided improvement...

476
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,827
over that treacherous Sally.

477
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:12,541
Master. The plans.

478
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:18,880
Excellent, Igor.

479
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,684
- What?
- What's goin' on?

480
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:35,231
This time

481
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,858
This time

482
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,987
Making Christmas

483
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:45,240
Making Christmas

484
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:50,246
Making Christmas
Making Christmas is so fine

485
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:55,418
It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised

486
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:58,295
It's ours this time

487
00:41:58,378 --> 00:42:03,550
- Making Christmas - Making
Christmas - Making Christmas

488
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,429
Time to give them something fun

489
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:10,099
They'll talk about
for years to come

490
00:42:10,181 --> 00:42:15,605
- Let's have a cheer from everyone
- It's time to party

491
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:19,983
Making Christmas
Making Christmas

492
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:24,155
Snakes and mice
get wrapped up so nice

493
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:27,742
With spider legs and pretty bows

494
00:42:27,824 --> 00:42:30,661
It's ours this time

495
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:33,623
All together
that and this

496
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:38,793
With all our tricks
we're making Christmastime

497
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:41,297
Here comes Jack.

498
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,927
I don't believe
what's happening to me

499
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:51,641
My hopes, my dreams

500
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:55,728
My fantasies

501
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:03,985
Won't they be impressed
I am a genius

502
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,530
See how I transform
this old rat

503
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:11,534
Into a most delightful hat

504
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:16,373
- Hmm.
- My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat

505
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:20,001
- Consider though this substitute A bat in place of this old rat
- Huh!

506
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:23,338
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present

507
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:27,342
It's been dead for much too long Try
something fresher Something pleasant

508
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:28,677
Try again
Don't give up

509
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,514
All together
that and this

510
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:36,101
With all our tricks
we're making Christmastime

511
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:48,757
- This time, this time
- It's ours

512
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,135
Making Christmas
Making Christmas

513
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:56,806
La, la, la
It's almost here and we can't wait

514
00:44:56,891 --> 00:45:00,353
So ring the bells
and celebrate

515
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:05,483
'Cause when the full moon
starts to climb, we'll all sing out

516
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:08,985
It's Christmastime

517
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:25,253
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.

518
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:29,465
Nice, nice, naughty,
nice, nice, nice...

519
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:32,009
There are hardly
any naughty children this year.

520
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,137
Now, who could that be?

521
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:39,474
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?

522
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:42,103
Ya!

523
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:47,733
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.

524
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,735
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!

525
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,447
But you're the Pumpkin King!

526
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,452
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!

527
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:01,871
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but...

528
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:04,000
- Ow!
- Sorry.

529
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:08,588
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?

530
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,132
I've got the beard, the coat,
the boots, the belt...

531
00:46:12,215 --> 00:46:17,012
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!

532
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:20,349
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!

533
00:46:20,432 --> 00:46:22,976
Let me out!

534
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:27,690
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!

535
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:30,818
Wh... Why, you have hands!

536
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,903
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha...

537
00:46:35,155 --> 00:46:36,865
Where am I?

538
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:40,286
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.

539
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,539
You don't need to have another
worry about Christmas this year.

540
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:47,793
- Wha... Well, wha... Wha...
- Consider this a vacation, Sandy, a reward.

541
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:51,755
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!

542
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,094
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!

543
00:46:57,177 --> 00:46:59,512
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but...

544
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:01,556
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't...

545
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:04,143
Hold on.
Where are we going now?

546
00:47:04,226 --> 00:47:06,811
Ho, ho, ho! No.

547
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:10,565
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho. - Much worse.

548
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,068
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.

549
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:16,364
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?

550
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:18,365
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?

551
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,409
To Oogie Boogie, of course.

552
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:23,663
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.

553
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:28,083
- And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.

554
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:32,713
Haven't you heard of peace on earth
and goodwill toward men?

555
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:34,923
No!

556
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:44,266
Ah! This'll stop Jack.

557
00:47:56,278 --> 00:48:01,032
What a joy to think of all
we'll have in common.

558
00:48:01,117 --> 00:48:06,581
We'll have conversations
won'th having!

559
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:12,961
Don't do this!

560
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:15,505
Naughty children
never get any presents!

561
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,800
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!

562
00:48:18,884 --> 00:48:22,387
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney...

563
00:48:22,471 --> 00:48:25,766
he can fit down here.

564
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:57,505
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

565
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,177
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!

566
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,014
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.

567
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,643
You'rejokin'
You'rejokin'

568
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,811
I can't believe my eyes

569
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:15,273
You'rejokin'me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy

570
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,445
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse

571
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:24,367
I might just split a seam now
if I don't die laughin' first

572
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:28,371
Mr. Oogie Boogie says
there's trouble close at hand

573
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:32,875
You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man

574
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:37,255
And if you aren't shakin'
there's somethin' very wrong

575
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:41,384
'Cause this may be the last time
you hear the boogie song

576
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:47,806
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh

577
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:50,601
- I'm the Oogie Boogie man
- He's the Oogie Boogie man

578
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:54,938
Release me now or you must face
the dire consequences

579
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:59,025
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

580
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,445
Ah, you'rejokin'
You'rejokin'

581
00:50:01,528 --> 00:50:03,739
I can't believe my ears

582
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:07,909
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears

583
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:10,413
It's funny
I'm laughin'

584
00:50:10,496 --> 00:50:12,414
You really are too much

585
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:17,168
And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

586
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:20,088
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.

587
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:22,340
Whoa

588
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:26,762
The sound of rolling dice to me
is music in the air

589
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:31,349
'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man
although I don't play fair

590
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:35,438
It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line

591
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:37,731
Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy

592
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:39,942
Now that'd bejust fine

593
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:44,447
Release me fast or you will have to
answer for this heinous act

594
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,701
Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin

595
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:53,039
You aren't comprehending
the position that you're in

596
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:57,335
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer

597
00:50:57,418 --> 00:50:59,628
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie

598
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,050
And you ain't goin'nowhere

599
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:34,496
Whoa! It's Jack!

600
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:45,173
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky...

601
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:48,010
outshining every star...

602
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:52,097
your silhouette
a dark blot on the moon.

603
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:54,557
You, who are our pride.

604
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:57,311
You, who are our glory.

605
00:51:57,394 --> 00:52:01,731
- You, who have frightened millions into an early grave.
- Ow!

606
00:52:01,815 --> 00:52:04,527
You, who have, uh...

607
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,322
devastated the,
the souls of the living?

608
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:12,367
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.

609
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:15,954
- The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses.
- Whew!

610
00:52:16,038 --> 00:52:19,208
This fog's as thick as, as...

611
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:22,545
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!

612
00:52:22,628 --> 00:52:25,547
There go all of my hopes...

613
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:29,760
my precious plans,
my glorious dreams.

614
00:52:29,844 --> 00:52:33,639
There goes Christmas.

615
00:52:34,764 --> 00:52:38,184
No, Zero. Down, boy.

616
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:41,896
My, what a brilliant nose you have!

617
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:44,317
The better to light my way!

618
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,110
To the head
of the team, Zero!

619
00:52:48,653 --> 00:52:50,989
We're off!

620
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:55,911
Wait, Jack! No!

621
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:08,423
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!

622
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:19,726
Good-bye, Jack.

623
00:53:19,809 --> 00:53:22,896
My dearest Jack.

624
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,317
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.

625
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:36,827
I sense there's something
in the wind

626
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:42,123
That feels like
tragedy's at hand

627
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:47,545
And though I'd like
to stand by him

628
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,927
Can't shake this feeling
that I have

629
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,306
The worst
is just around the bend

630
00:53:58,391 --> 00:54:02,436
And does he notice

631
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,815
My feelings for him

632
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:09,985
And will he see

633
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:14,322
How much he means to me

634
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:19,579
I think it's not to be

635
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:25,126
What will become
of my dear friend

636
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:30,463
Where will his actions
lead us then

637
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:35,844
Although I'd like
to join the crowd

638
00:54:35,927 --> 00:54:41,099
In their enthusiastic cloud

639
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:46,563
Try as I may it doesn't last

640
00:54:46,646 --> 00:54:50,860
And will we ever

641
00:54:50,943 --> 00:54:55,114
End up together

642
00:54:55,197 --> 00:54:58,367
No, I think not

643
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:02,704
It's never to become

644
00:55:02,788 --> 00:55:08,251
For I am not the one

645
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:31,067
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

646
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,318
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

647
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:43,286
Santa!

648
00:56:02,722 --> 00:56:05,434
Santa?

649
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:10,106
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

650
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:12,565
- Uh, uh, uh, uh...
- That's all right.

651
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:17,487
I have a special present for you
anyway. There you go, sonny.

652
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:21,117
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

653
00:56:26,746 --> 00:56:29,208
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?

654
00:56:31,418 --> 00:56:34,672
Merry Christmas!

655
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:39,677
Hello. Police.

656
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,347
Attacked by Christmas toys? That's strange.
That's the second toy complaint we've had.

657
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:50,396
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

658
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:55,943
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

659
00:57:19,925 --> 00:57:21,385
Huh?

660
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:23,387
Oh, wait!

661
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:30,853
Whoa! Help! Help!

662
00:58:07,306 --> 00:58:11,393
You're welcome, one and all!

663
00:58:11,476 --> 00:58:13,728
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.

664
00:58:13,813 --> 00:58:16,898
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.

665
00:58:16,983 --> 00:58:20,110
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.

666
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:22,822
Reports are pouring in
from all over the globe...

667
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:26,199
that an impostor is shamelessly
impersonating Santa Claus...

668
00:58:26,284 --> 00:58:28,952
mocking and mangling
this joyous holiday.

669
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:32,581
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...

670
00:58:32,664 --> 00:58:37,210
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.

671
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:40,088
- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...

672
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:44,135
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- Come back and save Christmas.

673
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:57,606
Look, Zero, searchlights!

674
00:59:05,197 --> 00:59:07,449
They're celebrating!

675
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:11,621
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.

676
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:16,583
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!

677
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:20,463
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.

678
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:27,469
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?

679
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:31,181
Let's play. Hmm?

680
00:59:32,724 --> 00:59:37,313
My, my! What have we here?

681
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:49,240
I'll get you out of here.

682
00:59:49,324 --> 00:59:53,204
Ah. Lovely.

683
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:56,498
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.

684
00:59:56,581 --> 00:59:58,708
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

685
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:06,342
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me!

686
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:15,309
Oh!

687
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:19,188
Who's next on my list?

688
01:00:19,271 --> 01:00:23,693
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?

689
01:00:35,621 --> 01:00:39,541
They're trying to hit us. Zero!

690
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:52,304
Merry Christmas to all...

691
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:58,143
and to all a good night!

692
01:01:16,244 --> 01:01:20,750
I knew this Christmas thing
was a bad idea.

693
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:24,253
I felt it in my gut.

694
01:01:24,336 --> 01:01:27,130
Terrible news, folks.

695
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:31,760
The worst tragedy of our times.

696
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:37,182
Jack has been blown to smithereens!

697
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:41,144
Terrible, terrible news!

698
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:46,692
Attention. Attention, citizens.

699
01:01:46,775 --> 01:01:51,489
Terrible news. There's still
no sign of Santa Claus.

700
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:54,909
Although the impostor
has been shot down...

701
01:01:54,992 --> 01:02:00,331
it looks like Christmas will
have to be cancelled this year.

702
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:02,875
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down...

703
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:08,797
but there's still
no sign yet of Santa.

704
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:27,400
What have I done

705
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:30,735
How could I

706
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,155
Be so blind

707
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,451
All is lost

708
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:40,954
Where was I

709
01:02:41,038 --> 01:02:47,795
Spoiled all

710
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:51,047
Everything's

711
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:54,510
Gone all wrong

712
01:02:54,594 --> 01:03:01,309
What have I done

713
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:05,855
Find a deep cave to hide in

714
01:03:05,938 --> 01:03:08,898
In a million years

715
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:13,820
They'll find me only dust

716
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:18,284
And a plaque that reads

717
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:23,581
Here lies poor old Jack

718
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:29,961
But I never intended
all this madness

719
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:31,547
Never

720
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:35,717
And nobody really understood

721
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,802
Well, how could they

722
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:42,307
That all I ever wanted was
to bring them something great

723
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:46,519
Why does nothing ever
turn out like it should

724
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:49,315
Well, what the heck

725
01:03:49,398 --> 01:03:51,608
I went and did my best

726
01:03:51,692 --> 01:03:56,739
And by God
I really tasted something swell

727
01:03:56,822 --> 01:04:01,244
And for a moment
why, I even touched the sky

728
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:05,706
And at least I left some stories
they can tell, I did

729
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:10,043
And for the first time
since I don't remember when

730
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:14,297
I felt just like
my old bony self again

731
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:16,550
And I, Jack

732
01:04:16,634 --> 01:04:19,262
The Pumpkin King

733
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:24,099
That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha

734
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:27,894
And I just can't wait
until next Halloween

735
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:32,190
'Cause I've got some new ideas
that will really make them scream

736
01:04:32,275 --> 01:04:37,445
And by god I'm really
going to give it all my might

737
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,409
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time...

738
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:44,954
to set things right.

739
01:04:45,036 --> 01:04:48,206
Sandy Claws! Hmm.

740
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,585
You wait till Jack
hears about this!

741
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:53,795
By the time he's through with
you, you'll be lucky if you...

742
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:56,132
The King of Halloween...

743
01:04:56,215 --> 01:05:00,177
has been blown to smithereens.

744
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:05,391
Skeleton Jack
is now a pile of dust.

745
01:05:05,557 --> 01:05:08,518
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.

746
01:05:16,443 --> 01:05:20,864
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?

747
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:29,998
Help! Help! Help!

748
01:05:30,081 --> 01:05:32,043
Shh.

749
01:05:34,295 --> 01:05:37,255
Looks like it's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.

750
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,175
- Help!
- One, two, three...

751
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:43,387
four, five, six, seven.

752
01:05:43,471 --> 01:05:45,764
Help!

753
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:50,936
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

754
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:55,690
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!

755
01:05:55,775 --> 01:05:58,945
One more roll of the dice
oughta do it.

756
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:04,867
What? Snake eyes?

757
01:06:06,577 --> 01:06:09,038
Eleven!

758
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:12,916
Looks like I won the jackpot!

759
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,213
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.

760
01:06:21,092 --> 01:06:22,760
What the...

761
01:06:24,804 --> 01:06:27,806
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!

762
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:33,228
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!

763
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:34,981
Oh!

764
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:44,739
Well, come on, bone man!

765
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:55,251
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!

766
01:06:59,922 --> 01:07:02,425
Fire!

767
01:07:04,802 --> 01:07:07,429
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!

768
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:16,188
Jack, look out!

769
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,112
So long, Jack.

770
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:29,994
How dare you treat my friends
so shamefully!

771
01:07:34,956 --> 01:07:38,960
Now look what you've done!

772
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:42,757
My bugs! My bugs!

773
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:50,847
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!

774
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:54,018
My bugs! My bugs!

775
01:07:55,561 --> 01:07:57,521
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.

776
01:07:57,605 --> 01:07:59,815
I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.

777
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:03,110
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

778
01:08:03,193 --> 01:08:08,365
The next time you get the urge to take over
someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.

779
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:12,161
She's the only one who makes any
sense around this insane asylum.

780
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:15,914
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.

781
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:19,377
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!

782
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,380
I'm Santa Claus.

783
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:30,429
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.

784
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:32,681
How did you
get down here, Sally?

785
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:37,228
Oh, I-I was trying to...
Well, I wanted to, to...

786
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,939
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just...

787
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:44,025
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you...

788
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:47,363
- Jack! Jack! -
Here he is! - Alive!

789
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:50,865
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!

790
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,036
Whoa!

791
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:59,082
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one
and only, has finally been spotted.

792
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,502
Old Saint Nick appears to be
traveling at supersonic speed.

793
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:06,841
He's setting things right, bringing
joy and cheer wherever he goes.

794
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:09,719
Yes, folks, Kriss Kringle
has pulled it out of the bag...

795
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:14,599
and delivered Christmas
to excited children all over the world.

796
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:21,104
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la

797
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:23,064
- Jack!
- Jack's back!

798
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:26,444
- Jack? - Jack's okay! -
He's all right! - It's Jack!

799
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:29,404
Jack's okay
And he's back

800
01:09:29,488 --> 01:09:31,948
Oh, yea
He's all right

801
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:36,453
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee

802
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:39,206
Jack is back now
Everyone sing

803
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:42,918
In the town of Halloween

804
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:46,588
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!

805
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:51,010
Happy Halloween!

806
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:55,139
Merry Christmas!

807
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:57,975
- What's this - What's
this - I haven't got a clue

808
01:09:58,059 --> 01:10:00,269
- What's this
- Why, it's completely new

809
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:02,395
What's this
Must be a Christmas thing

810
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:05,274
- What's this
- It's really very strange

811
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:16,077
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

812
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:17,953
What's this
What's this

813
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:26,462
Careful, my precious jewel.

814
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:58,034
My dearest friend
if you don't mind

815
01:10:58,118 --> 01:11:04,417
I'd like to join you by your side

816
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,797
Where we can gaze
into the stars

817
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:15,176
And sit together

818
01:11:15,261 --> 01:11:19,431
Now and forever

819
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:22,851
For it is plain

820
01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:27,023
As anyone can see

821
01:11:27,105 --> 01:11:33,154
We're simply meant to be
