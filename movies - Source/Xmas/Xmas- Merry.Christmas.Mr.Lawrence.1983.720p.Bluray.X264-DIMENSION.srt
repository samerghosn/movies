1
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,903
- What does he want?
- I'll find out.

2
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:58,949
You don't have to take orders
from this man, you know.

3
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,535
Well, I'm the liaison officer.
So I'm liaising.

4
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:05,206
You're sure you know what
you're doing, old man?

5
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:07,541
Yes, and what ever this is,
it's important to him...

6
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,835
that I see it.

7
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:14,548
- I'll keep an eye on them, sir.
- Very good.

8
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,930
Bastards!

9
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:42,910
MERRY CHRISTMAS
MR. LAWRENCE

10
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:29,808
A disgraceful incident has occurred.

11
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,645
I will deal with it myself.

12
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:37,941
If it's a secret, why show me?

13
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:42,279
I want you to witness it.

14
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,824
- Know what he did?
- This Dutch soldier?

15
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,247
Not him, he was in a cell
for stealing bananas.

16
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:56,668
- The Korean guard?
- Of course.

17
00:03:57,044 --> 00:04:00,714
Kanemoto, tell this British
officer what you did.

18
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,258
Kanemoto, come on!
Say it!

19
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:08,222
Say it! You, Kanemoto!

20
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:15,646
Why don't you?
Are you too ashamed?

21
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,697
You know now Lawrence?

22
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:31,703
Last night he stole into the
cell of that Dutch boy.

23
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:38,752
Kanemoto, show us how you used
this thing of yours.

24
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:44,049
Show us how you used it on this
white fellow's ass.

25
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:48,053
Just do it for us now!

26
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,059
Untie him.

27
00:04:56,353 --> 00:05:02,568
Kanemoto! Do it! Hear me? Now!

28
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:09,449
Has your dainty thing become
too shrunken to be potent?

29
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:16,957
If you can bugger him again
you may comit Harakiri.

30
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:19,376
Have you gone mad?

31
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:27,050
You haven't seen a Japanese
until you've seen Harakiri.

32
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:30,178
I don't want to watch it!

33
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,642
Do you want me to hate the Japanese?

34
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,395
I'll do it!

35
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,818
Stop it! For God's sake,
stop it!

36
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,029
Lawrence, out of the way!

37
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:51,074
Haven't you shamed him enough?

38
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:56,371
Shame? He didn't even resist
being raped!

39
00:05:58,248 --> 00:05:59,958
Can you get up?

40
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,630
You're Dutch, aren't you?

41
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,842
De Jong, sir. Karel De Jong.

42
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,970
Now you'd better
sit down.

43
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,890
Now tell me
what happened.

44
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:22,439
In the beginning he came in to
dress this wound of mine.

45
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,025
For three days, every night.

46
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:32,657
He was, he was very kind.

47
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:39,414
But then last night, he suddenly...

48
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:44,503
Captain Yonoi! This is
Colonel Lawrence! Come quickly!

49
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,227
Kanemoto, I'll assist you.

50
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:04,439
Stop it!

51
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,527
Watch this!

52
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,530
Sergeant Hara...

53
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:18,578
Attention!

54
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:36,972
What's going on?

55
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,308
Sergeant Hara is going
to execute this man!

56
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:45,063
- This is not your concern.
- Then why bring me here?

57
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,944
- Who ordered this execution?
- This is not an execution.

58
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:56,366
Kanemoto is trying to comit
suicide for his crime.

59
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,537
And you ignore it?

60
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,248
Out of compassion.

61
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:08,879
His family is poor. If we deem
his death an accident...

62
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:13,216
they will get a pension.

63
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:17,387
What crime has he committed?

64
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,598
Let me report in private.

65
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:37,073
I've no time now. I'm due at a
military trial in Batavia.

66
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:40,243
Make your report later.

67
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,274
This way, sir.

68
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,959
- Captain Yonoi is here, sir.
- Let him in.

69
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,892
I'm Captain Yonoi.
I'm here for the trial.

70
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:52,065
We are very honoured to have
Captain Yonoi here today.

71
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:56,361
This is Colonel Fujimura,
President of the court.

72
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:02,534
- Pleased to serve with you.
- Good to have you here.

73
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,371
My name is Iwata.

74
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:11,000
The military situation here
is very serious.

75
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:15,088
Your service is important.

76
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:24,013
Gentlemen, the defendant is
a very difficult man.

77
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,275
All rise to attention!

78
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,018
Before the court is the
case of Jack Celliers.

79
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:15,064
Your name is given
as Jack Celliers.

80
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:17,400
Is that correct?

81
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:22,780
- Why shouldn't it be?
- What do you mean by that?

82
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:29,871
Answer the question!
Is your name Jack Celliers?

83
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:33,750
I've answered that question
about a hundred times.

84
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:40,423
Read the charges.

85
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:45,094
The prisoner, Jack Celliers,
a Major in the British army...

86
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:49,098
parachuted with four men into...

87
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,104
the Banten Valley.

88
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:58,107
They waged guerilla warfare.

89
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:02,111
On October 16, they attacked a
Japanese transport unit.

90
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:09,118
They took ammunition, killed
PFC Takeshi Tazaki, then...

91
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:14,499
they wounded Corp. Sawafuji
and four others.

92
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:20,004
His crime is covered by
martial law regulations.

93
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:26,135
We recommend a death penalty...

94
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:31,474
as prescribed in section 1

95
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:40,817
Accordingly, he should receive
the death penalty...

96
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:46,948
as prescribed in Section 1,
chapter 5 of the regulations.

97
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:53,496
How do you plead?

98
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:58,167
Not guilty. I'm not a criminal.

99
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,838
I am a soldier in
His Majesty's army.

100
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,467
One month ago I came out of the
Djaja Sempoer mountains.

101
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:10,847
I surrendered to Colonel Utsumi
of the Imperial Japanese Army.

102
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:16,144
I was imprisioned at Sukabumi.
3 days in solitary confinement.

103
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:20,106
Then I was questioned
by Lieutenant Ito.

104
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:23,359
He asked me my name and
rank and I told him.

105
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:28,197
Then Lieutenant Ito asked me:
"Is that true?"

106
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,203
I replied: "of course, it is.
I'm with the British army. "

107
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:37,373
Do you mean you would never
give a false name?

108
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,918
Let me ask you something.

109
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,005
Why would a man who's about to
die give a false name?

110
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:48,426
A Japanese soldier who's caught
would give a false name.

111
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:55,016
But then, a Japanese soldier would
never submit to being caught.

112
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,435
- He would prefer to die.
- But then, I'm not a Japanese.

113
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:02,565
Why did you refuse to tell
about yourself?

114
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,152
You must tell us your
past history.

115
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,362
My past is my business.

116
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:20,791
What was the reason for
giving yourself up?

117
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,668
You've just read it,
haven't you?

118
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:27,089
Your men said they'd kill the villagers
if I didn't give myself up.

119
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:33,429
- How many men did you have?
- None.

120
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,890
- Liar!
- I'm not a liar.

121
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:42,021
I had four men but they
were killed in action.

122
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:46,901
We know you led a group
of native soldiers.

123
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,153
We are bound to find them
sooner or later.

124
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:51,614
Why don't you confess your crime?

125
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,242
I've never led natives.

126
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,912
Look, why don't I have a defense counsel?

127
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,916
Exactly what kind of trial
are you giving me?

128
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,251
This whole thing's a bloody farce.

129
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:10,967
Erase all those remarks.

130
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:17,264
May I question him?

131
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:27,942
"To be or not to be.
"That is the question,

132
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,615
The prosecutor said that you
landed in Java by parachute.

133
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,618
Under whose orders?

134
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,830
Under the orders of the
Supreme Commander of...

135
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:42,873
His Majesty's forces in India.

136
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,710
Were you not under the
commander of Java?

137
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,672
You know I came to Java in August.

138
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:53,801
You know the commander in
Java was captured in March.

139
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:57,680
- You know Captain...
- Captain Yonoi.

140
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:04,311
If this man fought in India
as a legitimate soldier.

141
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:09,859
Then we must treat him as
a prisioner of war.

142
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:14,071
- We have no proof.
- I believe this man.

143
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:19,660
What were you asked when captured?

144
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,788
Were you asked how you were
intended to conduct a...

145
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,790
guerilla war with only five men?

146
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:29,837
Well, I suspect they thought we
were an advance party...

147
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:32,882
for a new campaign presumably
the invasion of Java!

148
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,010
They wanted to know dates
and places.

149
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,262
What did you say?

150
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:40,431
I said I thought they
were crackers.

151
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:41,474
What?

152
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:45,519
- I thought they were mad.
- And then?

153
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:51,275
Then they stopped feeding me,
and started beating me.

154
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,320
Can you prove that you
were beaten?

155
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:15,382
Put on your shirt!

156
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,094
No more questions!

157
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:39,073
The court retires.

158
00:17:55,965 --> 00:18:01,345
A delay this long usually means
a firing squad.

159
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:07,393
But nowadays new officers like
to try out their swords...

160
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,478
on white necks.

161
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:35,838
The verdict in your case
has been postponed.

162
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,923
We shall wait for
further instructions.

163
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:56,066
Stand up.

164
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,553
Good day for it, sir.

165
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:27,514
Yes.

166
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:32,686
You have a family waiting
for you, Corporal?

167
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:39,818
Wife and two kids, sir.
One with, one without.

168
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,074
How's about yourself, sir?

169
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:12,017
- Tea?
- Yes, I'd like that.

170
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,927
The prisoner, sir!

171
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:09,658
Can you guess
what I'm thinking?

172
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:14,746
Yes, I think so. Can you?

173
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,783
He's rebellious to the end.

174
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:56,788
You have been found
guilty on all charges.

175
00:21:57,372 --> 00:22:01,710
The sentence will be carried
out without delay.

176
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,880
Make him ready!

177
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,217
- I don't need any help.
- Leave him alone!

178
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,138
I've practiced walking for years.

179
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,273
Firing position!

180
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,702
I don't need that.

181
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:42,501
The blind fold is for
the firing squad!

182
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:47,422
So they don't look into
your eyes as you die.

183
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,761
Let him be.

184
00:22:57,516 --> 00:23:00,018
Prepare to fire!

185
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:06,650
Firing positions!

186
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:13,657
Fire!

187
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,084
That's a good one!

188
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:39,683
Sergeant Hara...

189
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:43,770
Sergeant Hara...

190
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:53,863
Lawrence, can't you let me sleep?

191
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:55,782
I'm sorry.

192
00:23:56,783 --> 00:24:02,038
I was just now riding on top of
Marlene Dietrich's tummy.

193
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:04,040
In a hideway in Manchuria!

194
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,425
I must talk to you.

195
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:19,389
Why's he here?

196
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:25,061
I want you to protect him.

197
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:26,771
Why?

198
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,774
My men heard about him.

199
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:35,447
- I told you not to talk!
- I didn't.

200
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:42,120
There were Japanese soldiers
and Korean guards there.

201
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:44,873
You accuse Japanese...?

202
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:48,752
It was probably the guards.

203
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,422
Don't you realize that everyone
is going to know?

204
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:55,091
I understood.

205
00:24:56,051 --> 00:25:00,764
Will all your men want to
bugger him now?

206
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,309
Is it true that English men
are all homosexuals?

207
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:06,269
Don't be stupid.

208
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:11,107
Listen, I need your help.

209
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,111
A Japanese never asks help
from an enemy.

210
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:19,741
Hey, are you a homosexual?

211
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:25,538
He says you are a homosexual.
Are you?

212
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,624
No sir. I am not.

213
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,709
He's not.

214
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:32,837
You all fear homosexuality!

215
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:35,924
A samurai doesn't fear it.

216
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:41,805
Wars create friendships
amongst men.

217
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:47,727
That hardly means that all
soldiers become homosexual.

218
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:53,817
You are not soldiers,
you are prisoners!

219
00:25:55,568 --> 00:26:00,824
So you lack discipline,
and you beg favours.

220
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:04,702
- Shame!
- Sergeant Hara...

221
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:11,543
I've nothing to be ashamed of.

222
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,881
A new prisioner has arrived.

223
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,011
Another queer's here!

224
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:33,064
I've brought a prisoner from
the military prison in Batavia.

225
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:42,073
I'm Sergeant Gengo Hara.
I'll take over.

226
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,876
Your name and rank?

227
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,589
Celliers, Jack. Major,
British Army.

228
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:01,342
Celliers? Jack Celliers?
Straffer Jack?

229
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:05,013
Good morning, Colonel.

230
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,062
You bastard!

231
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:17,400
Stop it!

232
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:28,828
No! Stop it! Stop it!

233
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:38,296
You! Officer! Do you
know this man?

234
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:42,925
We served together in Libya.
We fought the Germans.

235
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,261
Take him to the sick bay.

236
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,898
What kind of a man is he?

237
00:27:56,981 --> 00:27:59,317
Is he a close friend of yours?

238
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:02,904
No. He's not a close friend, no.

239
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:07,909
- What kind of a soldier is he?
- He's a fine soldier.

240
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:12,955
We had a nickname for him
in the 8th Army.

241
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:14,957
We called him straffer Jack.

242
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,584
Straffer is a kind of um...

243
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:21,964
it's very difficult to translate.
Straffer is um...

244
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,343
This is astonishingly
difficult sometimes.

245
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:29,597
In any case,
he was a soldier's soldier.

246
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,726
Why are you so
interested in him?

247
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:43,945
- What did the doctor say?
- I didn't talk to the doctor.

248
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:45,613
You fool!

249
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,324
Lawrence, I want him in good
health as quickly as possible.

250
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:50,576
That's an order!

251
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:54,580
You don't have to order me
to look after a sick man.

252
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:58,125
I will send the Japanese
medic to see him.

253
00:28:58,209 --> 00:29:02,839
Why are you so concerned
about Major Celliers?

254
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:04,966
Send our medic.

255
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,311
- The commanding officer, sir.
- Let him in.

256
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,239
You spend more time with these
Japs than you do with...

257
00:29:28,322 --> 00:29:29,323
your own men.

258
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:33,536
I called Colonel Lawrence here.
Now from you...

259
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,289
I want the names of all
prisoners who are informed...

260
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:38,374
on the subject of armaments
and ammunition.

261
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:40,376
Who are the experts here?

262
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:43,963
I am not required under
International Law...

263
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,923
to furnish the enemy with
any information.

264
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:49,760
This is not North Africa.
We are not Germans!

265
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,929
There is no Geneva Convention here.

266
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:56,017
If you do not follow my orders,
I will have to replace you.

267
00:29:56,183 --> 00:30:00,021
Replace me?
What are you talking about?

268
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:01,939
Replace me with whom?

269
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:08,404
Do you know what
he's talking about?

270
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:09,905
No sir. I don't know.

271
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:14,702
You promised to improve
our food ration.

272
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:16,829
You eat the same as we eat.

273
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:20,583
Give me the names of your experts.

274
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:25,588
No, Captain Yonoi.
I will not.

275
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:45,066
Captain Yonoi.
Please try to understand.

276
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:48,444
Group Captain Hicksley
is an honourable man.

277
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:52,698
"They are all, all honourable men. "

278
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:57,495
As commanding officer, I prefer
another honourable man.

279
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:54,760
Lawrence, this armaments thing.

280
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:59,140
I think we can string it out
for quite sometime, don't you?

281
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:02,393
I mean, young Tojo will never
notice the difference.

282
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:10,359
They're not fools, you know,
sir, the Japanese.

283
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:14,488
They know how badly the war's
going for them.

284
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,657
A couple months, it could
all be over.

285
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:19,660
Then why not try and stay alive
for a couple of months?

286
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:21,495
Sir, I know these people...

287
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:25,833
I wish you'd be guided
by my knowledge.

288
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,836
I know these people, too.
They're the enemy.

289
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,005
And you're a British soldier.

290
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:36,927
You know they once
beat the Russians.

291
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:39,889
Really?
What school did you go to?

292
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:41,640
Winchester.

293
00:32:57,948 --> 00:32:59,950
Who's looking after Major Celliers?

294
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,120
- I am, sir.
- How's he coming along?

295
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:06,457
He's a tough man.
Anyone else would have been dead.

296
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,542
When will he be up and
about, do you think?

297
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:10,628
Christ, I had to give him
a sedative, so he'll sleep...

298
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,088
most of the time. I'd say a
couple of weeks.

299
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:16,425
- Good. Where's the big chief?
- I'll get him for you.

300
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,511
All right, you malingerers.
Now hear this!

301
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:23,057
Colonel Lawrence is going to
stay here for a few nights.

302
00:33:23,307 --> 00:33:26,935
- He's one of those, mate!
- Want my boxing gloves?

303
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:19,279
- Where is he?
- Sleeping.

304
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,449
Take me.

305
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:51,228
Why was he captured?

306
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:54,565
He wasn't.
He surrendered.

307
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:06,326
Why does Capt. Yonoi want to
make him commanding officer?

308
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:11,165
- I don't know.
- Answer me Lawrence...

309
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:15,878
Because he's a born leader.

310
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:22,342
Why are you still alive?

311
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,306
I'd admire you more if
you killed yourself.

312
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:30,225
A good officer like you!

313
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:35,647
How can you stand the shame?

314
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:42,321
We don't call it shame.

315
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:51,330
Being a prisoner is one of
the fortunes of war.

316
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:55,208
We surely aren't happy
being prisoners.

317
00:35:56,418 --> 00:36:02,049
We want to escape.
We want to fight you.

318
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:06,386
That's just quibbling.

319
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:12,684
No! We want to win.
This camp isn't the end.

320
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:17,898
We won't kill ourselves.
That's the coward's way out.

321
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,693
You're just scared of dying!

322
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:24,571
Don't wake the patients.

323
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,744
When I was 12, I visited
the shrine in my village.

324
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:34,206
I offered my life to the Emperor.

325
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:38,627
I have already died for my country.

326
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:45,300
Yes. But you're not dead are you?

327
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,189
It's all right, Jack.
It's Lawrence.

328
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:01,316
It's all right. You're fine.
It's all right.

329
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:04,403
Sergeant Hara isn't
going to hurt you.

330
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:07,572
Sergeant Hara isn't
going to hurt anyone.

331
00:37:12,494 --> 00:37:17,290
What on earth possessed Yonoi
to save me do you think? - I don't know.

332
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:20,168
What did he say, Lawrence?

333
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:30,554
What a funny face!
Beautiful eyes, though.

334
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:18,894
Make him well.
Cure him quickly.

335
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,571
All right?

336
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:16,618
What's that bloody noise!
What's the matter with them?

337
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,663
They're trying to become
super human gods.

338
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:22,666
They live in the past,
these fellows.

339
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,585
God help them, Lawrence.

340
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,006
And that's our Captain Yonoi's
voice, isn't it?

341
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:32,175
He's been screaming
his head off...

342
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:34,219
ever since you got here.

343
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:36,304
If he's got something
on his mind...

344
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:38,306
why doesn't he come out with it?

345
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,350
I rather think he is.

346
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:43,353
Perhaps we're both
on the same ladder.

347
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,655
Are you okay?

348
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:58,201
It was a nightmare.

349
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:07,770
Ueki is worried about these
training sessions...

350
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:11,774
that they are too violent.

351
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:16,571
Sir, your shouts make
the prisoners uneasy.

352
00:41:16,863 --> 00:41:20,116
Lawrence has come to me.

353
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:22,744
- Lawrence is here?
- Outside.

354
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:33,796
Is it true that our shouts
disturb the prisoners?

355
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:36,424
Yes, yes, sir. It is.

356
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,595
And you? Do you feel uneasy?

357
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:47,393
Well, I find the noise irritating,
but it doesn't make me uneasy.

358
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:51,105
However, some of the sick men...

359
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:58,112
- That sick officer, too?
- Major Celliers? Yes.

360
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:02,408
I do not want the prisoners
to become upset.

361
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,203
Thank you, Captain Yonoi.

362
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:16,506
How wonderful it
would have been...

363
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:19,259
if we could have
invited all of you...

364
00:42:19,425 --> 00:42:22,470
to a gathering under
our cherry trees.

365
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:24,597
Yes.

366
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,812
My fondest memory of
Japan is the snow.

367
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:33,773
The trees covered with snow.

368
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:40,822
- It was snowing on that day.
- What day?

369
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:47,161
Don't you know?
February 26, 1936.

370
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,164
Yes... yes.

371
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:56,004
I was in Tokyo that day.
You too?

372
00:42:56,254 --> 00:43:02,510
No. I had been sent off to
Manchuria 3 months before.

373
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:05,847
I was not there
for the uprising.

374
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:09,017
You regret that?

375
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:12,895
My comrades were executed.

376
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:16,858
I was left to die after them.

377
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:24,323
I see. So you were one of the
shining young officers...

378
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:41,674
And bring that
sick officer Lawrence.

379
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:50,600
Attention.

380
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:53,853
Salute.

381
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:06,491
Eyes right.

382
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:11,537
Lawrence, where is
that sick officer?

383
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:15,666
- The doctor stopped him.
- You stopped him, Lawrence.

384
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,627
He is very weak.

385
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:22,632
Where is the victim?
Let him step forward.

386
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:31,349
We're here on your orders.

387
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:36,062
We're under no obligation to
watch this execution.

388
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:43,611
If you had any humanity left in
you, sir, you would let us leave.

389
00:44:43,986 --> 00:44:46,906
Any of you who can't watch it...

390
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:48,908
keep your eyes shut or turn round!

391
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:52,620
But I will no permit you
to leave this site!

392
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:55,331
Allied officers do not turn
their back on the enemy.

393
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:16,352
Ready...

394
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:14,035
Raise your head.

395
00:46:52,364 --> 00:46:55,701
Oh, my God, he's bitten his
tongue off, for Christ's sake.

396
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:58,204
Roll him over.

397
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:01,540
Christ. He's swallowed a part
of his tongue.

398
00:47:13,928 --> 00:47:16,722
- Pay your respects.
- Come on, lads.

399
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:21,727
- Not yet.
- We want to pay our respects!

400
00:47:21,894 --> 00:47:25,815
- You Jap lover!
- Stop them.

401
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:30,861
You have no respect for anything!
Not even your own men!

402
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:33,906
You're wrong, Captain Yonoi!
By God, you're wrong.

403
00:47:34,073 --> 00:47:37,076
You are to say nothing
about today's execution...

404
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:39,078
or this soldier's death
until it is announced.

405
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:44,250
If you're so bloody right,
you've got nothing to hide!

406
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:48,254
We must wait for the
official announcement.

407
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,798
This is the right way.
I am right.

408
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,425
Colonel Lawrence,
am I not right?

409
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:59,098
No. No, Captain Yonoi.
You're wrong.

410
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:02,434
We're all wrong.

411
00:48:07,189 --> 00:48:12,111
I order all prisoners,
each and everyone of you...

412
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,992
not to go out to the fields
today or tomorrow.

413
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,080
Instead, you shall stay inside
your barracks for 48 hours...

414
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,916
and undergo "gyo".

415
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:32,715
You'll observe gyo for 48 hours.
There will be no eating

416
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:35,676
or drinking. Is this clear?

417
00:48:42,016 --> 00:48:43,976
What the hell's gyo?

418
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:47,438
It's a Japanese cure for laziness.

419
00:48:47,646 --> 00:48:50,107
Laziness, Jesus Christ!

420
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:52,651
Why don't you listen?

421
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,155
He means spiritual laziness.
And he believes...

422
00:48:56,196 --> 00:48:58,157
that if he takes away the food
and the water, then he also...

423
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,284
takes away the nourishment
for the laziness!

424
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:03,162
You don't believe that bullshit,
do you?

425
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:04,371
I don't flaping know!

426
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:07,666
Sir, I will tell you something
that may surprise you.

427
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,793
If we do it, he'll do it!

428
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:45,162
- Peasant!
- Here.

429
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:48,165
- Mills!
- Here.

430
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,210
- Ibbertson
- I'm hungry.

431
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:55,130
- Adams.
- Eggs and bacon, mate.

432
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:59,510
- Baxter!
- Steak and kidney-pie.

433
00:50:01,303 --> 00:50:06,225
Put up with it for another
13 or 14 hours. You can do it!

434
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,020
How about giving us a wee whisky?

435
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:13,690
What about a double whisky?

436
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,360
De Jong!

437
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:21,573
Next! Who's next?

438
00:50:21,698 --> 00:50:23,033
He's dead.

439
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:30,749
He's not dead!
He'll be back in a few days!

440
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,918
De Jong has been killed!

441
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:40,092
De Jong has been killed!
De Jong has been killed!

442
00:50:42,302 --> 00:50:43,512
Thank you.

443
00:50:44,304 --> 00:50:45,848
Next.

444
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:47,933
- Craig!
- Here.

445
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:51,061
- Smith!
- Yes.

446
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:52,604
Celliers!

447
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:05,033
- Where is Major Celliers?
- He said he'd be back soon.

448
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,744
One man is missing.
Major Celliers.

449
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:10,497
Look, he'll be here in a moment.
Just mark us all here.

450
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:13,917
I can't do that. I'll have to
report him missing.

451
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,253
No, please.
Just a few minutes!

452
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,633
Celliers?

453
00:51:22,634 --> 00:51:23,927
That's right.

454
00:51:24,636 --> 00:51:26,930
What are those flowers for?

455
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:29,474
Food.

456
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:31,143
Food?

457
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:37,024
I wish they were white, but these
were all that I could find.

458
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:39,067
In memory of De Jong.

459
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,572
It might be nice if you were to
say something, Lawrence.

460
00:51:56,043 --> 00:51:59,046
Our father who art in Heaven,
Hallowed by thy name

461
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:03,342
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done

462
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:06,678
Give us this day our daily bread

463
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:13,685
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive them that...

464
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,313
- Give me another.
- And lead us not into temp...

465
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:24,863
What are you doing?
We must observe the gyo.

466
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:26,698
What the hell are you doing, Major?

467
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:31,661
I gave Major Celliers
permission, sir.

468
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,832
Ah, changed our tune, have we?
What happened to the gyo?

469
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:40,337
- What are all these flowers for?
- In memory of De Jong, sir.

470
00:52:40,504 --> 00:52:44,466
He didn't give me permission, sir.
And it was my idea.

471
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:46,176
Really?

472
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,471
Lawrence, over here.

473
00:52:57,562 --> 00:53:02,400
You knew of Yonoi's plan to
replace me as commander?

474
00:53:02,484 --> 00:53:03,985
Yes, sir, I did.

475
00:53:04,236 --> 00:53:06,321
May I ask why you
didn't tell me?

476
00:53:06,571 --> 00:53:08,907
It's still only a rumor, sir.

477
00:53:13,453 --> 00:53:15,372
You don't like me, do you?

478
00:53:16,081 --> 00:53:17,707
Captain Yonoi doesn't like you.

479
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:20,710
I don't know what to
make of you, Lawrence.

480
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:26,758
You've either very clever, or
you're bloody stupid.

481
00:53:26,842 --> 00:53:28,468
But I tell you one thing.

482
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:31,346
I will never give Yonoi any
information about officers...

483
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:36,351
or armaments.
You understand that?

484
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:40,355
And I will never resign as
commander of this camp.

485
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:42,899
You can tell that to Yonoi.
Never!

486
00:54:31,323 --> 00:54:33,283
Bloody hell!
It's an inspection!

487
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:38,413
Don't waste the food.
Keep eating it.

488
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:40,540
I'll take the responsibility.
And keep singing.

489
00:54:40,749 --> 00:54:45,211
Rock of Ages,
cleft for me

490
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:49,549
Let me hide
Myself in Thee

491
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:53,762
Let the water
And the Blood

492
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:55,388
Come on now...

493
00:54:55,555 --> 00:55:01,102
From Thy riven side which
Flow'd Be of sin the

494
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:03,355
For God's sake get those bloody
flowers off De Jong's bed!

495
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:07,859
No, leave those on.

496
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:16,868
I will inspect all of you to see.
You scum!

497
00:55:17,077 --> 00:55:18,870
You aren't eating?

498
00:55:26,252 --> 00:55:30,048
If you've got anything
hidden away in here...

499
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:33,843
You all have "Manju" cakes!

500
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:42,602
Talk! Damn it!
Who brought them in here?

501
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:50,902
Flowers!

502
00:55:58,034 --> 00:55:59,994
Are you crazy?

503
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:05,500
Well I've tried the "Manju".
And I've tried the flowers.

504
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:08,419
And I think the flowers
taste better.

505
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:20,223
Stop resisting!

506
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,172
Stop it.

507
00:57:00,096 --> 00:57:01,055
Shut up.

508
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:05,018
What was that singing?

509
00:57:05,143 --> 00:57:08,229
They're practicing for christmas.

510
00:57:08,354 --> 00:57:10,023
It's for a funeral!

511
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:30,501
Who do you think you are?
Are you an evil spirit?

512
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:34,464
Yes, and one of yours I hope.

513
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,976
To the cell!

514
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:04,535
He's not an evil spirit.
He's a human being!

515
00:58:05,745 --> 00:58:10,792
Get rid of your superstitions!

516
00:58:15,463 --> 00:58:18,174
We found this radio!

517
00:58:24,555 --> 00:58:30,186
You stayed here, so I'm sure we
can count on you to tell us.

518
00:58:33,189 --> 00:58:34,732
My God!

519
00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:42,198
- Who's there?
- The key!

520
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,867
I can't give it to you.

521
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:48,162
- It's Captain's orders.
- Isn't he coming?

522
00:58:48,246 --> 00:58:51,249
- Does he come here?
- Every night.

523
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:57,130
Give me the key.

524
00:58:59,048 --> 00:59:00,133
Take this!

525
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:39,166
Lawrence, we're going walkies.

526
01:01:41,293 --> 01:01:46,382
Listen, we're getting out
of here! On my shoulder.

527
01:01:46,424 --> 01:01:48,384
Jack, look, we can't...

528
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:53,639
The tube line doesn't
come this far.

529
01:01:53,889 --> 01:01:58,269
Everything's all right. Yonoi
gave me a Persian rug.

530
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:01,021
It's all right for you.

531
01:02:07,695 --> 01:02:11,031
I can't get my legs to work.

532
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:15,744
Do you mind if I take the guard?
He's a lot lighter.

533
01:02:32,344 --> 01:02:36,265
This is quite ridiculous.

534
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:44,481
I presume you've come
for your carpet.

535
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:15,888
Why don't you fight me? If you
defeat me, you will be free.

536
01:03:23,854 --> 01:03:25,731
I'll kill him.

537
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:39,370
I think he's taken a bit of
a shine to you.

538
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,125
To the cells!

539
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:49,213
Please forgive me, Captain.

540
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:54,301
I want to apologize for my
behaviour with death.

541
01:03:56,971 --> 01:04:00,140
- Are you able?
- Yes.

542
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:02,935
Why try to kill him?

543
01:04:04,812 --> 01:04:09,316
That man is a devil! He will
destroy your spirit!

544
01:05:16,175 --> 01:05:20,721
How very straight you sit!
I'm very impressed with you!

545
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:25,976
I'd sit even straighter if my
legs hadn't been wrecked.

546
01:05:32,316 --> 01:05:35,903
My batman. He committed
harakiri last night.

547
01:05:36,153 --> 01:05:39,406
The government doesn't pay a
death benefit in cases...

548
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:40,949
of suicide.

549
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:45,412
Sergeant Hara has advised me
to treat the death...

550
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:47,414
as a death in action.

551
01:05:47,498 --> 01:05:50,626
This is my batman's
funeral ceremony.

552
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:53,212
How very thoughtful of
Sergeant Hara.

553
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:57,966
In your case, Sergeant Hara's
thoughtfulness means that...

554
01:05:58,175 --> 01:06:03,138
your wife will receive a pension
from British Army.

555
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:07,184
You awful bastard!

556
01:06:12,606 --> 01:06:14,149
Sit up!

557
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:36,338
This morning I put my seal on
Hara's recommendation.

558
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:41,218
It has gone to Batavia. We'll
get their answer quite soon.

559
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:43,220
It's only a formality.

560
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:47,224
Once the papers arrive, we can
put you to death.

561
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:51,228
Well that should please
Sergeant Hara.

562
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:53,855
You brought the radio
into the camp.

563
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:56,233
You know that is not true.

564
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:58,151
Not true?

565
01:07:00,862 --> 01:07:03,532
If you didn't do it, who did?

566
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:07,119
We must punish someone.

567
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:10,747
But why?

568
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,127
Would you rather punish
the wrong man...

569
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:18,088
than see the crime itself got
unsolved and unpunished?

570
01:07:18,296 --> 01:07:19,756
Yes.

571
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:27,097
You mean I'm to die because
you think if there's a crime...

572
01:07:28,306 --> 01:07:30,392
then it must be punished?

573
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,188
And it doesn't matter
who is punished?

574
01:07:42,779 --> 01:07:46,283
You're not by any chance a
Gilbert & Sullivan fan are you?

575
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:47,492
What?

576
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:54,332
You're not very funny really.

577
01:07:56,418 --> 01:07:58,128
I see.

578
01:08:01,131 --> 01:08:04,050
So I'm to die to preserve
your sense of order.

579
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:08,054
Yes. You understand, Lawrence.

580
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:11,224
You must die for me.

581
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:18,231
I understand.
But I won't die for you!

582
01:08:21,151 --> 01:08:24,613
Should I have lied about the
radio, Sergeant Hara?

583
01:08:26,323 --> 01:08:31,453
Should I have said I
brought it into the Camp?

584
01:08:32,037 --> 01:08:33,413
Sergeant Hara!

585
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:36,750
Stop it!

586
01:09:04,236 --> 01:09:06,196
It's your gods.

587
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,284
It's your bloody awful
stinking gods.

588
01:09:12,202 --> 01:09:14,663
They made you what you are.

589
01:09:15,997 --> 01:09:19,876
May they rot in whatever filthy
hell they came from!

590
01:09:20,752 --> 01:09:25,006
Damn them!
Damn your flaping gods!

591
01:09:28,385 --> 01:09:30,345
To the cells!

592
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,641
Wait!

593
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:42,357
What will happen to
Major Celliers?

594
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,359
That is none of your business.

595
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,990
Oh, you wouldn't execute
Major Celliers...

596
01:09:50,156 --> 01:09:54,786
for a crime like bringing a
wireless into a ward.

597
01:09:55,078 --> 01:09:58,665
Your friend was a
disappointment to me.

598
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:02,961
Do you want to see him
before you die?

599
01:10:38,163 --> 01:10:39,706
What happened in there?

600
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:45,962
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

601
01:10:58,975 --> 01:11:01,061
Something's changed.

602
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,940
I read it all wrong.

603
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:10,695
Do you think you've had it?

604
01:11:12,155 --> 01:11:17,118
What? What?

605
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:20,121
Do you think you've had it?

606
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,335
Bloody radio!

607
01:11:34,385 --> 01:11:36,930
Yonoi said something strange.

608
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:42,644
He said: "I'm disappointed
in your friend. "

609
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:48,650
What is wrong with
them, Lawrence?

610
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:53,822
I don't know.

611
01:11:56,407 --> 01:11:59,077
They were a nation of
anxious people.

612
01:12:00,537 --> 01:12:03,790
And they could do
nothing individually.

613
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:09,754
So they went mad, en masse.

614
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:18,179
God I wish they'd
stop hitting me.

615
01:12:28,398 --> 01:12:33,194
I don't want to hate any
individual Japanese.

616
01:12:46,624 --> 01:12:47,583
John.

617
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,045
John Lawrence.

618
01:12:54,632 --> 01:12:56,509
Good night, John Lawrence.

619
01:13:04,934 --> 01:13:07,437
What's up John?

620
01:13:11,065 --> 01:13:13,234
I was dreaming.

621
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:17,822
I was dreaming about this woman.

622
01:13:19,574 --> 01:13:23,077
Christ, sounds like
she cut it off.

623
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:32,670
I only met her twice...

624
01:13:55,401 --> 01:13:57,278
I met her only twice.

625
01:13:58,488 --> 01:14:01,032
Just before the fall
of Singapore.

626
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:06,329
The streets were just
packed with people.

627
01:14:07,288 --> 01:14:12,543
Everybody was trying to get out.
They'd all gone mad.

628
01:14:13,628 --> 01:14:18,091
The hotels were packed.
Everybody was screaming.

629
01:14:20,635 --> 01:14:22,553
And there was this woman,
who was different from...

630
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:28,559
all the rest, really.

631
01:14:29,352 --> 01:14:31,687
She didn't seem to
be frightened.

632
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,359
I was frightened.

633
01:14:39,529 --> 01:14:44,659
We talked about the war
and she kept saying...

634
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:50,665
"What's the truth?
I want to know the truth. "

635
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,503
Bloody silly question, really.

636
01:14:59,841 --> 01:15:05,596
We arranged to have breakfast
together the next morning.

637
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:09,851
And would you believe it?
I was whipped off.

638
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,858
The attack had started.
Japanese landed.

639
01:15:20,403 --> 01:15:23,614
Anyway I got back to the hotel
a few days later...

640
01:15:23,948 --> 01:15:26,701
and would you believe it?

641
01:15:28,411 --> 01:15:30,538
She was still there.

642
01:15:30,788 --> 01:15:36,669
She was standing in exactly
the same place...

643
01:15:37,169 --> 01:15:39,088
that I'd left her.

644
01:15:39,255 --> 01:15:43,843
It was as if she hadn't move
since I walked away.

645
01:15:46,053 --> 01:15:49,765
Like I'd run across the street
for a packet of cigarettes.

646
01:15:55,855 --> 01:15:58,899
I don't think I want to talk
about this anymore really.

647
01:16:34,477 --> 01:16:36,437
Jack, are you there?

648
01:16:38,814 --> 01:16:41,025
Yes, I suppose so.

649
01:16:42,651 --> 01:16:44,028
What's the matter?

650
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:49,617
The past, again and again.

651
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:53,704
You've got me at it now, John.

652
01:16:55,623 --> 01:16:59,001
Who is she? Your turn in
the confessional.

653
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:05,591
I've not had many romantic
interludes of great importance.

654
01:17:06,592 --> 01:17:09,804
My experience lies in the
field of betrayal.

655
01:17:18,604 --> 01:17:22,733
Ride, ride through the day

656
01:17:23,692 --> 01:17:28,781
Ride through the moonlight

657
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:36,622
Ride, ride through the night

658
01:17:37,873 --> 01:17:47,842
For far in the distance
Burns the fire

659
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:54,932
For someone who
Was waited long

660
01:18:01,355 --> 01:18:04,066
How do you find the time to
compose these songs?

661
01:18:04,483 --> 01:18:05,943
While you're at school.

662
01:18:18,956 --> 01:18:24,795
Lead us Heavently Father,
Lead us

663
01:18:25,004 --> 01:18:29,508
O'er the world's
Tempestuous sea

664
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:35,639
Guard us, guide us,
Keep us, feed us

665
01:18:35,806 --> 01:18:40,728
For we have no help
But Thee

666
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:46,817
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be

667
01:18:47,026 --> 01:18:50,613
Listen! They're a two
full notes off!

668
01:18:53,532 --> 01:19:00,456
Savior, breathe forgiveness
O'er us

669
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:04,585
All our weakness
Thou dost know

670
01:19:14,303 --> 01:19:16,639
- They're after me.
- But why?

671
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:20,392
- I laughed at them.
- I laughed, too!

672
01:19:20,434 --> 01:19:23,145
They hate me!
They like you.

673
01:19:25,981 --> 01:19:28,901
I won't let them touch you.
Go on home.

674
01:19:28,984 --> 01:19:31,820
Don't look back no matter what!
Understand?

675
01:19:32,946 --> 01:19:34,907
Do what I told you!

676
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,098
Be brave.

677
01:20:01,934 --> 01:20:03,394
Hey, hunchback!

678
01:20:03,936 --> 01:20:05,896
Get out of the way!

679
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,981
Don't run!

680
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:10,943
All right! You asked for it!

681
01:20:46,436 --> 01:20:49,356
What an earth do you think
you're doing!

682
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:08,375
Are you all right?

683
01:21:09,793 --> 01:21:12,921
You brought the pastor!
Why did you have to interfere?

684
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:14,923
Why didn't you go home
like I said?

685
01:21:15,215 --> 01:21:18,844
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

686
01:21:42,492 --> 01:21:44,244
Stop crying.

687
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,333
You hate me, too!

688
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,211
My brother was scared out of
his skin when the time came...

689
01:22:34,252 --> 01:22:36,254
for him to go to school.

690
01:22:36,296 --> 01:22:39,049
I was in the sixth form,
top of my class...

691
01:22:39,132 --> 01:22:41,051
and head of my house.

692
01:22:41,134 --> 01:22:44,680
Even so my brother lived every
day in absolute terror...

693
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:46,932
of being revealed...

694
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:57,025
Tomorrow's the initiation.
Any exemptions?

695
01:22:57,109 --> 01:23:00,362
One got a weak heart. But he's
got a doctor's certificate.

696
01:23:00,612 --> 01:23:05,033
I've got one who's blind as a bat.
He can't even pee straight.

697
01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:09,913
You've got a younger brother
in your house haven't you?

698
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,166
- What about him?
- Well, what about him?

699
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:18,004
- I was merely wondering if he was...
- He's perfectly all right.

700
01:23:18,255 --> 01:23:22,592
If there's any reason why you'd
want your brother excused...

701
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:28,390
It's awfully decent of you,
but there's no reason.

702
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:45,115
I knew my brother was
waiting for me.

703
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,952
But I couldn't conscience the
thought of the whole school...

704
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:51,079
setting eyes on his back.
It would reflect on me...

705
01:23:51,288 --> 01:23:55,333
and anything related to me
was not of the best.

706
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:59,045
I asked the science master
to let me stay after class...

707
01:23:59,129 --> 01:24:01,047
to make preparations for the
experiments the next day.

708
01:24:25,197 --> 01:24:29,409
Why was he born so beautiful?

709
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:33,371
Why was he born at all?

710
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:37,584
He's no bloody use to anyone

711
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:41,129
He's no bloody use at all

712
01:24:41,212 --> 01:24:43,089
Come on chaps!

713
01:24:47,302 --> 01:24:51,097
- What can you do?
- I hear he can sing.

714
01:24:51,222 --> 01:24:54,935
Oh he's one of those, is he?

715
01:24:55,101 --> 01:24:59,105
Come on sing!

716
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:04,027
Sing, Sing, Sing.
Sing. Sing. Sing.

717
01:25:04,194 --> 01:25:09,908
Ride, ride through the day

718
01:25:10,116 --> 01:25:17,832
Ride, ride through the night

719
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:28,093
For far in the distance
Burns the fire

720
01:25:28,259 --> 01:25:34,474
For someone who
Has waited along

721
01:25:52,242 --> 01:25:54,577
Jack, help me!

722
01:27:13,907 --> 01:27:15,950
So how did it go today?

723
01:27:17,327 --> 01:27:19,329
You mean you didn't see?

724
01:27:20,455 --> 01:27:23,416
No. I was in the science
laboratory all afternoon.

725
01:27:23,499 --> 01:27:28,129
I had to finish a job for
the science master.

726
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,506
I see.

727
01:27:33,218 --> 01:27:38,473
My brother never sang
another note... ever.

728
01:27:39,807 --> 01:27:42,936
He took over our father's
farm in due course.

729
01:27:43,394 --> 01:27:46,564
The last time I saw him was
at his wedding.

730
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:51,819
Over the years, I became,
you might say...

731
01:27:52,028 --> 01:27:55,990
a haunted person.

732
01:27:57,367 --> 01:28:01,746
I really wanted to see him again.
I never did.

733
01:28:03,331 --> 01:28:08,044
I was 32, eligible batchelor...

734
01:28:08,252 --> 01:28:14,258
a reasonably successful lawyer
and absolutely nothing.

735
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:21,808
When war broke out, God,
I embraced it.

736
01:28:22,141 --> 01:28:25,603
With some inexplicable sense
of relief and the kind...

737
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:32,235
of enthusiasm I hadn't shown for
anything for... I don't know.

738
01:28:33,027 --> 01:28:35,947
You should have joined the
Foreign Legion, Jack.

739
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:38,241
It would have been
an easier life.

740
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:40,952
That's the last thing I want.

741
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:47,792
- Here comes the milkman now.
- Two pints.

742
01:28:48,042 --> 01:28:51,295
Shouldn't we order an extra one.
It's Christmas remember?

743
01:28:51,379 --> 01:28:54,966
Well, it was lovely chatting
but I really must fly.

744
01:28:55,049 --> 01:28:57,301
It's not you. They've como
for me.

745
01:29:05,268 --> 01:29:07,645
How is it John you're
always wrong?

746
01:29:18,823 --> 01:29:21,743
- The prisoners, sir.
- Come in.

747
01:29:45,099 --> 01:29:50,354
So, Sergeant Hara,
you're human after all.

748
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:52,398
What?

749
01:29:54,484 --> 01:29:59,447
So Sergeant Hara,
you're human after all.

750
01:30:03,075 --> 01:30:08,080
Lawrence-San!
You know Father Christmas?

751
01:30:09,457 --> 01:30:11,542
What's he saying to us?

752
01:30:14,545 --> 01:30:18,174
Yes, Hara-San.

753
01:30:19,509 --> 01:30:25,056
Father Christmas means Santa Claus.

754
01:30:27,517 --> 01:30:30,895
I'm Father Christmas tonight.

755
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,775
Tonight, I'm Father Christmas.

756
01:30:37,276 --> 01:30:39,987
He thinks he's Santa Claus.

757
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:44,450
Father. Father Christmas.

758
01:30:47,495 --> 01:30:49,789
Father Christmas!

759
01:31:06,514 --> 01:31:08,808
Go with him.

760
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:15,398
You're both free.
He's pissed as a newt.

761
01:31:22,571 --> 01:31:25,491
Merry Christmas.

762
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,290
Thank you.

763
01:31:47,555 --> 01:31:51,851
Merry Kurisumasu, Lawrence!
Merry Kurisumasu!

764
01:31:54,228 --> 01:31:55,354
Bonkers.

765
01:32:09,118 --> 01:32:11,454
I brought the squad, sir.

766
01:32:27,803 --> 01:32:30,097
All present, sir.

767
01:32:37,396 --> 01:32:39,523
Lawrence! Why are you here?

768
01:32:39,732 --> 01:32:43,778
- I released him last night.
- Why?

769
01:32:44,195 --> 01:32:49,658
Yesterday I questioned a
Chinese prisoner.

770
01:32:50,326 --> 01:32:56,540
He confessed he smuggled the
radio into the sick bay.

771
01:32:56,749 --> 01:33:00,544
I had him executed.

772
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:05,466
I was wrong to blame Lawrence.

773
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:07,510
Why not report it!

774
01:33:07,593 --> 01:33:12,598
- I also released Jack Celliers.
- Without my permission?

775
01:33:13,682 --> 01:33:17,645
Sir, I was a little drunk.

776
01:33:18,687 --> 01:33:24,568
I didn't think Lawrence or
Celliers would do us harm.

777
01:33:25,653 --> 01:33:30,074
I didn't think you wanted
them to be martyrs.

778
01:33:31,659 --> 01:33:34,787
I'll take the consequences.

779
01:33:38,624 --> 01:33:40,209
Whatever happened to your
idea to replace me...

780
01:33:41,126 --> 01:33:45,214
with Major Celliers?

781
01:33:45,297 --> 01:33:46,715
Shut up, sir.

782
01:33:49,635 --> 01:33:54,306
Where is your report on armament's
experts here in the camp?

783
01:33:54,515 --> 01:33:58,894
- There are none here, sir.
- Not one among 600 men?

784
01:33:58,978 --> 01:34:02,564
Do you think you can get away
with such an obvious lie?

785
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:07,319
I'm told it is the Japanese
way to lie, sir.

786
01:34:07,653 --> 01:34:12,908
Very well! All prisioners
on parade in five minutes!

787
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,243
Dismissed!

788
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:23,711
All of them, I said.
Everyone!

789
01:34:38,684 --> 01:34:44,356
I'm sending prisoners to
Haruka to build an airstrip.

790
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:47,276
You'll take charge of them.
You leave in three days.

791
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:05,836
In the meantime you will be
confined to your room.

792
01:35:06,587 --> 01:35:08,047
Without sake.

793
01:36:02,643 --> 01:36:04,394
What are they up to now?

794
01:36:04,937 --> 01:36:10,734
I don't think it's anything.
Fairly routine stuff this.

795
01:36:35,175 --> 01:36:38,178
- Listen, John.
- What?

796
01:36:40,305 --> 01:36:41,723
I wish I could sing.

797
01:37:25,225 --> 01:37:26,977
It is beautiful.

798
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:35,068
My orders were explicit!

799
01:37:35,152 --> 01:37:38,363
I said that all prisoners
were to assemble!

800
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:41,491
You are not all here!

801
01:37:41,867 --> 01:37:43,994
We are all here, sir.

802
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:47,998
You! Come here!

803
01:37:56,715 --> 01:37:58,800
You lied to me again!

804
01:37:59,051 --> 01:38:04,348
I said all the prisoners!
Where are the men from the hospital?

805
01:38:04,514 --> 01:38:07,476
- They cannot possibly be moved!
- It's out of the question!

806
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:09,436
All prisoners will
assemble immediately!

807
01:38:09,561 --> 01:38:11,938
Get them! Now!
Get them!

808
01:39:53,957 --> 01:39:56,293
You're faking.

809
01:39:57,961 --> 01:40:00,880
You are not sick!

810
01:40:01,965 --> 01:40:07,554
Your spirits are sick!

811
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,942
Bastard! He's going to die!

812
01:40:56,102 --> 01:40:57,562
Captain Yanoi.

813
01:41:02,108 --> 01:41:03,443
He's dead!

814
01:41:06,946 --> 01:41:09,157
You! Get over here!

815
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:26,216
You...

816
01:41:28,093 --> 01:41:31,387
you and you...

817
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,974
Come here! Now!
Come here!

818
01:41:49,614 --> 01:41:52,700
As a representative of the
British Air Force how...

819
01:41:52,867 --> 01:41:57,997
many experts in weapons and
guns do you have in your group?

820
01:41:58,665 --> 01:42:00,125
None, sir!

821
01:42:04,754 --> 01:42:06,172
Death!

822
01:43:04,564 --> 01:43:07,358
You! Go back!
Go back!

823
01:43:08,151 --> 01:43:12,322
Go back! Go back!

824
01:43:50,151 --> 01:43:51,277
Stop it!

825
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:32,860
I am not as sentimental
as Captain Yonoi.

826
01:44:33,986 --> 01:44:37,615
Things will be different now.

827
01:45:31,085 --> 01:45:32,170
Detail...

828
01:45:37,633 --> 01:45:38,759
Attention!

829
01:45:39,886 --> 01:45:43,180
Platoon... attention!

830
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:49,186
Detail will advance by the left.
Quick march.

831
01:46:24,972 --> 01:46:26,891
Understand them do you,
Lawrence?

832
01:46:28,142 --> 01:46:32,229
If I were you,
I would commit harakiri.

833
01:49:36,455 --> 01:49:39,375
I'm pleased to see you.
Really Jack.

834
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:41,377
I wanted to come.

835
01:49:42,544 --> 01:49:44,505
Don't apologize.

836
01:49:47,716 --> 01:49:51,095
But I've wronged you, badly.

837
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:53,430
Help me water these things.

838
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:03,440
Look, I need to talk to you.

839
01:50:04,525 --> 01:50:06,610
Remember this one?

840
01:50:07,403 --> 01:50:08,946
You know I don't.

841
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:12,783
It flowers once every
five years. That's all.

842
01:50:15,285 --> 01:50:19,289
I'll be back before
it flowers again.

843
01:50:19,665 --> 01:50:21,583
Cross my heart.

844
01:50:24,503 --> 01:50:26,672
Let's go back to the house.

845
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:35,806
Ride, ride through the day

846
01:50:35,889 --> 01:50:41,061
Ride through the moonlight

847
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:48,986
Ride, ride through the night

848
01:50:52,656 --> 01:51:01,498
For far in the distance
Burns the fire

849
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:08,505
For someone who
Has waited long

850
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:46,473
I knew you would come,
Mr. Lawrence.

851
01:54:48,725 --> 01:54:55,315
- You've learned English.
- Yes very little. Please?

852
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:04,366
I very nearly didn't
get your message.

853
01:55:09,287 --> 01:55:11,248
It's tomorrow morning.

854
01:55:28,431 --> 01:55:31,309
Well if it was up to me.

855
01:55:31,434 --> 01:55:35,689
I'd release you today, send
you back to your family.

856
01:55:39,651 --> 01:55:44,948
Thank you.
I'm ready to die.

857
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:52,580
I don't understand.
My crimes were...

858
01:55:52,664 --> 01:55:55,625
no different from any
other soldier's.

859
01:56:14,185 --> 01:56:17,439
You are the victim of men who
think that they are right...

860
01:56:19,566 --> 01:56:24,154
just as one day, you
and Captain Yonoi...

861
01:56:32,829 --> 01:56:38,168
And the truth is, of course,
that nobody is right.

862
01:56:48,762 --> 01:56:51,014
Do you remember Jack Celliers?

863
01:56:52,557 --> 01:56:56,478
Strange.
I dreamed of him last night.

864
01:56:57,896 --> 01:56:59,522
Did you really?

865
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:13,787
Captain Yonoi gave me a lock
of Jack Celliers hair...

866
01:57:14,662 --> 01:57:20,543
and he asked me to take it to
his village in Japan.

867
01:57:23,755 --> 01:57:25,048
It's sad.

868
01:57:27,884 --> 01:57:30,303
That he was executed
after the war.

869
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:44,275
It was as if Celliers,
by his death...

870
01:57:45,610 --> 01:57:48,112
sowed a seed in Yonoi...

871
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:52,450
that we might all share
by its growth.

872
01:57:57,956 --> 01:58:00,959
Do you remember that Christmas?

873
01:58:03,044 --> 01:58:04,963
Yes.

874
01:58:11,928 --> 01:58:14,806
It was a good Christmas,
wasn't it?

875
01:58:16,724 --> 01:58:22,313
It was a wonderful Christmas.
You were drunk.

876
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:28,820
May I go on and on being drunk?

877
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,740
Sake is wonderful.

878
01:58:32,949 --> 01:58:37,829
Thank you. Father Christmas.
Thank you.

879
01:59:11,738 --> 01:59:16,868
There are times when victory
is very hard to take.

880
01:59:22,623 --> 01:59:24,042
Good bye. Hara-san.

881
01:59:27,962 --> 01:59:29,964
God bless you.

882
01:59:38,681 --> 01:59:40,183
Merry Christmas!

883
01:59:41,976 --> 01:59:45,271
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Lawrence!
