1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,100
DAYS TO CHRISTMAS

2
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,030
This, is what's been worrying me.

3
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,530
Turning sample number 76 from 1300 foot.

4
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,580
We finally found something else
than just plain rocks and dirt.

5
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,460
Have a look for yourself, sir.

6
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,850
Sawdust.. Hmm.

7
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,490
At first I thought we drilled into
some old tree or something.

8
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,830
But, no.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,320
This level of sawdust is 65 foot thick.

10
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,260
It doesn't add up,
it doesn't make sense.

11
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,740
It does.

12
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,150
In the olden days people used to
store ice by encasing it in sawdust.

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,120
Yea, but what do you mean,
what are you trying to say.

14
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,950
This mountain,
it's like a giant icebox.

15
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,020
For storing, what?

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,550
Drill deeper and you will see.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,800
Well, I am..

18
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,470
They're drilling as we speak

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,477
Make sure everyone
has one of these.

20
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:11,910
What are these?

21
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,540
It's the new safety instructions.

22
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,450
Wash behind the ears.

23
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,750
This is funny shooot!

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
Watch your mouth!

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,570
It's Christmas time.

26
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,150
So, let's act like it.

27
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,400
KORVATUNTURI mountain drill site

28
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,270
Someone's coming.

29
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,360
Mr. Green,
I think we found something.

30
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,130
Sample number 98.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,160
I think you were right.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,750
Always believe, always.

33
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,170
Gentlemen, listen up.

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,879
My dream, since my early childhood

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,670
Is about.. to come true.

36
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,570
I can proudly say,

37
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,990
That we are standing on the sacred grave..

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,190
Biggest burial mound in the world.

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,829
Someone's buried here.

40
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,670
This remarkable place puts
even the pyramids to shame.

41
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,590
It took the Saami-People of Lapland
centuries to build this mound,

42
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,770
You have 24 days to open it.

43
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,670
Roll up the sleeves, prepare the dynamite,
do what you do best!

44
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,020
They're going to blow it up.

45
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,310
We have a grave to rob.

46
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,030
Juuso!

47
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,660
Juuso, wait!

48
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,040
BORDER ZONE. NO ACCESS

49
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,870
I think Santa is buried up there.

50
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,350
Juuso, is Santa Claus dead?

51
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,890
What a baby.
You still believe in Santa?

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,730
Come on.

53
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,744
They've been lying to us.

54
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,910
To you.

55
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,860
Who was the Santa
who came to our house then?

56
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,570
Mr. Piiparinen.
Haven't you figured that out yet?

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,200
Do you think Dad knows?

58
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,910
Your dad pays him for it.

59
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,784
Don't you get it?

60
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,430
This whole Christmas thing
is just a bluff.

61
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,700
THE TRUTH ABOUT SANTA CLAUS

62
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,130
THE FIRST SANTA CLAUS

63
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,880
WHO'S BEEN NAUGHTY?

64
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,900
Santa walking barefoot in the snow.

65
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,970
Ancient Santa by his cauldron.

66
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,760
DAY TO CHRISTMAS

67
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,430
Pietari!

68
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,390
Wake up, Son!

69
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,040
Pietari! Are you awake?

70
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,040
Yeah, yeah!

71
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,340
Then go and get cleaned up!

72
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,020
Vuppe, bad boy.
You were supposed to keep watch.

73
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,900
Dad!

74
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,400
Come here, Dad!

75
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,650
Come inside if you
have something to say.

76
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,410
I don't want to.

77
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,740
You shouldn't be out there alone.

78
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,410
Really, I've got something
important to tell you.

79
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,040
Really, the wolves will gobble you up.

80
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,500
And I'm not kidding.

81
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,760
Dad, I'm coming in now.

82
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,850
Close your eyes, Son.
Daddy's working.

83
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,110
You shouldn't have
turned the lights off.

84
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,620
Who'd ever look at them at night?

85
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,290
- Have you been on the roof?
- What?

86
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,460
Outside my window?

87
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,300
I'm too busy to answer stupid questions.

88
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,423
Have you or haven't you?

89
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,060
No, I haven't.

90
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,640
Maybe the chimney sweep...

91
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Go and get dressed!
We're leaving soon.

92
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,060
Where to?

93
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,890
Don't you remember what day it is?

94
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah, the round-up.
You're taking me along?

95
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,440
I thought you'd be dressed by now.

96
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,670
He's spying on us.

97
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,670
This is yours now.

98
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,380
Is it loaded?

99
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,375
Of course or it'd be useless.

100
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:32,090
And take those goggles off.

101
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,810
Have you got a light?

102
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,310
Where's your dad?

103
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,320
They had to take the snowmobiles.

104
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,350
Piiparinen couldn't get
the chopper started.

105
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,670
Keep away from the fence!
Three, two, one!

106
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,514
You really think
you can use that?

107
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,930
Of course I can.

108
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,958
You gonna shoot Santa Claus?

109
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,920
He was outside my
window last night.

110
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,600
I thought you said he was dead.

111
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,005
Electric fence.

112
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,890
How do you like it?

113
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,180
Protection.

114
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,520
The explosions in the mountain
have sent the wolves on the prowl.

115
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,730
Wonder what they're digging up there?

116
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Just samples, I guess.

117
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,610
Look!

118
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,080
They're coming!

119
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Dad, Dad!

120
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,590
They're coming!

121
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,300
Our freezers will soon
be brimming with meat.

122
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,930
Open the gate.

123
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,140
Out of the way!

124
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,770
Come on!

125
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,150
Get in here, now!
What's keeping you?

126
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,320
Two skinny runts.

127
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,330
Something's wrong.

128
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,790
Maybe the others got lost.

129
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,300
No, they didn't.

130
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,510
Merry Christmas.

131
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,440
You stay here.

132
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,593
Me, too?

133
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:28,021
Keep an eye on Pietari.

134
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,180
What kind of wolves would do this?

135
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,190
Big and nasty ones.
Come and take a look.

136
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,530
Those morons and their blasting!

137
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,610
Now we have to deal with
Russian wolves as well!

138
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,950
They found the hole.

139
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,700
This was cut with pliers.

140
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,210
This is our fault.

141
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,380
If you go crying to your dad,
I'll give you a flogging.

142
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,260
We were never anywhere near the gate.

143
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,390
We should shoot that lot of idiots.

144
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,440
They've probably gone by now.
It's been quiet for days.

145
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,480
If it wasn't for that border,
I'd make minced meat of them.

146
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,481
We have insurance, right?

147
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:02,170
No, we bloody well don't.

148
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,790
433 carcasses.

149
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,750
Aimo, how much is that worth?

150
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Around $85,000.

151
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,680
Plus 22% VAT.

152
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,650
All that money's been rotted away.

153
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,870
He sure was hungry.

154
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,040
What do we do?

155
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,380
We'll pay them a little visit.

156
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,550
Nuts!

157
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,180
The guards have been paid
to shoot anyone who comes near.

158
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,010
Crossing the border is not a small thing.

159
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
Neither is bankruptcy.

160
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,560
Pietari, come on!

161
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,100
This was one hell of an idea!

162
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,470
These boys left in a hurry.

163
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,820
Come and see!

164
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,140
They found him, Vuppe.

165
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,980
Seismic researchers, my ass!
They've excavated something.

166
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,950
What on earth did they dig up?

167
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,890
So much for that.

168
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,800
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to open it?

169
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,050
No.

170
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,390
Tape these on your bum.

171
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,940
Are you serious?

172
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,400
How do I look?

173
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,990
Like a kid in a diaper.

174
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,620
You brought me here just for this?

175
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,580
Look.

176
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,510
The real Santa was totally different.
The Coca-Cola Santa is just a hoax.

177
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,100
These are from some fairytale.

178
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,430
This isn't.

179
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,118
What is this?

180
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:26,941
Proof that some
fairytales are true.

181
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,610
What am I looking at here?

182
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,320
The real Santa Claus.
He tears naughty kids to pieces.

183
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,620
Not even their skeletons are left.

184
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
How did he end up there?

185
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,420
The Sami people got angry
and lured him onto the ice.

186
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,380
The ice broke under him.

187
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,470
The lake froze solid
and Santa was trapped.

188
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:01,770
Come summer,
they dug out the huge ice block...

189
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,690
and buried it under a
sky-high pile of rocks.

190
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,820
- And it became Korvatunturi Mountain?
- Yep.

191
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,320
You're such an idiot.

192
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,000
When did you last get smacked?

193
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,710
When I was little, I guess.

194
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,630
Do you think we should confess?

195
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,340
Listen, you brat.

196
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,800
You have any idea what your dad will do...

197
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,850
when he hears that those
reindeer died because of you?

198
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,670
Are you making gingerbreads?

199
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,420
Are you hungry?

200
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,050
Yeah.

201
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,540
Were you playing hockey?

202
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,290
No, it's just this game we play.

203
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,220
Pretty rough game?

204
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,930
Yeah.

205
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,810
These are good.

206
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,770
Just like Mum used to make them.

207
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,690
I'm glad to hear it.

208
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,330
Dad, what if I didn't exist?

209
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
What do you mean?

210
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,630
If I disappeared.

211
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,510
You should disappear...

212
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,310
to your bed. It's late.

213
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,240
Dad, do you think I've been good?

214
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,740
All good boys are in bed by now.

215
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,100
Merry Christmas, Dad.

216
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,680
Merry Christmas, Pietari.

217
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,570
DAYS TO CHRISTMAS

218
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,790
Stay there. I have to check it.

219
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,770
Do you think this is funny?
I almost got killed.

220
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,490
You are not going skating now!
You're grounded this Christmas.

221
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,490
I have to wee.

222
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,630
Come on, Vuppe. Let's go out.

223
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,030
Dad! Dad!

224
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,670
- What is it?
- The bait's gone!

225
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,560
Careful now.

226
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,980
Stay there.

227
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,700
Did you hear me?

228
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,870
Stay!

229
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,760
Some kind of bird.

230
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,360
What is it?

231
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,400
Nothing.

232
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,605
Can I look?

233
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:35,870
No.

234
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,200
Some bird took the meat.

235
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,750
- I want to see it!
- There's nothing down there.

236
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,630
Why can't I look then?

237
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,460
Because we haven't even had breakfast yet.

238
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,230
Is this really all we're having?

239
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,560
These are good.

240
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,950
If I eat these, can I go
and look down in the pit then?

241
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,990
Then you'll have some more.

242
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,210
Are you angry with me?

243
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,250
No.

244
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,340
Wait here.

245
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,100
Did you hear me?

246
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,020
You're grounded.

247
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,234
Just preparing for my Santa gig.

248
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,120
Shut up and follow me.

249
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,360
Come on, Vuppe.

250
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,320
He shouldn't have come
snooping around in people's yards.

251
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,810
Greene, Brian Jonathan.

252
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,440
Born 1952.

253
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,150
Must be one of those
nutters from the mountain.

254
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,360
Not even 60 years old.

255
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,350
What are you going to say?

256
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,060
To who?

257
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,100
Everyone.

258
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,820
Nothing.

259
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,610
You know those wolf pits are illegal.

260
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,400
Darn it, Piiparinen!

261
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,990
Like it or not, you're in this too.

262
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
- I should...
- Shut up...

263
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,250
and think, if you know how.

264
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,770
I have an hour to my first Santa stop.

265
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,120
Vuppe, stay.

266
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,580
Did you see that?

267
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,840
He's breathing. Tough old codger.

268
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,480
What is he doing?

269
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,070
He smells something.

270
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,030
Pietari.

271
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Pietari!

272
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
You were supposed to stay inside!

273
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,170
Pietari, come back here now!

274
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,309
Did Pietari see him?

275
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,430
What do you think?

276
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,260
I have to go.
What do I do with him?

277
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,220
Have a little chat.

278
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,870
The cops!

279
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,710
Pietari, Pietari!

280
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,090
Blast it all.

281
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,110
What's he up to?

282
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,662
Hiya.

283
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:56,440
Hi.

284
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,962
Why the fancy dress?

285
00:39:58,973 --> 00:40:00,320
What?

286
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,600
- Is everything in order?
- What do you mean?

287
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,270
What a morning!
I've been all around the village.

288
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,110
Strange stuff going on.

289
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,030
Well, everything's fine here.
Right, Pietari?

290
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,330
Then you're an exception.

291
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,670
You brought the whole murder squad?

292
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,670
- What's the problem here?
- My other business.

293
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,550
A couple of hundred sacks of potatoes,
my whole harvest.

294
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,590
I'm here because of some potatoes?

295
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,850
Yes and no.

296
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,810
They only took the sacks.

297
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,980
Holy mackerel.

298
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:54,650
Almost every house
got their radiators stolen last night.

299
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,570
Torn off the walls.

300
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,330
It's going to be one cold Christmas.

301
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,290
My wife's hairdryer
was stolen from the bathroom.

302
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,710
Who'd want an old
piece of rubbish like that?

303
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,380
It's cutting-edge technology in Russia.

304
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,340
- Pietari, we should be getting home.
- No!

305
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,390
- Where's Juuso?
- Still sleeping, I guess.

306
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,730
Not so fast. Let's take a look at your car.

307
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,450
Juuso.

308
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,430
Juuso, wake up! He's at our place now.

309
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,890
Juuso!

310
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,570
Juuso's been taken!

311
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,570
- What the devil is that?
- It was in Juuso's bed.

312
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,620
Maybe he's out chasing girls.

313
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,250
When we were your age...

314
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,420
we'd stack up some pillows and pretend...

315
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,540
He'll be back by nightfall.

316
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,633
Don't you get it?

317
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:37,060
Pietari, that's enough!

318
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,541
Can I go now?

319
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:42,560
Okay, go.

320
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,980
Aimo, you speak English, right?

321
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,900
How come?

322
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,320
We need an interpreter.

323
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,150
Disgusting!

324
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,700
You old devil.

325
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,720
Gingerbread?

326
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,420
What do you want me to translate?
I've got stuff to do.

327
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,340
We've got visitors
from Korvatunturi Mountain.

328
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,236
Visitors?

329
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:49,730
American visitors.

330
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,870
Now, in you go.

331
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,750
- Daddy! We have to help Juuso.
- Nonsense. Juuso is a big boy.

332
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,710
So?

333
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,050
We can't go back in there.
It's not human.

334
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,800
- Not human?
- Not human!

335
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,470
- The old swine bit me!
- Look at that.

336
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,140
- I have to see this.
- I'm not kidding.

337
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,580
See for yourselves.
There's something really weird about him.

338
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,330
- Don't you think?
- He's a foreigner.

339
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,340
Go talk to him.

340
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,640
Be careful.

341
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,800
How do you like the land
of the Northern Lights?

342
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,280
I'm not going there alone.

343
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,200
Right.

344
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,330
Cover me.

345
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,560
He's harmless.

346
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,910
Sorry to disturb you on Christmas Eve,
but is Hemppa in?

347
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,250
Oh, he isn't.

348
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,750
Okay. Thanks anyway.

349
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,710
No, I haven't seen him.

350
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,090
Merry Christmas. Bye.

351
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Give me the broom.

352
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,210
Where are your friends?

353
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,770
Ask him what they were digging up.

354
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
What did you dig inside the mountain?

355
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,950
He's acting deaf. An old trick.

356
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,420
Tell him we'll keep him here
until someone pays up.

357
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,710
- You mean as a hostage?
- Yes.

358
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,800
Tell him!

359
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,359
We keep you here 'til somebody pay.

360
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,550
You're making him angry.
He doesn't understand you.

361
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,810
This was just phase one.

362
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,300
Last chance, asshole,

363
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Rauno here will ask the next question;
he don't speak English.

364
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,450
- What was that?
- Dad!

365
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,910
What does he want now?

366
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,410
Dad, I have to talk to you!

367
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:55,180
I'm just doing a little job
with Piiparinen. What is it?

368
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,010
You need to smack me.

369
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,403
What?

370
00:49:01,414 --> 00:49:03,161
I deserve to be smacked.

371
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,310
Fifteen good lashes should do.

372
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,190
What's the matter with you?

373
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,700
I've been naughty.

374
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,700
What have you done?

375
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,120
Juuso and I went up to the mountain...

376
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,210
and we made that hole in the fence.

377
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,460
You did what?

378
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,040
I'm the only one left, Dad.

379
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,960
All the others have been taken. Juuso, too.

380
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,460
What are you talking about?

381
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,340
All the kids.

382
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,550
Rauno, you have to see this.

383
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,850
Wait here.

384
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,240
He's up to something. And, look.

385
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,910
He bit it in half.

386
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,670
Look at his eyes.

387
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,010
What is he looking at?

388
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,760
Pietari!

389
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,780
Don't!

390
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,520
Do you know this bloke from somewhere?

391
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,780
He seems to know you.

392
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,110
He knows all the kids.

393
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,450
Who is he? Come on, speak up!

394
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,290
He's been spying on us.

395
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:47,460
What do you mean? Tell me!

396
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,920
He's Santa Claus.

397
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:08,730
He's come to get me.
They dug him up from the mountain.

398
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,900
A character from a fairytale.

399
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,730
I knew there was
something fishy going on.

400
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,809
He's going to attack!

401
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,750
Daddy, don't let him take me!

402
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,110
On the ground! Tell him in English!

403
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,600
Down boy! Go down!

404
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,750
He has his own language.

405
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,584
He's not afraid of you.

406
00:51:32,595 --> 00:51:34,260
He sure is.

407
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,630
Tie him up.

408
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,517
No way.

409
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:37,680
Now!

410
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,040
What was that?

411
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,850
Subzero One, do you read me?

412
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,630
It's coming from that jacket.

413
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,299
Careful!

414
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,000
Mr. Green? Is everything okay?

415
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,229
- We are landing in 30 Minutes..

416
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,770
- What did he say?
- They want him back.

417
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,330
Mr. Green?

418
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,180
Is Santa ready to fly?

419
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,940
- Don't they?
- What are you doing?

420
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,870
This is Rauno.
Rauno from Finland.

421
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
We have Santa Claus.

422
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,200
Who is this?
Where is Mr. Green?

423
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:24,490
Tell him we have Santa for sale.

424
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,690
How much are you going to ask for him?

425
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,730
- Enough to cover the debt
- At least.

426
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,096
Maybe we should think it over.

427
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,140
Are you scared?

428
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,610
We're giving him up too easily.

429
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,950
Just think what he could be worth.

430
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,000
The original, real Santa Claus.

431
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,630
Someone is going to get rich with him.

432
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,920
That's the plan.

433
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,520
- Dad!
- Stay here, we won't be long.

434
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,770
My wife's hairdryer!

435
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:12,310
What the hell...

436
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,520
Put that hairdryer away. Keep cool.

437
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,630
What a midget.

438
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,220
Who are you? Where are my men?

439
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,070
Say something.

440
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,839
Yea, yea.. we are men.
Let's do business..

441
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,132
Business?
What kind of business?

442
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,680
What do you want?

443
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,685
How much do we want?

444
00:56:21,696 --> 00:56:23,050
$85,000.

445
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
85 thousand dollars.

446
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,159
At least a million.

447
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,480
Shut up.

448
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:42,000
Hey. Where is the cargo?

449
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,920
The last door.

450
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,479
Shh, put down your weapons and smile..

451
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,550
As nice as you can.

452
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,720
Move slowly and do exactly as I say.

453
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,285
What did he say?

454
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:45,230
We need to keep quiet.

455
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,300
This is not Santa.

456
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,160
What?

457
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,790
It's one of Santa's little helpers.

458
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,250
What do you mean, a helper?

459
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:58,080
He says it's an elf!

460
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,620
Enough of this rubbish!
Give us the money!

461
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:10,400
God damned. Santa is going to find out
who is naughty or nice.

462
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,050
What's up with him?

463
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,470
Is someone there?

464
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:31,230
What's that running there?

465
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:38,399
What on earth is happening here?

466
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,120
They're protecting their master.

467
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,290
Pietari! Pietari!

468
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:00,880
Pietari!

469
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,030
The elves have built a nest for Santa.

470
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,450
For what?

471
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,540
- Is that...
- Yes.

472
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,500
They're trying to defrost him.

473
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,890
- Dad!
- What was that?

474
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,510
Daddy, help.

475
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:54,270
Juuso. They're all here.
And soon they will get smacked.

476
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,320
- Dad!
- Juuso, where are you?

477
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,700
Turn off the heat!

478
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,240
Juuso, say something.

479
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,620
Piiparinen, the door won't hold!

480
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,120
What should I do?

481
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:15,960
Barricade the door.

482
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,840
Move these there!

483
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,300
Aimo, leave the kid and come and help us.

484
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,220
Daddy's little boy.

485
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,829
Let's go home, Daddy.

486
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,901
Don't worry,
we'll get home soon.

487
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:38,980
We are all going to die!

488
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,040
Dad!

489
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,090
Aimo!

490
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,800
Piiparinen!

491
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,220
Listen to me!

492
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,990
As long as the kids are here...

493
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,820
the elves won't leave the hangar.

494
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,580
It's either me or Santa.

495
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,500
I suggest Santa.

496
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,950
It's Piiparinen.
Pietari, do you read?

497
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,530
I do.

498
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,570
Copy that.

499
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,830
Why do I have to go in the sack?

500
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,840
Because it's my plan.
Let's go!

501
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,220
Here's one more.

502
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:13,770
Not Juuso!

503
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,060
All the kids have to go,
or this won't work.

504
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,538
Daddy, I'm scared.

505
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:26,120
Piiparinen, the package is ready.

506
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,720
Won't they get cold out there?

507
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:34,540
Stay out of this.

508
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,830
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll be fine.

509
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,460
Ready to go!

510
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,930
You do your job,
I'll deal with this!

511
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,060
Slow down, we'll wait here.

512
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,790
Piiparinen, look down!

513
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,500
They're following us!

514
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:19,960
What did I tell you?

515
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,110
Let's turn around, Piiparinen!

516
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,570
What?

517
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:37,150
Towards the pens!

518
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,820
What for?

519
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,410
Pretend they are reindeer!

520
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,580
Reindeer! Stars alive!

521
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,340
That's what we'll do.

522
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,040
Looks like we've been naughty.

523
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,550
If you ever wondered how Santa can be...

524
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:44,430
in a zillion places all at once, now you know.

525
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,430
That's the magic of Christmas.

526
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:24,180
Piiparinen, the gate's closed!

527
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,810
Fiddlesticks!
We need a new plan.

528
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:33,600
There isn't time!
I'll go and open it!

529
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:35,560
You're not going anywhere!

530
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,940
I can't land there
to bring you back up.

531
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,070
I'm not coming back.

532
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,530
Pietari, can you hear me?

533
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,130
Pietari!

534
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,590
Piiparinen!

535
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,470
Tell Dad what I did.

536
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,040
Daddy.

537
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:35,560
Have a merry Christmas.

538
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,910
And a happy bloody New Year.

539
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:21,100
How do you like that, elves?

540
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:22,860
What happened?

541
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,440
The miracle of Christmas.

542
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,780
Congratulations, Pietari!
Congratulations!

543
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,320
You just put the elves out of a job.

544
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:49,130
Take the kids home.
It's their bedtime.

545
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,680
Roger. Over and out.

546
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,360
One hundred and ninety eight
Santa Clauses.

547
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,780
Juuso, what's that worth?

548
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,790
