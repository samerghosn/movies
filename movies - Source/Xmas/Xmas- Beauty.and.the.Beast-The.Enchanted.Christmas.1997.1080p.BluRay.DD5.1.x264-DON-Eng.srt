1
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,150
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

2
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,110
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,110
'Tis the season to be jolly

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
Don we now our gay apparel

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,000
Fa-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la

7
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,130
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol

8
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,050
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,220
Whoa!

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,390
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

11
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,350
Ha-ha. There must be much,
much more holly.

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,430
'Tis the season to be...

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,850
What's this? There's too much holly.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,400
Whoa! Slow down, lad.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,440
Don we now our gay apparel

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,150
No, no, no, no more mistletoe.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,580
Chip, away from
those presents, dear.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Mama, I found one for me!

19
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,040
Can I open it, Mama? Can I?

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,340
-Well, just one.
-Oh, boy!

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,630
It's good to see the boy
having a proper Christmas.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Not like last year.

23
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,340
Yes.
This is much more agreeable.

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,260
Well, I thought last year
was quite nice.

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,600
Yes, well, I suppose I...
I did manage to save Christmas.

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,060
-You?
-Yes, me.

27
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,520
If not for my skillful
and decisive leadership,

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,820
all would've been lost.

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,740
Leadership? Ha!
You could not lead a horse to water.

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,200
What are you yammering about?

31
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,620
It was all my idea.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,620
Your idea?
Everyone knows it was mine.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,120
Heavens. How many times are
we going to have to go over this story?

34
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,550
-Story?
-Until someone gets his facts straight.

35
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,470
-Why don't you tell it, Mama?
-Capital idea.

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,680
Well, I don't know.

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,300
Come now, Mrs. Potts.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,350
Surely you recall
how I saved Christmas.

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,600
Tut-tut-tut-tut. No leading the witness.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,140
Please, Mama, tell the story.

41
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,480
Oh, all right.

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,610
Ah! Now we will hear
what really happened.

43
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,780
Well, let's see.

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,950
Belle, terrified by the master's anger,

45
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,660
ran away from the castle

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,330
straight into a pack of wolves.

47
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,000
But the master saved her.

48
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
They began to be friends.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,420
Ah-ah-ah.

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,920
That's where l came in.

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,510
Where could he be?
Goodness knows.

52
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,130
We've searched every last corner.

53
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,720
I'm beginning to think
he's not in the castle at all.

54
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,060
Voilà! There he is!

55
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,940
-Wonderful!
-No time to waste.

56
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,900
We must find a way
to get them together.

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,820
Let's go! Love will not wait.

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,280
You really think she's the one?
Will she break the spell?

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,870
I knew it from the moment
I set eyes on her.

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,490
If anyone can reach the master,
Belle can. Such a kind soul.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,330
And her looks
don't hurt either.

62
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,290
Wait for me!

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,510
-Hi, Belle.
-Oh, hello.

64
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,310
Chip, do you know what day it is?

65
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,930
Well, it's not Tuesday...

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,730
No, silly. Today is December 24th.

67
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,980
-The day before Christmas.
-And what a beautiful day it is.

68
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,860
A wonderful day for a morning stroll.

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,990
Yes, yes. Nothing starts the day
like a brisk walk around the grounds.

70
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,620
Yeah!
Or you could go ice-skating.

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,000
-Ha-ha. Wahoo!
-Yes, fresh air, exercise. Ha-ha.

72
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,540
-In moderation, of course.

73
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,420
Come along, Belle, dear.
The great outdoors awaits.

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,460
Yeah, let's go!

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,260
Oh. Good morning.

76
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,560
Huh? Whoa...

77
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
Uh... Uh...

79
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,280
I fell and I landed on my...
On... On the ice.

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,370
It's pretty slippery.

81
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,620
Yes, it's slippery.

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,040
This is a perfect day for skating.

83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,090
Come on.

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,960
Hmm?

85
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,510
Come on.

86
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,970
No.

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,100
-Go on, Master. It might be fun.
-Go for it!

88
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,140
Hmm. Hmm?

89
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,230
Come on!
Not so fast.

90
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,900
Ooo-ooo la-la.

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,900
Come on. Why don't you try it like this?

92
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,740
One, two, three. One, two, three.
See? It's easy.

93
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,370
One, two, three.

94
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,620
Ho-ho-ho.

95
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,290
Yes, I think this may work.

96
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,190
Bravo! Bravo! Encore!

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,030
Fife, you approve?

98
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh, Maestro, it's magnificent!

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,410
Oh, come along. It's merely an opera

100
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,550
to bring the house down.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,130
-Ooh!

102
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,720
Is there a part for a piccolo?

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Absolutely.

104
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,520
Solo for Fife in B-flat.

105
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,650
-Ooh. I'd do anything for a solo.
-Yes.

106
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,110
I know. Now, Fifey,

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,360
in the midst of my crescendo,

108
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,040
I thought I heard merriment
outside the window.

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,580
Have a little look-see, will you?

110
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,750
Wow! Would you look at that?

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,550
Well, I think I might.
I'll just pick myself up and...

112
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,630
Oh!

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,340
What's this? Heavens, look.

114
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,930
I'm bolted to the wall!

115
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,810
Oh, right.

116
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,430
Um, the master is skating.

117
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,110
Skating? Why on earth
would he do a thing like that?

118
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,270
Probably because that
pretty girl is holding his hand.

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,820
-What? Belle?
-Hey.

120
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
Maybe if she falls in love with him,
the spell will be broken,

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,410
and we'll be human again!

122
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,290
Trust me, Fife.

123
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,870
-Humanity is entirely overrated.

124
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,790
Before the enchantment,
there was no need

125
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,550
for my particular brand of genius.

126
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,300
But now the master needs my melodies

127
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,140
to feed his tormented soul.

128
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,270
I am his confidant

129
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,890
and his best friend.

130
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,650
And I won't let some peasant girl
ruin it for me!

131
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,150
Fife, see to it that this blossoming love

132
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,530
withers on the vine.

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes, Maestro Forte.

134
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,540
One, two, three.

135
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,750
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

136
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,750
I think I've got it!

137
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,760
Hey, down in front. I wanna see.

138
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,260
Let me see. I wanna see, too!

139
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,600
Shh!

140
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,190
Quiet. Oh, this is very promising.

141
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,770
Ah, yes, there is something in the air.

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,150
-Could it be love?

143
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,190
Love? Oh, oh, oh, ooh.

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,940
Uh. Oh. Oh.

145
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,650
I've got to stop them.

146
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Oh!

147
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,530
Help!

148
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,620
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,040
What's that little toot up to?

150
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,630
Whoa!

151
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,380
Mmm-mmm.

152
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,550
Stop!

153
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,530
It's a Christmas angel, see?

154
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,910
Oh.

155
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,370
This is no angel.

156
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,670
It's the shadow of a monster.

157
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,680
Oh, Forte is going to be so proud of me.

158
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,270
I don't know why I bother.

159
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,110
Now he's worse than ever.

160
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,860
Don't lose heart, dearest.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,840
I hate Christmas.

162
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,720
The music helps?

163
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,020
Your music is the only thing
that helps me forget.

164
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,650
Don't worry, old friend.

165
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,020
I'm here for you,

166
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,440
just as I have been,

167
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,240
just as I always will be.

168
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,990
Why is the beast such a grump?

169
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,660
I don't know. He's always like that.

170
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,750
-Even at Christmas?
-Yep.

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,330
Belle, what's Christmas?

172
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,840
Oh, Chip, you must know
about Christmas.

173
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,340
Stockings in front of the fire? Tree?

174
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,800
Tinsel? Presents?

175
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,930
Presents? Do I get one?

176
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,510
Of course. Everyone gets
a present on Christmas.

177
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,020
-Oh, even the master?
-Yes, even the master.

178
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,360
-What are you gonna get him?
-I don't really know him well enough

179
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,520
to know what he would want.

180
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,820
-What would you want?
-Well, what I love most

181
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,620
in the world are my books, my stories.

182
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,200
Why don't you get the master a story?

183
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,620
You're right, Chip. A story.

184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,960
When l get to know him

185
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,420
We'll find more things to say

186
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,550
One day I wiII reach him

187
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,050
There has to be a way

188
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,010
Everyone needs someone

189
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,430
He must need someone, too

190
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,770
When l get to know him better

191
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,400
Here's what l will do

192
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,360
l'll read him stories

193
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,820
From picture books
all filled with wonder

194
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,870
Magic worlds where the impossible

195
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,120
Becomes the everyday

196
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,380
We'll find a mountaintop

197
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,590
And some moonbeams to sit under

198
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,880
l'll lead because l know the way

199
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,100
So much to discover

200
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,470
l do it all the time

201
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,600
l could live inside bright pages

202
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,650
Where the words all rhyme

203
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,480
We will slay the dragons

204
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,650
That still follow him around

205
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,280
And he'll smile
Yes, he'll smile

206
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,540
As his dreams leave the ground

207
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,500
Stories and stories

208
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,040
About mermaids, kings
and sunken treasure

209
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,170
Magic worlds where the impossible

210
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,720
Becomes the everyday

211
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,970
l know a tiny place

212
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,310
Just a dot too small to measure

213
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,350
l'll take him there

214
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,640
l know the way

215
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,900
Stories about heroes

216
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,650
Who overcame their deepest sorrow

217
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,780
They'll put hope into his heart again

218
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,280
He'll cherish every day

219
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,660
He'll find a better world

220
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,080
And the strength to face tomorrow

221
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:04,170
l'm sure that
when he knows the way

222
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,470
He'll want

223
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:12,930
To stay

224
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,860
Do you think the master
will like his gift?

225
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,020
I do.

226
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,730
So does this mean
we're gonna have a Christmas?

227
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,150
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

228
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,490
Absolutely not.

229
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,530
Why not?

230
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,870
Out of the question. Not a chance.
Dream on. An impossibility. Forget it.

231
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,670
Come on!

232
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,170
-Suck in that gut.

233
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,460
-Mon ami. Get with the spirit. Unwind.

234
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,510
-Oh, dear.
-Come on, love. Have a heart.

235
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,890
Yeah. Come on.

236
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,310
-No, no, and... Let me think...
-Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

237
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,980
-No!

238
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,850
This is where I put my foot down.

239
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,360
Wait. Get out of...

240
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,280
The master has forbidden Christmas!

241
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,740
-Oh, dear.

242
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,570
Forbid Christmas?

243
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,910
No one can forbid Christmas.

244
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,160
He doesn't wish
to be reminded of his past,

245
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,830
and Christmas is
a most painful reminder of it.

246
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,750
I, for one, do not wish to torture him.

247
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,090
I, for one, think a little Christmas
cheer would do him some good.

248
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,800
-Yeah.
-Oh? Hmm.

249
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,260
The girl is right.
It is up to us to do something.

250
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,510
Gosh! It's not our place
to get involved.

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
No, no, no, no! We just can't
mind our own beeswax, can we?

252
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,560
Just have to stick our wick
where it doesn't belong.

253
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,860
Whoa!

254
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,910
-Oh, humiliating.
-Pish posh.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,160
I think it's a wonderful idea.

256
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,750
But the master doesn't want it.
His castle, his rules.

257
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,790
It's not fair.

258
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,970
He's right. It's not fair!

259
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,430
Don't whine, glasses.

260
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,050
Sorry.

261
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,600
Look at us,
squabbling and bickering.

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,310
Breaks my heart to see it, it does.

263
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,310
And we used to be at our very best
at Christmas.

264
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,650
Why, we used to prepare
a feast for the entire castle.

265
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,070
Ah! You could have
some stuffed turkey.

266
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,780
-Cranberry sauce.
-Shortbread cookies.

267
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,910
Mince pies.
Potatoes.

268
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,160
-Gravy.
-And Christmas pudding!

269
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,710
Uh, pudding? With... With custard?

270
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,000
What do you think we are, barbarians?
Of course with custard.

271
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,760
-And raisins and brandy,

272
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,420
-and all those things you like.

273
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,590
Ohh. Oh, I...

274
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,970
-All right.
-Yes!

275
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,390
But if the master finds out about this,
he will be furious,

276
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,360
so, everybody, keep quiet.

277
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,480
Come on!
What are we waiting for, Christmas?

278
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,110
Good heavens, we don't have
much time. It's Christmas Eve!

279
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,820
-I'll see to the dinner.
-I'll get some mistletoe.

280
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,870
We need to brighten this place up.

281
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,240
Belle, I know someone who will help.

282
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,250
Now, now, wait for me.
I'm in charge here. I'm in charge.

283
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Wait for me!

284
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,760
One-thousand one,
one-thousand two,

285
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,720
one-thousand three...

286
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,300
-Are we there yet?
-Not yet.

287
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,470
Oh, boy, there sure
are a lot of stairs here.

288
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,350
One-thousand seven,
one-thousand eight,

289
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,060
one-thousand nine, one-thousand ten...

290
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,200
Hello?

291
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,750
Do not be afraid, mes amis.

292
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,000
It is I, Lumiere.
We have come to pay you a little visit.

293
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,590
-Lumiere?
-Angelique.

294
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,470
-Ah, Lumiere, finally.

295
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,850
I thought we were to be locked away
in this dusty attic forever.

296
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,680
Ah, Angelique, mon amour.

297
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,270
Your eyes are still so lovely
after all these years.

298
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
Lumiere, please!

299
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,650
You'll tarnish the halo.

300
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,160
Oh, yes. This is Belle, our guest.

301
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,040
-Pleased to meet you.
-And this is Angelique.

302
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,080
She is the castle decorator.

303
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,790
You mean was the castle decorator.

304
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,460
I am not responsible
for this baroque atrocity.

305
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,590
When I was in charge,

306
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,590
the castle was full of light and beauty.

307
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,850
But, chérie,
that is why we have come.

308
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,560
Gather around, mes enfants.

309
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,350
-We are planning the greatest

310
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
Christmas celebration ever.

311
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,660
No, stop!

312
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,830
-What is it, chérie?

313
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,040
Why do you raise my hopes...

314
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,830
I... I mean, their hopes...
Only to have them dashed?

315
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,080
Well, no more.

316
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,050
But it's Christmas Eve.

317
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,090
Without you, we'll never get
the castle decorated in time.

318
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,760
Ha! Christmas? Hmph!
I refuse to hope for it anymore.

319
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,970
I will not be disappointed again.

320
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,140
But this is to be
the greatest celebration ever.

321
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,350
We cannot do it without you.

322
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,060
Well, but of course you cannot.

323
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,110
Christmas takes planning
and organization.

324
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,070
No. No, I won't do it.
It won't change anything.

325
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,200
I believe it will.

326
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,910
There is more to

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,750
This time of year

328
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,460
Than sleigh bells and holly

329
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,840
Mistletoe and snow

330
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,800
Those things come and go

331
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,050
Much deeper than snow

332
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,850
Stronger than the strongest Iove
we'll know

333
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,730
We'll ever know

334
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,200
As Iong as there's Christmas

335
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,410
l truly believe

336
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,710
That hope is the greatest

337
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,210
Of the gifts we'II receive

338
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,420
As Iong as there's Christmas

339
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,550
We'll all be just fine

340
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,510
A star shines above us

341
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,850
Lighting your way and mine

342
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,190
Just as Iong as there's Christmas
there wiII be Christmas pud

343
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,610
Tons of turkey

344
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,280
And cranberry sauce and mince pies
if we're good

345
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,490
-Lots of logs on the fire
-Lots of gifts on the tree

346
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,790
All wrapped up in red ribbons

347
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,830
Wonder if there's one for me

348
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,000
We're due for a party
Where on earth do we start

349
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,130
l may wear my tiara
you bought me in Montmartre

350
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,380
All the silver will sparkle

351
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,470
And the china will gleam

352
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,800
And we'll be as shiny
as a brand-new centime

353
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,930
-After dinner we'll play games
-Till the morning breaks through

354
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,810
Then we'll meet in the garden

355
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,770
-This is what we shall do
-We will build

356
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,320
We will build a snowman
that'll reach to the sky

357
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,860
lt will stay up until July

358
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,250
What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop.

359
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,130
Put me down. Put me down.
This is ridiculous.

360
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,380
Everyone knows that
the lights go on first.

361
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,800
I don't want to go
all the way up there on the top.

362
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,730
As Iong as there's Christmas

363
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,690
l truly believe

364
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,820
That hope is the greatest

365
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,780
Of the gifts we'II receive

366
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,820
As Iong as there's Christmas

367
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,830
We'll all be just fine

368
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:03,630
There'II aIways be Christmas

369
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,010
So there aIways wiII be a time

370
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,180
When the world

371
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,390
ls filled with peace

372
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,100
And warmth

373
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,480
We're gonna have
the greatest Christmas ever.

374
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,980
Oh, I hope so, Chip.

375
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,110
You on the left,
you on the right, follow me.

376
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,450
-There is decorating to be done.

377
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes. But keep in mind,
the master mustn't find out.

378
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,290
Ooh, yes.

379
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,170
Christmas?
She's planning Christmas?

380
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,930
Yes. Awful, isn't it?

381
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,940
Perhaps she doesn't know
how I feel about Christmas.

382
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,060
-But she does know.
-Hmm?

383
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,980
She just doesn't care like I do.

384
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,700
She's actually trying to bring
Christmas back to the castle.

385
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,160
And you know how much
we despise Christmas.

386
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,700
The day my life ended.

387
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,960
-Bring me my presents!
-Your Highness,

388
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,920
please accept this humble gift
as a token of our appreciation.

389
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,260
I know I speak for everyone when...

390
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,470
Ah, just give it to me!

391
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,470
A storybook? You call this a present?

392
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,600
I hope you have something
better for me, Forte.

393
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,690
Yes, sir. Of course, master.

394
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,190
What is that?

395
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,320
Um, a small piece in your honor, master.

396
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,290
Ew! I hate it.
Forte, that stuff is gloomy.

397
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,250
Who disturbs my Christmas?

398
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,300
Please, take this rose

399
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,720
in exchange for shelter
from the bitter cold.

400
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,180
I don't need a rose.

401
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,180
Go away, you wretched old hag!

402
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,860
You have been deceived
by your own cold heart.

403
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,400
A curse upon your house
and all within it.

404
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,610
Until you have found one
to love you as you are,

405
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,780
you shall remain forever a beast.

406
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
But we've come so far since then.

407
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,550
We've risen above the tragedy.

408
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,220
Where is she?

409
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,680
I believe she's gone to the boiler room,

410
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,940
or so, a little birdie told me.

411
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,810
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

412
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Oh!

413
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,830
Aah!

414
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,500
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Get out of the way.

415
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,970
-We're workin' here.

416
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,550
-Excuse me.
-Let's go. Let's go.

417
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,680
All right, you guys.
Now, get back to work.

418
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,310
The castle doesn't heat itself,
you know.

419
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,100
So, what can I do you for, lady?

420
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,440
-I'm looking for a log.
-All right. Logs we got.

421
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,610
What do you want? Hard wood?
Soft wood? We got it all.

422
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,740
We got birch, maple, pine, oak...

423
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,240
- Concrete.

424
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,030
-My head. Don't worry. It'll pass.

425
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,290
So, make up your mind already.

426
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,120
Is it all right if I just browse?

427
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,500
Suit yourself. Take your time.
Me, I got work to do.

428
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,750
Huh.

429
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Hmm.

430
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,440
-Whew.

431
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,020
Hey, what am I payin' you for,
being boring?

432
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,230
Do that on your own time.
Get out of here!

433
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,360
Yes.

434
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,070
Oh!

435
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,750
What are you hiding?

436
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,720
It's a Yule log.

437
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,010
Huh?

438
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,760
A... A Yule log.

439
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,060
It's a wonderful tradition.

440
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,440
One log is chosen and everyone
in the house touches it

441
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,690
and makes a Christmas wish.

442
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,440
Mmm, wishes are stupid.

443
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,530
You made a Christmas wish last year.

444
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,370
Is this what you wished for?

445
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,000
No.

446
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,290
But I will keep wishing.

447
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,670
And when the log is burned
on Christmas morning...

448
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,630
There will be no Christmas.

449
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,380
-But...
-No! I am the master here.

450
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,180
How can you be so selfish?

451
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,350
You cannot possibly understand.

452
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,680
You have no idea
what it's like to lose everything,

453
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,940
to be trapped in your own castle,

454
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,310
to be a... A... A...

455
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,820
Prisoner?

456
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,070
The only one holding us prisoner here
is you.

457
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,240
Well, I'm not giving up.

458
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,160
Prisoner.

459
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,440
Hiya, Belle.
You should see the ballroom.

460
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,110
It's all decorated and pretty
and there's garlands everywhere.

461
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,110
I think the master's gonna
be really excited

462
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,280
when he finds out about Christmas.

463
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,450
Well, he... He already knows.

464
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,280
Really? Was he excited?

465
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,540
Actually, Chip, he's forbidden it.

466
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,370
But I thought
he couldn't forbid Christmas.

467
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,460
You know, Chip, he can't.

468
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,880
We'll have Christmas
with or without him.

469
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,090
Hurray! Can we get a tree now, Belle?
It's the only thing we're missing.

470
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,140
All right, then. Let's go get a tree.

471
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,220
But first...

472
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,390
Shh.

473
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,320
Psst, Belle.
The master. Hurry.

474
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,430
What about this one?

475
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,680
Mmm...

476
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,940
Mmm.

477
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,860
Nah, too skinny. Come on.

478
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,920
Ooo la-la.

479
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,340
-Ohh, Lumiere.
-She's beautiful, no?

480
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,050
Yes, and I'm hideous.

481
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,430
Not to mention
ill-tempered.

482
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,720
What? What is that?

483
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,680
Ooh, it looks like a Christmas present.

484
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,320
Oh-ho-ho. It's for you, master.

485
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,990
It's from a girl.

486
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,330
-Mrs. Potts?
-No. From Belle.

487
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,330
Belle?

488
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,250
Uh-uh-uh. Master, you can't open it.

489
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,710
Well, why not? It's for me, isn't it?

490
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,090
Because it's not yet Christmas.

491
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,390
Master, we all understand
how you feel about Christmas.

492
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,270
But when a woman gives a man a gift,
she's saying, "I care about you."

493
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,560
Hmm.

494
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,600
But I don't have a gift for her.

495
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,440
It is not too late.

496
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,150
Well, I guess I could
get her a little something.

497
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,450
Forte, stop the noise!

498
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,200
Noise? Noise?

499
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,620
This is my masterpiece.

500
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,460
Master.

501
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,630
I... I want you to compose a song.

502
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,050
-It's a present for Belle.
-What? Belle?

503
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,850
And make it happy!

504
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,890
Oh, but happiness is so depressing.

505
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,650
What's next? Love songs?

506
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,730
Wedding marches?

507
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,150
It's all that girl's fault.

508
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,330
What about this one?

509
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,290
-Hmm, too wiggly.
-Too wiggly.

510
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,500
Fife!

511
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,630
Pay attention.

512
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,420
I need you to pace when I think.
The girl is evil, I tell you.

513
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,630
She pulls him from my grasp.

514
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,350
She fills his head with dreams of love

515
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,140
and hope and Christmas!

516
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,810
Well, what you gonna do?
You can't stop Christmas.

517
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,900
No, but I can stop the girl.

518
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,450
Chip, this is the last one.

519
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,410
That's not it. That's just a weed
wishing it was a tree.

520
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,870
Chip, we've looked
at every tree on the grounds.

521
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,710
But it's more this way than that.

522
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,670
It will have to do.

523
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,470
-What a headache I have.
-I'm sorry.

524
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,340
I... I'll get a saw.

525
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,470
No, that's fine.
I don't want I should put you out.

526
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,260
Oh, all right.

527
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,560
Do you have some oil?
I just thought a little massage...

528
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,560
But if it's no, it's no. Go on.
What are you waiting for?

529
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,770
Knock yourself out.

530
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,940
You never get headaches, I guess.
Lucky you.

531
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,320
-Really, I can get a saw.
-Who wants a saw?

532
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,740
I said go ahead with the whacking
and the hitting. Who's stopping you?

533
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,620
-Shh.

534
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,500
What is that?

535
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,500
Ohh.

536
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,470
It's beautiful.

537
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,890
And now for a little Fife.

538
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,020
Sultan, wait!

539
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,780
Don't worry yourself about me.
I'll just sit here. Snow is fine.

540
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,450
A little wet, but who's complaining?

541
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,330
Yes, my dear. Come to me.

542
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,370
Come here, boy. Come here.

543
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,390
-Good doggy. Nice doggy.

544
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,060
Sultan?
Back off, doggy.

545
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,310
Oh.

546
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,770
Hello?

547
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,530
Well, maybe there's nobody here.

548
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,030
Maybe we should go.

549
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,530
What's the matter, Sultan?

550
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,080
Oh, hello. I don't believe we've met.
I... I'm Belle.

551
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,250
-And you are?
-Fife.

552
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,170
-Down, boy, down.

553
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,800
We heard the most beautiful music.

554
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,590
-Was it you?
-Me?

555
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,010
You thought that was me?

556
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,640
Mademoiselle, please.

557
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,940
I am Maestro Forte,

558
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,400
court composer
and your most humble servant.

559
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,700
Pleased to meet you, Monsieur Forte.
I'm Belle.

560
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,160
Yes. The entire castle is talking
about you, child.

561
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,040
They say you're planning
a Christmas gala. Marvelous idea.

562
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,300
The very thing to shatter
the master's dark and gloomy past.

563
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,590
But you must make this
the grandest celebration ever.

564
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,090
-Have you gifts?
-Yep.

565
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
-Food?
-Yep.

566
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,390
-Garlands, ribbons, wreaths?
-Check.

567
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,640
Spangles and "fandangles"?

568
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,560
The trinkets, the trimmings,
the trappings?

569
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,230
-Yep, we got 'em all.
-A tree?

570
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,780
See, Belle? I told you.

571
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,490
Well, we found one.

572
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,740
But it was on the piddlin' side of puny.

573
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,910
But did you look in the Black Forest?

574
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,910
There you will find a tree

575
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,290
better than any you can dream of.

576
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,840
Better? We gotta go, Belle!

577
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,380
-We gotta!
-Chip, we can't.

578
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,100
I... I promised your master
I wouldn't leave the castle grounds.

579
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,350
I gave my word.

580
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,180
Chin up, son.
There's a profound lesson here.

581
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,690
Keeping your word is much more
important than bringing joy to another.

582
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,900
You're twisting what I said.

583
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,950
Not at all. I agree with you.

584
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,160
Look after yourself.
Let the master do the same.

585
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,120
Never mind that the tree

586
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,500
was always his favorite part
of Christmas.

587
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,380
Please, Belle? Please?

588
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,800
It looks dangerous.

589
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,970
Mademoiselle,
you are in more danger

590
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,470
in this very room, I assure you.

591
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,930
All right.

592
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,810
-Yes!
-We'll take Phillippe.

593
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,980
If we hurry, we can be back by nightfall.

594
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,560
-Hurray!
-Au revoir, Monsieur Forte.

595
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,860
You'll keep my secret, won't you?

596
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,820
Of course, mademoiselle.

597
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,280
The master will remain
completely in the dark.

598
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,160
Au revoir, Fife.

599
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,500
Fife! I want you to follow her.

600
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,670
Make sure they don't come back.

601
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,130
Oh, yeah, but, Maestro, she's so nice.

602
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,680
When you're finished fawning, Fife,

603
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,640
perhaps you can recommend
someone else to play your solo.

604
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,100
No! I'm going. I'm going.

605
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,780
-Cogsworth!
-Oh, dear. Yes. Coming. Coming.

606
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,660
Cogsworth!

607
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,000
Running, running. Almost there.
You bellowed, sir?

608
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Find Belle. I... Uh...

609
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,380
Well, I...
She has to hear a song.

610
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,130
Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Uh, yes.

611
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,890
Splendid. Yes, well... Splendid.

612
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,010
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

613
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,020
Belle. Belle?

614
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,270
Where is she? Belle?

615
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,400
Careful, careful.

616
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,570
Too fast! Get out of the way! Stop!

617
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Huh!

618
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,650
Amateurs.

619
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,200
Belle? Here... Excuse me. Hello?

620
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,620
Has anyone seen Belle?
I can't find her anywhere.

621
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,830
And the master is demanding
to see her now.

622
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,410
-He's got a song he wants her to hear.
-Ho-ho.

623
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,670
Last I saw of her, she was going
with Chip to look for a Christmas tree.

624
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,340
Right. We must conduct
a search of the grounds.

625
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,180
-Lumiere, you're with me.
-Cogsworth!

626
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm waiting!

627
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,890
Oh, dear. Running, running, running.
I'm almost there, sir.

628
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,480
Mrs. Potts, stall the master.
All right, Lumiere, we're...

629
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,230
Lumiere? Wait, I'm leading.

630
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,480
Me first, you second.

631
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,370
Belle! Belle! Where is she?

632
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,120
Belle? Belle?

633
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,620
Belle, where are you?

634
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,960
Lumiere, wait.

635
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,040
Hmm?

636
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,380
The Black Forest!

637
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,090
Come along. Hurry now!

638
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,470
Oh, no.

639
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,470
This is catastrophic!

640
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,770
Cogsworth, quit dawdling.

641
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,980
I'm not dawdling. I'm waddling.

642
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,730
Well, don't waddle then.
We're in a hurry, you lazy old clock.

643
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,910
Hmm? Hmm?

644
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,420
Why am I still waiting?

645
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,210
-Mrs. Potts!
-Coming, sir! Coming!

646
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,630
What a brisk day!

647
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,300
Why, you look positively chilled
to the bone.

648
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,510
Where's Belle?

649
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,520
How about a nice cup of tea, sir?
Just a spot.

650
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,060
Hmm.

651
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,610
Forte, play Belle's song!

652
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,940
Hot.

653
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,280
You're not singing!

654
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,450
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

655
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,290
Fa-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

656
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,670
Louder!

657
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
'Tis the season

658
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,880
A bit more tea, sir?
Good for the heart, you know.

659
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,050
No, thank you.

660
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,130
-Just a spot?
-No more.

661
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,300
-Well, there's always room for tea, love.
-I said, "No more."

662
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,720
-Oh, dearie me!
-Mrs. Potts,

663
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,810
are you trying to distract me?

664
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,980
Goodness, no, sir.

665
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
Heavens. Is that a yellow-bellied,
double-breasted sapsucker?

666
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,150
-Rare this time of year.
-Enough! Where's Cogsworth?

667
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,360
-Where's Belle?
-Belle?

668
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,080
We can't find her, sir.

669
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,580
What?

670
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,040
Leave me!

671
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,710
Show me the girl.

672
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,720
-I will bring her back!
-No!

673
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,180
Um, she's abandoned you.

674
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,260
-Listen to your old friend, won't you?

675
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,560
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Led you astray?

676
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,480
No. But the girl...

677
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,190
The quickest way
to break your heart

678
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,940
Make you depressed and ill

679
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,160
ls to get tangled up inside

680
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,990
The side effects could kill

681
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,160
All passion is a waste of time

682
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,880
A deadly game pour vous

683
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,340
l am your friend
Your cher ami

684
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,050
l wouldn't lie to you

685
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,520
lf you must love someone
may l suggest

686
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,890
You love yourself
Just think it through

687
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,400
You'll never leave
and you will find you'll get more rest

688
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,820
You'll always feel
as good as new

689
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,030
Your freedom is the most
important thing, my friend

690
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,410
You must be strong
You mustn't bend

691
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,490
Don't talk for hours
Don't send flowers

692
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
Don't write poems
Don't sing songs and dance

693
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,410
Beneath the stars
that shine above

694
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,420
Don't fall in love

695
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,300
-Oh, don't do it.

696
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,960
Oh!

697
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:45,260
As soon as your heart
rules your head

698
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,850
Your life is not your own

699
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,810
lt's hell when someone's always there

700
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,810
lt's bliss to be alone

701
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,820
And love of any kind is bad

702
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,400
A dog, a child, a cat

703
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,990
They take up so much precious time

704
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,540
Now, where's the sense in that

705
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,960
Love takes the wildest heart
and makes it tame

706
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,300
lf you're turned on
then just turn off

707
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,880
Emotions are a thing
all great men overcame

708
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,140
Please, don't make
this grande catastrophe

709
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,640
Don't get attached
to anyone or anything

710
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,020
There's nothing worse
than things that cling

711
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,810
You'll go to pot
You'll turn to drink

712
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,520
You'll never rest
You'll end up mad

713
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,280
And looking like
some poor demented dove

714
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,910
Don't fall in love

715
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,160
Don't fall in love!

716
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

717
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,590
They cannot mix bells with holly.

718
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,300
Still, I have to admit,
not bad for amateurs.

719
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,360
I knew this was hopeless.

720
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,230
There. That's it! That's it!

721
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,770
Oh, Chip, it's perfect.

722
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,990
-Do you see her?
-Not yet. Now, come along. Hurry!

723
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,330
-You go on. I'll never make it.

724
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,300
Save yourself.

725
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,470
Ah, it will be summer
before we reach them.

726
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,300
What the... Whoa!

727
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,640
Oh, dear!

728
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,600
Faster! Faster!

729
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,980
I think we finally found a use for you.

730
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,690
Clock boarding! No, snow clocking!

731
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,990
Whatever!

732
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,490
Whoo!

733
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,450
Whoa!

734
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,040
-It's the best tree ever!
-Chip, you're right.

735
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:08,300
Merry Christmas!
And a happy Hanukkah!

736
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,090
We better hurry.
It's getting very stormy.

737
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,220
Again with the chopping.

738
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,600
Oh, I gotta do something.
Forte's counting on me.

739
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,110
Timber!

740
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,660
Phew!

741
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
Take it away, Phillippe!

742
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,170
Whoo!

743
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,540
Whoa!

744
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,590
Oh, no!

745
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,640
Aah! Aah! Aaah!

746
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,110
Fife?

747
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,150
Uh, hi, Belle.

748
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,360
Nice tree.

749
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,780
What are you doing way out here?

750
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,780
Uh, nothin'. I just was walkin'.

751
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,080
I mean, I love the bitter cold. I mean...
Hee, hee!

752
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,750
Phillippe!

753
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,720
Oh, no!

754
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,640
The tree, Belle!
We're gonna lose the tree!

755
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,270
Whoa!

756
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,100
Chip! Oh!

757
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,650
Where is he?

758
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,070
Whoa! Whoa!

759
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,420
Oh!

760
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,680
-Hold on, chérie. I will save you!
-Oh, dear!

761
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,770
Oh, no. Oh, gosh. Oh, no.
Oh, gosh. Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

762
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,520
Oh, no!

763
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,080
-Oh, Chip, thank goodness you're safe.
-I wasn't scared.

764
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,830
Oh, no! No!

765
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,650
Belle!

766
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,080
Oh, no, what have I done?

767
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,750
It's all my fault.

768
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:37,260
We all share some blame, mon ami,
for daring to hope for a Christmas.

769
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,820
You said you'd never leave.

770
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,450
I wasn't trying to leave.

771
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,000
I just wanted to make you happy.

772
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,590
You broke your word.

773
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:24,140
And for that, you will rot
in this dungeon forever.

774
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:30,560
I should have known
you'd never be anything but a beast.

775
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,070
Midnight.

776
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,610
Merry Christmas, Cogsworth.

777
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,990
If only it were.

778
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:51,160
Oh, my dear old friend,
I told you not to feel for her.

779
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:56,420
Things were so much simpler
before she came along,

780
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,510
before we dared to hope.

781
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:05,390
Oh, I thought she was the one.

782
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,560
Belle?

783
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,640
There she is.

784
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,150
-Merry Christmas.
-Doesn't look so special to me.

785
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,030
Oh, Chip, I'm sorry.

786
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,400
Nothing's changed.

787
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,160
I told you nothing would change.

788
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,200
I told you the master
would not allow this.

789
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,790
I told you
Christmas was a hopeless folly!

790
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,120
But

791
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,000
I was wrong.

792
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,340
When l felt lost

793
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,470
And lonely

794
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:52,890
Not a dream in my head

795
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,060
Your words lifted my spirits

796
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,270
High

797
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,240
Remember what

798
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,740
You said

799
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:14,620
As Iong as there's Christmas

800
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:19,670
l truly believe

801
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:26,380
That hope is the greatest

802
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:32,560
Of the gifts we'II receive

803
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:36,270
-As long as
-As long as

804
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,610
Our guiding star

805
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,320
Shines above

806
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,030
There'll always be

807
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:55,410
Christmas

808
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,790
So there aIways

809
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:02,090
Will be a time

810
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,970
When the world
is filled with peace

811
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:15,350
And love

812
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:26,320
Ah, it tears me up
to see you this way, master.

813
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,570
Why do you torment yourself?

814
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,660
There's the symbol of your curse.

815
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,450
Destroy it, and end
these adolescent notions

816
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,870
of love and redemption.

817
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,750
End your pain forever.

818
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,460
Yes! Do it!

819
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:51,050
Smash it!

820
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,520
Belle?

821
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,020
What are you doing? What is it?

822
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,320
Oh, a storybook.

823
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:18,410
Does this one have pretty pictures
you can color?

824
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,040
Utterly dreadful, master.

825
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:26,000
No! This one's different. It's from Belle.

826
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:29,590
Well, that would account
for the creative wrapping.

827
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,880
Quiet!

828
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,090
I want to read.

829
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,600
"Once upon a time,
there was an enchanted castle.

830
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:49,150
"lts master seemed as cold as winter.
Deep inside his heart...

831
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,360
"His cries of anger echoed through
the stone wall of the castle.

832
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:56,910
"Though surrounded by servants,
he was all alone.

833
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,950
"And in that simple act of kindness,

834
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,580
"he knew someone cared.

835
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,540
"Christmas that year was spent
exchanging humble gifts.

836
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,920
"But the greatest gift
that anyone received

837
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,840
"was the gift of hope."

838
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,350
Hmm.

839
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,010
Hope.

840
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,940
-No, master! Come back!

841
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,940
She'll only prolong your torment!

842
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,370
You know what, Belle? I don't need
a tree to celebrate Christmas.

843
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:41,240
-And I can do without mistletoe.

844
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,210
-Well, I don't need tinsel.
-Oh, I don't need holly.

845
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,620
-And I don't need a wreath.
-I don't need ornaments!

846
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:49,630
-And I don't need turkey!
-I don't need stuffing!

847
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:52,840
I don't need pudding!

848
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,470
To each his own, my friend
You know how to get me stressed

849
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,800
But when it comes to
making Christmas speciaI...

850
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,470
l'm a cut above the rest

851
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,810
lf you could see things clearly
you would say that l've been blessed

852
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,640
You can't hold a candle
to my timing

853
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,190
l'm a cut above the rest

854
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,900
You belong side by side
You should never be apart

855
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:17,240
'Cause when you're both together
you're really twice as smart

856
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,320
"Twice as smart."
She does have a point.

857
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,660
Yes, well, two heads
are better than one.

858
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,960
They say that as a team
we have got to be the best

859
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,540
Now we found something
we both agree on

860
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,170
We're a cut above the rest

861
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,760
There's no doubt that as a team
we two are the very best

862
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,220
Everyone who knows us must agree

863
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,930
We're a cut above the rest

864
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,350
There's no doubt that as a team
you two are the very best

865
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,020
Everyone who knows you must agree

866
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,390
-We're a cut
-A cut above

867
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,150
Above the rest

868
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,900
Uh-oh! It's the master!

869
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,400
Uh, Belle...

870
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,170
Can you forgive me?

871
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,550
Of course. Merry Christmas.

872
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,300
-All right!

873
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,100
Let's give Belle the Christmas
she's always wanted.

874
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,350
So, Beast gets girl,

875
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,560
and it's a happy ending for everyone.

876
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,650
Enchantment lifted,

877
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,740
and Forte fades into the background.

878
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,160
No longer important. No longer needed.

879
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,910
I think not!

880
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,090
What is it, Mama? What's happening?

881
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,140
Watch out!

882
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,440
Forte!

883
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,770
-Whoa!
-Hurry, now. Hurry.

884
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,700
Can you believe I never took a lesson?

885
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,530
Belle!

886
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,620
-Oh, no!
-Belle!

887
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,870
Help!

888
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,130
Oh, no.

889
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,060
Maestro! Stop!

890
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,980
-What do you think you're doing?
-Don't you see, Fife?

891
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,360
They can't fall in love if they're dead.

892
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,530
I'll tell you what I see.
A big, old windbag!

893
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,450
You could've joined me, Fife,

894
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:08,410
but I see my triumph is a solo act.

895
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,710
My solo... It's blank!

896
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,670
So naive.

897
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,340
-No! No, no!
-You're second fiddle, Fife,

898
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,340
and that's all you'll ever be.

899
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,420
Forte!

900
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,260
We can remain as we are
forever and ever!

901
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,770
Forte!

902
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,660
Enough!

903
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,780
Heavens! Master.

904
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,580
You're not singing.

905
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,420
Careful.

906
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,350
Oh, no, the bell jar!

907
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,060
-Whoa! Got it. Got it.
-Oh, careful.

908
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:22,150
Is this happy enough for you, master?

909
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:26,650
I know I'm downright giddy!

910
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,490
Oh!

911
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,870
Master, the keyboard.

912
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,600
-You got it?
-Got it. Got it.

913
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,310
Whoa!

914
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,030
Help!

915
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:17,160
No!

916
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,380
Forte.

917
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,430
Oh, yes, it is lovely.

918
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,940
And you said it was impossible.

919
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,600
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

920
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,110
I said it was impossible without me.

921
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,650
-Everyone, shh-shh! Here they come.
-Wow!

922
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,200
The setting is perfect.

923
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:57,080
Oh, aren't they beautiful?

924
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,290
-It's wonderful!

925
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,130
Hurray!

926
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,680
And what a wonderful Christmas it was.

927
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,180
I suppose if anyone saved Christmas,
it was Belle.

928
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,600
Merry Christmas, one and all!

929
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,690
-Merry Christmas.
-And merry Christmas to you, sir.

930
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:25,440
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

931
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,240
I believe we have
a little something for you, Chip.

932
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,360
A present? Oh, boy! Thank you.

933
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:34,030
Open it!

934
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:39,370
Look, Mama! A storybook!
Would you read it to me?

935
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,080
-I'd love to, son.
-Oh, boy!

936
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:48,050
Maestro?

937
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,680
-Yes, master?
-Would you do us the honor, old friend?

938
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,100
I'd be delighted.
