2
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,563
Merry Christmas.

3
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,883
Merry Christmas to one and all.

4
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,567
Give a penny for the poor, governor.
Penny for the poor.

5
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,885
Bah.

6
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,125
My partner, Jacob Marley,
dead seven years today.

7
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,966
Ah, he was a good one.

8
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,324
He robbed from the widows
and swindled the poor.

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,484
In his will, he left me enough money
to pay for his tombstone.

10
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,810
Ha. And I had him buried at sea.

11
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
Oh, ah, uh.

12
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,447
Good morning, Mr. Scrooge.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,765
Cratchit, what are you doing
with that piece of coal?

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,164
I was just trying to
thaw out the ink.

15
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,080
Bah. You used a piece last week.

16
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,446
Now, get on with your work,
Cratchit.

17
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,481
Speaking of work, Mr. Scrooge,
tomorrow is Christmas,

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,321
and I was wondering
if I could have half a day off.

19
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,006
Christmas, huh?

20
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,446
I suppose so.

21
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,286
But I'll dock you half a day's pay.

22
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,487
Now, let's see,
I pay you two shillings a day.

23
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,962
Two shillings and a halfpenny, sir.

24
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,126
Oh, yes. I gave you that
raise three years ago.

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,726
Yes, sir, when I started
doing your laundry.

26
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,647
All right, Cratchit,
get busy while I go over my books.

27
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,963
Oh, and here. Here's another
bundle of shirts for you.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,001
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,809
Let's see now, 50 pounds,
10 shillings from McDuff.

30
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,565
Plus his 80% interest
compounded daily.

31
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,648
Money, money, money.

32
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,604
Merry Christmas.

33
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,803
And a merry Christmas to you,
Master Fred.

34
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,724
Bah, humbug.

35
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,882
Merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,202
What's so merry about it?

37
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,682
I'll tell you what Christmas is,
it's just another work day.

38
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,368
And any jackanapes who thinks else
should be boiled in his own pudding.

39
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,931
Oh.

40
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,686
But, sir, Christmas is a
time for giving.

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,286
A time to be with one's family.

42
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,529
I say, bah, humbug.

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,048
I don't care.
I say, merry Christmas.

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,043
Merry Christmas.

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,690
Well said, Master Fred.

46
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,208
Cratchit, what are you doing?

47
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,126
Uh, heh. I was just trying
to keep my hands warm, sir.

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,811
Hmph.

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,689
And what are you doing here, nephew?

50
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,051
I've come to give you a wreath
and invite you to Christmas dinner.

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,489
Well, I suppose you're going
to have plump goose

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,324
- with chestnut dressing.
- Yup.

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,051
And will you have plum pudding
and lemon sauce?

54
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,049
Yeah. Boy, oh, boy.

55
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,402
And candied fruits
with spiced sugar cakes?

56
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,244
Yeah. Will you come?

57
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,731
Are you daft, man?

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,089
You know I can't eat that stuff.

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,084
Here's your wreath back.
Now out, out, out.

60
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,008
Bah, humbug.

61
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,323
Merry Christmas.

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,362
And a "bah, humbug" to you.

63
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,207
Ha, ha. That Fred, always
so full of kindness.

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,086
Aye, he always was a little peculiar.

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,407
And stubborn.

66
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,928
Ooh, heh, heh, heh.

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,686
Customers.
I'll handle this, Cratchit.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
Yes, what can I do
for you two gentlemen?

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,364
Sir, we are soliciting funds
for the indigent and destitute.

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,760
For the what?

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,930
We're collecting for the poor.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,444
Oh. Aha.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,127
Well, um, you realize
if you give money to the poor,

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,442
they won't be poor anymore,
will they?

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,206
- Well, uh...
- And if they're not poor anymore,

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,408
then you won't have to raise money
for them anymore.

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,046
VVell, I suppose...

78
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,442
And if you don't have to raise money
for them anymore,

79
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,802
then you would be out of a job.

80
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,885
Oh, please, gentlemen,
don't ask me to put you out of a job.

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,886
- Not on Christmas Eve.
- We wouldn't do that, Mr. Scrooge.

82
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,330
Well, then, I suggest
you give this to the poor and begone.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,922
What's this world coming to,
Cratchit?

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,766
You work all your life to get money,
and people want you to give it away.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,480
Hmm. Two minutes fast.

86
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,247
Well, never mind those two minutes.
You may go now.

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,569
Oh, thank you, sir.
You're so kind.

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,527
Never mind the mushy stuff. Just go.

89
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,206
But be here all the earlier
the next day.

90
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,886
I will. I will, sir.
And a "bah humbug..."

91
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,171
I mean, a merry Christmas
to you, sir.

92
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,051
Bah.

93
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,366
Scrooge.

94
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,250
Jacob Marley?

95
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,648
No, that can't be.

96
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,091
Ow.

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,690
Oh. Gosh.

98
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,165
Bah.

99
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,851
Ebenezer Scrooge.

100
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,251
Go away.

101
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,771
Ebenezer Scrooge...

102
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,683
Gosh, kind of slippery.

103
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,606
Scrooge, don't you recognize me?

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,526
I was your partner, Jacob Marley.

105
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,885
Marley, it is you.

106
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,605
Ebenezer, remember when
I was alive,

107
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,524
I robbed the widows
and swindled the poor?

108
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,803
Yes, and all in the same day.

109
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,249
- Oh, you had class, Jacob.
- Heh, heh, heh. Yup.

110
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,849
No, no. I was wrong.

111
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,610
And so as punishment,

112
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,362
I'm forced to carry these heavy
chains through eternity.

113
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,244
Maybe even longer.

114
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,684
There's no hope. I'm doomed.

115
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,606
Doomed.

116
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,724
And the same thing will
happen to you,

117
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,087
Ebenezer Scrooge.

118
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,323
No. No, it can't.

119
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,322
It mustn't.

120
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,210
Help me, Jacob.

121
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,281
Tonight you'll be visited
by three spirits.

122
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,447
Listen to them, do what they say.

123
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,691
Or your chains will be heavier
than mine.

124
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,769
Farewell, Ebenezer.

125
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,769
Farewell.

126
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,002
Marley, watch out for that first...

127
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,606
...step.

128
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,481
Spirits. Heh.

129
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,800
Humbug.

130
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,088
What, what, what?

131
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,811
Ahem.

132
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,881
What?

133
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,248
Well, it's about time.
Haven't got all night, you know.

134
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,164
Who... Who are you?

135
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,450
Why, I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past.

136
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,327
Oh, I thought you'd be taller.

137
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,442
Hmph. Listen, Scrooge,
if men were measured by kindness,

138
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,530
you'd be no bigger than
a speck of dust.

139
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,765
Kindness is of little use
in this world.

140
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,169
You didn't always think so.

141
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,562
- Come on, Scrooge, it's time to go.
- Then go.

142
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,606
Spirit, what are you doing?

143
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,690
We're gonna visit your past.

144
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,403
I'm not going out there.
I'll fall.

145
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,647
Just hold on. Whoop.

146
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,964
Not too tight now.

147
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,530
Whoa, oh, oh.

148
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,010
Spirit, look out!

149
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,243
What's wrong, Scrooge?

150
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,809
I thought you enjoyed looking down
on the world.

151
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,565
Spirit, I believe I know this place.

152
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,409
Yes, it's old Fezzywig's.

153
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,291
I couldn't have worked
for a kinder man.

154
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,763
Why, it's old Fezzywig himself.
And all of my very dearest friends.

155
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,763
And that shy lad in the corner,
that's me.

156
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,286
Yes, that was before you became
a miserable miser consumed by greed.

157
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,204
Well, nobody's perfect.

158
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,602
And there, there's lovely Isabel.

159
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,246
Ebenezen

160
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,286
- Ebenezen
- Yes, Isabel?

161
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,489
My eyes are closed,
my lips are puckered,

162
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,366
and I'm standing under the mistletoe.

163
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,810
You're also standing on my foot.

164
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,610
Oh, I remember
how much I was in love with her.

165
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,402
In ten years' time,
you learned to love something else.

166
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,762
Why, it's my counting house.

167
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,684
Nine thousand nine
hundred and seventy-two.

168
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,844
- Nine thousand...
- Ebenezer.

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,604
Yes? What is it?

170
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,722
For years, I've had this honeymoon
cottage, Ebenezer.

171
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,767
I've been waiting for you
to keep your promise to marry me.

172
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,322
Now I must know,
have you made your decision?

173
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,366
I have. Your last payment on
the cottage was an hour late.

174
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,124
I'm foreclosing the mortgage.

175
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,090
You loved your gold
more than that precious creature.

176
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,642
And you lost her forever.

177
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,610
Nine thousand nine
hundred and seventy...

178
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,447
...three.

179
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,443
Please, spirit, I can no
longer bear these memories.

180
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,721
Take me home.

181
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,761
Remember, Scrooge,
you fashioned these memories yourself.

182
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,209
Why was I so foolish?

183
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,130
Why? Why?

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,411
What's this?

185
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,364
Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell...

186
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,529
I mean, I smell

187
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,082
a stingy little Englishman.

188
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,050
I think I do.

189
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,765
Yeah, I do.

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,764
Please, let me go.

191
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,126
Don't eat me.

192
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,081
Why would the Ghost
of Christmas Present, that's me,

193
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,562
want to eat a distasteful little miser
like you?

194
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,370
Especially when there are so many
good things to enjoy in life. See?

195
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,811
Ooh. Mince pies.

196
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,646
Turkeys.

197
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,170
Suckling Pig-

198
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,041
And don't forget the chocolate pot roast
with pishmachio...

199
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,601
Uh, with smishmachio... Uh, with...

200
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,125
With yogurt.

201
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,169
But where did all this come from?

202
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,049
From the heart, Scrooge.

203
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,809
It's the food of generosity.

204
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,045
Which you have long denied
your fellow man.

205
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,611
Generosity. Ha!

206
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,730
Nobody has ever shown me generosity.

207
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,486
You've never given them reason to.

208
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,645
And yet, there are some who still find
enough warmth in their hearts

209
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,883
even for the likes of you.

210
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,721
No acquaintance of mine, I assure you.

211
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,968
Uh, you'll see.

212
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,411
Here we are.

213
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,526
Why did you bring me to this old shack?

214
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,004
This is the home of your overworked,
underpaid employee, Bob Cratchit.

215
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,208
What's she cooking?
A canary?

216
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,248
Surely they have more food than that.

217
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,730
Look on the fire.

218
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,165
That's your laundry.

219
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,725
Not yet, children.
We must wait for Tiny Tim.

220
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,166
Coming, Father.

221
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,085
I'm coming.

222
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,451
Oh, my, look at all the wonderful
things to eat.

223
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,561
We must thank Mr. Scrooge.

224
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,289
Tell me, spirit,
what's wrong with that kind lad?

225
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,010
Much, I'm afraid.

226
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,362
If these shadows remain unchanged,

227
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,085
I see an empty chair
where Tiny Tim once sat.

228
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,760
Then that means Tim will...

229
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,290
Where did they go?

230
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,882
Spirit, where are you?

231
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,966
Don't go. You must tell me about Tim.

232
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,561
Don't go.

233
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,370
Where did...

234
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,567
Who are you?

235
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,526
Are you the Ghost of Christmas Future?

236
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,123
Please, speak to me.

237
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,167
Tell me, what will happen to Tiny Tim?

238
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,404
Oh, no.

239
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,805
Spirit, I didn't want this to happen.

240
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,691
Tell me these events
can yet be changed.

241
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,850
I've never seen a funeral like this one.

242
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,887
Aye, no mourners,
no friends to bid him farewell.

243
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,847
Oh, well, let's rest a minute
afore we fill it in, eh?

244
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,043
He ain't going nowheres.

245
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,247
Spirit.

246
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,522
Whose lonely grave is this?

247
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,841
Why, yours, Ebenezer.

248
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,210
The richest man in the cemetery.

249
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,570
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Please.

250
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,885
No,no,no.

251
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,564
I'll change.

252
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,448
Spirit, let me out, let me out.
I'll... Eh?

253
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,242
Oh, I'm back in my own room.

254
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,806
It's Christmas morning.
I haven't missed it.

255
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,611
The spirits have given me
another chance.

256
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,445
Oh, I know just what I'll do.

257
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,529
They'll be so surprised.

258
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,571
What a wonderful day.

259
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,451
Oh, there's so much to do.
Oh, so much to do.

260
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,762
I can't go out like this.

261
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,003
There, that's better.

262
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,122
Yay!

263
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,721
Merry Christmas
to one and all.

264
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,644
Well, bless me.
Good morning, gentlemen.

265
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,962
I have something for you.

266
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,568
Twenty gold sovereigns. Oh, no.

267
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,008
Not enough? Well, all right.

268
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,609
Fifty gold sovereigns.

269
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,562
- Really, Mr. Scrooge, it's...
- Still not enough?

270
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,724
Aye, you drive a hard bargain.
Here you are.

271
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,323
One hundred gold pieces.

272
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,880
And not a penny more.
Not a penny more.

273
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,123
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.
Thank you.

274
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,965
And a merry Christmas to you.

275
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,249
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

276
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,769
Oh, nephew.

277
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,890
Uncle Scrooge.

278
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,522
I'm looking forward
to that wonderful meal of yours.

279
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,763
Well, I'll be doggone.

280
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,444
You mean you're coming?

281
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,761
Of course I am.

282
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,845
You know how much I like candied fruits
with spiced sugar cakes.

283
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,969
I'll be over promptly at 2:00.
Keep it piping hot.

284
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,841
I will, Uncle Scrooge. I will.

285
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,288
And a very merry Christmas to you.

286
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,406
Merry Christmas,
and keep the change.

287
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,605
Wonderful lads.

288
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,683
And now for Cratchit.

289
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,045
Why, Mr. Scrooge.
Uh, merry Christmas.

290
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,884
- Won't you come in?
- Merry Christmas. Huh.

291
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,687
I have another bundle for you.

292
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,162
But, sir, it's Christmas day.

293
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,249
Christmas day, indeed.

294
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,246
Just another excuse for being lazy.

295
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,245
And another thing, Cratchit.

296
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,525
I've had enough of this
half-day-off stuff.

297
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,681
You leave me no alternative
but to give you...

298
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,962
- Toys.
- Yes, toys.

299
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,485
No,no,no.

300
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,203
I'm giving you a raise,
and making you my partner.

301
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,925
A Partner?

302
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,323
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

303
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,044
Merry Christmas, Bob.

304
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,647
And God bless us, every one.

305
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,063
