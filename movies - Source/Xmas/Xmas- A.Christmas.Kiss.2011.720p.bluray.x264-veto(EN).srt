Take part in ballet ?

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,167
Then , on this occasion ?
- Just go out with the girls.

53
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,833
This does not look good .

54
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,433

- Rosy cheeks are you .

58
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,833
All shining , and it's not the glitter .

59
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,500
I was with a handsome guy in
an elevator that suddenly has started to fall .

60
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,833
I thought we die .
And then he kissed me .

61
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,967
Oh no ! - You bet !

62
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,767
And I retorted
kiss . - You did not!

63
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,500
It was a kiss

64
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:33,033
which I was to remember and when I
old , forgetful and in diapers .

65
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:37,433
And that spark . Spark is .

66
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I've never experienced arcing .

67
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,233
I hope you've learned about him
name and took the phone number .

68
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,833
I did not . - What?

69
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,167
Are you kidding me ? - I do not .

70
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:53,167
There was some kind of a Christmas choir
and it was crazy , I had to run away ,

71
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:59,233
But you know what? She obeyed
You and I relaxed . I. ..

72
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,567
The feeling is wonderful.
- Who is this guy ?

73
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:09,900
It does not matter , because if we are destined
be together , I'll find it .

74
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,033
Or would he find me .

75
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,567
Hello , ladies . - Hi !

76
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,433
Who am I kidding ? I will not
see him again , right?

77
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Will . I'm sure of it .

78
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,833
And if you can not see it , it's nice to see
back to the old Becky . - That's right.

79
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,233
Thank you , girls . - A night
has just begun ... - It's true .

Do not dock until
I hear what you seek .

127

The foundation of my family 's patron
Ballet " The Nutcracker " at the City Theatre ,

130
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:09,100

00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:37,300
What purpose this hanged man? - Wendy
revealed who the guy in the elevator .

Would not that be good ?
- Would that not accidentally boy Miss . Hall .

136
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,633
Come on ! - And what's worse ...

137
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,233
I do not even recognize . Not even close .

138
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:53,900
Honestly , you were incognito . - Are
you sure he did not recognize .

139
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,833
Maybe, but since he is sleeping with your
boss did not want to reveal it in front of her .

140
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,233
You should tell him that it was you .

141
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,833
If you feel
spark , and he certainly is .

142
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,433
What am I supposed to say ?

143
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,900
" Hey , Adam , do not you recognize me ,
But you kissed me in the elevator .

144
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,500
And yes , I work for your
's future wife .

145
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,033
How dare you not recognize me ?

146
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,833
You may have škljokice , but
I am. You're supposed to see that. "

147
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:25,167
He is male . They insight
things . They should all draw .

148
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:32,100
No. I will concentrate more on the job and
forget the spark , and kiss him .

149
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:35,233
Good luck to you !
- Anyway, the constant traveling .

150
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,633
Probably more I will not even see it .

151
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:41,900
I would tell him . not
You can ignore the spark .

152
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,433
I bet he's the right one .

153
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,233
This is not a film
scenario , but my life .

154
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:54,367
No! The spark is officially off .
- Liar. - Why ?

155
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,767
Poor . - Shut up !

156

Do you remember that trip

215
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,833
My roots are in the theater .

216
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,967
And my whole life revolves around it .

217
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,300
Unfortunately , we are replicas
related only to finance .

218
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,900
I worked for Art Direction
" Midsummer night " in Berkshire .

Well you know Shakespeare.

226
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,900
Why did you leave the theater ?

227
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,833
I do not know . Due to the pressures of real life .

228
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,300
Because opportunities to start a lucrative business .

229
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,433

While he has no idea about it .

234
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
That would be torture .

235
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,233
For me it's fate .

236
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,900
Merged you spell romance and Christmas.

237
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,567
It is not fate , but a golden opportunity ,

The right of the nail ! - I know .

This could be my
amazing opportunity .

243
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,033
I think it's fate .
How do you see it ?

244
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,100
You had another
amorous encounter in the elevator .

245
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,433

Darling, shall we try biscuits ?

288
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:08,100
In addition to theater patrons ,

289
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:13,300
should invite more
several notables at the party.

290
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:21,967
Keep in mind that the theater
most important patrons .

291
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:27,900
Sure , but Christmas is ...
And as you said ,

292
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:32,900

first joint Christmas in Boston .

Do you know that there are first
release " a Christmas song ?"

Of course I do .

302
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:20,233
We could use
as inspiring for the draft .

303
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,167
It's a terrible idea .

304
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:25,167
First of all , " a Christmas story "
is totally overrated .

305
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,033
It is a slag .

306
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:30,167
But Mr. Hughes is tied to the book.

307
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:33,433
It is not sentimental reception ,

308
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:39,100
but should impress Adam's room.
The only thing that 's important to me . And him .

309
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,500
But if you expect it to be the celebration
engagement , it should be mushy .

310
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,833
Absolutely not! Neither Adam nor I have
time for sensitivity, .

311
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,433
Retrieve my good ice sculptures
and a pair of artificial trees božiænih .

312
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:54,167
Make sure that everything is
completely white.

313
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,833
I have not apologized
how do you know Adam ?

You mean you're all
planned in advance ?

317
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,767
It is a bit ...

318
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,500
The calculated ?

319
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,167
Of course it was The calculated .

320
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,100

And tell us the modes of
life completely coincide .

322

What brings you here ?

335

Nice to have you back in Boston .

00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:09,100
Tell me , Charlie . how
did you know that she's the one ?

341
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,433
That was clear after
our first kiss .

342
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,900
My heart fluttered .

343
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,433
And after 39 years , her kisses
still have the same effect .

344
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,567
You are about to jump ?

345
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,567
I'm thinking about it .

346
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:44,633
Already have purchased the ring , which
tells you quite sure .

347
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:50,167
I was more than sure
when I bought it .

348
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:53,833
But since I came back to Boston ...

349
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,033
I do not know .
- Evora ? Blinking heart ?

350
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,100
I do not understand .

351
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:07,167
Evora means that you
prevents something from inside .

352
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:11,100
What indicates that you
you should give it up .

353
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:14,633
But if your heart is flashing ...

354
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,300
Then she must have those rights .

355
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,233
And what if at the same time have
and Evora , and treperiš ,

356
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:28,500
and if the Evora result of guilt over
spontaneous kiss in the elevator ...

357
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,833
What is your heart flutter ?

358
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:35,500
In this case you would
wished luck , Mr. Hughes .

359
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,300
Thank you very much , Charlie .

360
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,567
You're late for 4 minutes . - I believe that we will
all will be forgiven when you see my drawings .

361
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:13,433
The drafts ? - I was very inspired
Adam's homes and collections ,

362
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,633
so I made plans .
I worked almost all night .

363
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:23,700
Nedoraðene are still just sketches .

364
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,300
Are extremely ...

365
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,567
Deflecting .

366
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,767
How do you , for God's sake , the idea to
Adam might like something like this ?

367
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,567
Because of his first
editions of " a Christmas song ."

368
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:41,300
I like " Wuthering Heights " , but it does not
means that I want to live in a swamp .

369
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:47,033
Wendy , I'm extremely disappointed .
These sketches are just ...

370
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:50,900
Another three a Christmas tree.
Who has three a Christmas tree ?

371
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,500
And that's right . It was horrible .

372
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:58,767
The first tree to represent
of Christmas past , present other ,

373
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:04,833
a recent future . I crossed my mind
to make ornaments for the tree for the future of Christmas ,

374
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,167
could make the children of artistic
programs that support the " Foundation Hughes ."

375
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,500
Is that right ?

376
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,967
It will be a social event , not
artistic workshops childrens' kindergartens .

377
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,233
Children are the future .
- My not .

378
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,567
These sketches are utterly unacceptable .

379
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:24,633
Remove them . - proud
I was on these sketches .

380
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,833
You have no reason to be .

381
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,833
Good morning ! How are you ?
- Good .

382
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,433
Come on , look at my drawings .
The whole night I was working on them .

383
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,433
Good morning , Wendy .
- Morning .

384
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:58,500
Still astonishes me your talent .
- Thank you, darling , it's my job .

385
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,500
Can I be completely honest ?

386
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:03,500
Sure .

387
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,633
I'm looking for something like this
this year . I 'm , you know ...

388
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,700
Something more traditional .

389
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,100
That's what I 'd expected , so I created
Another draft , so he could choose .

390
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:25,300
He was still confused,
but you'll understand the idea .

391
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,233
I just asked for this .

392
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,767
I can not believe how you managed
capture exactly what I wanted .

393
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,500
Three the Christmas tree ,
past, present and future .

394
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:54,433
This is zadivljujuæe .
- A tree for the future ...

395
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,833
Decorations could make children from one
of your sponsorship projects .

396
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:06,767
This is great ! Incredible !
The whole idea is so Enhanced Hair .

397
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,833
I love it. Absolutely .

398
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:13,033
I totally see through .

Thank you for this perfect sketch .
I can not wait to see them completed .

400
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:21,767
I have to go . I have a meeting .
Thank you very much , Wendy . - Hi !

401
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
It 's great past . - Yes.

402
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:33,300
Think you've captured the essence .
- I am. - Not true .

403
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,833
Your idea was
completely missed .

404
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,233
You're playing with the life of a young
lady! - These are my sketches !

You work for me , so that your work and my work .

As long as I give you wages ,

407
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:48,767
That's not fair !
- Do you remember , Wendy ?

408
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,833
I think you just can not open
Rights doors in this city .

409
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,900
But if you prijeðeš , I'll see

In addition , I want to see how

who will know that they are mine.

427
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,767
Lord!

428

Lord, I am not Adam
allowed to see her like this.

00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,100
If you really loved her, did not
matter how you look. - That's right.

482
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,833
Ubuduæe will I constantly think like this.

483
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,167
No one can not see me like this.

484
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,833
I need to look perfect for engagement ,
that would be a headline .

485
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:57,233
If Adam sees me like this ...
What should I do?

486
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,567
I'll go to New York.

487
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:08,767
I will go to my mother's with plastic
surgeon and he will quickly solve the problem .

488
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,433
Adam can not see me like this.

489
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,633
But what are we to decorating the house ?

490
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:21,967
You're responsible for everything , until I get back .

491
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,100
What I will say to Adam ? - If I had to
suddenly go out of town on business .

492
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,633
Nothing weird .

493
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:35,100
Damn it ! < / i >

494
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,567
You know what this means ?

495
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:50,167
That we mortals can vent .

496
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:53,967
Staying alone with Adam .

497
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,633
That's it.

498
00:41:57,233 --> 00:42:01,300
Finally it dawned on you ? - I guess .

00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:04,833
Come on , waiting for a lot of us

Too bad you do not Priscilla
can see this . - Thank you .

502
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,567
We're making progress . - That's right.

We're ready for the trees . USA
they are on the right. - Oh, trees .

504
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,433
You're going to get them ? - Yes .
I like to buy them at night .

505
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:18,500
The Christmas lighting gives them a real vibe.

506
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:22,633
You intend to bring herself three trees ?

507
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,033
That was my intention .

508
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,033
I can not let you do that .

509
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:32,167
Not very . I'll go with you .
- I really did not need , can alone .

510
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:35,967
When you are dealing Interiors ,
get used to your hands full .

511
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:41,433
I'll make you feel better if you let me
help you . - Good . Come on.

512
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,767
What is the " pudding with figs ?"

513
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,767
I do not know , but it must be very tasty ,
doèim not want to leave until you get .

514
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:28,367
Sure . Perfect.
- Probably everyone sing .

515
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,567
They will get bored by the end of the evening . - It will not !

516
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,500
The Christmas songs I can never get bored .

517
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:38,833
When I was little , I went
I was at the tree with my dad .

518
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:45,233
We went to the farm and Derby Hill
literally plunged into the forest trees .

519
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,100
It would take at least an hour ,
While we chose perfectly .

520
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,767
Sounds like a revived
Norman Rockwell painting .

521
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,433
Exactly so .

522
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:59,767
Then we went home , cooked
cocoa and decorated tree and the same night .

523
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,900
And then we would with okiæeno
tree sat in front of the TV,

524
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,100
and watch the Christmas movies .
- What are your favorite ?

525
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,833
" Charlie Brown Christmas " , of course .

526
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,233
" The Grinch " , " Wonderful Life "
and " a Christmas story " .

527
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,367
Special memories .

528
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,300
Are .

529
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,700
This is nice . - Yes , it's perfect .

530
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,900
Tonight was the first time elected
the Christmas tree . - Are you kidding? - I do not .

531
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:49,433
In our house were submitted to the Christmas tree.

532
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,367
My father has traveled extensively , mother
was constantly busy .

533
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:56,833
And at Christmas we had
a special meaning .

534
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,167
Apart from my grandmother . it
it was she seemed special .

535
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,900
It is still ... - ... Not Dies
the prior 15 years . - My condolences .

536
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:15,900
There is still a lot of thinking about
her. She held the family together .

537
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:20,767
How did you engage in
work with the theater ?

538
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,167
In the middle I wanted to become an actor .

539
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:30,633
I trained at drama
section and learned by heart

540
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:35,100
all the famous Hamlet's soliloquies .

541
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,633
When I finished the shootout ,
Hall remained in torment .

542
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,100
I could hear the flies .

543
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:49,967
I was full of myself , I'm viewing it
Good Performance broken down by your feet.

544
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:58,167
And after a whole eternity , the teacher
was the first to react , I wondered :

545
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:04,167
"Adam, Do you realize that Hamlet speaks
suicide in this monologue ? "

546
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:07,900
So I decided to work behind the scenes .

547
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,767
And it very much .

548
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,967
Tressa ! Caroline !
Hi ! - Hi !

549
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,567

00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,167
Hi , Adam !
- How are you ? - Good .

551

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,633
What are the Canol ?
- Rules of them this morning .

553
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:34,833
Often eat what you cook a dish
at work ? - I like to lick the spoon .

554
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,033
In fact it is stated on Facebook
as one of their pastime .

555
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,167
She received quite a few strange
friend requests . - That's right.

556
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,433
We talked about past Christmas.

557
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:50,633
Have you dug up some old ghosts ?

558
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:56,567
Actually we did. Several .

559
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,500
That 's what I thought .

560
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,233
You're funny .

561
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,233
I Hi ! - Hi ! delivery

00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:11,100
Here you are. - Where do you want to

563
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,900
Lots of boxes. - Yes . They arrived decorations
the tree of past and present Christmas.

564
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:54,367
Children today are doing decorations for the tree
future Christmas. To arrive tomorrow .

565
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:56,100
Tomorrow arrives since Christmas. - Yes .

566
00:48:56,233 --> 00:49:01,500
But what would happen if tomorrow
be present , and the future arrives ?

567
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:05,567
I do not understand ... Well ,
Stephen Hawking .

568
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,167
I have a surprise .

569
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:09,967
Pudding with figs .

570
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,433
How did you managed to find ?
- Not so easy .

571
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,833
Do not even look like
pudding . - It looks disgusting .

572
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,767
Yes.

573
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,967
You first . - No, ladies
have an advantage . Here you go .

574
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,500
Yet I am a gentleman .

575
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:34,433
And his taste is disgusting .

576
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:42,833
More like a fruit cake . - And I
I'll stick to dried figs .

577
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:48,100
But , thank you for this interesting ...
experience . - You're welcome .

578
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,233
I need to decorate the tree of Christmas past .

579
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,833
Would you help me?

580
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:56,900
With pleasure .

581
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,767
Hangs it up .

582
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:07,167
Where ? - Up there .

583
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,767
Here ? - Yes . Perfect.

584
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,900
Look at this .

585
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,100
She's beautiful .

586
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,433
Excellent. Right here .

587
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,033
And this ?

588
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,700
On the other side .

589
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,167
Here ? - Can .

590
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,100
Grandma would have loved this .

591
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,100
Liked her all this .

592
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:57,100
With her Christmas was warm and family ,
atypically for the rest of the Hughes family .

593
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,900
Before his death we donated
that Dickens book for Christmas.

594
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,500
It was a really special gift .

595
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:17,767
Because she had nothing . She sold
family jewelry to make me buy it.

596
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:25,767
Family Hughes has unlimited resources
and could buy hundreds of such books .

597
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:31,033
But I wanted her to buy their
money ... Especially for me .

598
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:36,567
Only now I understand how
this book is special .

599
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:41,233
I 'm glad you like blueprints .

600
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:43,233
I love it.

601
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,767
I was a little surprised that the
Priscilla decided for this approach .

602
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,100
Sometimes it seems that
We are from different planets .

603
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,367
And then come up with something like this .

604
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,033
Adam, I'm ...

605
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:08,100
I have to say that I am ...
- I'm sorry .

606
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:12,167
Priscilla . I apologize .

607
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:15,900
Priscilla ? Hi !

608
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,233
We are. We just talked about .

609
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,500
Nice! I love it.

610
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:44,833
A Christmas gifts to
current tree Christmas.

611
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,500
Is not nadahnjujuæe ?

612
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,567
I love it.

613
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:54,767
It got dark , I turn on
Light . - No, not yet!

614
00:52:55,567 --> 00:53:02,100
All lighting is connected remotely ,
so you just need to press in. ..

615
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:05,700
Merry Christmas !

616
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,900
And the light emerges from the darkness .
Not even he can not win .

617
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,367
It's incredible .

618
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,433
Come see your book .

619
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,967
This is perfect.

620
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:43,567
Can you repay
dinner for all the effort ?

621
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:46,233
Sure .

622
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:51,767
For parties that away and see
do not serve pizza and beer .

623
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:56,100
They can only enjoy the
parties after the prime actors .

624
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:59,233
Will you come to the party
actors from " The Nutcracker " ?

625
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,433
I do not know . It could be me
be a very important night.

626
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:10,100
Just a little . Here it is . I want to propose .

627
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:13,700
Miss Hall ? - What do you think ?

628
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:19,033
I think it's wonderful .

629
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,233
But not for Ms Hall . - Come on ?

630
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:28,833
Pretradicionalan is ,
it is much more modern .

631
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,767
I bought it in Milan.

632
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,833
Then I was not sure
in that we should be together .

633
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,167
But returning to Boston ,

634
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:43,900
I was not sure whether I feel
heart flutters or knots.

635
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,633
But the other night I felt
right flicker . - Did you ?

636
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,167
Yes, but not with Priscilla .

637
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:55,767
I thought Priscilla
I feel Evora ,

638
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,233
but it turned out to
it is still blinking .

639
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,100
I feel a flicker .
- I'm not sure I understand .

640
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,567
Clearly , because it speaks
my friend Charlie .

641
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,033
When I saw Priscilla's draft ,

642
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,833
all the love and emotions
that is woven into them .

643
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:19,900
That's when I knew .

644
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:24,167
Drafts are ruled ?
- Without further .

645
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,767
It is those .

646
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:35,433
Would you like anything else ?

647
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,033
I do not want .

648
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:43,033
Account , please ! Thank you .

649
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:48,833
Isabella , " Measure for Measure "
Cordelia , " King Lear " . And Portia .

650
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,767
There is no end to them .

651
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:55,967
What is it?

652
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:59,567
Reminds me of the sled
from Priscillinih draft .

653
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:05,300
I like what is inserted
something so romantic .

654
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:09,967
Maybe I should propose
while driving the carriage .

655
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,833
I think she'd be more
liked something noticable.

656
00:56:13,967 --> 00:56:18,367
You would not ! Are you kidding? I
this would be perfect .

657
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:20,767
Shall we run on ?

658
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:25,967
I want them first
try out . - I do not know ...

659
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:28,167
Come on , it will be fun .

660
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:32,900
Can ride ? - Can ,
for $ 25 . - Good .

661
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,900
Thank you .

662
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,567
Here you are.

663
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:49,033
Here you go.

As we are not in town . reflection

00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,900
It was wonderful .

671
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,233
Yes, it is .

672
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:24,767

00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,900
He talked about you , when you said
for it in the elevator . Flicker and sparkle .

677
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:46,900
That's what I thought , but he showed me
the ring . He thinks she's the one .

678
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,900
You're the one. Sketches , kiss .

679
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,233
You have to tell him everything ,
before zaruèi .

680
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,500
Zaruèit will be on false assumptions.

681
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,700
I tried , but have
Right . I am a coward .

682
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:02,367
She 'd tell him I say . - No!

683
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:05,767
If anything I find out now ,
I will look to The calculated .

684
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:09,967
And still would be my word against
Priscilla . - But , to discover the truth .

685
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:14,500
What will only embarrass
Adam , because I did not recognize .

686
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:18,367
Probably would have been angry that I did not
she and I ruined our friendship .

687
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,100
You would not even believe that my sketches .

688
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:22,500
And yet , and I pulled
Priscilla's anger at himself .

689
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:25,700
Imagining the worst .

690
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:29,900
And not the best , it is also possible .

691
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,500
As well as get to Lotte.

00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:37,967

Everything is so complicated .

However, we should pay tribute to her . there are
excellent taste when it comes to men .

705

It's true .

706
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,700
We need her to help untangle this
disputes, but how ? - I do not know .

707
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:13,633
But if the guy broke her heart ,

708
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:19,233
my cowboy boots will hit him so
very ass that will spurs play .

709

So much so that he rushed to propose to me.

761
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,700

Nothing happened between Adam and
Me . You are the one I love , you proposed .

773
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:14,167
I do not want to listen to what you were doing together .

If you try to enter ubuduæe

781
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:15,967
Less would hurt that I kept
original plan and avoided him .

782
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,367
Why am I supposed to think at all
harsh drafts ? - Do not!

You know what , Miss Hall ?

I thought that was working for
You realization of all my dreams .

successful interior designer .

882

And I was blinded
your glamorous life .

883
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:11,767
But that was before
I see your true colors.

884

So , go ahead , spend
the work of his poor threat .

885
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:19,167
Because if you spend the rest of his career
as a set designer in the public theater ,

886
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,433
It would be a dream come true .

887
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:25,033
And you ...

888
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,900

- What is going on here ?

889
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,833
I really believe that she
could make harsh drafts ?

890
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:37,567
Adam, I was in front of you
eyes all the time .

891
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:43,233
If you had that kiss in the elevator
something meant the concoction , he recognized me .

892
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:46,567
You're not a man to whom I fell in love .

You deserve each other .

but know that my heart
leapt in that carriage .

903
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,500
I felt the same spark as
with a kiss in the elevator .

904
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,767
I just want to know ...

905
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:28,900
Can you forgive me
I have been so blind ?

906
01:24:30,767 --> 01:24:33,100
I'll consider it .
