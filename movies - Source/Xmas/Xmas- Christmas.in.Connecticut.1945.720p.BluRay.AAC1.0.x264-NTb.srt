1
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,835
Garçon, where is the Bordelaise sauce?

2
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,629
- Right here, sir.
- Ha!

3
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,382
- And some more wine.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,977
- Wake up.
- Hmm?

5
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,728
Wake up!

6
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,814
What is it, a ship?

7
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,733
Naw, you was calling me Garsun.

8
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,569
Who's Garsun?

9
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,530
Doggone you, Sink.
I was just having a wonderful dream.

10
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,741
- What about?
- What do you think? Food.

11
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,578
- What, again?
- Yeah, and you had to wake me up.

12
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,246
I was lonely.

13
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,747
What day is it?

14
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,915
Wednesday.

15
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,584
You said yesterday was Wednesday.

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,003
Well, then, it must be Thursday.

17
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,629
Must be.

18
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,089
So what?

19
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,259
Fifteen days.

20
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,887
Oh, boy, if I ever get out of this...

21
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,515
...my first meal is gonna be a humdinger.

22
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,561
A big, thick, juicy steak
with baked potatoes...

23
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,105
<i>...asparagus with hollandaise sauce...</i>

24
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,441
<i>...and chocolate cake and ice cream.</i>

25
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,247
- That for me?
- No, this is for Seaman Sinkewicz.

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,085
This is for you, and you've
got a surprise tonight.

27
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,422
- Turkey? Steak?
- Mm-mm.

28
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,342
A lovely raw egg floating in your milk.

29
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,520
"By America's Best Cook,
Elizabeth Lane.

30
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,523
Roast goose Bernoise
with walnut dressing...

31
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,984
...giblet gravy, cranberry..."

32
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,503
Did you enjoy your lunch,
honey boy?

33
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,879
You mean that mush?

34
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,887
What I don't understand
is when a guy's okay...

35
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,717
...and he wants some man-size food,
why do they hold out on him?

36
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,054
You forget you were out on a raft
for 18 days without any food.

37
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,973
Well, your tummy's not ready
for solid food.

38
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,684
And why is Sinkewicz's stomach
any different than mine? Why?

39
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,228
Because you starved longer
than he did, Jeffy.

40
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,730
You gave him the last
of that K ration, remember?

41
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,399
That was a great sacrifice.

42
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,360
That was no sacrifice.
Have you ever tasted K ration?

43
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,196
And if I starved longer,
do they have to try to finish the job?

44
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,282
Of course not,
but the doctors know best.

45
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,785
All I get is milk, milk, milk.
Every time I yawn, I'm scared I'll moo.

46
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,955
Silly boy. I'll get something to read
and be right back.

47
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,541
- Hi, fella.
- Hi, Sinkewicz.

48
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,544
Say, look, you had steak
again yesterday, didn't you?

49
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,005
Mm-hmm. And today, chicken Maryland.

50
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,299
- Oh, brother!
- How do you work it?

51
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,592
You gotta use the old magoo, Jeff.

52
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,679
That's all. The old magoo.

53
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,101
The old magoo.

54
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,062
Here we are.
Your favorite and mine.

55
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,523
- Mm, Elizabeth Lane.
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,443
You know she must be the most
wonderful cook in America.

57
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,902
Yeah.

58
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,613
I've dreamt about eating
one of her seven-course meals.

59
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,451
She says, "Yesterday,
my son was 8-months-old.

60
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,202
He's getting quite companionable.

61
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,663
I sat him in the kitchen with me
while I prepared dinner.

62
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,081
And what a dinner it was.

63
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,626
I took crisp lettuce,
romaine and crinkly endive...

64
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,920
...from my own garden
for my husband's favorite salad.

65
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:42,926
For this I made a rich, creamy
blue-cheese dressing." Mmm.

66
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,262
"Then to prepare roast duck
his favorite way...

67
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,099
...I rub salt and pepper inside,
then brown the duck in its own fat..."

68
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,770
Wait. Please. Would you mind?
I know she's a wonderful woman...

69
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,356
...a marvelous housekeeper,
and a great cook but...

70
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,441
...would you mind
reading something else?

71
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,569
Well, of course not.
How about the new Mayfair?

72
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,072
There's a very funny story in it.
I'll get it.

73
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,326
Roast duck. Mmm.

74
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,497
- Hey, Sink?
- Yeah...

75
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,665
...what do you want now?

76
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,335
You're getting to be a problem child.

77
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,505
What is this old magoo you talk
about that gets you the food?

78
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,465
Oh, that? Heh.

79
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,634
- Now, look, that nurse you got.
- Yeah?

80
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,720
She likes you. Well, the magoo.

81
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,473
- What magoo?
- Oh, now, listen.

82
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,142
Don't you think they like to
do those little extra things...

83
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,104
...for a guy who's in love with them?

84
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,690
- Oh.
- But it's got to be convincing.

85
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,859
That's where magoo
is different from baloney.

86
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,403
Altogether different.

87
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,822
But just how far do you have to go?

88
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,242
How hungry are you?

89
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,744
That far?

90
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,788
Break a girl's heart that way.

91
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,998
Her heart or your stomach.

92
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:57,835
Hey!

93
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,171
What's my nurse's name?

94
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,506
Mary.

95
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,260
Mary.

96
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,348
Here we are.

97
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,851
Oh. Where were you for so long?

98
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,519
I, uh, missed you...

99
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,855
...ahem, Mary.

100
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,648
Oh, well, how nice.

101
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:23,360
I mean, well, I didn't even know
you knew my name.

102
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,696
Me? Not know your name?

103
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,621
What you gonna get, steak or chops?

104
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,291
- Chops today, steak tomorrow.
- Okay, huh, bud?

105
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,542
Yeah, okay.

106
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,587
Say, uh, how far'd you have to go?

107
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,797
- All the way.
- Yeah?

108
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,009
Yeah. She thinks I wanna marry her.
Nothing else worked.

109
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,178
Oh, well, don't you worry.

110
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,055
<i>Magoo got you 'm.
Magoo“ get you out.</i>

111
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,308
Shoot

112
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,980
Look what I've got, Jeffy boy.

113
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,902
- Look.
- Oh, gosh, Mary, you're wonderful.

114
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,029
Well, you're powerful sweet,
yourself, sugar.

115
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,949
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
We've gotta cut that in itty-bitty pieces.

116
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,119
There.

117
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,288
What do you want me to do,
jump for it?

118
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,751
Mmm.

119
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,755
- What's the matter, Jeffy?
- It won't go down.

120
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,050
Oh, my goodness, I told you.
The doctors are right.

121
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,101
- My, you're so clever.
- Hmm.

122
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,272
Little me's feeling
mighty blue tonight, Jeff.

123
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,732
What's the matter?

124
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,944
Well, I heard that you're getting
discharged from the hospital in a week.

125
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,153
Yeah?

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,656
Gee, maybe if I could get away,
you and I might be...

127
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,867
I mean, I could cook for you.

128
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,452
Yeah?

129
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:01,333
Jeff, marriage and domesticity,
they frighten you, don't they?

130
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,169
- Well, to tell the truth, I...
- No, I know it, I could tell.

131
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,673
You're afraid of being tied down.
After the war, I mean.

132
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,134
Well, you see, Mary,
I've always been sort of a rolling stone.

133
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,054
I was an artist and a painter.
I've never had a home.

134
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,306
I guess I am a little afraid
of the idea of...

135
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,642
Oh, but, Jeffy boy,
a home is so wonderful.

136
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,520
Oh, I know it is,
but the thing to do, Mary, is to wait.

137
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,773
After all, who knows?
You may change your mind too.

138
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,734
Silly boy, if you only knew
what a difference...

139
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,945
...a real home would make.

140
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,406
Just to feel you had it
to come back to.

141
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,576
- Yeah.
- But you've never known a real home.

142
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,287
If you had, you'd feel differently.

143
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,833
You know, I was just thinking,
honey boy, that...

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,210
Oh, dear.

145
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,341
Shhh, not now. He's asleep.

146
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,843
When are you two getting married?

147
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,512
Oh, I don't know.
I'm afraid he's backing out.

148
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,181
It's because he's never had a home.
And he doesn't realize.

149
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,017
Well, why don't you do
something about it?

150
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,685
Well, do what?

151
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:06,356
Well, if he spent Christmas
in a real homey home, he might...

152
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,817
Well, that's how Sally Jackson
hooked a Marine last year.

153
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,694
Yeah, but whose home?

154
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,031
Everybody I know lives
in a hotel or one-room.

155
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,450
You have a problem.

156
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,960
"Alexander Yardley."

157
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,879
Why, of course!

158
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,973
"My dear Mr. Yardley...

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,062
...I hope you will remember little me.

160
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,231
This is Mary Lee...

161
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:52,861
...the girl who nursed
your granddaughter...

162
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,657
...back to health from the measles..."

163
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,579
- Alexander Yardley?
- Yes, this is Mr. Yardley's residence.

164
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,414
Special delivery.

165
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,000
Thank you.

166
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,946
- Elkins.
- Yes, sir?

167
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,824
- Did my daughter phone?
- Yes, sir. Midnight last night, sir...

168
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,030
- ...but I thought it best not to waken you, sir.
- When is she getting here?

169
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,539
She said that she and your granddaughters
can't get away from Washington.

170
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,457
Her war work, she said, is too heavy.

171
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,959
Say anything else?

172
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,129
Just that she'd call you and
wish you a merry Christmas, sir.

173
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,631
Not much of a Christmas
for me all alone.

174
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,509
No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

175
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,891
Good morning, Mr. Yardley.

176
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,601
Good morning.

177
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,854
That Elizabeth Lane feature,
the housewife one...

178
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,689
...runs in Home <i>&</i> Garden, doesn't it?

179
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,315
<i>No, sir. Smart Housekeeping.</i>

180
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,067
Get me, what's-his-name...

181
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,279
...Mr. Beecham,
on the direct wire, the editor.

182
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,156
Yes, Mr. Yardley.

183
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,873
<i>Mr. Beecham at Smart Housekeeping, sir.</i>

184
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,666
This is Alexander Yardley.

185
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,336
Oh, yes. Yes. How are you, sir?
May I wish you a merry Christmas?

186
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,423
Well, thank you, sir. Heh.

187
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,926
Yes, Mrs. Lane's feature is...

188
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,767
But... But I'm not sure
I could do that, Mr. Yardley.

189
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,453
Mrs. Lane's farm and her home life
are something that we have...

190
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,104
...no right to intrude on, even...

191
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,482
I only ask two things
of my editors, Beecham:

192
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,650
Print the truth and obey my orders.

193
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,444
I expect Mrs. Lane at 4.

194
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,415
Elizabeth? This is Dudley.

195
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,960
I think I'd better have lunch with you.
It's important.

196
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,671
Oh. Well, then I'll come over
now and see you.

197
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,388
"From my living room window as I write...

198
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,683
...I can look out across the broad
front lawns of our farm...

199
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,312
...like a lovely picture postcard
of wintry New England.

200
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,650
In my fireplace the good cedar logs
are burning and crackling.

201
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,906
I just stopped to go into
my gleaming kitchen...

202
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,741
...to test the crumbly brown goodness...

203
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,244
...of the toasted veal cutlets
à la Connecticut in my oven.

204
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,871
Cook these slowly..."

205
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,041
Come in!

206
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,919
- Miss Lane?
- Yes.

207
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,548
Thank you very much.

208
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,925
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, miss.

209
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,324
- Felix!
- Hello! Your breakfast.

210
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,326
Oh, Felix, you shouldn't.
Not in this weather.

211
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,621
And all the way from the restaurant
with no hat or coat. You'll catch cold.

212
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,207
Pitchy-potchy!
In Budapest this was summer.

213
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,837
Anyway, it's just around the corner.
And anyway, if it wasn't for you...

214
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,674
- ...I wouldn't got no restaurant.
- Oh, you paid that back long ago.

215
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,926
This interest. I'm...

216
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,096
Gee, I knew it! Such breakfast.

217
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,472
Sardines.

218
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,643
You mad at your stomach, darling?

219
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,478
Come here and let me see.

220
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,981
Oh, yummy! Mushroom omelet!

221
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,349
Did you write up those recipes
for next month's article?

222
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,084
- Yes, yes, darling.
- What am I cooking?

223
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,406
Look here! Breast of gray dove,
saute with peaches grenadine...

224
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,866
...no points...

225
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,201
...chicken soup with Moselle wine,
no points.

226
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,329
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- And you can...

227
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,040
- Lizka!
- What's the matter?

228
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,167
That coat!
What's the meaning?

229
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,085
Oh, don't worry.
I'm paying for it myself.

230
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,296
It'll take my next six months' salary.

231
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,466
- Nice, isn't it?
- Six months' work for a coat?

232
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,886
Mm-hmm. All my life,
I promised myself a mink coat.

233
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,890
You know, Felix, it's very important
to keep promises, especially to yourself.

234
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,892
Do you have to promise
so expensively?

235
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,894
- But I needed it!
- You need it?

236
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,979
Nobody needs a mink coat
but a mink.

237
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,691
You don't know what a mink coat
does for a girl's morale.

238
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,068
Yes, the morale, I know.

239
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,737
I had a silk hat once in Budapest.

240
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,198
A silk hat.
It made me feel so fine.

241
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:52,535
And then I insulted the maître d'hôtel
and got fired with a silk hat.

242
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,870
Come on, eat.

243
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,790
Mink outside, sardines inside,
that's no good too.

244
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,249
Oh, this is marvelous.

245
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,044
You know, Felix, some time
I'm gonna take time out...

246
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,338
- ...and learn to cook like you do.
- No, no, no, no.

247
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,673
- No?
- No, no, darling.

248
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,093
Then you would find out
it is not the way you write now.

249
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,054
All easy and fun and... Don't cook.

250
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,555
All right.

251
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,100
I have to go, darling. Goodbye.

252
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,935
Thanks a million.

253
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,814
- Oh, hello, Felix.
- Hello, goodbye. Merry Christmas.

254
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,816
- Don't mention it.
- Hello, Dud.

255
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,694
Hello, Liz. We're in a jam.
Something terrible is about to happen.

256
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,260
- What's the matter?
- It's Yardley.

257
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,656
He wants to see you
at his home on Long Island.

258
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,033
Really? Maybe he wants to give me
a raise for Christmas.

259
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,921
- I've certainly helped circulation.
- No, darling. It's not a raise.

260
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,679
You look frazzled, Dud.
You want a drink?

261
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,872
No. No, thanks.

262
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,084
Now, it's really nothing
to be nervous about. Not a thing.

263
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,086
Don't be silly.
I'm not nervous. I feel fine.

264
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,588
Well, you won't in a minute.

265
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,425
Now get this. Some fool nurse
at a Naval Hospital...

266
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,951
...wrote to Yardley asking him
to invite a wounded sailor...

267
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,471
- ...out at your farm for Christmas.
- My farm?

268
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,933
Oh, oh, yes, my farm!
Oh, my farm.

269
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,227
And he wants to see you
right away to arrange it.

270
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,814
Are you crazy? Where am I gonna get a farm?
I haven't even got a window box.

271
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,609
That's just it. We'll have to stall him off.
You know what a stickler he is for the truth.

272
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:10,155
If he ever finds out we've been making
all this up, he'll fire the both of us.

273
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,073
Oh.

274
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,456
Well, it's been nice knowing you.

275
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,670
It's really not as bad as it sounds, Liz.
All you have to do is to go out there...

276
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,381
...and tell him that your child
has whooping cough or something.

277
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,468
Say that you couldn't possibly
entertain anyone for Christmas.

278
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,929
- Your husband wouldn't like it.
- Oh, yes. Yes, my husband.

279
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,808
Of course, simplest thing in the world.
You go out and tell him, Dud.

280
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:43,146
- You're a much better liar than I am.
- Oh, no, Liz. He wants to see you.

281
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,857
And when Yardley wants something,
he gets it or else. Pppt!

282
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,443
Well, I'd rather get fired
than face that old battleax.

283
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,612
Yes, but what about me?

284
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,947
Remember I have a wife
and a family to support.

285
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,159
You're not gonna let me down
after all I've done for you?

286
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,495
Oh, all right. I'll go.

287
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,290
Let's see, whooping cough
or maybe scarlet fever.

288
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,585
- It's a better color for Christmas.
- Anything. Only call off the sailor, Liz.

289
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,506
Now if you put this over, I'll get
a raise for you. I swear I will.

290
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,633
The things a girl will do
for a mink coat.

291
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,844
Come in.

292
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,179
Well, here I am.

293
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,388
Hello, John.

294
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,599
An hour early,
but the early bird catches the worm.

295
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,851
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

296
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,229
- Why are you so early?
- I took an earlier train.

297
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,106
That much longer to be with you, my dear.

298
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,108
Sloan, go away. We're in conference.

299
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,314
Oh, don't mind Dud today.
We're in a little trouble.

300
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,279
If there's anything I can do for you,
you just have to say the word.

301
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,199
- You know how I feel, Elizabeth.
- No. How do you feel?

302
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:40,161
- Tell us all about it. Say "ah."
- Ah! Say, what is this?

303
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,540
Why don't you go and build those
rabbit hutches or whatever it is you build?

304
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,041
Multiple dwellings.

305
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,252
And I don't build them.
I'm an architect, Beecham.

306
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,963
All you want to do
is to propose to Liz again.

307
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,465
I'll do it for you
and get just as good a no.

308
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,833
- Now, look here. Liz!
- Liz, don't waste time with him.

309
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,178
You have to decide what you're
gonna say to the old man.

310
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,706
- What old man?
- Oh, it's Yardley.

311
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,891
- He's sending me a sailor for Christmas.
- Oh, how nice.

312
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,601
A sailor? Really, Elizabeth.

313
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,562
Well, it's just a little trouble we're in.

314
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,731
You see, Yardley thinks I have a farm,
a husband and a baby in Connecticut.

315
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,527
- A farm, a husband and a baby.
- Simple, isn't it?

316
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,071
There's obviously only one
thing for you to do, my dear.

317
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,798
- Sloan, you keep out of this.
- I've taken just about as much...

318
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,267
- ...as I'm going to take from you.
- Boys, stop quarreling.

319
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,912
Come in.

320
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,206
- Mrs. Lane?
- Oh, yes. Put it in there.

321
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,585
Oh, Dud, I wish you'd tell the office
to stop sending those things here.

322
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,797
Another rocking chair?

323
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,507
- Yes.
- You already have eight.

324
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,426
Thirty-eight.
The rest are in the basement.

325
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,113
- Thirty-eight rocking chairs?
- I said in last month's issue...

326
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,300
...that I was searching in vain
through antique shops

327
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,311
...for a rocking chair
like Granny used to have.

328
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,268
So my public is sending me
rocking chairs.

329
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,312
And that proves how popular you are.

330
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,564
If you get fired,
you'll be robbing the public...

331
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,483
...of the finest human-interest feature
in the whole magazine field.

332
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,319
And Dudley Beecham
of his finest job.

333
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,286
All right, all right.
Let's get down to cases.

334
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,364
What are you going to say
to the old gentleman?

335
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,327
Well, I'll simply say, of course,
Mr. Yardley, there's nothing I'd rather do...

336
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,663
...than invite this young man to spend
Christmas with me on my farm, but...

337
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,750
Excellent, Mrs. Lane.
I knew you'd feel that way.

338
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,709
After all, it's our
patriotic duty, isn't it?

339
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,587
The poor young man
spent 18 days on a raft...

340
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,423
...six weeks in a hospital,
and he's never had a real home.

341
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,391
You can imagine how much
it'll mean to him...

342
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,030
...to have a nice, homey Christmas
with your wonderful cooking.

343
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,264
- Naturally, but you see...
- Ah. But your cooking, Mrs. Lane.

344
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,642
I follow your diary faithfully.

345
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,144
It is the only thing
I ever do read in my publications.

346
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,854
And I wouldn't miss it for the world.

347
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,650
In October, when you had
breast of guinea hen in madeira...

348
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,818
...oh, that was perfection, Mrs. Lane.

349
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,904
- Lucky man, your husband.
- Well, thank you...

350
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,990
And last June, strawberries Chantilly
with rum and egg white.

351
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,493
You stiffen the egg white first,
don't you? Before the rum?

352
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,580
- Oh, yes, definitely, of course.
- Of course. It's the only way to do it.

353
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,498
And your Christmas menu,
Mrs. Lane.

354
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,667
Ah, that is really magnificent.

355
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,669
Roast goose Bernoise
with walnut stuffing...

356
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,004
...celery soufflé and
real old fashioned plum pudding.

357
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,174
- Mr. Yardley, it's out of...
- Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

358
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,511
Miss Scott, take this telegram
to Miss Mary Lee...

359
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,429
...Navy Hospital, Staten Island.

360
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,640
In reply to your letter of the 15th...

361
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:10,103
...Mrs. Lane will be very pleased
to entertain your friend, Jefferson Jones.

362
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,480
Mr. Yardley, there's something
you should know. I...

363
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,190
Yes. What is it?

364
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,694
Well, it was just something
that you should know.

365
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,613
It's my child, he's been ill
with whooping cough.

366
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,074
Whooping cough.
That's not contagious to adults.

367
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,576
My grandchild had it.
Not at all serious nowadays.

368
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,912
- Mr. Yardley, I...
- This is going to be a great story

369
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,497
...for our next issue, Mrs. Lane.

370
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,709
"American Hero Spends Christmas
On Perfect Farm."

371
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,169
What a boost for circulation.
Yes, indeed.

372
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,630
And I believe I'll arrange
a nice little bonus for you...

373
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,382
...in recognition of your cooperation.

374
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,218
Well, thank you, very much,
Mr. Yardley, but I really couldn't...

375
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,054
Now, now, I know you're not doing this
for any mercenary reason.

376
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,641
You're a fine American wife and mother, and
we're very proud to have you on our staff.

377
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,977
But I guess you could use
a little bonus, couldn't you?

378
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,229
- Oh, I guess I could.
- Splendid. Splendid.

379
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,916
Allow me to shake your hand,
Mrs. Lane.

380
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,233
Mr. Yardley, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

381
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,693
Don't try. Don't try, my dear.

382
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,820
And thank you very much
for coming to see me.

383
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,196
Good afternoon, Mrs. Lane.

384
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,948
Good afternoon.

385
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,207
Anything wrong, madam?

386
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,460
Oh, no, nothing at all.

387
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,838
He's kind of overpowering,
isn't he?

388
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,757
Oh, yes.
A very strong personality.

389
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,759
- Yes.
- Pardon me, Mrs. Lane...

390
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,346
...but I'm planning on having
a farm in Connecticut myself one day.

391
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,348
I'd like some good bottomland.

392
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,850
- Bottomland?
- Yes.

393
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,737
That's the best kind for farming, isn't it?

394
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:36,230
Oh, some people say yes,
and some people say no.

395
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,232
But what do you say?

396
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,777
Um, I'm inclined to agree with them.

397
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,363
Oh, thank you very much.

398
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,326
What's this?

399
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,579
It's the menu for your Christmas dinner, sir.
It's what the doctor ordered.

400
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,374
Mashed prune whip.
Creamed turnip fluff.

401
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,419
He expects me to eat
these barbaric atrocities? Well, I won't.

402
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,715
Mrs. Lane.

403
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,634
There's something I want to...

404
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:08,054
Mrs. Lane, this must be telepathy.
I know exactly what you're going to say.

405
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,347
- Do you?
- Yes.

406
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,516
You're going to invite me
to your Christmas party.

407
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,727
Well, Mrs. Lane, I'm going to accept
with the greatest of pleasure.

408
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,688
- Well, that'd be just wonderful.
<i>- I'll</i> be there Christmas Eve.

409
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,484
I was going to spend the holidays with
my family, but I'm coming to Connecticut.

410
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,362
Well, why not bring the family too? Heh.

411
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,695
Where was Elizabeth
when she phoned?

412
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,363
Grand Central Station.

413
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,948
Well, she should be here by now.

414
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,534
I sent her to Yardley
to talk him out of it.

415
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,744
Instead, he talks her into it.

416
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,621
It means she'll lose her job,
of course.

417
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,708
Yeah. And mine too.

418
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,961
Well, merry Christmas.

419
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,760
Hello, Lizka.
Your friends are waiting in the bar.

420
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,429
What's the matter?
Something wrong?

421
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,890
Oh, no, no.
Just a catastrophe, that's all.

422
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,600
Mm-hmm. "Catastroph."

423
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,059
- Sam?
- Yes, sir?

424
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,853
Catastrophe, what is it?

425
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,148
It's from the Greek.
It means a misfortune, a cataclysm...

426
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,774
...or a serious calamity.

427
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,487
Greek? Serious calamity?
Heh-heh. Is it good?

428
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,781
- No, sir. That's bad.
- Bad?

429
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,495
- Double martini, Oscar, please.
- Well?

430
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,539
Every time I opened my mouth,
he talked. I felt like Charlie McCarthy.

431
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,167
Lizka. This catastroph. It's trouble?

432
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,504
- Yes. I'm going to lose my job, Felix.
- Pish-posh. That's nothing.

433
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,631
- So you get another job.
- That's what you think.

434
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,258
I better go phone my wife
and give her the glad tidings.

435
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,093
Come, darling.
You have to eat something.

436
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,012
He's right, you must
keep up your strength.

437
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,430
Commence with an appetizer.

438
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,599
Then I bring some nice chicken Budapest...

439
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,852
...some Brussels sprouts à la Felix,
some potatoes au gratin.

440
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,187
Sounds very palatable.

441
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,563
Help yourself, darling.

442
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,858
First, some nice filet of
marinated herring à la créme.

443
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,026
- Elizabeth?
- Uh-huh?

444
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,528
Artichoke hearts vinaigrette.

445
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,613
Sometimes these things
happen for the best.

446
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,781
Bologna.

447
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,908
When I think how I worked
building up that job.

448
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,316
Well, there's another job
waiting for you if you want it.

449
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,411
- There is?
- Yes.

450
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,664
The job of being Mrs. John Sloan, darling.

451
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,374
Horseradish.

452
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,167
Well, that's sweet of you, John.

453
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,170
But I don't feel that way about you,
and it wouldn't be fair.

454
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,632
I'm willing to take a chance. I'm sure
I can make you care for me in time.

455
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,841
Nuts.

456
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,636
Walnuts, pickled walnuts. Excellent.

457
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,472
Come on, Lizka. Sit here.
I wait on you myself.

458
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,474
Eat everything, Lizka.

459
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,059
Felix, bring us some wine,
will you?

460
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,645
Something very good,
but not too expensive.

461
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,605
Moselle 1927? Yes?

462
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,023
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,067
Well, Elizabeth, how about it?

464
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,152
You know you need someone
to look after you.

465
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,321
But I don't love you, John.

466
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,448
All that will come in good time.

467
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,285
Could you wait that long?

468
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,953
I think so.

469
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,457
Saying no to your proposals
has become a habit.

470
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,419
Yes, it's a bad habit.
You must break yourself of it.

471
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,172
It becomes harder and harder
to find an excuse to say no.

472
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,676
Well, you can't blame it on your career
this time because you haven't got one.

473
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,429
You're right.

474
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,682
Well, I just can't think of another excuse.

475
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:43,019
You could say that you love someone else.

476
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,895
But I don't.

477
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,356
Oh. Let me think.

478
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,862
Oh, what am I...? You mean...?
You mean you will marry me?

479
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,990
Well, if you really want me,
knowing how I feel.

480
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:57,658
Do I? Darling!

481
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,827
Well. Don't mind me.

482
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,537
Dud, we're going to be married.

483
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:02,872
What?

484
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,999
Say, now, look here, Elizabeth,
it isn't that bad.

485
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,209
- Oh, really, Beecham.
- It's a good idea, Dud.

486
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,338
In fact, I think I'll rather enjoy
living on a farm after...

487
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,215
- A farm?
- John's farm. It's in Connecticut.

488
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,301
That's where I got most of my copy.

489
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,387
Say, that's right.
You have got a farm, haven't you?

490
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,057
Congratulate me.
This is the happiest day of my life.

491
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,809
Aren't you getting a bit mixed?
It's the happiest day of my life.

492
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,394
Of course, John.
Congratulations.

493
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,730
Elizabeth, I think you've made
a very wise decision.

494
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,733
In fact, I think you two should
get very married right away.

495
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,235
And there we are.
A husband, a farm in Connecticut.

496
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,905
- Now all we need is a baby.
- What are you getting at?

497
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,241
What's the harm of having Yardley and the
sailor up at your farm for Christmas?

498
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,078
Yardley and a sailor on my honeymoon?
Are you crazy?

499
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,955
Elizabeth, I just talked with my wife.

500
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,832
You told her?

501
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,501
I didn't have the heart.

502
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,171
She told me what she was getting
the kids for Christmas.

503
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,090
And, well, I...

504
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,676
She sounded so happy I...

505
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,429
Of course, I know it's asking a lot,
but when a pal's in a jam...

506
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,766
John, darling, it would
only be for a few days.

507
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,893
After all,
Bud's been so good to me.

508
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,271
I am getting out of it now,
thanks to you.

509
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,942
Oh, John, couldn't we,
so he won't lose his job?

510
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,028
Elizabeth, I know I shall regret
this for the rest of my life...

511
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,031
- ...but if it's what you want...
- Oh, Johnny, you're a lamb.

512
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,784
Sloan, I take everything back.
I'll never forgot this.

513
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,577
I thank you,
and my family thanks you.

514
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,121
Wait a minute. It's no good.

515
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,664
- Why not?
- I can't cook.

516
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,625
- She can't cook.
- She can't cook.

517
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,503
Felix. You'll take him with you.
He'll do anything for you!

518
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,172
- Felix.
- Yes, Mr. Beecham.

519
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,579
Felix, I've great news for you.

520
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,917
May I have the honor of announcing to you
the engagement of our dear Elizabeth...

521
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,638
...to Mr. John Sloan?
A prince of good fellows.

522
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,558
- Thank you.
- Lizka. It's true?

523
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,810
Yes, Felix.
I decided quite suddenly.

524
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,187
Congratulate them, Felix.
It's colossal.

525
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,647
Colossal?

526
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,941
It's catastroph!

527
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,590
Oh, Mr. Sloan, a Merry Christmas.
The same to you, Miss Lane.

528
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,967
Thank you, Nora.
Merry Christmas to you too.

529
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,927
So he finally talked you
into marrying him.

530
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,345
Congratulations, Mr. Sloan.

531
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,514
<i>Thank you, Nora.
Has Judge (Brothers armed yet'?</i>

532
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,683
No, sir. But he's on his way. He phoned.

533
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,477
That'll be a dollar even.

534
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,146
There you are. And, uh, that's for you.

535
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,317
Well, shall I carry you in,
darling?

536
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,402
No, thank you.
We're not married yet.

537
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,366
Oh, Oh, John, it looks lovely!

538
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,161
Just the way I described it
in the Christmas issue.

539
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm glad you like it.
Oh, Nora, this is Felix Basternock.

540
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,808
He's going to help you
with the cooking.

541
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,709
Help me? Help me?

542
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,961
We're having two guests.
They'll be arriving later.

543
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,381
- I hope you have their rooms ready.
- Everything's ready, Mr. Sloan.

544
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:04,512
If you come this way I'll show
you the kitchen, Mr. Basternook.

545
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,931
Just call me Felix.

546
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,850
I hope you like it here, Felix.

547
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,728
Me? I don't like the country.

548
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:16,398
Oh, it's real cozy here.
We have a horse and a cow.

549
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,693
I hate horses, and cows
don't like me, either!

550
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,695
Where's the kitchen?

551
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,036
Why, darling, you look wonderful!

552
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:32,164
But, uh, won't they think
that outfit's a little ultra...

553
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,874
...for Elizabeth Lane, the housewife?

554
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,417
Oh, I'll change before they come.

555
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,295
After all, a girl has to be
dressed up on her wedding day.

556
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,172
Do you really li...?

557
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,799
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

558
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,527
What'll I say to Yardley
and the sailor?

559
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,927
- About what?
- About the baby!

560
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,221
The one I've written about.
They'll expect to see him.

561
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,639
We forgot about the baby!

562
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,267
You forgot about the baby,
you mean. Come with me.

563
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,518
But, John!

564
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,646
If there's one thing an architect
thinks of, it's details.

565
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:58,274
- I told you I'd attend to everything.
- But, John...

566
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,525
Come along.

567
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,280
- There's your baby.
- Oh!

568
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,908
Oh, John!

569
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,410
Where did you get it?

570
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,977
Nora has been looking after him
for a neighbour, Mrs. Wright.

571
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,957
She works in a war plant in the village,
and her husband's in the Army.

572
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,293
The baby stays here quite late each night.

573
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,129
Hello. You're awfully cute.

574
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,800
Oh, John, this is wonderful!
I was worried.

575
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,969
Didn't I tell you that
all your worries are over?

576
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,263
Yes, I guess they are, all right.

577
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,724
You're very sweet to me, John.

578
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,064
Yes, I always think of details.

579
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,984
I was designing a house
once for plumbing.

580
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,487
Instead of ordinary pipes,
they had to be double-ribbed ones.

581
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,906
It's nothing, I just...

582
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,490
- John, dear.
- Yes, darling.

583
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,369
When you're kissing me,
don't talk about plumbing.

584
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,997
What? Oh, sorry. Of course not.

585
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,373
Well, what shall I talk about?

586
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,835
Well, do you...?
Do you have to talk?

587
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,629
You quaint little thing.

588
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,299
Ahem. Mr. Sloan,
Judge Crothers is here.

589
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,551
- I put him in the den.
- Oh, thanks, Nora.

590
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,428
Well, darling.

591
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,271
- Anything wrong, darling?
- No, no, nothing at all.

592
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,985
I, uh... I think I'll
freshen up a bit first.

593
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,197
- Oh, certainly, but don't be too long.
- No, I won't.

594
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,992
John, don't you think we...?

595
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,328
Don't I think what, dear?

596
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,872
Nothing.

597
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,463
Ah, judge.

598
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,191
- How are you, Sloan?
- Nice to see you.

599
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,540
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

600
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,219
- Where is the little bride?
- Oh, she's... She'll be right down.

601
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:54,390
- I thought we'd hold the ceremony in here.
- My, my. A lovely room for a wedding.

602
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,600
How about right here
by the mantel for the ceremony?

603
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,435
The mantel. Splendid idea.

604
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,562
Now suppose you stand
right over here, judge.

605
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,356
That's right. Just like that.

606
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,024
Oh, no, Sloan, not there.

607
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,903
I came here to marry you, not to be roasted
for your Christmas dinner.

608
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,414
Sheesh!

609
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,292
- Catastroph.
- What do you mean, "catastroph"?

610
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,879
Catastroph is a word from the Greeks.
It means not good!

611
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:30,342
I'll have you understand this is the finest
kitchen in Connecticut, Mr. Basilknocker!

612
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,928
Just call me Felix. But what smells?

613
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,596
That's Irish stew.

614
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,932
Goulash with turnips?

615
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,392
Catastroph.

616
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,436
It isn't goulash,
it's good old Irish stew!

617
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,813
Maybe old, but not good such goulash.

618
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,274
I tell you it isn't goulash.

619
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,276
Hold this.

620
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,531
Paprika. That will fix it.

621
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,580
Now it's goulash.

622
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,709
Come on, Nora and Felix.
We're gonna need you as witnesses.

623
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,837
Merciful heavens! The wedding, is it?
I better take off me apron.

624
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,839
- How do I look?
- How do you look?

625
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:12,676
Is it you that's getting married? I wish.

626
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,303
Ah, here she is, judge.

627
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,097
- Elizabeth, this is Judge Crothers.
- How do you do, Elizabeth?

628
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:20,059
Oh, it's not me. It's her. I'm Nora.

629
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,895
Oh, you're... Ha-ha! I declare!

630
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,772
Well, I'm delighted to meet you, my dear.

631
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,774
John's very lucky to get
such a lovely bride.

632
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,485
- Thank you. This is my uncle, Felix.
- How are you?

633
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,778
Not good.

634
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,363
I suppose you'll give the bride away,
Uncle Felix?

635
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,908
Me? I don't give nobody away.

636
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,660
Always I keep my mouth shut.

637
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,121
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Ha-ha! "Mouth shut," yes.

638
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,873
If you'll kindly step this way, please.

639
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,923
Join hands, please.

640
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,468
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together in the sight...

641
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:56,512
Wait, wait a minute.
Excuse me, please.

642
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,723
A wedding with no music?
That's impossible.

643
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,017
You're quite right.

644
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:06,105
I have here a record of "The Wedding March"
especially for the occasion.

645
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,566
Remember, dear? Details?

646
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,860
But, John, couldn't we have Mozart or...?

647
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,362
No, no, no, darling, no.

648
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,572
"The Wedding March"
is the conventional thing.

649
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,660
- Proceed, judge.
- Dearly beloved, we are gathered together...

650
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:24,039
- It's company already.
- Oh, John! It's the sailor!

651
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,667
- He's two hours early! What'll we do?
- What's the trouble?

652
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,419
It's a peculiar situation.
We'll have to postpone the ceremony.

653
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,256
Take him to the other room.
Not in there. You'll wake up the baby!

654
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,743
- The baby?
- Well, it's borrowed.

655
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,551
I mean, it's adopted!
Oh, go ahead!

656
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,572
Nora, turn off the music
and don't forget to call me Mrs. Sloan.

657
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,889
What, already?

658
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,100
Quartermaster Jones reporting.

659
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,146
Merry Christmas, Mr. Jones.

660
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,150
Your mother invited me,
Elizabeth Lane.

661
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,404
No, I'm Elizabeth Lane.
It's my pen name. I'm really Mrs. Sloan.

662
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,322
Won't you come it?

663
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,451
- Merry Christmas.
- This is my uncle, Felix.

664
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,453
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

665
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,248
I'm sorry, I... I guess I didn't expect...

666
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,667
I mean I thought you were...

667
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,420
Oh, I brought a present for you.

668
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,088
That'll be a dollar even,
commander.

669
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,756
Okay.

670
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,637
Gee, thanks! Merry Christmas.

671
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,181
Merry Christmas.

672
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,727
Well.

673
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,524
I, uh...

674
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,235
I guess I pictured you...

675
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,779
Oh, older? Yes, everyone does.

676
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,949
It's lovely, isn't it, Uncle Felix?

677
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,619
Wonderful. Just what you need.

678
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,539
I read in your column where you were
trying to buy one, and couldn't, so I...

679
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:51,710
- ...hope you like it.
- Of course, I do.

680
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,504
Uh, my old man was an expert
with rocking chairs.

681
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,966
He said he used to solve
all his problems in one.

682
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,052
But you have to know how to rock.

683
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,680
- Don't you just rock?
- Oh, no.

684
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,599
- No?
- No.

685
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,309
Uh, I'll show you.

686
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,979
Now suppose you're tired
and worried about a problem.

687
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,315
Well, then you rock like this.

688
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,109
Like you're on a ship,
away from everything...

689
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,738
...rolling soft and smooth
over the open sea.

690
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,074
Well, then you get to thinking
slow and calm.

691
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,576
Get it? That's the ocean rock.

692
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,424
- I never thought of that before.
- Then there's the horseback rock.

693
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,415
When you can't sit still, you're jittery.
You gotta be doing something.

694
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,834
And you rock like this,
very fast.

695
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,211
Then the lazy rock.

696
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,672
When there's something across
the room you want to get...

697
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,884
...and you're too lazy to get up and get it.
Well, you just rock over and get it.

698
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:45,222
Only chair in the world you can cross
the room without getting up. Heh-heh.

699
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,975
I never know there was so much
to a rocking chair.

700
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,352
- Won't you take off your things?
- Oh, yeah.

701
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,983
Gosh, your house is wonderful.

702
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:59,027
I got all the back copies
of the magazine and read them...

703
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,280
...so I'd know about you
before I got up here.

704
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,864
We've read all about you too.

705
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,242
It was certainly swell of you
to have me up here.

706
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,369
We're very proud to have you here.

707
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,707
Lizka, what's...? What's that?

708
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,792
Um, the baby, of course.

709
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,294
Baby, so quick?

710
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,504
He woke up rather early.

711
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,674
It must be time for something.

712
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,469
Could be!

713
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,887
Oh, I know.

714
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,515
- It's time for the baby's bath.
- Is it?

715
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,977
- Yes. I read all about it in your articles.
- Oh, oh, yes, it is.

716
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,624
They're awfully cute in the tub.

717
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,606
Heh. Yes, aren't they?

718
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,568
- Well.
- Uh, do you mind if I watch?

719
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,112
Watch?

720
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,115
Oh... no.

721
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,168
- Psst, Felix.
- You stay in there. Everything is fine.

722
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,837
- Where did they go?
- They are going to wash the baby.

723
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,130
Good heavens. Both of them?

724
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,537
Mm-hmm.
- Anything wrong?

725
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,675
Wrong? Oh, no. No, nothing at all.

726
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,970
I'm sorry, judge. I'm afraid we'll have to
postpone the ceremony for a while.

727
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,805
Oh, that's all right. Anytime.

728
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,599
Look, judge,
I make you a nice martini.

729
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,601
Good? Two martinis, judge.

730
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,729
- Two Manhattans.
- Two Manhattans!

731
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,525
Well, all set.

732
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,278
Uh, maybe I shouldn't bathe him today.
It's rather cold.

733
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,197
But don't they have to
be bathed every day?

734
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:27,199
No, no. That's the old-fashioned idea.

735
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,910
Oh, gosh. You're not gonna
disappoint me, are you?

736
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,662
Oh, no, I guess not.

737
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,749
- Heh. He's a cute one.
- Yes.

738
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,959
- What's his name?
- His name?

739
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,796
Um, uh, um, Robert. Robert.

740
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,422
Oh, that's a nice name.

741
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,799
Does he talk yet?

742
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,467
Uh...

743
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,219
No, no.

744
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,890
Does he like his baths?

745
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,559
Oh, yes, he loves them. I think.

746
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,833
Uh, shall I...?
Shall I test the water for you?

747
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,628
Oh, yes, please.
I always test the water.

748
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,258
You seem to know something
about bathing a baby.

749
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,218
Oh, yes. I used to bathe
my sister's kids.

750
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,970
You did?

751
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,471
Oh, sure. Lots of times.

752
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,265
- Really?
- It's okay.

753
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,767
Yes, I'm an expert.
My sister's babies got so used to me...

754
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,814
...they'd practically raise the roof,
if I didn't take over at bath time.

755
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,441
- Oh, isn't that wonderful?
- You mean you're gonna let me?

756
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,861
- Oh, well, if you're real careful.
- Oh, sure.

757
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,363
Come on, skipper. Come on, skipper.

758
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,116
We're gonna get along great.
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,161
Hurry up. Here we go.
Into the drink.

760
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,705
Yup, yup. Oh, there we are.

761
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,543
- Did you say the baby's name was Robert?
- Yes.

762
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,213
Uh, no, no. Uh, Roberta!

763
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,923
Oh.

764
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,224
- Soap?
- Soap, there.

765
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,809
Sponge?

766
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,060
Sponge

767
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,939
- We never use one. It isn't sanitary. Here.
- Oh.

768
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,699
Oh, it's such a relief to have
someone else do it for a change.

769
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,160
It gets sort of monotonous
bathing him... Uh, her...

770
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,204
...day after day after day...

771
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,748
Hey, take it easy there, princess.
You're rocking the boat.

772
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,959
Oh! Soap!

773
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,920
Roberta! How naughty of you.

774
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,963
Here, I'll wipe it off.

775
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,424
There. That all right?

776
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,259
- Over here.
- Oh.

777
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,387
- There.
- Thanks.

778
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,349
Oh, Roberta! She's eating the soap.
What'll I do?

779
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:00,769
- That won't hurt her. They all do it.
- Oh, really?

780
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:01,978
Oh.

781
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,023
You'd make a wonderful father,
Mr. Jones.

782
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,109
You're not married yourself
by any chance, are you?

783
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,238
No. The cards are stacked
against me, I guess.

784
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,449
Every time I meet a girl I like,
it turns out she's already married.

785
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,867
Oh, that's too bad.

786
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,454
But you would get married
if you found someone you liked...

787
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,957
...who wasn't married?

788
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,293
Well, it must be pretty nice
to have a home to come to...

789
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,171
...and a little lady like this.

790
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:31,299
Uh, she doesn't look like you.

791
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,303
- Does she look like your husband?
- Good heavens, no.

792
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,188
- I knew I should regret this.
- Me, also.

793
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,065
Now, hurry.
Yardley'll be here any moment.

794
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:52,070
Go into the kitchen, get the drinks for the judge,
bring them here, and I'll keep him entertained.

795
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,242
- Are you ready yet?
- No, not quite. Just a few more minutes.

796
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,662
Well, I hope it won't be too long. I've
gotta get home and trim my Christmas tree.

797
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:01,997
Trim your Christmas tree, eh?

798
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,542
Mm-hmm. Then I'm going to
hang up my stocking. Ha-ha!

799
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,921
- Oh, quick! Get back in there.
- Well, look, look.

800
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,591
No, not now.
I'm sorry, judge, I'm sorry.

801
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,098
How do you do? I'm Alexander Yardley.

802
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,934
Oh, yes, yes. How do you do?
I'm John Sloan.

803
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,269
Is Mrs. Lane in?

804
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,063
Mrs. Lane?
You mean Mrs. Sloan?

805
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,441
- I'm Mr. Sloan.
- Elizabeth Lane's husband?

806
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:32,402
Yes. That's... Yes, that's right.
Elizabeth Lane's husband.

807
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,404
- Come in, won't you?
- Thank you.

808
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,282
Well, I'm... I'm delighted
to see you, Mr. Yardley.

809
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,200
Well, the pleasure's all mine, Mr. Sloan.

810
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,412
It was most considerate of your wife to ask me.
Where is the little lady?

811
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,999
Oh, she's bathing the baby,
and I think Mr. Jones is helping her.

812
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,501
Well, well, that's what
I call real hospitality.

813
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,879
Taking the poor lad
right into your domestic life.

814
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,006
I am deeply touched,
Mr. Sloan, deeply touched.

815
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:55,800
- Your wife's a wonderful woman.
- Thank you. May I take these?

816
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,969
- Why, certainly.
- And have your coat?

817
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,448
Well, it's just about time
to feed her.

818
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,408
Feed her? Oh, yes.

819
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,286
Well, you do this and
I'll go get her dinner.

820
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,205
Heh. Okay.

821
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,625
Well, princess.
How we doing, huh?

822
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,336
Yeah.

823
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,130
Here we are.

824
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,758
Ah, Elizabeth, darling.

825
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,927
Oh, Merry Christmas, Mr. Yardley.

826
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,930
Merry Christmas, my dear Mrs. Lane.
Or, rather, Mrs. Sloan.

827
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,807
It's a great privilege,
a great privilege.

828
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:47,268
I have been admiring your charming room.
It's exactly as you described it.

829
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,647
But, uh, where is the spinning wheel?

830
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:53,650
- The spinning wheel?
- Oh, yes, the spinning wheel.

831
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,986
- You wrote about it last month.
- Yes, it's, um...

832
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,490
Oh, it's out being repaired.
You know how antiques are.

833
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:01,908
Oh, yes, of course.

834
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,035
But what a delightful room.

835
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,037
Such a magnificent fireplace.

836
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,831
I like a good, generous fireplace.

837
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,250
Makes a room so friendly
and warm, doesn't it?

838
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,628
Yes, indeed. Yes, I specialize
in fireplaces, Mr. Yardley.

839
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,548
I will never allow any of my clients
to plan without one.

840
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,051
But we don't depend entirely
on the fireplace to warm the house.

841
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,262
- No?
- Oh, no, no. I should say not.

842
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:25,890
No, we have unit heat, and each
heating pipe has a triple wall jacket...

843
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,143
...and all the outside walls
are double insulated.

844
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,146
- How interesting.
- Yes. It is. Isn't it?

845
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,026
Well, here we are, Mommy.
All dressed and ready for chow.

846
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:39,154
Mr. Yardley, this is Mr. Jones.

847
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,322
Mighty proud to meet you,
Jones. Mighty proud.

848
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,367
- Thank you very much, sir.
- And this is my, uh, husband.

849
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,035
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

850
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,121
It's a mighty fine baby
you have here, Mr. Lane.

851
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,832
- Sloan is the name.
- Well, well, what a cherub.

852
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,667
Cootchie, cootchie, cootchie, cootchie.

853
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,920
Oh, there, there.
That's no way to treat a stranger.

854
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,382
I'll take it. I'll have
Nora feed it tonight.

855
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:07,307
Lizka, he looks good on you.
Better than a mink coat even.

856
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,435
- Felix. How I need one of those.
- No, no, no, no, no. For the judge.

857
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,229
Oh, Mr. Yardley,
this is my uncle, Felix.

858
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,023
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

859
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,150
Oh, and how very thoughtful
of you, sir.

860
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:22,447
Excuse me, dear.
Speaking of fireplaces, Mr. Yardley...

861
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,950
...I'd like to take you and show you
a little ingenious thing I've invented.

862
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:32,403
- I brought you other one with two cherries.
- Thank you very much, Uncle Felix...

863
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,710
...but I can't wait any longer. I've gotta
get home and trim my Christmas tree.

864
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:39,672
- Please. I tell them you come back later.
- Why, yes. Of course. I don't live very far.

865
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,217
Just a little ways down the road.
They can call me.

866
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,761
- Here. Here's my card.
- That's very nice, very nice.

867
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,388
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
This way, please.

868
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,848
Come, come, come, come, come.

869
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,892
Out the window?

870
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,019
Oh, a shortcut, huh?

871
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:56,314
Ha-ha-ha! Why, thank you.

872
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,066
Don't mention it. It's a pleasure.

873
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,401
Merry Christmas.

874
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,954
Moth-proof closets, filtered ventilation,
and indirect lighting. As you see...

875
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,415
...I've introduced all modern conveniences
without sacrificing the traditionals.

876
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,294
Splendid, splendid! And I suppose
Elizabeth contributed her ideas.

877
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,921
Elizabeth? Oh, yes.

878
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,465
No, no. I should say not.
I'm the architect.

879
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,551
I never allow anyone
to interfere with my plans.

880
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,346
- Oh, Felix?
- Yes?

881
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,016
- Everything okay?
- Hunky-dunky.

882
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,519
Now I go to the kitchen and
make such a wonderful dinner...

883
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,020
...like you never had before.

884
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,398
But I thought Mrs. Sloan
was going to cook the dinner.

885
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:40,316
Uncle Felix is going to help me.

886
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,777
As a matter of fact, I've taught
him everything he knows.

887
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,321
And he always uses my recipes.
Don't you, Uncle Felix?

888
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:49,450
He thought he'd relieve me in the kitchen so
I'd have more time to spend with my guests.

889
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,910
That's very thoughtful of him.

890
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,957
But if you'll forgive
my saying so, Uncle Felix,

891
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,874
I won't feel the same as if you
had cooked it, Mrs. Sloan.

892
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,459
Believe me, you will feel much better.

893
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:11,598
<i>O little town of Bethlehem</i>

894
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,141
<i>How still we see thee lie</i>

895
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,310
Nice voice, that boy.

896
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,061
Yes.

897
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:22,525
<i>Above thy deep
And dreamless sleep</i>

898
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:28,489
<i>The silent stars go by</i>

899
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:32,994
<i>Yet in thy dark streets Shineth</i>

900
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:38,374
<i>The everlasting light</i>

901
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:45,965
<i>The hopes and fears
Of all the years</i>

902
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:53,222
<i>Are met in thee tonight</i>

903
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:01,731
Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't stop.

904
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:13,159
<i>I'm wishin' that I may</i>

905
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:17,038
<i>I'm wishin' that I might</i>

906
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:22,251
<i>Have the wish
That I wish tonight</i>

907
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:26,047
<i>I've told my lucky star</i>

908
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,758
<i>The wish that I made</i>

909
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,261
<i>And every time so far</i>

910
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,890
<i>She's come to my aid</i>

911
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:39,227
<i>It may not be today</i>

912
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,230
<i>It may not be tonight</i>

913
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:48,319
<i>But I'm sure
it will be all right</i>

914
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:53,366
<i>And maybe by tomorrow</i>

915
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:57,829
<i>If I wish with all my might</i>

916
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:05,086
<i>I might have the wish
I wish tonight</i>

917
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,532
<i>American Housekeeping,
that's our competitor.</i>

918
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,409
They imitate us in all departments.

919
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,453
Format, layout and contributors.

920
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,455
Now they've instituted
a Betty Kane column...

921
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,290
...a complete steal on Elizabeth Lane.

922
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:45,209
- Imitation is the sincerest flattery.
- That is not all.

923
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,170
- Betty Kane is going to have a baby.
- No.

924
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:50,423
- Yes, sir. We've got to nip it in the bud.
- The baby?

925
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,967
I'll tell you how we can kill
two birds with one stone.

926
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,219
- Murder.
- My dear sir.

927
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,014
Last May, our circulation jumped 200,000.

928
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:01,225
Think of it, 200,000 new readers
with one issue. Do you know why?

929
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,937
- I can't imagine. Another brandy?
- Thank you.

930
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,106
Because your wife had a baby.

931
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,275
She did? I mean, we did?

932
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:13,488
Twenty-three pages of new advertisements,
all baby food.

933
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,615
Her fan mail went up 100 percent.

934
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,867
A hundred percent! Think of it!

935
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:20,703
Other new mothers all over
the country were interested.

936
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,289
That is the key of my success
in the magazine field.

937
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,541
Human interest, home appeal.
Do you follow me?

938
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,251
Yes. Go ahead. It's very interesting.

939
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,879
One baby, 200,000.
Two babies, 400,000.

940
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,547
Babies boost circulation.

941
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:35,009
Now Betty Kane is going to have
her baby in September.

942
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:39,597
We can steal their thunder and boost circulation
at the same time, if we beat her to it.

943
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,182
Beat her to it?

944
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,644
Have another baby, my dear Sloan.
Have another baby. Any hopes?

945
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:47,855
Mr. Yardley, Elizabeth's
a very busy woman.

946
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,525
And having babies to boost
your circulation takes time.

947
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,529
Take all the time you need, my dear sir.
All the time you need.

948
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,738
Well, thank you.

949
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,951
- Yes, Nora?
- Telephone for you, Mr. Sloan.

950
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,911
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Yardley.

951
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,091
Hello? Oh, hello, judge.
Yes, I'm glad you called.

952
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,052
What? 15 minutes?
Oh, my goodness.

953
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,555
Yes, indeed.
Absolutely. All right.

954
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,641
Well, I'll arrange everything.
Okay. Goodbye.

955
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,061
Well, my children,
I guess it's bedtime.

956
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:30,565
We retire early on the farm.
Come along, Elizabeth.

957
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,900
John, it's Christmas Eve.

958
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,820
The judge will be here
in 15 minutes.

959
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,906
I'm just about ready to turn in.

960
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,701
Nothing like a good dinner
to make a man sleepy.

961
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,829
I'm very grateful to you
for your hospitality, Mrs. Sloan.

962
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,122
You're welcome, Mr. Yardley.

963
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,875
I'll just turn out the lights, dear.
Good night, everybody.

964
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,543
- Good night.
- Good night.

965
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,426
Good night, Mr. Yardley.
I hope you sleep well.

966
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,928
I'm sure I shall in that fine
old colonial four-poster.

967
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,763
Good night, Mrs. Sloan.
Good night, Jones.

968
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,974
Good night, Mr. Yardley.

969
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,107
Well, good night, Mrs. Sloan.

970
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,151
Good night, Mr. Jones.

971
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,046
Good night, Nora.

972
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,964
Good night.

973
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,841
Well, of all the brazen...

974
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,928
Right in front of me very eyes.

975
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,975
Well, I arranged that very neatly,
didn't I, dear?

976
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,644
Yes, you did.

977
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,313
And to think that in 15 minutes,
we shall be man and wife.

978
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,065
Come.

979
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:07,161
Nora, where are you going?

980
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:10,539
Mr. Sloan, I've been working
for you five years...

981
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:14,335
...and never did I believe that you'd be
the kind of a man that would...

982
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:16,170
Of course, I'm not blaming you entirely.

983
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,005
It's the woman that leads
the man astray.

984
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,716
- What are you talking about?
- I'm quitting.

985
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,510
Christmas or no Christmas,
I'm quitting.

986
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,971
But you can't leave now.
We shall need you as a witness.

987
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,577
The judge'll be here in a few
moments to perform the ceremony.

988
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:30,893
Oh, saints of mercy,
what have I been saying at all?

989
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,854
Oh, Miss Lane, I didn't mean it.
I apologize.

990
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,857
Oh, glory be, I could bite me
wicked tongue out, so I could.

991
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,568
- Never mind, Nora. It's all right.
- Bless your heart, miss.

992
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:43,030
Sure, I might've known you weren't the
kind that would... But it's just that I...

993
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,574
- Oh, forget it, Nora.
- Thank you, miss.

994
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,828
Ah, sure, 'tis all the luck in the world
I do be wishing you both.

995
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:51,914
- Thanks.
- Well, I'll go and take me things off then.

996
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,703
- Ah, judge.
- Hello.

997
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,081
- Mighty nice of you to come back again.
- Not at all, Sloan, not at all.

998
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:38,002
My conscience wouldn't let me rest
until you two were married.

999
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:41,756
- Good evening, Miss Lane.
- Good evening.

1000
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,717
Come along, Elizabeth.
The judge hasn't much time.

1001
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,219
Well, come on, dear.

1002
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,349
Oh.

1003
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:55,353
Let's go into the den,
it's more private there.

1004
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,398
Look out! Quick! Someone's coming!
Come on, Quick!

1005
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:25,549
Hello. Well, how did you
get down here?

1006
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,134
Down the back stairs.

1007
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,178
I'm still catching up
with my nourishment.

1008
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,721
Have a drumstick.

1009
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,099
Mm, don't mind if I do.

1010
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:40,981
Ah. Nice cold Chablis.

1011
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:43,936
Nothing like it with a drumstick.
How about it, Jones?

1012
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,821
I wish I could. A good bender
might make me feel better.

1013
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:50,032
I suppose an experience like yours
leaves a fellow wobbly, eh?

1014
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,702
Mr. Yardley...

1015
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,666
...do you think Mrs. Sloan
is happy with her husband?

1016
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,419
Why, certainly.
He's a nice, sensible chap.

1017
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,921
Steady, conscientious, successful.

1018
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,841
Yeah, I guess that kind
does make a good husband.

1019
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:10,177
Indubitably, my boy, indubitably.
A fine couple.

1020
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,599
- What's he doing now?
- I don't know. He's still in the kitchen.

1021
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,768
- I hear voices.
- We can't wait any longer.

1022
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,603
Let's get on with the ceremony.

1023
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:25,359
- What about witnesses?
- Oh, yes. We must have witnesses.

1024
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:26,861
I'll get Felix and Nora.

1025
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,988
All right, dear.
But hurry, hurry!

1026
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:31,115
Skimmed milk for six weeks, Mr. Yardley.

1027
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:34,368
You don't know how wonderful it is
for a guy to be able to come downstairs...

1028
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,120
- ...and raid an icebox.
- You're telling me?

1029
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:38,330
I've been on a diet
of creamed turnip fluff.

1030
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:41,500
- What are they picking on you for?
- Doctor says I'm too fat.

1031
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,627
Tsk-tsk-tsk. Can you imagine that?
- I began feeling better...

1032
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,668
...the minute I stopped
paying any attention to him.

1033
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,884
Mmm. Mrs. Sloan can
certainly roast a chicken.

1034
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,136
Cold chicken is my weakness.

1035
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:55,055
- Have some more chicken, sir?
- Thank you.

1036
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,017
Oh, hello.

1037
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,519
Caught us red-handed, didn't you?

1038
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,480
Not at all. I'm glad you feel at home.

1039
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,446
- How about a wing, Mrs. Sloan?
- No thank you. I couldn't eat a thing.

1040
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,735
- A glass of wine, perhaps?
- No, I must be going.

1041
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:10,154
- No, wait a while.
- No, really, I have to go.

1042
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,614
If you'll excuse me.

1043
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,533
What's that?

1044
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,952
- Why, that must be Macushlah.
- Macushlah?

1045
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,412
Your cow. That's right.

1046
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:21,081
You did say in one of your articles
she wouldn't settle down...

1047
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,792
...unless you go in
and bid her goodnight.

1048
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:27,004
Well, hello, Macushlah. Heh-heh.

1049
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,050
I'll help you put her back
in the barn if you like.

1050
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:33,552
That's very nice of you, Mr. Jones,
but I don't think I...

1051
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,889
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
I'll get your coat for you.

1052
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,433
The perfect pastoral touch.
This is a real experience.

1053
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,769
- Won't you finish your supper?
- Thank you.

1054
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,354
Mrs. Sloan, would you mind...

1055
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:46,398
...if I came down and watched you
cook breakfast in the morning?

1056
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,608
Watch me cook breakfast?

1057
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,945
Yes. I remember what you said
about the charm of an attractive woman...

1058
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,073
...performing her homey little task
of flipping flapjacks...

1059
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,284
...with the smell of good coffee
and sizzling bacon in a sunny kitchen.

1060
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,851
I'm homesick for a sight like that.

1061
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:01,080
Well, you see, Nora
usually fixes breakfast.

1062
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,790
You do it tomorrow just for me.

1063
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:05,167
- Mr. Yardley, I...
- This is the only one I could find.

1064
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,879
Hold everything.
We'll be right with you.

1065
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,548
Mr. Jones, I'm very tired.

1066
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,092
I think I'd better call Nora.

1067
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:15,427
Soo, boss. Soo, boss.
Soo, boss.

1068
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,221
No, now quit your griping.

1069
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,931
Here.

1070
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,474
Here she is.

1071
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,157
- What a night.
- What a night.

1072
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,785
Moonlight, snow.

1073
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,745
And a cow.

1074
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,455
Do all animals take to you,
Mrs. Sloan?

1075
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,292
Oh, yes, of course.
Some more than others.

1076
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,587
Yes. They have their likes and dislikes,
just like human beings.

1077
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,131
- Yes.
- Myself, I like most people.

1078
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,049
Some more than others,
of course.

1079
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:57,595
Is there anyone you like more
than the others at the moment?

1080
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,597
Definitely.

1081
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,057
Um, a girl?

1082
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,892
Yes.

1083
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,395
Are you in love with her?

1084
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:09,356
Well, in a way, yes.

1085
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,400
In what way?

1086
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:14,570
Well, I... I admire her very much.

1087
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,364
I think she's about
the swellest person I ever met.

1088
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,742
Is that as far as it goes?

1089
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:23,120
- She's, uh... She's married.
- Oh.

1090
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,334
Does, uh...?

1091
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,960
Does she like animals?

1092
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,046
Yes.

1093
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:35,341
Do animals like her?

1094
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,217
Oh, yes.

1095
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:40,304
Does she live on a farm?

1096
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,931
Uh, yes.

1097
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,808
Jefferson Jones,
are you flirting with me?

1098
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,895
- Oh, no, I wouldn't dare.
- Oh, don't apologize. I'm flattered.

1099
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:50,189
It's always intriguing
to a married woman to find...

1100
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,483
...she's still attractive
to the opposite sex.

1101
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,360
- But I...
- Uh...

1102
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,905
Do I attract you?

1103
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,574
Yes.

1104
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:04,787
But you see, you were so different
from what I expected. I was...

1105
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,164
- Knocked for a loop?
- You just said it.

1106
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,083
Oh, how nice.

1107
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,085
But I... I shouldn't have told you.

1108
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,462
Your being married and all that, I...

1109
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:16,924
But, you know, I find it
hard to believe you are married.

1110
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:19,718
I find it pretty difficult myself.

1111
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,805
You don't act as if you were married.

1112
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,307
I don't feel as if I was married.

1113
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,309
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1114
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:30,187
Must be the moonlight
and the snow.

1115
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,772
And the cow.

1116
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,650
Oh, where is the cow?

1117
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:36,402
Oh, you must have
dropped the rope.

1118
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,613
Could be.
My hands got so cold.

1119
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,948
Oh.

1120
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:45,536
Gosh, they are cold.
Let me warm them for you.

1121
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,749
Oh, that's fine.

1122
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:54,294
Uh, have...?

1123
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:57,381
Have you ever kissed
a married woman?

1124
01:01:57,548 --> 01:01:59,007
No.

1125
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,509
No?

1126
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:01,927
No.

1127
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,638
No, you're not the type.

1128
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:07,391
I, uh... I wish I was.

1129
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:09,810
Oh, me too.

1130
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,900
Well, and that's that.

1131
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,819
Yeah. I guess it is.

1132
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,654
Better look for the cow.

1133
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,490
Yes, I guess we had better.

1134
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,413
- Oh, there she is.
- That's the barn.

1135
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,040
It is? I mean, it is.

1136
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,333
Yeah.

1137
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,045
Do you think
she got back there all by herself?

1138
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,589
Maybe.

1139
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,387
There she is.

1140
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,392
Nice cow.

1141
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,186
Lovely brown eyes.

1142
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,480
Oh, no, no. They're gray.

1143
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:58,692
Really? All the cows I ever knew
had brown ones.

1144
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,486
Nice firm rump.

1145
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:03,322
Oh.

1146
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:06,241
Well, good night, Macushlah.

1147
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:09,161
Good night, Macushlah,
and thank you so much.

1148
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,184
Elizabeth, are you all right?

1149
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,771
Oh, I feel wonderful, darling.

1150
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,898
How are you?

1151
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,402
Oh, I thought you'd gone to bed.

1152
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,863
No, dear. There are one or two
things we have to discuss.

1153
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,157
- Tonight?
- It's been an upsetting evening.

1154
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,535
Of all the insane,
inconsiderate things to do.

1155
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,955
- Could I help it if the cow got loose?
- The cow. A fine how do you do!

1156
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,541
- The judge was very annoyed.
- Oh, was he?

1157
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,918
Yes. Do you mind?

1158
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:00,003
But really, Elizabeth,
this is very awkward.

1159
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,090
- I mean, where am I going to sleep tonight?
- You sleep in your room...

1160
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,418
...and I've already put my things
in the guest bedroom.

1161
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,010
Oh, fine. And this is my wedding night.

1162
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,428
Go to bed, John.

1163
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,722
But, darling, we've got to
get these things settled.

1164
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,475
- Go to bed, John.
- Oh, all right. If you insist.

1165
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,042
But the judge'll be here first
thing in the morning, and I...

1166
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:18,647
- Good night, John.
- Good night.

1167
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,108
Please.

1168
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,111
But I shan't sleep a wink.

1169
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,532
Not a wink.

1170
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:10,657
The cow? What happened then?

1171
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,660
- Nothing. The judge went home.
- Now I like cows.

1172
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,621
Oh, Felix, he's so wonderful.

1173
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,497
Sure. They are fine animals.

1174
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:21,168
Milk and cream they give
and butter too. And buttermilk.

1175
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:24,254
- No, no. I mean Mr. Jones.
- Uh-huh.

1176
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,215
I've never met anyone like him
before in my whole life.

1177
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,843
Oh, Lizka, Lizka.
You give me goose pimples.

1178
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,347
Watch now. I show you
how to flip-flop the flop-flips.

1179
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,934
On... up!

1180
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,313
Ah. You see? It's easy.

1181
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,857
Now you try it. Throw it up.

1182
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,610
Up!

1183
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,528
Not on the stove.

1184
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,782
In the pa... Now. Throw it with this.

1185
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,577
High, high, high, high.
Oh... Up!

1186
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,665
Ah. Up.

1187
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,838
Take this. Throw it up.

1188
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,507
High, high, high. Oh, up!

1189
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,720
Lizka! Better you
cook on the typewriter.

1190
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,974
- Oh, Felix, what am I going to do?
- Don't ask me. Ask the rocking chair.

1191
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,352
I'll answer it.

1192
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:27,025
I'm Mrs. Gerzeg.

1193
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,778
Thank you so much for taking care
of our babies while we work.

1194
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,863
Mrs. Wright told me
you took care of hers.

1195
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,740
Yes, but where is her baby?

1196
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,534
She doesn't need to
leave her baby today.

1197
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:38,912
She's not working. I have to work.
So I leave you mine.

1198
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,790
- Yes, but...
- I have to go to work. Thank you so much.

1199
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:44,167
Darling, be careful.
He's no trouble at all.

1200
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,878
His name's Louie.
I'm late to the factory.

1201
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:49,297
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1202
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,719
He?! Oh!

1203
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,263
Hey! Uh... Oh.

1204
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,515
Oh, Felix. This is awful.

1205
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,726
We have a new baby.
It's a boy.

1206
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,979
It's life. Sometimes you get girls.
Sometimes, boys.

1207
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:07,232
- Mrs. Sloan.
- Oh, here, quick, take it.

1208
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:10,402
Take it around the back to the bedroom.
Hurry up.

1209
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,783
- Hello.
- Good morning. Merry Christmas.

1210
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,036
I hope I'm in time
to see you flip the flapjacks.

1211
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,288
I'm not in a flipping mood
this morning, Mr. Yardley.

1212
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:22,706
Nora will attend to breakfast.

1213
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,833
Nora, Mr. Yardley wants
to watch you flap...

1214
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,127
I mean, flip the flapjacks.

1215
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,087
I don't flip them. I scoop them.

1216
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,774
Won't you flip
just one for me, please?

1217
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:34,134
I never flipped in me life, and I'm not
gonna start flipping now for nobody.

1218
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:35,469
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

1219
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,430
Uh, I must go now.
If you'll excuse me, please.

1220
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:41,117
I've been looking for you everywhere.
The judge is in the study.

1221
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,018
Let's hurry before anyone sees us.

1222
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:48,482
But John, couldn't we all
have breakfast first?

1223
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:49,775
Oh, there you are.

1224
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,652
Now, if you'll stand here,
please, and join hands.

1225
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,196
Where are the witnesses?

1226
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,824
Mrs. Sloan. Oh, excuse me.

1227
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,285
Well, this looks like a wedding.

1228
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,329
It does? I mean, it is.

1229
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,122
You see, it's an old custom.

1230
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,916
We were married on Christmas day...

1231
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,251
...so we usually repeat
the ceremony every Christmas.

1232
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,838
Well, well, what a charming idea.
I hope you don't mind my being here.

1233
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,759
- I'm quite a sentimentalist myself.
- Now all we need is one more witness.

1234
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,261
- Suppose I get Mr. Jones?
- Oh, no, no. I'll get Felix.

1235
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,430
No, no. You stay here.
I'll get Felix.

1236
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,478
Felix!

1237
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,064
Felix!

1238
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,483
The judge is here.
We shall need you as a witness.

1239
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,152
But Mr. Sloan, something happened.
Something terrible.

1240
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,737
- Catastroph.
- What is it?

1241
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:38,156
The baby. The baby. My watch.

1242
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:41,409
I gave him to play with it.
He put it in her mouth.

1243
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:43,370
Goodbye, watch.

1244
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:45,580
You mean to say the baby
swallowed your watch?

1245
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,290
Oh, good heavens,
I must call a doctor.

1246
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,543
The police too.
It was a gold watch.

1247
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,671
- What's the trouble?
- The baby swallowed his watch.

1248
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:56,174
- I'm calling a doctor.
- Oh, how awful. I must go to it.

1249
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,179
Now, don't get excited, Mrs. Sloan.
Babies often swallow things like that.

1250
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:04,349
Poor darling! Does your little tummy hurt?

1251
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,686
That's strange.
He looks different this morning.

1252
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:10,689
Well, wouldn't you look different
if you had swallowed a watch?

1253
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:11,982
But he's a blond.

1254
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,526
- Mama! Mama!
- He has teeth.

1255
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:18,405
- And he talks.
- Mr. Yardley, this is no time to take inventory.

1256
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,410
Oh, please, go. I must get him quiet.
Please go.

1257
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:25,954
Most extraordinary thing I ever saw.

1258
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,632
- How is it?
- There's only one thing to do, Sloan.

1259
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,635
- A good dose of castor oil.
<i>- I'll</i> go upstairs and see if we have any.

1260
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,637
When is that doctor going to get here?

1261
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,932
I wouldn't want anything to happen to that baby.
It would ruin the circulation.

1262
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,268
It wouldn't do
the baby no good, neither.

1263
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,902
- Lizka.
- Felix, this is awful.

1264
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,653
Has the doctor arrived yet?

1265
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,448
- No, but the judge went home.
- Oh.

1266
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,579
Felix! Oh!

1267
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:12,250
Oh, Felix, you did it to stop the wedding.

1268
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:16,838
- If a cow can do it, I can do it.
- Oh, Felix, you're wonderful!

1269
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:18,506
Moo!

1270
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,468
- Excuse me.
- What's the matter?

1271
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,346
- The baby swallowed a watch.
- He swallowed what?

1272
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,349
- Felix's watch.
- He gave it back.

1273
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,934
The baby swallowed that?

1274
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,770
Mm-hmm. Everything is hunky-dunky.
Still going.

1275
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,772
How is the child? Is it all right?

1276
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:36,358
- Oh, perfectly fine.
- Where's Mr. Yardley?

1277
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,110
- I think he's in the den.
- Let's have breakfast.

1278
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:40,917
- Good morning, Mr. Jones.
- Good morning.

1279
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,906
You're having lots of excitement
around here this morning.

1280
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:45,492
- Yes, but it's all over now.
- Mind if I see the baby?

1281
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,662
Oh, no. You mustn't.
It's been through a trying experience...

1282
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,081
...and I want it to rest.
Suppose you have breakfast.

1283
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,416
Nora's making some lovely pancakes.

1284
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,711
- Where's the judge?
- He will be back later.

1285
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:00,340
But if you don't get married then,
you will have to wait until next year.

1286
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:03,009
Well, that settles it.
I'm tired of having my marriage put off.

1287
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,137
- I'm going to tell Mr. Yardley the truth.
- No, John, plea...

1288
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,891
I think it best we skedaddle.

1289
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:15,105
When the bag lets out the cat,
somebody gets scratched, hmm?

1290
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:17,440
Mr. Yardley, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

1291
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,848
There's something I want
to talk to you about too, Sloan.

1292
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,362
- Something important.
- But what I have to say...

1293
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:25,615
I'm not easily fooled. I know the real
from the fraudulent every time.

1294
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:28,076
Exactly, I knew you'd realize,
and that's why I decided...

1295
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:30,036
- Those models are yours, of course.
- Yes, of course.

1296
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,622
They're splendid, Sloan.
That's why I want to talk to you.

1297
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,000
- Those?
- Yes. I told you about my competitor...

1298
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,377
...in <i>the magazine field,
American Housekeeping.</i>

1299
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:40,463
I'm going to keep 10 jumps ahead of them.
I'm starting a new department.

1300
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,923
But Mr. Yardley...

1301
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,210
A "Build Your Own Home" section
for post-war planning.

1302
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,928
I need an editor for it.
A man who is honest and dependable.

1303
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:50,724
I know you're the real thing. I know you're
pretty busy, but this thing will pay well.

1304
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,185
- Well, it all sounds very wonderful, Mr. Yardley.
- You bet it's wonderful.

1305
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,272
It's the biggest promotion plan
in the country...

1306
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:59,524
...and the tie up with the Elizabeth
Lane feature will put it over.

1307
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,568
I can see our February
cover right now.

1308
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:04,446
Beginning in this issue, "John
Sloan, Elizabeth Lane's husband...

1309
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,489
...conducts our new
home-planning department."

1310
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,199
And you'll put that on the cover?

1311
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,869
That's right. Now, what is it
you wanted to tell me?

1312
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:13,705
As a matter of fact, it was
almost exactly the same thing.

1313
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:16,082
Well, there you are,
great minds think alike.

1314
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,877
Mr. Yardley, Mr. Jones is
way ahead of you on flapjacks.

1315
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:21,838
He is, is he? Well, I'll give him
a head start of a dozen...

1316
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:24,090
...and still eat him under the table.

1317
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,676
- Did you tell him?
- Well, no. I decided not to.

1318
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:30,221
There's no point in destroying his Christmas.
Come on, let's have breakfast.

1319
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:37,771
Mrs. Sloan, would you mind doing
something for me, as a special favor?

1320
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,147
Anything you want,
Mr. Yardley.

1321
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,274
Would you mind just
flipping me one flapjack?

1322
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:44,277
Flip... Heh.

1323
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:45,612
Well, you see, Mr. Yardley...

1324
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:49,074
Oh, just one to please me, huh?

1325
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,784
Uh, but, Mr. Yardley...

1326
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,036
Won't you please, Mrs. Sloan?

1327
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:55,080
Oh.

1328
01:12:55,246 --> 01:13:00,335
Well, all right,
but I'm a little out of practice.

1329
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,762
- Oh, come on.
- Go ahead.

1330
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,430
Go on, dear.

1331
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:25,235
- Bravo!
Ha-ha! Wonderful!

1332
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,745
And for dinner, Mr. Yardley,
we will have potage Mongol...

1333
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,915
...with roast goose Bernoise
with walnut stuffing.

1334
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:42,001
Oh, Uncle Felix, stop.
Please, you make my mouth water.

1335
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:49,050
Good morning. Mr. Sloan?

1336
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:50,593
- Yes.
- How do you do?

1337
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,637
- How do you do?
- I'm Homer Higgenbottom.

1338
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:55,598
I represent the Christmas entertainment
committee of Stanfield.

1339
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:59,269
Mr. Sloan, I understand you're
entertaining Jefferson Jones, the war hero.

1340
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,563
- Is this the young man?
- Yes, that's right.

1341
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,524
- I am proud to shake your hand, young man.
- Thank you, sir.

1342
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:07,444
We're having a community dance
this evening at the town hall.

1343
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,730
People of Stanfield would
consider it a great honor...

1344
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,906
...to entertain you and your guests.

1345
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,575
I hope you can all come.

1346
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,410
Well, how about it, Elizabeth?

1347
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:17,912
A dance?

1348
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,790
Do you dance, Mr. Jones?

1349
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,376
Oh, I get around.

1350
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,837
I think it would be lovely.

1351
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:33,094
Salute your partners!
On the right! On the left!

1352
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,430
Join hands, circle left!

1353
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,729
Meet your partner!

1354
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,856
Promenade!

1355
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:52,071
Forward, and everybody swing!

1356
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,829
Forward and do-si-do!

1357
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,708
Around to the right!

1358
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,545
Now around to the left!

1359
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,925
Around you go!
Swing your partners right and left!

1360
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,219
Isn't this lovely?

1361
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,055
Eighteen days on a raft was
nothing compared with this.

1362
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,896
And with the new pre-fabricated
methods and post-war plastics...

1363
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,524
...we shall positively
revolutionize home building.

1364
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,943
Quite right, Sloan.
Quite right.

1365
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:38,243
Sashay down the ﬂoor!

1366
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:41,955
Around you go!

1367
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:47,043
Form an arch,
and all follow through!

1368
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:56,135
Everybody forward and form a star!

1369
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,888
Around to the right!

1370
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,726
Now to the left!

1371
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,816
All break away!

1372
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:31,004
You see, with the new high-compression
plywood, we'd become pioneers.

1373
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,755
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Sloan.

1374
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:36,175
But remember this whole proposition depends on
that other matter that I discussed with you.

1375
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,677
What other matter, Mr. Yardley?

1376
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:42,724
We've <i>got to beat American
Housekeeping to that new</i> baby.

1377
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,185
Oh, of course, of course.
That will be attended to, naturally.

1378
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,741
It's just the sort of thing
a progressive architect like myself...

1379
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,036
Mr. Sloan, Mr. Yardley, we are relying
on you two to start the bond sale.

1380
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,204
- Why, of course.
- Whenever you say.

1381
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,290
If you'll follow me, gentlemen.

1382
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:06,599
Sure is nice here.
I'll hate to leave tomorrow.

1383
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:09,519
- That soon?
- I'm due back tomorrow night.

1384
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:14,399
<i>- I'll</i> have to leave early in the morning.
- Oh. So this is our...

1385
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,069
Your last night here?

1386
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:21,155
I had a wonderful time.
You've all been very kind to me.

1387
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,991
Oh, let's keep on walking.

1388
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:28,287
<i>But your shoes'?</i>

1389
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:31,499
Oh, yes, they are sort of inadequate.

1390
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:35,753
I guess I was just letting
my imagination run away with me.

1391
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,463
Why not?

1392
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,760
- My lady, your carriage.
- Oh, we couldn't!

1393
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,805
It's just parked here.
Nobody'll mind.

1394
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:47,640
We'll make believe
we're going for a ride.

1395
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,853
Where should we go?

1396
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,355
Well, where do you generally
go in your dreams?

1397
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:59,026
The horse is moving.

1398
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,155
- It wasn't tied up.
- Uh-uh.

1399
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,854
Confound it.

1400
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,367
Speaking of marriage...

1401
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,037
- Were we?
- No.

1402
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,206
I guess I was just talking out loud.

1403
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,333
I've got marriage
on my mind these days.

1404
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,376
So have I.

1405
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:01,964
Um, if I wasn't married,
what would you say to me now?

1406
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,802
Well, first I'd call you Lizka,
like Uncle Felix does.

1407
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,804
- Say it.
- Lizka.

1408
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,056
Say it again.

1409
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,808
Lizka.

1410
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,434
And then what would you say?

1411
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:16,979
I... Gosh, I guess I couldn't say anything.

1412
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,941
I know. It's all so lovely.

1413
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,818
So lovely.

1414
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,736
You're lovely too.

1415
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,822
Go on, don't stop.

1416
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,698
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

1417
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,451
I'm having fun,
I admit that, but believe me...

1418
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,912
...if I'm making fun of anybody,
it's Elizabeth Lane.

1419
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,498
- Why?
- Oh, she's so smart. Knows all the answers.

1420
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:38,960
Gets herself into a mess and hasn't
the moral courage to get herself out of it.

1421
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,045
You're not very happy, are you?

1422
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:44,090
Well, I'm as happy as I
have any right to be.

1423
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:47,260
I think you deserve
all the happiness in the world.

1424
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,428
You do?

1425
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,847
I think you're wonderful.

1426
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,598
You do?

1427
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:58,020
- Maybe we'd better turn back.
- No. Not yet.

1428
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,107
Okay.

1429
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,700
I'm going to spend
the night at me sister...

1430
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:16,831
Mm-hmm. That makes
50,000 I owe myself.

1431
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:19,208
I'm going to spend
the night at me sister's.

1432
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,460
Mrs. Gerzeg worked
overtime tonight...

1433
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,880
...and she'll be coming along
pretty soon for her baby.

1434
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,132
If she cries,
you better change her.

1435
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:28,175
Mrs. Gerzeg?

1436
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,511
Ah, never mind. Skip it.

1437
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:32,054
Good night.

1438
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:47,904
Hey, you.

1439
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,405
Hey!

1440
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:55,453
- Where do you think you're going?
- That's what we'd like to know.

1441
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:58,664
Stealing my sleigh for a joyride, huh?
Well, get out.

1442
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,042
- Oh, we didn't steal it.
- That's what you say.

1443
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,210
You're four miles from
where Mr. Harper parked it.

1444
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,922
- Holy smokes!
- You didn't get very far, did you?

1445
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,299
Well, the horse just walked
away with us accidentally.

1446
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,385
- Oh, sure. Heh-heh.
- Tell that to the judge, will you?

1447
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,971
- You mean, you're arresting us?
- That's right, lady.

1448
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,458
- Oh, isn't that wonderful?
- Sorry, lady. In the car.

1449
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,360
- Oh, but, mister, really...
- All right, Harper. There's your sleigh.

1450
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:22,146
- You better show up to prefer charges.
- Thanks, sheriff.

1451
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:45,419
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

1452
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:53,386
It's me, Mrs. Gerzeg.

1453
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,471
I've come for my baby.

1454
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,144
Hey! Hey!

1455
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,730
Felix!

1456
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,316
Felix!

1457
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,694
Where is everybody?

1458
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,364
Give me the police.
The state troopers.

1459
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,701
The FBI. Quick!
This is Alexander Yardley.

1460
01:23:58,868 --> 01:24:01,370
Certainly it's an emergency!
A baby has been kidnapped.

1461
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:02,830
- Kidnapped?
- Yes.

1462
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:05,499
Look, don't get excited.
Everything is hunky-dunky.

1463
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,168
Hunky-dunky.
Are you out of your mind?

1464
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,462
Do you realize what this baby
means to my circulation?

1465
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,630
- Mr. Yardley, please.
- No, don't argue with me.

1466
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:15,384
Get Sloan. Go down to the town hall
and bring him back immediately.

1467
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:19,180
Hello. Is this the state police?
This is Alexander Yardley.

1468
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:22,183
Yes, the Alexander Yardley.

1469
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,894
The Smart Housekeeping baby
has <i>been</i> kidnapped!

1470
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:28,064
Could we have a description
of the baby?

1471
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,399
- Can we have some photographs?
- We're from the <i>Daily Press.</i>

1472
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,401
- How old was the baby?
- What's he look like.

1473
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,987
He's 8-months-old. A boy.
He has blond hair and teeth.

1474
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:36,447
- Blond hair and teeth?
- No, no.

1475
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,449
- No blond hair? No teeth?
- That's right.

1476
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:41,577
I'll give a $25,000 reward
for the return of that baby.

1477
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,120
Twenty-five grand!

1478
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:45,331
It's Elizabeth Lane's, the most
famous baby in the country.

1479
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,083
- Where are its parents?
- Here's Sloan now.

1480
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,919
- Will you give us a story, Mr. Sloan?
- Quiet, please. He doesn't know yet.

1481
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,171
Come inside, my boy.
I have something to tell you.

1482
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:54,757
Keep a stiff upper lip.
Everything's going to be all right.

1483
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:56,092
Excuse me.

1484
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:12,608
- I'm sorry about the arrest, Mrs. Sloan.
- That's all right.

1485
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:15,528
Of course, if we'd realized who you
people were, it wouldn't have happened.

1486
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:16,862
- That's all right.
- Good night, ma'am.

1487
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,239
Good night.

1488
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,702
- Good night? It's morning.
- Heh-heh.

1489
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:26,747
- Imagine us being arrested. Ha-ha!
- Heh-heh-heh.

1490
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:29,994
Maybe your husband won't think it's so
funny, coming home at 7 in the morning.

1491
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:31,836
Oh, they all went to bed hours ago.

1492
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,963
We seem to have company.

1493
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,381
Yeah.

1494
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:05,953
Uh-uh!

1495
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,038
- No?
- No.

1496
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:21,635
Elizabeth, where've you been?

1497
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,802
- Where have you been?
- When did you last see the baby?

1498
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,433
Quiet, everybody.
Where do you suppose she's been?

1499
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,160
She's been out searching
every nook and cranny for her lost baby.

1500
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,813
- Mr. Jones has been helping.
- My lost baby?

1501
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,980
There, there, Mrs. Sloan.
You mustn't collapse now.

1502
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:36,567
No, indeed. You must be brave.

1503
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:39,778
- Hold still, Mr. Jones.
- Did you get any ransom note?

1504
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,573
Take it easy, boys.
Mr. Jones is just out of hospital.

1505
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:45,534
Go into the kitchen, Jones.
Felix has some coffee for you.

1506
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,495
Boys, you realize Mrs. Sloan
has had a very trying time.

1507
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,542
I will let you know of
any further developments.

1508
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:53,918
- We'll take care of everything, Mr. Yardley.
- We'll have an extra on the street in an hour.

1509
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:57,296
- You hear any news, let me know.
- I will.

1510
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,634
Now, then, what is this all about?

1511
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,136
Fine time to be asking what
it's all about, young woman.

1512
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,680
Lucky thing for you I prevented
the press from printing the truth...

1513
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,557
...whilst you've been
gallivanting about all night.

1514
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:11,018
Oh, I haven't been gallivanting,
I've been in jail!

1515
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:12,436
- In jail?
Mm-hmm.

1516
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:15,147
- Your baby.
- What about my baby?

1517
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:17,441
- It isn't here, dear.
- Of course it isn't.

1518
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:21,445
No. I saw it being kidnapped.
Our baby, the Smart Housekeeping baby.

1519
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,739
- Kidnapped?
- As I came home, I saw a woman...

1520
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:27,326
...in a cloak and hood go out of this
house, carrying your baby in her arms.

1521
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:30,037
- Oh, that. Don't get so excited.
- Elizabeth!

1522
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:34,708
Well, of all the heartless, callous, irresponsible
women I've ever met in my whole life.

1523
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:38,837
You can sit there and tell me not to
get excited, while your own baby...

1524
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:41,173
Be careful, Mr. Yardley,
or you'll have a stroke.

1525
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,342
This is incredible.

1526
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,386
This is fantastic.

1527
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:49,932
Here, I believe you to be the finest,
the most exemplary wife and mother.

1528
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:52,685
Mr. Yardley, if you'd just
sit down and calm yourself...

1529
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:55,729
Of all the brazen, cheap...

1530
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:58,691
Ah. I suppose you've fallen in love...

1531
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,360
...with this young
whippersnapper-hero Jones?

1532
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:05,281
Well, um, frankly, I...

1533
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:06,782
I have.

1534
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:13,247
So your husband and child
no longer mean anything to you.

1535
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:15,332
Well, let me tell you
something, Mrs. Sloan.

1536
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:18,627
If you feel no moral responsibility
towards your husband and child...

1537
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:22,256
...I have a magazine to protect, understand?
And if you think you can make a mockery...

1538
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:24,704
...of the Yardley publications,
you're very much mistaken.

1539
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:26,322
My public believe in you, Mrs. Sloan.

1540
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:30,472
Millions of women in these United States
pattern their daily lives after that feature.

1541
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,726
And you're gonna live up to their ideals,
or my name is not Alexander Yardley!

1542
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:38,397
But if you'd just let me talk a minute.
You see, John and I were never married.

1543
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:42,860
Never married?
Such blatant immorality!

1544
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:45,195
But you don't understand, Mr. Yardley.
We meant to get married.

1545
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,239
Yes, but we never got around to it.

1546
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:50,743
You mean to stand there and tell me
the Smart Housekeeping baby is...

1547
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,287
- Oh, no. No.
- Oh, no. No.

1548
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:56,707
Thank heaven, at last.
You'll be rewarded, my good woman.

1549
01:28:56,874 --> 01:29:00,461
- Good morning.
- Two babies?! Which one is yours, Mrs. Sloan?

1550
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,212
- Hers?
- You make fun.

1551
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:04,715
- These are our babies.
- Uh, Nora, she takes care of them.

1552
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:08,052
- While we're at the war plant.
- We're on the early shift today.

1553
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,763
- Yes, darling.
- Thank you so much. Goodbye.

1554
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:14,391
- Will someone take this...? This...?
- What are you doing to that child?

1555
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:18,771
- What am I...?
- Aw, give it to me. The poor little thing.

1556
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,857
- Nora, you'd better take them upstairs.
- Oh, indeed, I will that.

1557
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,402
Aw, there now. There now.

1558
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:26,945
Oh, the poor things.

1559
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:30,741
If it's not asking too much,
will you explain?

1560
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:33,744
Well, it's all very simple.
I have never lived on a farm before.

1561
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:36,413
- Never lived?
- No, I have no husband and no baby.

1562
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,956
And she can't cook.

1563
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,586
No husband? No baby?

1564
01:29:42,753 --> 01:29:45,631
Well, of all the dirty,
scoundrely tricks to play.

1565
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:48,884
But Mr. Yardley, we were
only trying to protect the feature for you.

1566
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:52,262
Protect? Do you realize what you've done?
My face will be in all the papers.

1567
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,516
I'll be the laughingstock
of the publishing business.

1568
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,268
Give me the police.

1569
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:05,359
This is Yardley,
Alexander Yardley.

1570
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:09,321
It was all a mistake. The baby's all right.
There's been no kidnapping.

1571
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:12,825
I tell you, it was all a mistake!

1572
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:19,248
As for you, young woman,
you're fired.

1573
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,168
Now, see what you've done.
Why'd you tell him?

1574
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,711
I didn't tell him. He found out.

1575
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:27,923
After all I've clone to help out,
you have to spoil it all. Where were you?

1576
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:31,635
Well, we were sitting in a sleigh,
and the horse walked off with us.

1577
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:35,305
A likely story. First a cow and then a horse.
I don't know what to think.

1578
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:37,724
Well, think the worst, John.
You always would, anyway.

1579
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:40,436
- You're not even sorry for what you've done.
- No.

1580
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,646
And I think you're glad it happened.

1581
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:44,898
Well, I must say the way you've
been behaving isn't exactly...

1582
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:48,026
As the wife of John Sloan,
the eminent architect, should behave?

1583
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,987
You've disrupted my household.

1584
01:30:50,154 --> 01:30:51,905
Yes, I have, haven't I?

1585
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:54,241
You told Yardley
that you were in love with Jones.

1586
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,618
Of course all that's an absolute
lot of nonsense, but...

1587
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,871
Oh, please. Now, where was I?

1588
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:00,539
You were throwing me over, I think.

1589
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:03,250
I cannot afford to incur the enmity
of a man like Yardley.

1590
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:06,777
- Oh, no, no. Of course you can't.
- I must say you're taking the thing very lightly.

1591
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:09,173
Lightly? What do you want me to do?
Weep on your shoulder?

1592
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:12,384
- I've been through as much as I can stand!
- There's no reason to raise your voice.

1593
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,636
- My nerves won't stand it.
- That's fine!

1594
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,138
That settles it.

1595
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:17,806
What's the matter?

1596
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,475
- Is something bust?
- Plenty.

1597
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:22,519
More company.

1598
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:27,941
Does Miss Elizabeth Lane live here?

1599
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,694
Everybody lives here. Come in.

1600
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:35,407
Jeffy, boy! Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
How do you feel?

1601
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,910
Well, just great. I feel great.

1602
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,370
Oh, my, but it's good to see you.

1603
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:43,081
Uh, this is Miss Mary Lee.

1604
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:45,250
Oh, yes, your fiancée.

1605
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,002
Fiancée?

1606
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:50,422
Yes. Mr. Yardley told me all about it.

1607
01:31:51,507 --> 01:31:54,218
I'm surely delighted
to meet you all.

1608
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:55,802
How do you do?

1609
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:59,181
It was so sweet of you to have Jeffy boy
out here for Christmas.

1610
01:31:59,348 --> 01:32:01,558
It was a pleasure.

1611
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,811
Oh, Jeffy, I've got so much to tell you.

1612
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,731
About our engagement and everything.

1613
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:11,985
Uh, why did you come up here at this hour?

1614
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:15,197
Well, Mr. Yardley phoned
for me to come as a surprise.

1615
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:16,990
But I was sort of delayed.

1616
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,701
Then I took the wrong train
and landed in Bridgeport.

1617
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:23,914
I got the milk train back. It was simply awful.
There was no diner on it.

1618
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:28,293
Well, uh, maybe you'd like some breakfast.

1619
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,255
Well, thank you.
I haven't had a bite since last night.

1620
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,132
Felix will fix you some.
I have to pack.

1621
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:41,807
In case I don't see you again,
Mr. Jones, goodbye.

1622
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:43,016
<i>L.</i>

1623
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:46,812
It was certainly
an experience knowing you.

1624
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,106
Goodbye, Miss Lee.

1625
01:32:49,273 --> 01:32:51,984
Goodbye, and I'm surely grateful to you.

1626
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:56,655
I guess I'd better pack too.

1627
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:59,866
Run along, Jeffy boy.
I fix Miss Lee.

1628
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:01,910
I won't be long.

1629
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:15,632
My, he certainly does look good.

1630
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:17,926
Hmm? Fine boy.

1631
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:21,597
- And to think I've got to break his heart.
- You got to what?

1632
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,640
Break his poor little heart.

1633
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:25,142
Why do you do that?

1634
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:27,561
Well, you see, after he left the hospital,
I married.

1635
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:30,939
- Mm-hmm. You got married?
- I married Sinky.

1636
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,067
Hmm? You mar... What?

1637
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:35,652
You get married?!

1638
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:37,362
Yes, I married Sinky.

1639
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,323
You...

1640
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,491
Who is...? Who is this Stinky?

1641
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:44,328
His pal. He was on the raft
with Jeffy boy.

1642
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:47,914
She... You married!
Come quick! Come with me!

1643
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,542
Quick, come along with me!
In here! In here!

1644
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:52,711
- I mean...
- I fix your breakfast.

1645
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:58,050
I want to have a few words with you,
Mr. Yardley.

1646
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,594
I have nothing more to say, Sloan.
She's fired.

1647
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,013
- Oh, not about that. I mean the contract.
- Contract?

1648
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:06,266
Yes. The home-planning feature
in Smart Housekeeping.

1649
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:09,603
- Now, an idea has grown on me...
- Oh, that. Well, you'll have to see...

1650
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,273
I'm hungry-

1651
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,776
But, uh... But, Mr. Yardley.

1652
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:18,403
Ah, good morning, Felix.

1653
01:34:19,905 --> 01:34:22,574
Mmm. What a delightful aroma.

1654
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:24,785
You're a good chef.

1655
01:34:26,495 --> 01:34:29,331
Do I smell kidneys?

1656
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:30,999
Special for somebody.

1657
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,460
But, Felix, I'm famished.
And kidneys...

1658
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:35,629
Cook your own kidneys.

1659
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:38,465
I don't cook for somebody
that's not nice to my friends.

1660
01:34:38,632 --> 01:34:40,759
Why, I've done nothing
to your friends, Felix.

1661
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:44,179
- No? You fired Elizabeth.
- Well, didn't she make a fool of me?

1662
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:47,724
Pishy-poshy! You done it!
Nobody can tell you something.

1663
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,686
Sometimes, if you shut up,
maybe you learn something.

1664
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,689
Now, look here, Felix.
I'm not an unreasonable man.

1665
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,108
So then maybe you don't
fire Elizabeth, yes?

1666
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:59,486
- Well, maybe not.
- Yes or no?

1667
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:01,738
Well, I don't know
after the way she lied to me.

1668
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:05,701
She lie? For you, she lied!
Anyway, she got another offer.

1669
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:07,828
- Another offer?
- Yes!

1670
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:11,623
Heh-heh-heh.
This came last night. I show you.

1671
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:18,213
I read it to you.

1672
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,383
"I can offer contract
with <i>American Housekeeping."</i>

1673
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,261
<i>American Housekeeping!</i>
I <i>like their nerve stealing my people!</i>

1674
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:27,308
They won't get away with it. I'll outbid them.
I'll give her a big raise.

1675
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:29,433
No, no, no, no!
Wait, wait a minute!

1676
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:31,435
Cross your heart.

1677
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:40,318
Kidneys! Kidneys! Kidneys!

1678
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,863
- Please.
- Uh, thank you, Felix.

1679
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,656
I hope we'll have many meals together.

1680
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:46,950
Any time. At Restaurant Felix.

1681
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:49,536
- No cover charge.
- Uh-huh.

1682
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,165
Having a nice breakfast,
Mr. Yardley?

1683
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:55,959
Yes. Everything is hunky-dunky.
Heh-heh-heh.

1684
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:58,170
Very hunky-dunky!

1685
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:02,883
Jeffy boy, put down the bag.

1686
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,676
- Where is everybody?
- Shh, shh.

1687
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:07,554
Miss Lee is in the den
waiting for breakfast.

1688
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:10,432
But first, I have news for you.
Come, come, come.

1689
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:14,269
Yes. I'm finished with her.

1690
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,813
- You mean you're not gonna marry her?
- I am not.

1691
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,774
And now, Mr. Yardley,
about that contract.

1692
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,221
There's only one contract
that interests me at the moment.

1693
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,528
The Elizabeth Lane contract
with Smart Housekeeping.

1694
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,198
- You were perfectly right to fire her.
- Fire her.

1695
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,034
I'm not going to fire her.

1696
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:31,077
I'm going to double her salary.

1697
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:44,925
- Who is it?
- Yardley. I want to have a few words with you.

1698
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:46,510
Come in.

1699
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:50,639
What does he want?

1700
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:54,059
I don't know.
But I know what I want.

1701
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:56,645
You mean to tell me Lizka
did all this because of me?

1702
01:36:56,812 --> 01:36:58,355
Positively.

1703
01:36:58,522 --> 01:37:00,023
I've got to talk with her.

1704
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,400
I should wait till
the fat man comes out.

1705
01:37:04,653 --> 01:37:05,904
Listen, my boy...

1706
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:09,074
So I've come to ask you to reconsider
leaving my employment.

1707
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:11,701
- As I remember it, you fired me.
- I spoke in temper.

1708
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:13,995
I want you to stay,
with a big raise, of course.

1709
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:15,413
A raise?

1710
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,833
I'll <i>double</i> any offer
<i>American Housekeeping makes.</i>

1711
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,125
<i>American Housekeeping?</i>

1712
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:21,253
Yes, my dear,
Felix told me of their offer.

1713
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,754
Oh, he did, did he?

1714
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:25,257
But you wouldn't want to leave
old Yardley, now, would you?

1715
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:26,883
Oh, wouldn't I?

1716
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,719
I'd even give Sloan that contract.

1717
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,221
Well, I'm glad of that.

1718
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:33,515
I know he's a bore,
but why not marry the man?

1719
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:36,601
It'd make a great difference to circulation.
Husband and wife on the same paper.

1720
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,562
I can see the heading
of your next column.

1721
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,731
Quote, "My dear husband now
joins me in my daily work.

1722
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:45,235
Here we are, side by side,
fellow workers in the vineyard. My baby..."

1723
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,445
Unquote. You're a great fixer, aren't you?

1724
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,652
Well, I think if you'll listen to me,
you'll find...

1725
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,379
- Suppose you listen to me?
- Miss Lane...

1726
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:54,953
Listen to me. I'm tired of being pushed around.
Tired of being told what to do.

1727
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:58,540
Tired of writing your gall-darned articles.
Tired of dancing to everybody else's tune.

1728
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:02,377
Tired of being told whom to marry.
In short, I'm tired.

1729
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,087
- But, Miss Lane...
- Oh, get out.

1730
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:05,630
- You'll regret this.
- I said, get out!

1731
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,966
Well, really...

1732
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:14,472
- Most unreasonable woman I've ever met!
- Well, she's crazy! Even last night...

1733
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,642
Pardon me, gentlemen.
This is where I take over.

1734
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:22,981
Well, what does he think
he's going to do?

1735
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:24,816
I give you one guess.

1736
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,991
Don't hear a thing.
I wonder what's happening.

1737
01:38:35,327 --> 01:38:36,536
Why did you do that?

1738
01:38:36,703 --> 01:38:38,330
- I changed my type.
- What do you mean?

1739
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,297
Now I'm the type
that does kiss married women.

1740
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:41,708
- Oh.
- And I like it.

1741
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,585
- Well, I don't like it!
- No?

1742
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:46,713
- There's only one thing to do with you.
- Yes? Let's do it.

1743
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,715
No! No!
Now don't you come near me!

1744
01:38:48,882 --> 01:38:51,384
- You attract me, remember?
- Well, you forget, I...

1745
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:52,761
Oh-ho, no, I don't.

1746
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:55,368
You're a married woman,
but you don't feel like one. Remember?

1747
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:56,598
Well, it's not fair.

1748
01:38:56,765 --> 01:38:59,351
Oh, there are rules to this game, are there?
You must teach me.

1749
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:02,354
Well, uh, men who are engaged must...

1750
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,189
- Play the game.
- Yes.

1751
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:07,150
- Well, let's play.
- Well, uh...

1752
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,779
- They've stopped talking.
- That's good.

1753
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:13,198
Mr. Yardley, have you noticed
the even temperature in this room?

1754
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:15,075
- That's the triple-wall insulation.
- Oh, shut up!

1755
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,284
Yes.

1756
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:21,331
- Excuse me.
- Good heavens.

1757
01:39:21,498 --> 01:39:23,875
- It's just little me.
- I forget all about you.

1758
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,794
Your breakfast is in the kitchen.

1759
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:28,254
Won't you join us and wait'?

1760
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,714
What are you waiting for?

1761
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,716
Only Uncle Felix knows.

1762
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:33,969
Well, I'm powerful hungry.

1763
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:36,972
- I'll show you where the kitchen is, my dear.
- Thank you.

1764
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:43,478
- What's...?
- Shh!

1765
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,732
Don't you come near me,
you sea wolf!

1766
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:50,235
- After the way you deceived me.
- I deceived you?

1767
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:51,528
- You're engaged.
- You're married.

1768
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:54,114
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Nor has my engagement.

1769
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,076
- If you take another step, I'll scream.
- Go ahead and scream. Scream the house down.

1770
01:39:58,243 --> 01:40:00,412
Perhaps your husband
will come to your rescue.

1771
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:04,374
- I haven't got a husband.
- You haven't?

1772
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,001
No.

1773
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:07,752
Then Felix was telling the truth.

1774
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:09,462
Felix told you?

1775
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:11,297
Everything.

1776
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:13,258
Then you knew all the time?

1777
01:40:13,425 --> 01:40:14,884
Yes.

1778
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:17,637
I know something you don't know.

1779
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:19,347
I'm not engaged anymore.

1780
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:20,932
You're not?

1781
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,435
She married my shipmate.

1782
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:25,145
She did?!

1783
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:28,064
I'm as free as a bird.

1784
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,610
That's what you think.

1785
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:39,367
- They've stopped talking.
- What, again?

1786
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:41,453
But this time, it's for keeps.

1787
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,874
Now I bring the judge, yes?

1788
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,500
- But definitely.
- Yes, please.

1789
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:50,920
Well, young man, I suppose
you know what you're doing...

1790
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,922
...but I warn you, she can't cook.

1791
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:56,426
- She can't cook?
- No, I... I can't cook.

1792
01:40:56,593 --> 01:41:00,680
She can't cook, but what a wife! Ooh!

1793
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:03,183
I hope you'll be very happy.

1794
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:04,934
Thank you.

1795
01:41:06,436 --> 01:41:09,064
What a Christmas. Ha-ha-ha!

1796
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:10,565
What a Christmas.
