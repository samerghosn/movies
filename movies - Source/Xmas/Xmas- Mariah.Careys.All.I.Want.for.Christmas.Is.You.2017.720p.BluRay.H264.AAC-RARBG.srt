1
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,054
I'm gonna tell you
the story of my first love.

2
00:00:55,557 --> 00:01:00,228
It was cuddly with fuzzy ears and
a little wet nose, and, well,

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,021
more about that later.

4
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,481
It happened at Christmas time.

5
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,111
Hey, come on now.

6
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,072
I said, "It happened
at Christmas time."

7
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,450
Happy holidays!

8
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>That's more like if.</i>

9
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,328
What are you getting from Santa?

10
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:18,495
Great to see you!

11
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,825
Every Christmas,
I asked for a puppy to love,

12
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,746
and this Christmas,
I especially wanted one.

13
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,664
Hi, Mariah!

14
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:02,998
I like your dog.

15
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,629
Oh... Thank you.

16
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,381
Have you heard of the Community Charity
League fashion show we're putting on?

17
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,050
Mmm-hmm. I signed up
to do refreshments.

18
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,135
Of course I had heard of it.

19
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,847
It was only the biggest
talk of the town.

20
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:21,058
Such a cool idea to raise
money for the pet shelter.

21
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,602
Fashion and friends.

22
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,146
Matching outfits
for you and your pet.

23
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,064
We're talking about
being in the show.

24
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,524
Really?

25
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,526
Oh, my gosh!
I would love to be in it!

26
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,069
Thank you so much!

27
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,531
Great. We're short
one girl with a dog.

28
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,656
Oh...

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,074
I don't have a dog.

30
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,868
Mmm, sorry.
We thought...

31
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:47,836
Wait!

32
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,586
I'm gonna have one soon.

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,173
I'm gonna ask for one
for Christmas.

34
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,800
Supercool!
Perfect!

35
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:57,052
Come meet us at school today
at 4:00 for rehearsal.

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,764
We are so excited for you
to be in the show with us.

37
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,098
Be on time!
Be on time!

38
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,520
Vicky and Grace were only the
coolest girls in my whole school.

39
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,438
I mean, these two
had it going on.

40
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,358
They were going places.

41
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,526
Good luck with that.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,112
Mariah, why did
you tell them that?

43
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,240
Mom and Dad won't
let you have a dog.

44
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,786
My little brother
and sister, Brett and Beth.

45
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,430
So supportive.

46
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,331
They loved teasing me about
how much I wanted a dog

47
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,376
and how many times I had asked.

48
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:30,545
But they were right.

49
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,296
Who was I kidding?

50
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,300
I'd been asking for a puppy every
Christmas, every birthday, every...

51
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,634
You get the idea.

52
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:41,848
But my mom and dad
always said no.

53
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,272
To be fair,
my dad was allergic to dogs.

54
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,707
I'm talking
really crazy allergic.

55
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:21,012
And Mom was very, well...

56
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,514
She liked to keep
the house just so.

57
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,752
Oh, honey, we're doing
all red and white this year.

58
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,798
Since Mom and Dad wouldn't
budge on letting me have a dog,

59
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,718
I went over their heads,
straight to the big guy.

60
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,805
We're talkin' Santa Claus.

61
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,057
Every year,
I put "puppy" on my list.

62
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,978
I was sure Santa really
wanted me to have a puppy,

63
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,230
but, for whatever reason, he
couldn't seem to get it together.

64
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:17,567
I mean, I didn't know how they ran
things up there in the North Pole.

65
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,663
Dagnabit!

66
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,542
But it seemed to me like maybe
Santa was in over his head.

67
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,757
Um, boss?
Excuse us, sir.

68
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,884
You forgot a couple...

69
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,639
Hmm...
I'm not sure about that.

70
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,058
Maybe Mom and Dad
had something to do

71
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,769
with Santa not
getting me a puppy.

72
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,514
Sorry.
I'm running late again.

73
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,858
Butterscotch.
My favorite!

74
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:04,115
You can have the cookies as
long as you don't leave a dog.

75
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,077
Nah.

76
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,622
Mom and Dad would never have
done anything like that to me.

77
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,791
Anyway, this Christmas,

78
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,463
I was determined
my present would be a puppy.

79
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,464
Gorilla!
Come back, Meatball!

80
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,634
Whoa! Gorilla!

81
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,637
Down, Meatball!

82
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,350
- Mariah!
- What's up?

83
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,478
Hi, Holly.
Hi, Ernesto.

84
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,064
Let's do a whipsnake!

85
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,316
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

86
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,608
Uh, I gotta go.

87
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:40,860
We just got here.

88
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,737
I have fashion show rehearsal
with Vicky and Grace.

89
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,238
Vicky and Grace?

90
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,406
Ooh! Popular.

91
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,909
I thought you and me were
doing refreshments together.

92
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,411
Uh, well, loan
still do 'em both.

93
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,579
I'll see ya.

94
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,581
We can skate tomorrow.

95
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,516
What's wrong?
I'm on time.

96
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,685
"On time" is almost late.
Let's get going.

97
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,187
Our motto is, "You
snooze, you lose."

98
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,654
Remember, students,

99
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,447
you'll be making your final
outfit choices today,

100
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,699
and you must bring them home

101
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,451
so they can be laundered and
pressed for the dress rehearsal.

102
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:32,786
Aw! How cute!

103
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,206
Don't forget to come Thursday
dressed in your outfits.

104
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,002
<i>I had gotten myself into a fix.</i>

105
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:48,052
I wanted a puppy,
but now I really needed one.

106
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,644
I had pretty much given up on
Mom and Dad, and Santa, too,

107
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,562
but when everyone
else lets you down,

108
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,314
there's always Grandma, right?

109
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,817
Honey, my hands are cold.
Let's step in here.

110
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,319
But it's almost 6:00.

111
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,906
I think she'll stay open for us.

112
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,411
Merry Christmas, Emiko.

113
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,331
Mariah! So nice to see you.
Hello, Lucy.

114
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,584
So sorry, Mrs. Inadomi,
I know you're closing, but...

115
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh...
Isn't he darling?

116
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,132
Sure, but you know
what Mom and Dad say.

117
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,757
"Dogs are trouble!"

118
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,512
But ever so worth it
and ever so snuggly.

119
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,557
Grandma!
Is that even sanitary?

120
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,980
Did you see that? Remember
what I said about grandmas?

121
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,650
They have a sneaky way of figuring
out how to make everyone happy.

122
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:49,238
Mariah, I hear you're working
on the pet fashion show.

123
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,115
Thanks to you kids, we'll be
able to have our adoption fair.

124
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,663
She's a little older, and those
puppies were climbing all over her,

125
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:01,708
so I moved her to her
own special apartment.

126
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:06,464
She's a quiet little girl,
never hear a peep out of her.

127
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:10,634
And that's how it
happened, love at first sight.

128
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,052
Oh...

129
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,888
She's so sweet!

130
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,349
So well-behaved,
and doesn't shed.

131
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,308
She's hypoallergenic.

132
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,312
Did someone maybe tell you
my dad's allergic to dogs?

133
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:23,648
Huh?

134
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,984
I was just pointing out
one of her many attributes.

135
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,736
She's such a little
princess in every way.

136
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,280
Oh, that's such a perfect name.

137
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,075
Princess!

138
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,076
That was it.

139
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,495
I was hooked.

140
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,998
I didn't want
just any dog anymore.

141
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,584
I had to have Princess.

142
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:48,129
Christmas time

143
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:53,970
Is in the air again

144
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:59,933
Christmas chimes reminding me

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,938
Of when we

146
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,732
Fell like the snow

147
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,110
So deep in love

148
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:14,948
High above us, the evergreens

149
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:19,662
Sparkle with lights
and feel the breeze

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,500
As we made future
Christmas memories

151
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:34,927
For a honey to
hold Christmas Day

152
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,265
And to feel love
like ours always

153
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,578
And the dream is to share
this Christmas cheer

154
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,873
With you all throughout the year

155
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,583
And not wait till the morning

156
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,671
When Christmas time

157
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,840
Is in the air

158
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,927
Christmas time is everywhere

159
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,182
Christmas time

160
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:28,272
Is in the air again

161
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,365
Again

162
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,537
And again

163
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,125
Naughty!

164
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,389
Oh, Grandpa Bill.
Not again.

165
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,642
Grandpa Bill!
Not again!

166
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,645
You've just got to stop this!

167
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,149
I am sick of these blinkin' lights
keeping me awake all hours.

168
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:17,571
Mmm-hmm. Funny, seeing as Grandpa's
room was at the back of the house.

169
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,741
What was really goin' on was
he had Christmas display envy.

170
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,163
Mom liked things tasteful,
you know, understated.

171
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,666
So, Grandpa took
out his frustrations

172
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,251
on poor Mr. Ingersoll's
blinking lights.

173
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,504
You're gonna get in trouble!

174
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,883
Plug those back in!

175
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,927
Can't remember
which one goes in which.

176
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,178
Come here, show me.

177
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,307
Nuh-uh, I'm not trespassing.

178
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,312
Come away from there!

179
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,357
Where are you going?

180
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,403
Cut it out!

181
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
Come on!

182
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,167
Quick!
They're gonna catch you!

183
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,794
Catch us, my partner in crime.

184
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,048
I'm not your partner in crime.

185
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,562
You're impossible.

186
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,481
So, on top of keeping
Grandpa out of trouble

187
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,400
and making sure I had Princess
by the fashion show,

188
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:40,236
I had a lot to deal
with that Christmas.

189
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,490
Auditions for the spring
musical were coming up,

190
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,993
so I was dying to make a good
impression on my choir teacher.

191
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,495
Beautiful!

192
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,181
And I had to get my little
brother to keep our back door shut.

193
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,937
Uh, the back door was wide open.

194
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,730
I know I closed it.

195
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,856
Brett?

196
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,067
Sorry.

197
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,860
What were you two doing outside?

198
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,365
Oh, darling, we've been admiring
Ingersoll's Christmas display.

199
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,283
It's a doozy this year.

200
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,034
There's no accounting for taste.

201
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,953
It's an eyesore.

202
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,705
Oh, there's my girl.

203
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,039
Come here, Penny.

204
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,043
I have a vision for
a whole reindeer herd

205
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:41,215
pulling a sleigh the size of a Winnebago
that can fit the whole family.

206
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:45,009
It'll wrap around the house,
continue up on the roof.

207
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,346
A thousand blinking lights.

208
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,474
Let's see Fred Ingersoll
top that!

209
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,225
Blinking lights?

210
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,476
Tacky.

211
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,812
Not in our yard.

212
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,105
Ow!

213
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,816
Wait till they're baked.

214
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,149
Oh, come on.

215
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,783
Dad's got the tree!

216
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,368
Brett...

217
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,078
Close the door, dude.

218
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,044
I had to give it to Grandma.
She knew how to work it.

219
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,131
She really made
a case for Princess.

220
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,217
You can't use the dog
allergy excuse this time.

221
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,928
Ahhh! Mom!
You heard me.

222
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,099
The dog's hypoallergenetic,
or whatever they call it.

223
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,562
Oh, Brett, sweetie...

224
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,855
Let's not do tinsel.
It's so...

225
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,316
Tacky.

226
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,860
And you can't say
she hasn't earned a pet.

227
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,113
She's so responsible
and thoughtful.

228
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,615
Does her chores and everybody
else's chores, too.

229
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,783
Ouch!

230
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,036
Top of her class,
soloing in the choir.

231
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,288
Model United Nations
representative.

232
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,707
Mrs. Reyes better
elect her Model UN president.

233
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,751
Oh! I so hope
that she gets it.

234
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,961
What does Mariah hope for?

235
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,715
These are Mariah's goals.

236
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,217
Maybe 'cause someone
told her they should be.

237
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,638
Ow!

238
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,804
Ma!

239
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,850
Lucy, all her accomplishments could fall
apart with a distraction like a pet.

240
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,644
What's wrong with a distraction?

241
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,105
She needs to be a little girl.

242
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,981
She doesn't know
what she'd be taking on.

243
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,234
Uh, Bud, that garland's
upside down.

244
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,322
And when she finds out
she's in over her head,

245
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,240
I'll be the one
taking care of a mutt.

246
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,326
It's time to put
the topper on the tree.

247
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,370
I've got that totally covered.

248
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,375
Daddy.

249
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,586
Up you go, Supergirl.

250
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,178
Isn't she the most beautiful
dog you've ever seen?

251
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,015
Where are you going?

252
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,434
I got to get ready to take
my brother to the airport.

253
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,437
Oh, I have something
for Uncle Reg.

254
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,023
I made him a potholder.

255
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,107
Hmm.

256
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,068
Yeah, that's very
thoughtful of you, Mariah.

257
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm sure he'll treasure it.

258
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,133
What do you call that thing?

259
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,594
It's not a thing.
She's a dog.

260
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,137
I asked Santa for her.

261
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,598
Well, a lot of good
that had done me in the past,

262
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:42,104
but I was still hoping that somehow
Santa would get it right this time.

263
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:46,232
Her name is Princess,
and she's a poochon.

264
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,234
A "poo-chon"?

265
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,114
Such a loving and
supportive little brother.

266
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,743
Dopey, it means
part poodle and bichon.

267
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,912
And she's perfectly perfect.

268
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,833
Oh, look, now she's part pug.

269
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,170
Brett...

270
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,501
You're such a clown.

271
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,632
Jealous.

272
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,550
Priceless.

273
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,556
I can help, Mariah.

274
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,807
No, thanks, Beth.

275
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,686
You're scared I'll mess her up.

276
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:28,525
No, I'm not. It's just...
I'm done. There.

277
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,364
Daddy could never say no to me.

278
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,449
Look, Daddy!

279
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,536
But he always figured out
a way to do it without saying it,

280
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,829
especially when
it came to a dog.

281
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,666
Possible.
Maybe, maybe not.

282
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,045
I'll get back to you on that.

283
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,714
I'll have to discuss
that with your mother.

284
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,260
You'll have to take
that up with Santa.

285
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,262
But this Christmas
was his best yet.

286
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,224
He really pulled
a fast one on me.

287
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,654
I can wrap some
of yours, Mariah.

288
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,031
Um...

289
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,909
I think I've got it, but thanks.

290
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,586
Mariah, I think you hurt
your sister's feelings.

291
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,671
Oh, no.

292
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,297
I didn't mean to hurt her...

293
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,673
Couldn't you let
her wrap just one?

294
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,342
Does it really
matter how it looks?

295
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:39,011
Well, this one's for my teacher,
so it's got to be perfect.

296
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,973
We should've discussed this.

297
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,893
It'll work out
just fine, trust me.

298
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,941
Well, lookie here.

299
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,358
What's that, Daddy?

300
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,778
I have a proposal for you.

301
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,363
Can't wait to hear it.

302
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:02,201
Reggie needs a dog-sitter for, you
know, his, uh, pooch, while he's away.

303
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,828
Uncle Reggie has a dog?

304
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,329
Mmm...

305
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,789
It was a recent acquisition.

306
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,625
Thought he couldn't
have pets at his apartment.

307
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,672
Well, they made an
exception for this one.

308
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,590
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

309
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,551
Can I dog-sit the dog?
I can dog-sit!

310
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,054
Oh, no, you didn't. No.

311
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,224
Oh, Daddy, I'd be the best dog-sitter ever.
Let me see! Let me see!

312
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,728
And I fell right into his trap.

313
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,314
But, wait!
Here's the deal.

314
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,442
Let's see how you do
dog-sitting this guy,

315
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,612
and then we'll see about...
What's her...

316
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,695
Princess!

317
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,031
I can have Princess
if I dog-sit?

318
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,115
Grandma!

319
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,867
Dog-sit well.

320
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,829
I'm all about well. That's me. I can
do well. I promise. Let me see him.

321
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,164
I bet he's so cute.

322
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:52,044
Yeah. He sure is.
Something like that.

323
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,545
Okay.

324
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,672
Oh, boy.

325
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,507
Bud, you're not going to...

326
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,510
Oh...

327
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,679
He's a...

328
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,307
Is that a dog?

329
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
Ugh!

330
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,019
Uh...

331
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,688
Don't worry, Pen, I'm pretty
sure Reggie house-trained him.

332
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,065
What's his name?

333
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
Huh?

334
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,983
Don't look at me, darling.

335
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,361
Oh, yeah.
Uh...

336
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,948
Did Uncle Reggie even train him?

337
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,031
Hey.

338
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,368
Jack!

339
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,244
Come here, Jack.
Come here, baby.

340
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,329
Bud!
Come over here.

341
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,455
It's harmless.

342
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,539
Oh, no.

343
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,962
Come here, good boy.

344
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,714
Catch him, Grandma.
Come here, you!

345
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,883
I said, "Hey"!

346
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,719
Demon.
Bud, do something!

347
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,962
Settle down now.
I'll get you.

348
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,555
Ooh!
Off the couch!

349
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,307
Hey, now stop that.
Can you sit? Stay?

350
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,059
Lie down?

351
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,854
Catch him! Good Lord,
I think he has rabies!

352
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,105
Come here, you!

353
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,272
Jack.

354
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,776
Whoa!

355
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,911
Where's he going?

356
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,330
My steaks.

357
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,922
Stop!

358
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,092
Hey. Hey! Hey!

359
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,261
Drop it, you thief!

360
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:27,931
What's for dinner?

361
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,766
Shut the door!

362
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:31,852
Whoa!

363
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,270
Some kind of giant rat thing
just ran past me.

364
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,111
Steak! All right!

365
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,322
I know. I know, Pen.

366
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,450
We should've discussed
this together first.

367
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:50,244
Oh, Bud, dear... It looks
like he took your steak.

368
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,915
Jack!

369
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,501
Here, boy!
Here, baby!

370
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,462
Come here, little guy!

371
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,298
Jack!

372
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,468
Uh...

373
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,969
Hi, Mr. Ingersoll.

374
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,056
Did you maybe see a
small dog thing around?

375
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,142
It's just befuddling.

376
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,394
Can I help you with something?
What's that?

377
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,771
Oh! Hello, Mariah.

378
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:21,233
I just can't figure out
why my lights aren't blinking.

379
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,736
I bought blinking lights.

380
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,989
Just not as cheerful
when they don't blink.

381
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,991
Not sure, Mr. Ingersoll.

382
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,037
Jack!

383
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,371
Where'd you go?

384
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,957
Jack!

385
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,507
Jack?

386
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,320
Hold still, guy.

387
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,038
Yum!
This looks so tasty.

388
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,047
Scrumptious.

389
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:27,968
This is the best steak I've
ever had in the world.

390
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,135
Yum-yum.

391
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,261
Nuh-uh!

392
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,596
This is my dinner.

393
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,013
Yum...

394
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,101
Come on, you know you want it.

395
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,894
Follow me.

396
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,314
That's it.

397
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,107
Just a little further.

398
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,615
Ha! I got ya!

399
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,201
Hi.

400
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,828
Oh, congratulations, Mariah.

401
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,122
Let's take a look.

402
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,207
Oh, he's a beautiful specimen.

403
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,586
Grandpa, did you do something
to Mr. Ingersoll's lights?

404
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,844
It's my secret weapon.
The Unblinker.

405
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,930
You screw it in
anywhere on the strand,

406
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,473
and they all become Unblinkers.

407
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:20,144
It'll drive Ingersoll
blinkin' mad.

408
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,439
Grandpa, that's so naughty.

409
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,488
Oh, honey, I think this dog
is too much of a handful.

410
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,450
Don't feel like
you have to keep him.

411
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,119
No way, Mom. I'll do
anything to get Princess.

412
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,955
I'm taking care of this dog.

413
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,333
Dad and I have a deal.

414
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,044
I can do it.

415
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,628
I know I can.

416
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,050
Hmm... Well...

417
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,554
I guess if anyone
can do it, you can.

418
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,640
He's gonna need
a leash for starters.

419
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,392
Oh! I know all about
dog supplies.

420
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,809
And a bath.

421
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,151
It's just water.

422
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,403
Ow!

423
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,073
Have you ever had a bath before?

424
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,824
Come here! Stop it!

425
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,161
What is she doing to him?

426
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,665
Let me dry you.

427
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,500
Poor little guy.

428
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,544
Oh, honey, I wouldn't...

429
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,296
Hey!

430
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,465
Beth!

431
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,009
Where'd he go?

432
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,932
Did Jack come in here?

433
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,057
Nope.

434
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,558
Haven't seen him.
Not in here.

435
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,228
Been swimming?

436
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,440
Is the back door closed?

437
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,692
Yeah, it's closed.

438
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:49,942
It better be.

439
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:55,115
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho, ho, ho

440
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,615
Click, click

441
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,785
Down through the chimney
with good St. Nick

442
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,369
Dad.
Huh?

443
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,788
You didn't happen
to see Jack, did you?

444
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,874
Wait, what's that?
You've lost him?

445
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,752
No, no.
We're playing hide-and-seek.

446
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,878
Hmm?

447
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,881
Yeah, it's so much fun.

448
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,090
Hmm...

449
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,467
Ho, ho, ho

450
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,593
Hmm?

451
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,811
Uh-huh!

452
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,480
Mmm-hmm.

453
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:30,983
Jack?

454
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,737
Here, boy.
Come on out now.

455
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,113
Jack?

456
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,913
Jack!

457
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,814
Aren't you handsome
now that you're all clean.

458
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,986
Thanks, Grandma. Night.

459
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,031
Night, sweet pea.

460
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:28,833
Off!

461
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,835
You can't be up here.

462
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,255
Even if you did get my
extra-special spa treatment.

463
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,049
I did do a pretty excellent job.

464
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,843
You are sort of handsome.

465
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:39,927
Okay.

466
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,223
Just a few days,
and I'll have Princess.

467
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,724
I can stand it.

468
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,309
That's what I thought.

469
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,980
The things you do for love.

470
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,817
Just when I thought he was
sort of, kind of cute.

471
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:59,530
Well, he would
start acting like a dog.

472
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,656
Ugh!

473
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,325
Don't kiss me.

474
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,202
And especially not my face.

475
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,040
You can stay up here as long
as you don't try that again.

476
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,923
Why are you doing that?

477
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,178
What's the matter with you?

478
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,852
No. Oh, please, you're not...

479
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,185
Oh, no.

480
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,105
Don't you dare!

481
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,480
No.No! No!

482
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,357
No!

483
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,653
Gross.

484
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:39,778
Gross!

485
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,615
Ew!
When did you eat zucchini?

486
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,324
The next day things were better.

487
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,756
I was feeling pretty confident
about getting Princess.

488
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,217
So, I went shopping.

489
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,887
Uh, I said, "Shopping."

490
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,534
The door...

491
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,457
What is all this pink stuff?

492
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:33,916
Doggie supplies.

493
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,669
But isn't Uncle Reggie
coming back soon?

494
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,795
And Jack's a boy.

495
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,215
These aren't for Jack,
they're for Princess.

496
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,433
You got color-coordinated
poopy bags?

497
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,772
That's priceless.

498
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,234
Pink poopy bags, priceless.

499
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,573
Not nice.

500
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:06,865
Kindness, please.

501
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,252
Come on, Jack.

502
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,566
Nuh-uh-uh!

503
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,692
That's Princess' bed.

504
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,697
You can borrow her collar,
but not her bed.

505
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,999
No, this is for the toy drive.

506
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:29,740
No!

507
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,285
Argh!

508
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,789
Give me that.

509
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,423
Come back here.

510
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:51,887
Argh!

511
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,894
Grandma, why does he hate me?

512
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,647
He doesn't hate you, sweetheart,
just teething, probably.

513
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,400
Teething?
He has enough teeth.

514
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,489
Seem to remember someone else who
gave me a lot of trouble teething.

515
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,531
Oh, Grandma.

516
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,911
Just need to get
him a good bone.

517
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,086
I'm talkin' real bone,
with beef.

518
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,464
The handbook doesn't say
anything about beef bones.

519
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,058
Thank goodness Grandma was
able to work outside the handbook.

520
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,777
If only I could have had
Grandma with me everywhere.

521
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,864
Heel, heel, heel, now sit!

522
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,616
But, unfortunately,
that wasn't possible.

523
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:59,955
It's just befuddling.

524
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,139
Okay, walk on, let's go.

525
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,853
Jack, they're not real.

526
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,324
Jack, no!

527
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:50,088
Ooh, my lil snowman
He's the coolest cat in town

528
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,052
He's jolly and he's happy
Nothing's gonna bring him down

529
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,599
All the people say
that there ain't no way

530
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,684
Hey!

531
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,186
This Christmas
he ain't comin' around

532
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,813
Ooh, my lil snowman
He's the finest boy to me

533
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:08,608
Look at that dog!

534
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,400
Ooh ooh ooh

535
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:11,860
He's got them pretty little eyes

536
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,655
And the biggest belly
you've ever seen

537
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,490
Ooh ooh ooh

538
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,159
He's got his hat to the back
'Cause he's cool like that

539
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,869
Oh, hey!

540
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,036
Ah!

541
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,829
And they don't know
how he makes me feel

542
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,791
Sorry!

543
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,501
Ooh, my lil snowman
Does what no one else can

544
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,045
You can't tell me
he ain't for real

545
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:33,298
Baby, baby, my bah)'

546
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,134
Ooh ooh ooh

547
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:39,764
Baby, baby, my bah)'

548
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,057
Ooh ooh ooh

549
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,976
Ooh, my lil snowman
Does what no one else can

550
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,561
You can't tell me
he ain't for real

551
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,313
Jack, stop! Sorry!

552
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,152
Jack!

553
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,914
Mommy, it's a monster.

554
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,041
Make him stop, Mommy.

555
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,335
Ooh, my lil snowman
He's the coolest cat in town

556
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,967
He's jolly and he's happy
Nothing's gonna bring him down

557
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,527
All the people say
That there ain't no way

558
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,641
This Christmas
he ain't comin' around

559
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,813
Ooh, my lil snowman
He's the finest boy to me

560
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:30,063
Oh, no.

561
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:33,733
Whoa!

562
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,110
Ooh! Yikes!

563
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,655
Whoa!

564
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,239
Right, check it out.

565
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,201
Whoo!

566
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,414
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

567
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,208
Come on, Mariah.

568
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,503
Watch out!

569
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,719
Whose dog is that?

570
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,557
Ooh, my lil snowman
Does what no one else can

571
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,809
You can't tell me
he ain't for real

572
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,315
Hello, Mariah.

573
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,733
Oh!

574
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,152
Hello, Principal Reyes.

575
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,867
That's not your dog, is it?

576
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:25,452
Hey, that's my scarf!

577
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:28,706
Oh! No, of course not.

578
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,626
So irresponsible letting a dog
run loose here.

579
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,336
Dangerous.

580
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,007
Hey, Mariah!

581
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,134
Whoa!

582
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,012
Help!

583
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:51,686
No! Jack didn't
take out the principal.

584
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,190
The one who was recommending me
to lead Model United Nations.

585
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:01,739
Whoa!

586
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,166
Mariah.

587
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,878
I'm so sorry, Principal Reyes.

588
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:19,090
Are you okay?

589
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,885
Jack! Not my face, Jack.

590
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,641
I thought you said
that wasn't your dog.

591
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,018
He's not.

592
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,228
Stop! Jack!

593
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,646
I'm surprised at you, Mariah.

594
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,773
I've never known you to lie.

595
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,157
Is this your new dog?
He's the best.

596
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,077
Where's your skates?

597
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:49,996
He's not my dog,
and he's not the best,

598
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,871
and I don't have time to skate.

599
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,541
Why are you so busy suddenly?

600
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,585
Well, you know,
you snooze, you lose.

601
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,922
I had a wonderful reputation.

602
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,298
Upstanding, thoughtful, witty...

603
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,260
Jack was determined to ruin it.

604
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,597
He has no shame.

605
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,891
Hey, he's putting us to shame.

606
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,981
Okay. You can put up
one display, just one.

607
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,567
Really? Oh!
This is so great, Penny,

608
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,943
'cause wait till you
see what I've got in mind.

609
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,324
Small, understated, tasteful.

610
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,827
Oh, absolutely.

611
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,288
Evening, partner.

612
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,626
Hello, sweetheart. Off the couch, Mr.
Whiskers.

613
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,547
Are you ready to call it quits?

614
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,884
No way.
I've gotten this far.

615
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,552
I'm not giving up now.

616
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,972
Besides, Jack and I
are having the best time.

617
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:51,514
He's the best.

618
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,094
What on Earth?

619
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,804
Jack,

620
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,222
what have we talked about?

621
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:18,893
Argh!

622
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,829
Mariah,
didn't you take Jack out?

623
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,831
We've been out all day.

624
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,710
Well, he's left a little present
for you at the bottom of the stairs.

625
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,545
You better get busy.

626
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,340
What?
How is that even possible?

627
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,929
I never took my eyes off you.

628
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,806
Can't believe this.

629
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,641
Need some help, honey?

630
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:02,061
Nope, I got this.
Not a problem.

631
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,813
Stay.

632
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:08,777
Apparently, my brother wasn't the
only one who had trouble closing doors.

633
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,239
Nice look.

634
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:15,534
Fashion was very important
to me, as you can see.

635
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,960
Yep, what I said
about closing doors.

636
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,809
Jack, Jack, it's me, come back.

637
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,146
Ugh!

638
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:46,773
No way!

639
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,735
Mariah, what's going on?

640
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:52,737
Nothing.

641
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,157
Everything's just
perfectly perfect.

642
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,954
On!

643
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,039
Well, I'll be.

644
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,501
I had to clean up after him.
And now...

645
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,168
on!

646
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,170
I see he really
decked the halls.

647
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,802
I seem to remember someone
who had me cleanin' up a lot.

648
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:17,929
You went through diapers
like nobody's business.

649
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,516
Oh, Grandma, please, do you
have to bring up me as a baby?

650
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,730
Oh, honey, don't ever ask me
not to bring up you as a baby.

651
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,440
Come on, I'll help you out.

652
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,150
Thanks, Grandma, but I got this.

653
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,902
I can do it.

654
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,407
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

655
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,414
Jack, come out,
I look normal now.

656
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,835
Yuck! Don't lick me.

657
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,923
Okay, okay, please,
just don't lick me.

658
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,719
Let's go to bed.

659
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,722
You're silly.

660
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:05,059
Okay, so we had
moments of sweetness,

661
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,440
but little did I know, it was
only the calm before the storm.

662
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:16,655
You got your bone, you've got water, food.
You're good.

663
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,072
You stay in there.

664
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,952
Wow! Nice.

665
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,583
You're sure that dog's secure?

666
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,668
Sure, let's go.
Gonna be late.

667
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,338
Honey, he's too lonely
to be left there.

668
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,175
Oh, gosh.
Okay, I'll bring him.

669
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,596
Oh, I see you're finally
making an effort, Bill.

670
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,557
Nice item you got there.

671
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:48,144
Oh, is that Mr. Marshmallow
or a snowman?

672
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,942
Oh! Hi, Mr. Ingersoll!

673
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,115
Uh-oh!

674
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:06,329
Oh!

675
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,248
Dog has good taste.

676
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,097
Well, we can't wait
all night for Mariah,

677
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:26,307
even if she is the soloist.

678
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,726
The show must go on.

679
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:30,311
Everybody!

680
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:39,737
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

681
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:42,657
Fa la la la la, la la la la

682
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,911

683
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:48,831
Fa la la la la, la la la la

684
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,373
Better hurry, Supergirl.

685
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:55,170
Don we now gay apparel Troll
the ancient Christmas carol

686
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,340
Fa la la la la, la la la la

687
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,427
See the blazing Yule before us

688
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,304
Fa la la la la, la la la la

689
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,599
Strike the harp
and join the chorus

690
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,601
Fa la la la la, la la la la

691
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:13,521
Follow me in merry measure

692
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,231
Shh! Jack! Cut it out!

693
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,402
Fa la la la la, la la la la

694
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,530
Deck the halls with

695
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,074
Pup's got a set of pipes
on him, that's for sure!

696
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,659
And a set of teeth.

697
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:29,246
'Tis the season to be jolly

698
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,039
Fa la la la la, la la la la

699
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:38,213
Don we now our gay apparel Troll
the ancient Christmas carol

700
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:41,507
Fa la la la la, la la la la

701
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:47,722
Follow me in merry treasure While
I tell of Christmas treasure

702
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,851
Fa la la la la, la la la la

703
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:54,146
Fast away the old year passes

704
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,231
Fa la la la la, la la la la

705
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:58,733
I've never heard this version.

706
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:01,695
This rocks!

707
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:08,159
Sing we joyous all together
Heedless of the wind and weather

708
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,286
Make them stop, Mommy.

709
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,009
I wanna go home!

710
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,469
Mariah!

711
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:30,516
The spring musical wasn't
looking so great at that point.

712
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,726
In fact, it looked like I could

713
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,311
say goodbye to choir altogether,

714
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,771
thanks to Jack.

715
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,817
Jack! Cool it!

716
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,445
And Jack wasn't finished
destroying my reputation. Oh, no.

717
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,032
He had much bigger plans for me.

718
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:50,661
Hey, buddy. Mariah, Mom
says you need to get ready

719
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:53,454
for your dress rehearsal
if you wanna be early.

720
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:57,876
I was supposed to do that.

721
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,085
Yesterday.

722
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,295
I would have done it.

723
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,630
It's okay.
I know you hate it.

724
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,132
Hey, where'd Jack go?

725
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,427
Did you close the back door?
Uh...

726
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,179
Jack? You up here?

727
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,722
Jack?

728
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,684
Unbelievable how such a
small creature could be capable of

729
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,811
so much destruction.

730
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,483
Jack! Drop it!

731
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,280
Jack, give that to me.
Nice doggie.

732
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:29,032
Don't move!
Give that to me.

733
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:31,867
Jack!

734
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:42,963
Jack.

735
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:50,012
Come here, you!

736
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,682
Give it to me!

737
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:01,981
Oh, no, no, no!

738
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:05,443
Mariah, are you okay?

739
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:08,447
Jack's not getting
into trouble, is he?

740
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:11,699
No. Everything's great.

741
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,619
You little...

742
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,918
Hey, Mariah.

743
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,463
Yeah?

744
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,719
What's wrong?

745
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,639
Oh, no!

746
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,224
I could help.

747
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:39,353
H ow?

748
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,688
I don't mess up everything.

749
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:48,402
I didn't say you did.

750
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:58,914
I got an idea.

751
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:00,998
Okay. What is it?

752
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,166
Yep, that was the Christmas

753
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,293
I was turned into a trespasser
to save Grandpa,

754
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:08,215
and a thief because of Jack.

755
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,132
We're just borrowing it.

756
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,146
She looks Christmassy.

757
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,990
What do you think?

758
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,326
Works for me.

759
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,661
I guess.

760
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:40,496
Are you kidding? I
could make anything look good.

761
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,375
Even a borrowed Mrs. Santa
suit that had been outside for

762
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,168
maybe 10 Christmases.

763
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,045
What about the dog?

764
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,380
I don't have one yet.

765
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,882
Yes, you do.

766
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
Hmm.

767
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:56,637
Pretty cute.

768
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,349
Better than leaving him here.

769
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:01,851
He'd eat the house.

770
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:06,731
Something tells me
this is not a good idea.

771
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:09,025
And did I listen? No.

772
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,695
We better get going. Don't
forget your toys for the toy drive.

773
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,197
Thanks for helping me, Beth.

774
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,661
At least he didn't ruin this.

775
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,789
Not for you, buster.

776
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:49,023
Don we now our gay apparel Troll
the ancient Christmas carol

777
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,400
<i>Fa la la la la</i>

778
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,402
What is wrong with you?

779
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:01,994
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho!

780
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:10,795
Come on, Jack, we're late. Don't
you know, you snooze, you lose?

781
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,215
Gotta go. Bye, Mom.

782
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,659
We're going to get
started, so please, everyone,

783
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,094
take a seat and settle,
if you wouldn't mind.

784
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:24,226
I, Mr. Tyabji, the Community
Charity League Director,

785
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:27,144
welcome you to
the Fashion and Friends show!

786
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:31,273
Thank you for coming. Proceeds will
benefit our local pet shelter,

787
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:33,818
a cause we all
care deeply about.

788
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:36,195
Let's see how you
and your best friend

789
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,489
can be fashionable this season.

790
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,534
Let's get this show started!

791
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,916
Who says dog
is only man's best friend?

792
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,583
Here's Cindy with
her best pal Orbid

793
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,391
wearing this
attractive matching ensemble.

794
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,255
What happened to you?

795
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,172
I'm so sorry, girls. I...

796
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:57,592
Is that the dog
you brought caroling?

797
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,804
He's just a stand-in,
till I get my real dog.

798
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,806
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

799
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:10,105
Hey, where'd you get a hat?

800
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,442
Looks great.
Good thinking.

801
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:19,072
And look who's
ready for duck hunting season.

802
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:22,367
Mario and Sparky with
a red camouflage number.

803
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,159
Is something wrong with him?

804
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:26,164
Who says fashion
can't be functional?

805
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,039
Uh... Stage fright?

806
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,623
These high quality
sporty outfits and more

807
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,228
are available at
Ingersoll's Hardware.

808
00:53:31,293 --> 00:53:34,713
Oh, yes, this was my
finest Christmas performance,

809
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,047
and Jack made it all possible.

810
00:53:37,132 --> 00:53:38,884
And just when you
thought Christmas was over...

811
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:40,135
Okay, that's us.

812
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,137
Chausette, walk on.

813
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,804
Liebchen, heel.

814
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,307
Oh, boy.

815
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:48,809
Here goes nothin'.

816
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,896
On sale at
Mendel's Yardage and Sundries.

817
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,231
Buy a size up and your
daughters and their pets

818
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,900
will be ready for next
year's holiday season.

819
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,487
What are
the Ingersolls doing here?

820
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:02,907
What's wrong?
They are big sponsors.

821
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,076
They're going to arrest me.

822
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,911
For modeling?
Shh!

823
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,413
Let's go.

824
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,757
Come on, Jack.
Don't fail me now.

825
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,512
Jack performed as well as
I had imagined Princess would.

826
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,934
That's amazing!

827
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,523
I want a dog like that.

828
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,445
So cool!

829
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,322
What an amazing dog!

830
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,628
But that lasted
for about two seconds.

831
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:12,893
Ingrid, there's
something familiar

832
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,271
about that Santa suit,
isn't there?

833
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,650
Sit, Jack.

834
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,329
Oh!

835
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,009
Jack.

836
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,309
Whoa!

837
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,913
Ahhh!

838
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,623
Keep calm, ladies and gentlemen.

839
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,791
Stay in your seats. We'll get
janitorial in right away.

840
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:19,418
That's disgusting!

841
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:21,503
Gross.

842
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,215
I don't know
how I ever lived that down.

843
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,344
I tried to repair some of
the damage Jack caused,

844
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:33,141
but things just kept going
downhill that Christmas.

845
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,230
Oh!

846
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,831
Let's see you find
this one, Ingersoll.

847
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,418
Yes, yes, yes!

848
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,775
I'm sure they don't want me
in the show anymore.

849
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:25,943
Oh, honey, I doubt that.

850
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,989
He hoarked up the sleeve
of my Santa suit!

851
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,409
Hmm... Well...

852
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:38,373
Mr. Ingersoll's lights
stopped blinking again.

853
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:44,211
Mom, gotta get some more ribbon.

854
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,922
You stay.

855
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,719
Don't forget to close the door!

856
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:02,480
I don't think I ever
would have been bold enough

857
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,650
to sneak onto the Ingersolls'
property alone, at night,

858
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:10,237
but after all the trouble Jack had
caused, I guess I had nothing to lose.

859
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,572
Grandpa?

860
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:12,865
Grandpa?

861
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:14,826
Grandpa, are you here?

862
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,829
You gotta be kidding me.

863
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,831
Now, Mariah, it's not
what it looks like.

864
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,041
Looks to me like
he was about to fall

865
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:25,253
into a fish pond
and get electrocuted.

866
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,213
Oh, no! Gosh! Wow!

867
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:29,548
I'm going to the outlet.
I'll unplug you.

868
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:32,594
Oh, forget about that 'cause
Ingersoll, of course, locked it.

869
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,469
Hmm, smart.

870
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:37,181
Okay, don't move.
Don't breathe.

871
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,101
Please don't fall.
Please don't fall.

872
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,438
You are trespassing?

873
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,364
Grandpa?

874
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,791
Oh, wow! If he falls through that
ice with all those lights on...

875
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:06,126
Zap!

876
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:09,338
Yeah. I get it.

877
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,217
I got a plan.

878
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,719
You have a plan?

879
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:17,679
If you can trespass,
I can have a plan.

880
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:20,807
Ooh!

881
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:32,903
Oh, gosh. Oh, gee.

882
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,989
Busted, jail time.
Juvie!

883
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,157
Drama queen.

884
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,534
Community service if.

885
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,869
Let's go!

886
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,746
Nuh-uh! I can't.
Can't move.

887
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,123
Too tall.

888
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:46,833
Too short.

889
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,795
Just right. Come on!

890
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,507
What are we doing?

891
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,132
Lift this guy.

892
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:08,690
Come on, grab a leg.

893
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,442
No! Grandpa's leg.

894
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,527
Oh!

895
01:00:14,112 --> 01:00:15,195
NOW pull!

896
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,134
Ooh!

897
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,385
Oh, dear.

898
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,396
It's just us, little guy.

899
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:53,735
Hey, someone stole my sandwich.
Was it you, Jack, buddy?

900
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,362
Old man?
Where are you?

901
01:00:57,447 --> 01:00:59,072
I'm coming.

902
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,699
That's it.

903
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,744
Ingersoll got me beat.

904
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:07,456
You saved him.

905
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,958
HOW humiliating.

906
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:13,128
My slacker little
brother had to take charge.

907
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,505
See?
I'm not totally worthless.

908
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,257
I know.

909
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,016
Merry Christmas.

910
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,476
Merry Christmas.

911
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:32,231
Okay, so I guess
if it hadn't been for Jack,

912
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,358
I wouldn't have gone
to save Grandpa, either,

913
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:37,027
given I had nothing to lose
after Jack ruined my reputation

914
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,614
with my Community Charity League
director and my choir leader

915
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,784
and my principal and my friends.

916
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:48,081
I almost could
forgive him, but then...

917
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:01,760
Jack! No!

918
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,891
Get back here, you little scamp!

919
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,231
It's Santa Claus!

920
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,983
Ho-ho-ho!

921
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,284
I got you!!

922
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:39,090
Mommy, it's a monster!
I wanna go home!

923
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,440
Come on, Jack. What did I tell
you about licking my face?

924
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,780
Okay, not good.

925
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,617
Not good at all.

926
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:10,288
I happened to know the elves were
the mayor's personal favorite,

927
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:13,081
and I think
the Ingersolls donated them.

928
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:17,545
I wasn't very confident about
getting Princess anymore.

929
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,965
It was the night
before Christmas Eve.

930
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,552
I only had one more day to prove
I could take care of a dog,

931
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:28,889
but I didn't think there was anything
worse Jack could do at this point.

932
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,177
What's going on?

933
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,556
I'm sure it's nothing.

934
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:36,182
What's wrong?

935
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,393
What on Earth?

936
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,353
Oh, dear.
What?

937
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,690
Huh. Priceless.

938
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,501
It's Santa Claus!

939
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,219
It's Jack!

940
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,438
What a mess you've made
of our living room, Jack!

941
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,898
He's made a mess of Christmas.

942
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,858
He's made a mess
of my whole life.

943
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:28,943
You're the worst dog ever!

944
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,780
I can't wait to get rid of you.

945
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,076
Mariah! He's just a pup.

946
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:13,280
Uh, I'm sorry
I yelled at you, Jack.

947
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,699
Grandma's right.
You're just a pup.

948
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:23,833
Won't you come out?

949
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,461
Well, suit yourself.

950
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,717
Now Jack really
had done his worst.

951
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:36,846
Or had he?

952
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:54,864
The fire is burning
The room's all aglow

953
01:07:56,157 --> 01:08:01,954
Outside the December wind blows

954
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:06,458
Away in the distance

955
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:12,297
The carolers sing in the snow

956
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:24,435
<i>Everybody's laughing
The world is celebrating</i>

957
01:08:24,894 --> 01:08:31,484
And everyone's so happy
except for me tonight

958
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:35,404
Because I miss you

959
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,158
Most at Christmas time

960
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:43,244
And I can't get you

961
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,666
Get you off my mind

962
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:53,881
Every other season comes along
and I'm all right

963
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:57,967
But then I miss you

964
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,220
Jack?

965
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:02,890
Most at Christmas time

966
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,057
Jack!

967
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:08,270
Where are you hiding?

968
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:12,149
Brett! The door!

969
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,283
The shelter will call us
if they find him, honey.

970
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:22,618
There's nothing else we can do.

971
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,911
I finished
calling the neighbors.

972
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,996
They couldn't...
They can't stand Jack.

973
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,079
They aren't gonna help.

974
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:29,750
Well, they haven't seen him.

975
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,086
Well, what will
I tell Uncle Reg?

976
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,756
He'll be heartbroken.
He'll never speak to me again.

977
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,632
Mariah,

978
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,926
I have a confession to make.

979
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:44,014
He wasn't really
Uncle Reggie's dog.

980
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,932
What?
What?

981
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,394
He was a stray Reggie found.

982
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,564
He was gonna drop him at the
shelter, but then I got...

983
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,064
One of your ideas?

984
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:55,149
I got a collar.

985
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:58,654
I thought if you had
a taste of a brute like Jack,

986
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,948
you'd change your mind
about having a dog.

987
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:04,368
So you wouldn't have to say no.

988
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,037
Son, I might be
a devil of a prankster,

989
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:10,373
but even I wouldn't stoop
to such a rotten trick.

990
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,792
That's so, so...

991
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,461
Passive aggressive?

992
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:15,796
Yeah.

993
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,840
It was a dirty trick.

994
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,175
No one could have
handled that mutt.

995
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:22,051
I'm so sorry.

996
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:23,720
We still should find him.

997
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:26,640
We will, but there's somewhere
we need to be first.

998
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:29,726
That's right. The adoption center
closes early on Christmas Eve.

999
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,770
You mean...

1000
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,354
Let's go pick up Princess.

1001
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:34,814
Really?

1002
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:36,734
We decided.
Decided.

1003
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,402
Oh, Daddy! Thank you!

1004
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,488
Hopefully Princess won't be
anything like Jack.

1005
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:42,698
I'll say.

1006
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,168
Huh?

1007
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,465
Oh! You made it.

1008
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,884
I wasn't sure you
were coming back.

1009
01:11:09,934 --> 01:11:11,268
Remember, Dougie,

1010
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,688
I told you some folks had come
and put a deposit on this puppy.

1011
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,944
Would you like to pick
out another pet, son?

1012
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:23,238
No, thanks.
Not today.

1013
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,989
Bye, Rascal.

1014
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,545
Oh, my. That's the first time
she's ever made a sound.

1015
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,838
I didn't know she could bark.

1016
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:45,677
Come on, son.

1017
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,680
Yeah, I know.

1018
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:50,724
You snooze, you lose.

1019
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:55,229
No, you don't lose.
Wait!

1020
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,314
I...

1021
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,440
What is it, sweetie?

1022
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:10,577
The puppy is yours.

1023
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:11,996
What?
What?

1024
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,162
What do you mean?

1025
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:15,832
If you still want her,
you can have her.

1026
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,085
For real?

1027
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:20,128
Thank you.

1028
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:23,548
Rascal!

1029
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,302
I'm not sure I understand,
Mariah.

1030
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,514
You said Princess
was your dream dog.

1031
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,015
I was wrong.

1032
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:34,393
My dream dog is Jack.

1033
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,395
Jack? That monster?

1034
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,479
He isn't a monster to me.

1035
01:12:38,564 --> 01:12:40,733
Well, maybe he is a monster,

1036
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:44,028
but I love him.

1037
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,194
You couldn't.

1038
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:47,530
She could.
What do you think?

1039
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,867
Can't just take
a dog in and not keep it.

1040
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,911
Okay, but he ran away.

1041
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:55,872
I know.
And it's my fault.

1042
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:36,371
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1043
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:42,002
There is just one thing I need

1044
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,672
I don't care about the presents

1045
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:50,426
Underneath the Christmas tree

1046
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:54,014
I just want you for my own

1047
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,850
More than you could ever know

1048
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,771
Make my wish come true

1049
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:09,279
All I want for Christmas

1050
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:16,203
Is you

1051
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:30,634
Where are you going?
It is freezing out there.

1052
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:34,680
I've gotta find Jack.

1053
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,890
Here, Mariah.
I made these.

1054
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,310
Thanks, guys.

1055
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:42,770
Let's go hang 'em up.

1056
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:50,069
Mariah, we heard about Jack.

1057
01:14:54,283 --> 01:14:55,993
We came to help you find him.

1058
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:57,493
You... You did?

1059
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:58,662
Of course.

1060
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,984
I thought you were mad at me
for not hanging outwith you.

1061
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:06,377
But Jack messed up
the rehearsal.

1062
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:08,212
But that's what puppies do.

1063
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:12,842
Don't be silly.
You're our friend.

1064
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,011
Yeah.

1065
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:15,216
We wanna help you find him.

1066
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,265
He's got a rather nice howl,
actually, an alto.

1067
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:21,768
But we ruined the caroling.

1068
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,811
We don't care about that.

1069
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:25,689
We care about you.

1070
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,359
And your pet.
He is your pet, isn't he?

1071
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,194
Yes.

1072
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:32,779
He is.

1073
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:34,614
And we're gonna find him.

1074
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:43,122
Here, everybody!
Take some fliers.

1075
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:48,252
I don't want a lot for Christmas

1076
01:15:48,337 --> 01:15:50,881
There is just one thing I need

1077
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:54,467
And I don't care
about the presents

1078
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,719
Jack! Jack!

1079
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,595
Underneath the Christmas tree

1080
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,264
I don't need to hang my stocking

1081
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:00,724
Here, Jack!

1082
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,225
There upon the fireplace

1083
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:04,394
Jack! Jack!

1084
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:07,605
Santa Claus won't make me happy

1085
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:10,484
With a toy on Christmas Day

1086
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:13,569
I just want you for my own

1087
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,739
More than you could ever know

1088
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:19,909
Make my wish come true

1089
01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:24,997
All I want for Christmas is you

1090
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,168
You, baby

1091
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:32,881
I won't ask for
much this Christmas

1092
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:36,176
I won't even wish for snow

1093
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:39,345
I'm just gonna keep on waiting

1094
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:42,431
Underneath the mistletoe

1095
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:45,685
I won't make a list and send it

1096
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:47,729
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

1097
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:49,189
Jack! Jack!

1098
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:51,565
I won't even stay awake

1099
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:55,112
To hear those
magic reindeer click

1100
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,280
'Cause I just
want you here tonight

1101
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,532
Here, buddy!

1102
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,618
Holding on to me so tight

1103
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,453
What more can I do?

1104
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,791
Baby, all I want for Christmas

1105
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,583
Is you

1106
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:13,880
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

1107
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,969
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere

1108
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,054
Jack!

1109
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,140
And the sound of children's
laughter fills the air

1110
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:25,641
Here, boy!

1111
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,601
Jack?

1112
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:30,689
And everyone is singin'

1113
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:33,734
I hear those
sleigh bells ringin'

1114
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:36,485
Santa, won't you bring me
the one I really need?

1115
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,570
Principal Reyes!

1116
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,698
Won't you please
bring my baby to me?

1117
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,909
Oh, I don't want
a lot for Christmas

1118
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,162
Here, Jack!
Where are you?

1119
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:46,954
This is all I'm asking for

1120
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:49,666
I just wanna see my baby

1121
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,877
Standing right outside my door

1122
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:56,131
Oh, I just want you for my own

1123
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,551
More than you could ever know

1124
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:02,179
Make my wish come true

1125
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:06,891
Baby, all I want for Christmas

1126
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:10,770
Is you

1127
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,399
Jack!

1128
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:18,194
All I want for Christmas

1129
01:18:18,278 --> 01:18:20,654
Is you, baby

1130
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,657
Where could he be?

1131
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:26,078
There isn't anywhere
we haven't looked.

1132
01:18:26,161 --> 01:18:28,372
Why don't you ask Santa?

1133
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,878
I don't think he
wants to talk to me.

1134
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:37,713
Oh...

1135
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:40,341
That's right. Bad idea.

1136
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:53,438
What is it?

1137
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:55,148
I think I will ask Santa.

1138
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:04,990
Ho-ho-ho!

1139
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:14,667
Jack!

1140
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,636
I'm so sorry for being so bossy.

1141
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:28,347
And for talking about
Princess all the time.

1142
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:32,394
I love you, and I want
you to be my dog.

1143
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,688
Who's she talking to?

1144
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,189
I don't get it.
Is he in there?

1145
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,984
I promise to be perfect.

1146
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,029
Forget about perfect.

1147
01:19:43,113 --> 01:19:45,907
I'll just do my best
to take good care of you

1148
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,951
if you'll give me a chance.

1149
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,453
Come on, Jack.

1150
01:19:49,536 --> 01:19:50,953
Come to me.

1151
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,788
Come on, boy. Come.

1152
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:05,886
Ho-ho-ho!

1153
01:20:15,604 --> 01:20:16,604
Ugh!

1154
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:22,402
Okay! Go for it!

1155
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,780
Jack! You're so crazy!

1156
01:20:31,703 --> 01:20:32,871
We found Jack!

1157
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,038
All right!

1158
01:20:34,122 --> 01:20:36,082
Merry Christmas!

1159
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,752
Merry Christmas!

1160
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,728
Tacky.

1161
01:20:57,354 --> 01:20:59,230
Grand, isn't it?

1162
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,109
Oh, it's something all right.

1163
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:08,532
Hey, I see you found your pup.

1164
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,324
Glad to see it.

1165
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,536
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

1166
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,914
Hopefully, that'll restore
some Christmas spirit

1167
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,708
that you all are
clearly in need of.

1168
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,381
Oh, that does it.

1169
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:29,636
Bill, you have my permission
to decorate till you drop.

1170
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:31,470
Yes!

1171
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:34,765
I really wanted this!

1172
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:35,934
Oh!

1173
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:41,273
Santa really came
through this time.

1174
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,690
Thank you.

1175
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:49,613
Sit, Jack.

1176
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,117
Would you look at that?

1177
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,868
Told ya, got to be beef.

1178
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:00,082
Turns out, Dad wasn't
allergic to dogs after all.

1179
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,376
Guess that sneezing stopped.

1180
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,670
Yep. It's a Christmas...

1181
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:12,804
Get 'em!

1182
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:22,814
Come here!

1183
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,524
There he goes!

1184
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:28,110
There they are!
Get 'em!

1185
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:29,194
Yeah!

1186
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:31,280
Over there!
Behind that snowman!

1187
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,201
Jack was innocent. It was the
squirrels the whole time.

1188
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:37,162
Get those squirrels!

1189
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:03,771
So, you see, my first
love was a lot of trouble.

1190
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:07,775
But definitely worth it,
and definitely snuggly.

1191
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:13,948
Jack showed me my dog
didn't have to be perfect.

1192
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,117
And I didn't have to be perfect,

1193
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:18,328
because love is.
