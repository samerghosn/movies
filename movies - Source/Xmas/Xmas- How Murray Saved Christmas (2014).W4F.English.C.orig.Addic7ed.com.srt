00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:08,324
North of the North Pole
and south of the stars

3
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:11,718
lies a quaint little village
called Stinky Cigars.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,881
The name is so awful
that folks pass right by it.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,949
It's a trick that we use
to keep our town quiet.

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,753
You'll see that we've got
some celebrities here...

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,100
The groundhog, Columbus,
and Chinese New Year.

8
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:26,858
There's Jack Frost
and Washington,

9
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:27,958
Lincoln and Cupid,

10
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,068
and dear April Fool,
who's as sweet as he's stupid.

11
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,088
Yahtzee.

12
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:33,283
- Oh!
- Man!

13
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:35,984
St. Pat and St. Nicholas fill
our saint quota.

14
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,417
If you're looking

15
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,978
for St. Paul,
check Minnesota.

16
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:40,853
- Ho ho!
- Har har har.

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,472
You have to be
proud and a little bit nuts

18
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:45,661
to honor a banner
with two smelly butts.

19
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:51,064
Please join me
in our town anthem.

44
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,384
We've got to get
a shorter anthem.

45
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:36,364
- It's a nice place to work.
- It's a nice place to grow up.

46
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,865
It's such a nice place,
you just want to throw up.

47
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,021
Everyone's happy,
except Murray Weiner,

48
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,945
owner of Murray's
Holiday Diner.

49
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,598
Murray is grouchy and cranky
and crabby,

50
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,127
nasty and ghastly,
obnoxious and flabby,

51
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,040
ill-tempered, ill-natured,
malevolent and...

52
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,786
- All right!
- They get it.

53
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,099
Yet still everyone
in the holiday bunch

54
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,858
would come into Murray's
to have a great lunch.

55
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:00,169
You might see George Washington
eating and drinking

56
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:02,313
on President's Day
with Abraham Lincoln.

57
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,182
And how, you might wonder,
did Santa get that?

58
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,183
Just thank Murray's

59
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,019
chocolate-chip
cheesecake for that.

60
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,288
Ho ho ho!

61
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,558
You get the bagels.
You got the chili.

62
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:18,396
Thanksgiving Turkey,
stuff yourself silly.

63
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,733
Cupid, you're sweet.
I don't want to be pushy.

64
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,770
But get off my seat with
your bare-naked tushy.

65
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,574
Ooh.

66
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,944
Here's your roast beef,
Leprechaun.

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,182
This is rare.
I want well-done.

68
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:40,218
Much obliged.

69
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:42,620
And back in the corner,
all by himself,

70
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,189
sat an odd little fellow
named Edison Elf.

71
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,224
What are you doing
playing with food?

72
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,627
It's wasteful and dirty
and terribly rude.

73
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,298
I'm just sitting here
quietly making a racket.

74
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,866
I'm Edison Elf.
I'm a bit of a tinkerer.

75
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,037
Kid, as a tinkerer,
you are a stinkerer.

76
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,504
Hey!
I invented horse socks...

77
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,539
To go with horseshoes...

78
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,010
And a loud watch alarm
for people who snooze.

79
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:08,545
I'm up! I'm up!

80
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,081
And here is a toy that I know
kids will love.

81
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,951
It's a Jack-in-the-box
with a spring boxing glove.

82
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,324
I call it
a Jack-in-the-boxer.

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,961
Box, boxer, glove.
It's a pun.

84
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,829
This would at least get
an honorable mention

85
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,067
if there were a contest
for world's worst invention.

86
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:29,733
What?

87
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,235
- It's stupid.
- It's clever.

88
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,704
- It's nasty.
- It's nice.

89
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,406
Go show it to Santa
and get his advice.

90
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,242
I will. I will!

91
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,045

122
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:00,451
At Santa's Workshop
on Christmas Eve day,

123
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,687
zillions of toys were
stuffed into the sleigh.

124
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:06,490
There were Jacks and wax lips
and all kinds of loose stuff...

125
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,858
Crumpunglers, tumpuzzlers.

126
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,494
You know, Dr. Seuss stuff.

127
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,596
There were dolls that said "mama"
and dolls that said "goo,"

128
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,999
dolls that made music...
And dolls that made pooh.

129
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,735
There were dolls that grew
tall at a push of a button

130
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,805
and a doll, best of all,
that didn't do nothing.

131
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,639
Santa was ready,
about to take off,

132
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,444
when from behind him,
he heard a small cough.

133
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,146
Santa... Ahem.

134
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,279
Could I have your attention?

135
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,382
I'd just like to show
you my latest invention.

136
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,584
Yes?

137
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,420
My Jack-in-the-boxer
belongs on your list.

138
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,255
It's a Jack-in-the-box
with a fabulous twist.

139
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:47,098
Aaaarggh!

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,935
You're, uh, supposed to point it
away from your face.

141
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,971
Ho ho! Don't worry, son.

142
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,274
I'm perfectly schnibble
and ready to glibble.

143
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,446
- You're starting to dribble.
- Really?

144
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,415
All of the toys
fell out of the sled.

145
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,851
And they bounced one by one
off of poor Santa's head.

146
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,088
Mama!

147
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,190
Gah!

148
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,961
Oh, nutmeg.

149
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,733
Anyone else hear that?

150
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,514
_

151
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,572
Hmm, it needs work.

152
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:41,195
Globble, glibble, ish,
kibibble. Hee hee!

153
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,530
Mmm!

154
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,432
Appetite... Good.

155
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,369
When someone is having
a less than a jolly day,

156
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,703
they call on this man.

157
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,404
His name is Doc Holiday.

158
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,706
Diaper rash.

159
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,408
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Seasickness.

160
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:57,345
I'm under such pressure
to see my shadow

161
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,913
and get winter over already.

162
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:02,416
What if I don't see it?
I mean, should I lie?

163
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:03,985
Diaper rash.

164
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,120
- Aah! No...
- Claus-trophobia.

165
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:09,389
One year I was certain
I saw my shadow,

166
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,826
but it turned out to be
an oil stain on the pavement.

167
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:16,463
I cannot tell a lie.
Ha ha. You're fat.

168
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,033
I'm a rodent,
not a meteorologist.

169
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:23,236
Uh, diaper rash.

172
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:29,543
I'd rather hear the good news.

173
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:31,011
Oh, I didn't say
there's good news.

174

I mean, that's not the worst
thing in the world.

203
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,082
Actually, it is.

204
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:20,187
I've done the worst thing
in the world.

205
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,289
People will forgive me in time.

206
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:25,493
They'll be able to look back
at this and laugh...

207
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:29,663
Ha ha...
In say 6 billion, 8 billion years.

208
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:33,267
So let's review.
I hurt Santa, broke his toys,

209
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:36,903
ruined Christmas,
and now I'm stuck in a trench.

210
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:39,240
Help! Help!

211
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,076
Hmm...

212
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:56,389
Oof!

213
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,826
Where are you going?
What's all the rumpus?

214
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,962
So long, Easter Bunny.
Good-bye, Columbus.

215
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,811
There in the snow
stood the holiday stars,

216
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:18,546
every last person
in Stinky Cigars.

217
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,148
There were even a few
who weren't so famous,

218
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,750
like Arbor Day Aardvark
and Labor Day Amos.

219
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,821
You all saved my life.
Thanks goodness you came!

220
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:30,624
But something bad happened,
and I am to blame.

221
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:33,860
For those who don't know me,
I'm Edison Elf.

222
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,764
And I'm afraid Santa is
not quite himself.

223
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,967
- Hello!
- I'm Queen Hanna of Bananaland.

224
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:45,472
Bananas for you and you
and especially you.

225
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:48,908
Yes, your majesty.
Let's get back to the castle.

226
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:52,312
- Gently, sir.
- Bananas bruise easily.

227
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:56,116
I'm afraid it's my fault
that he's under the weather.

228
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:59,787
And there won't be a Christmas
unless we pull together.

229
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,355
It's gonna be tough,
and it's gonna be tricky.

230
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:06,059

and the pretty good boys.

285
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:49,690

286
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,027
The voyage should take me
3 months at the least.

287
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,363

288

Have it your way.
I'll go west to go west.

289
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,368
He asked Easter Bunny
to gift-wrap a truck.

290
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:03,770
His paws were too small.
He was having no luck.

291
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:06,573
So he painted and dyed it
in purples and pinks.

292
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,107
On an egg, this looks good.

293
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:10,376
On a truck? Well, it stinks.

294
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:13,113

00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,889
Then it goes on
for 5 pages more.

298
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,024
How many gift cards
would you say you've done?

299
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,793
When this card is finished,
I'll be up to one.

300
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:30,096
- Hey!
- Aah!

301
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:31,865
Lincoln and
Washington had a big fight.

302
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,902
Honest Abe,
can't you do anything right?

303
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:37,171
- I'm on the penny.
- I'm on the quarter.

304
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,539
- I'm also much older.
- You're almost much shorter.

305
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:42,543
Stop it, you guys!
You're behaving like Scrooges.

306
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:45,745
Then they all started fighting
just like the Three Stooges.

307
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,047
Here. Hold this.

308
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:49,048
- Woo!
- Woo! Woo! Woo!

309
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,183
Yah, yah, yah!

310
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,585
- Ha ha!
- Uh!

311
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,455
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all was in crisis.

312
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,956
The groundhog had eaten
the "naughty and nice" list.

313
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,326
The April Fool built
a preposterous bike,

314
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,129
and Labor Day Amos
had gone out on strike.

315
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,431
Silent night, holy night!

316
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,834
We will not give up the fight...

317
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,268
<i>Liberte!</i>

318
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,871
Stop all your shouting.
Stop all the noise.

319
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,240
There's no one I trust
to deliver these toys.

320
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:18,077
Delivery. Lincoln,
here's your hot pastrami.

321
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:19,846
Washington gets cold salami.

322
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:21,382
Columbus asked for rigatoni.

323
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,782
St. Pat ordered
fried bologna.

324
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:26,053
Piece of fish, sirloin steak,
meat knish, carrot cake.

325
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,654
And April Fool...
I don't know why...

326
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,890
Ordered compact discs on rye.

327
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:30,958
Yum!

328
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,597
- What?
- You're the one!

329
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,066
I'm the what one?

330
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,800
You are the one
to deliver the toys

331
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:43,770
to 200 countries,
to good girls and boys.

332
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,006
Just put on this red suit
and get in the sleigh.

333
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,342
What are you, cuckoo?
Forget it. No way.

334
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,410
Please.

335
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,477
- No.
- Please?

336
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:51,478
- No!
- Please?

337
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:52,246
- No...
- Please...

338
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,914
And so for an hour,
these two kept on going,

339
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,184
with one of them please-ing
and one of them no-ing.

340
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,318
- Please?
- No.

341
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,487
Please?

342
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:03,190
No! Why in the world should
I schlep through the snow,

343
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,925
bringing millions of presents
to kids I don't know?

344
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,028
Will anyone pay me?
Will anyone tip?

345
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,762
What if I slip
and fracture my hip?

346
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,332
Look at the weather.
It's cold and it's shivery.

347
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,435
There's no way on earth
I will make this delivery.

348
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:18,971
Bummer.

349
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:23,210
Murray spent each
Christmas Eve on his own,

350
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:26,980
remembering days when he
wasn't alone.

351
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,915
_

352
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,113
_

353
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,390
You dated her?

354
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:38,424
Get out of my deli.
Get off of my land.

355
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:41,662
What part of "no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no"

356
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:42,762
don't you understand?

357
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,765
I'll tell you the reason
you shouldn't say no.

358
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,601
I just need one minute,
and then I will go.

359
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,936
- One minute?
- 60 seconds.

360
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:51,939
So what's the reason?

361
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:55,643
Because it's Christmas.
Lights, please.

362
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,646
Christmas, you know,
is that one special season

363
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:02,549
when people do good things
without a good reason.

364
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,919
The grouchiest men
will wear musical ties

365
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:08,355
and buy Christmas presents
for folks they despise.

366
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:12,026
The cheapest of cheapskates
will spend all his money,

367
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,627
and people make fruitcakes
from concrete...

368
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:15,563
And honey.

369
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:18,065
Tonight think of others
instead of yourself.

370
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:23,170
Your minute is up,
Mr. Edison Elf.

371
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,207
_

372
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,279
Libby, mistletoe!

373
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,317
- Ooh!
- Murray!

374
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:38,051
Ha ha. It's ok.

375
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:40,854
Merry Christmas, Murray.

376
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,660
- I'll do it.
- Oh, Murray!

377
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:49,697
No hugs, no hugs,
no hugs, no hugs.

378
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,832
Murray put on the suit.

379
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:55,134
The belly was baggy.
The shoulders were saggy.

380
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:56,403
The bottom was draggy.

381
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,939
I'm pretty fat,
but I think Santa's fatter.

382
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,441
The caboose is quite loose,

383
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,576
but I guess it won't matter.

384
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:07,847
<i>Bravissimo</i>, Murray!

385
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,083
I wish you good luck.

386
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,784
I love what you're doing.

387
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,486
My zipper is stuck.

388
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,887
They hopped in the sleigh
and sped off like a comet.

389
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,257
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to vomit.

390
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,626
I've got one rule,
but, surely, it's basic.

391
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:22,695
If you go too fast,
I'm gonna get sleigh-sick.

392
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:23,797
Why don't you drive?

393
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,201
On, Dumbo and Jumbo.
On, Mason and Dixon.

394
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:30,136
On, Cosmo and Kramer
and Richard M. Nixon.

395
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:32,772
That wasn't even close.

396
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,580
They made their first stop,
Eddie fearing the worst.

397
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,983
Murray fell down the chimney
and landed head-first.

398
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,519
Ow! Oof.

399
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:50,190
Not terrible. A little dry.

400
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:52,593
Eggnog, huh?
I never had it.

401
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:56,296
Blecch! So that's why
they only drink it once a year.

402
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:59,500
He didn't come back
till a quarter to 2:00.

403
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,868
Murray! I worried.
What happened to you?

404
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:04,304
Down by the fireplace,
kids hung up socks.

405
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:07,473
So I loaded the socks up
with bagels and lox.

406
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,307
Presents.

407
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,176
You're supposed
to bring presents.

408
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,679
Kids don't love lox?

409
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:13,212
They went to the next house.

410
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,448
It didn't go better.

411
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,717
Murray got bit by
a big Irish setter.

412
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:23,691
Aah!

413
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:26,259
He stepped on
a turtle at house number 3.

414
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:31,230
In house number 4,
he knocked over the tree.

415
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,734
What was that noise?

416
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,436
- Mice.
- Oh.

417
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:37,604
Wait. Who said that?

418
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,138
Cat.

419
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:43,309
Oh. Betty Fred,
get my gun.

420
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:48,715
I've been bit by a dog
and shot by a gun.

421
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,384
I must tell you, shorty,
I'm not having fun.

422
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,253
I'm old and I'm cold,
and this suit doesn't fit.

423
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,990
If the next stop goes badly,
I'll just have to quit.

424
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,093
Edison Elf couldn't blame him.

425
00:21:59,127 --> 00:21:59,792
He tried.

426
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:01,260
I have faith in you, Murray.

427
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:04,163
The little elf lied.

428
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:10,604
Murray jumped down the chimney
and landed so hard...

429
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:13,579
The thud knocked the snow
off the trees in the yard.

430
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:15,337
- He got to his feet with a...
- Oof.

431
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,404
- And an...
- Oy.

432
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:19,413
And he found himself facing
a 6-year-old boy.

433
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:22,281
Santa Claus!
Santa Claus! Santa Claus!

434
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:24,718
Where? Oh, right.
You mean me.

435
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes, I'm Santa, I swear.

436
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:27,887
Do your Santa Claus laugh.

437
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,323
Please, please, please, please?

438
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:32,659
Huh? Sure. Heh heh.
Tee hee.

439
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:34,961
Hoo. Ha. Oh, boy.

440
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:37,530
Murray snorted and snickered
and chortled and chuckled.

441
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,134
And as he chuckled,
his belt came unbuckled.

442
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:42,736
His pants, which were loose,
fell down straight to his knees.

443
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:46,038
"Murray Weiner" was stitched
on his silk BVDs.

444
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,374
Well, I'm going to jail.

445
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,576
Santa Claus, please.
Would you kindly explain

446
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:54,213
why you and your underpants
have different names?

447
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,382
Betrayed by his boxers,

448
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,152
let down by his pants,
he knew a good story

449
00:22:58,186 --> 00:22:59,586
would be his best chance.

450
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,989
Don't you know Murray Weiner is
a famous designer?

451
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:04,791
Calvin Klein may be fine,
but Weiner is finer.

452
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:06,359
Are you sure you're Santa?

453
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:07,994
You don't have a beard.

454
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:10,463
Your suit is all baggy.
You smell kind of weird.

455
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:13,467
I shaved off the beard.
Mrs. Claus said it tickles.

456
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:16,068
And I went on a diet...
Club soda and pickles.

457
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,739
That should explain why
I'm beardless and bellyless.

458
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,441
The pickles would also
account for my smelliness.

459
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:24,443
So there, I've explained.
I've made everything clear.

460
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,113
Now, I should be going.

461
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:27,614
Wait. Name your reindeer.

462
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,483
- Murray hemmed and he hawed.
- He did not know this stuff.

463
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,353
So he huffed and he puffed
and proceeded to bluff.

464
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:36,088
There's Bambi and Rambo
and Dopey and Doc,

465
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,157
Scotty and Sulu,
Uhura and Spock.

466
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:39,826
Murray looked at him hopefully.

467
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:40,794
How did I do?

468
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:45,097
You're a big phony fake!
I guess Santa is, too.

469
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,102
Santa's not phony.
I've got the proof.

470
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,471
Come out on the lawn,
look up on the roof.

471
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:57,510
That's Santa's sleigh
sitting there in the snow.

472
00:23:57,546 --> 00:24:00,180
There are the reindeer
whose names I don't know.

473
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,782
Oh, Santa is real, kid.
It's wrestling that's fake.

474
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,251
And that's when the boy knew
he'd made a mistake.

475
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:07,054
This wasn't just some smelly
guy in a suit

476
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:10,390
but an honest to goodness
Saint Nick substitute.

477
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:13,160
And then the boy smiled.
Murray felt a strange tingle.

478
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:18,298
He knew for one night that
he could be Kris Kringle.

479
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,200
Ho ho ho!

480
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:23,135
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

481
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,304
Aah! Oh!

482
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,473
Murray brought the boy in,
and he patted his head.

483
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,010
And he fixed him a lean
pastrami sandwich with coleslaw

484
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,712
and a triple-thick
chocolate milkshake.

485
00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:35,147
And he sent him to bed.

486
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:39,419
So tell me, Murray,
do you feel like quitting?

487
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:42,288
Quitting, quitting?
You got to be kidding.

488
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:43,824
I love Christmas lights...

489
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,359
the purple and orange,
the yellow and...

490
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,295
Something that rhymes
with orange.

491
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,631
Enough of this talk.
We've got toys to deliver.

492
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:54,166
We can't sit around
like 2 lumps of chopped liver.

493
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,272
Glibble, globble,
Julian Schnabel.

494
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,847
My suit. My sleigh.
My toys.

495
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,016
My word!

496
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,519
Hello? Sarah,
get me the police!

497
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:17,758
Officer Bender,
the bender of laws.

498
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:21,428
- To whom am I speaking?
<i>- My name's Santa Claus.</i>

499
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:23,329
Weirdo.

500
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,733
You say you're Santa.
I say I doubt it.

501
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:30,304
If you're really Santa,
then tell me about it.

502
00:25:30,338 --> 00:25:33,006
When you were 2,
I brought you a crib.

503
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,574
When you were 3,
you got a nice bib.

504
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,609
At 4, I gave you
a big Teddy bear.

505
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:40,646
You were naughty at 5,
so you got underwear.

506
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:43,450
All right. All right.
What's been stolen?

507
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:45,885
Eight flying reindeer,
sleigh in the back,

508
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,955
6 billion toys,
and a 50-foot sack.

509
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,891
Any distinguishing
characteristics?

510
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,792
Oy. I'm dealing
with an idiot.

511
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:54,694
I give you my word
as the public's defender,

512
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,431
I'll track down this rat
and return him to sender.

513
00:25:57,465 --> 00:26:00,133
I'll find this little coward
and put him in jail.

514
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,303
I'm Officer Bender,
and I never fail.

515
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:04,904
Huh. Where did I put
my keys?

516
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:11,301
From Nome down to Rome,
from Minsk to Atlanta,

517
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:15,425
Murray brought presents
as quickly as Santa.

518
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:37,606
_

519
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,755
Bah!

520
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,128
Oh, boy.

521
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:05,809
I'm raring to go.
It's a quarter past 3:00.

522
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:07,010
Where are you, shorty?

523
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,814
You're sitting on me!

524
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,621
Santa, of course,
didn't know about Murray.

525
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:19,589
He thought Christmas was stolen,
so he had to hurry.

526
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,491
It's a quarter past 3:00.
I still got a chance.

527
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,528
I just need a sleigh and
some toys and some pants.

528
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:27,765
He put on red
long johns in place of the suit.

529
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,567
Instead of a cap,
he wore a red boot.

530
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:31,769
Perfect!

531
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:35,105
- Sleigh, sleigh?
- Do I have a spare sleigh?

532
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:38,576
Maybe there's one buried
under this hay.

533
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:41,045
Ooh. All that I see is
a shovel and rake

534
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,047
and this old garden hose.

535
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,882
No, wait. That's a snake.

536
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:47,518
Snake! Ah! Ah!

537
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:51,955
This could work.

538
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,193
I just need to find a giant
toy store

539
00:27:56,229 --> 00:28:01,833
that's open on Christmas
at a quarter to 4:00.

540
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:07,305
Then Santa Claus
saw a miraculous sight.

541
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:12,309
In the sky far above was
a star shining bright.

542
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:20,684
Give me everything
you got in the store!

543
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,818
Don't shoot me.

544
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,391
What are you?

545
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:28,692
I'm vishin' you...

546
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:29,794
You're Vishnu?

547
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:31,628
I'm vishin' you
wouldn't shoot me.

548
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:34,798
I'm not going to shoot you.
Put down your arms...

549
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:37,101
All of them.

550
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:39,537
Two more.

551
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,172
So how can I help you?

552
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:42,640
- Wrapping paper?
- Aisle one.

553
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:44,142
- Children's books?
- We have none.

554
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:46,076
- Any toys?
- Just some knickknacks.

555
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:48,813
- Christmas candy?
- Only tic tacs.

556
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:52,150
Ho ho ho.

557
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,820
Comic books, candy bar,
bobbing head dolls for your car,

558
00:28:56,855 --> 00:29:01,259
playing cards, ballpoint pen, paper clips.
Yeah! Kids love them.

They didn't need
milkmen like me anymore.

Milk's just as good
when it comes from a carton.

609
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,554
So my whole holiday
was completely forgotten.

610
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:44,654
Forgotten.

611
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:49,426
The parades got much smaller.
And one day, they stopped.

612
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:53,663
The floats were dismantled.
The balloons were all popped.

613
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,733
My whole happy life
had become a bad dream.

614
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:01,204
And I became sour
as 3-month old cream.

615
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:04,240
I gave up my job.

616
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,044
And I gave up my friends.

617
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,549
And I told my true love
not to see me again.

618
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:18,321
Why did you do that?

619
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:19,356
Because I was nothing.

620
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:21,424
I was nothing,
and she was a national treasure.

621
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,160
I put that woman on a pedestal.

622
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:25,028
I mean,
she was already on a pedestal,

623
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:29,165
but I put her on a figurative pedestal
on top of the literal pedestal.

624
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:31,434
Ah! You know
what I mean.

625
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,471
You're not nothing, Murray.
You proved that you're not.

626
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:37,674
Well, thank you for giving this grump
one last shot.

627
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,912
- Murray smiled. Eddie smiled.
- And the reindeer all smiled.

628
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:45,482
Tonight you brought presents
to every good child.

629
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:48,184
- What about the bad kids?
- Who?

630
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:50,520
Why should we stop?
We have time. We have toys.

631
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:53,523
Why can't we bring them
to bad girls and boys?

632
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:54,625
No.

633
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,960
- Please.
- No.

634
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:57,094
- Please?
- No!

635
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,030
So a kid might be lazy.
He might be a slob.

636
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:02,799
He drives his folks crazy.
That's kind of his job.

637
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:05,736
Ed heard what he said,
and he couldn't resist.

638
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:09,140
They brought toys to the naughty,
a very long list.

639
00:33:09,174 --> 00:33:11,776
Some ice skates for Kate,
who poured glue on mom's chair,

640
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,011
put tacks in dad's slacks,
and then belched the lord's prayer.

641
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:18,214
A toboggan for Ogden,
who played sick from school

642
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,251
and drove his dad's Pontiac
into the pool.

643
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:23,520
A Dolly for Molly,
who just for a joke

644
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:26,690
popped a bag behind grandpa
and gave him a stroke.

645
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:30,661
Murray brought presents
to all bad and good kids...

646
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:33,663
The weird and the feared
and the misunderstood kids

647
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:36,333
and not just to Christians,
he brought gifts to Hindus,

648
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:39,970
to Buddhists and Muslims,
to fat and to thin Jews.

649
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:42,373
And people said Christmas
was never so pleasant

650
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:47,377
as that one special year
when the world got a present.

651
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:55,586
I'm afraid there's
no presents for us in the sack.

652
00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:59,155
I could give you a hug,
and you could give me one back.

653
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:00,557
Oh, man!

654
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,693
Freeze!

655
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:06,430
Dudes can't hug in this town?

656
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:11,101
You're under arrest
for stealing Christmas.

657
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,398
Officer Bender,
Stinky P.D.

658
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:19,833
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have my I.D.

659
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:21,695
- Driver's license?
- I forgot it.

660
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:23,422
- Pilot's license?
- Never got it.

661
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,639
- Poetic license?
- I, uh... What?

662
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:28,501
If you don't have a poetic license,
stop rhyming.

663
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,777
All the poetry in this town
drives me crazy.

664
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:32,347
It takes me 4 hours
to do paperwork

665
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:35,516
because I can't find a rhyme
for aggravated assault.

666
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:36,650
Ugh. So...

667
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:39,454
You have no I.D.
on you at all.

668
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,489
Wait. I do have this.

669
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:43,257
See? See?

670
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:45,659
Dropping trou in front
of a police officer, son.

671
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:48,563
You just got yourself
in a lot more trouble.

672
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,864
Stolen sleigh.
Driving without a license.

673
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,001
- No car seat for your baby.
- I'm not a baby!

674
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:55,536
And what happened to the toys?

675
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:58,907
There were supposed to be
billions of toys in here.

676
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:00,708
We gave them to good
girls and boys.

677
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:03,344
And a few really rotten ones.

678
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,746
Wait. Now, hold it.
What's this?

679
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:08,016
Trying to hide one from me?

680
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,286
- I really wouldn't do that.
- Don't tell me how to do my job.

681
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:14,789
- I beg you to stop!
- I beg you to shut up.

682
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:17,257
Yeah. Let the man
do his job.
