00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,252
Have you ever wondered
how it all gets done?

3
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:22,617
How Santa gets in and out
of millions of homes

4
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:24,795
all in one night?

5
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,086
Let's just say,
he has a little help.

6
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,184
The operation
has its challenges...

7
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:42,235
But we're always prepared.

8
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,896
Our mission statement is...

9
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:56,120
Get in. Get out.
Never be noticed.

10
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,954
I'm part of
Prep & Landing.

11
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,436
An elite unit of elves
getting houses around the world,

12
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:09,291
ready for the Big Guy's arrival.

13
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,580
My name is Wayne.
Callsign:  Little Drummer Boy.

14
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:25,604
And I've been doing this
a long time.

15
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:30,656
A really long time.

16
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:36,012
Now I'm ready to move up
and leave this job behind.

17
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:37,913
Oh, yeah...

18
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:41,200
Next year's gonna be different.

19
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:57,466
Hey-hey-hey...  Excuse-me.
This spot is reserved for...

20
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,840
Wayne?

21
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,682
No ticket this time,
Waterkotte.

22
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:03,222
You received the promotion?
I was not informed of that!

23
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:05,170
I'm just heading over to
Magee's office right now.

24
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,470
You know, make it official,
blah, blah, blah.

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,495
You just make sure you get
a parking sticker on there pronto, mister!

26
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,774
Hey, hey, hey, hey!   Scratch it,
and I'll put you on the naughty list.

27
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,662
Just kidding...

28
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,863
But I could.

29
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,727
All Prep and Landing teams
report in.

30
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:22,144
# Oh, jingle bells
Wayne is swell #

31
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,330
# He's a director #

32
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:30,017
# Don't be late, for our date
Under the mistletoe! #

33
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,976
- Hey, Wayne, we're gonna miss you!
- And I'll miss you, Gabe.

34
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,227
It's Bryan!

35
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:37,988
Naughty List Houses
coming online now.

36
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:40,050
All coal elves,
check-in.

37
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,983
Oh, here he comes,
here he comes.

38
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:44,397
- Hey, new boss.
- Hey, boss!

39
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,611
My wife, she made you a fruitcake.

40
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,557
Wife? Thank you!
Whoa... Heavy!

41
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,848
Oh, it feels more like
a pound cake, huh?

42
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,449
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
Okay.

43
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,274
What was your name again?

44
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,934
Gristletoe Joe, sir.
But my friends call me Nancy.

45
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,518
I'm gonna remember you
when I'm in charge, Nance.

46
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:08,775
You tell that lovely wife of yours that
I am gonna savor every last bite, yeah.

47
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,727
(whispering) - From me to you.
- Hold on. Hello?

48
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:14,768
I'll see you at the christmas
party tomorrow.  Okay. bye!

49
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,335
- Hi, Magee.
- Hello?  Oh, yeah?

50
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,457
Well, this year I'm santa's secret santa.
Okay, what am I supposed to do
about that, Jerry? ugh!

51
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:23,417
Hi, Wayne.

52
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:27,243
- Aw, did you lose a bet, sweetie?
- It's my celebration tie.

53
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:30,200
Wayne, you didn't get
the promotion.

54
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,837
- What?
- Peterson got it.

55
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,293
- My partner?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:38,433
So, no parking sticker?

57
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,471
You're disappointed.

58
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:46,972
Oh no. No!
I'm glad for Peterson.

59
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:49,828
What are you crazy?
'Cause he was trained by me.

60
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:53,026
I mean seriously are you crazy?
I'm so glad...

61
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:57,414
that the Big Guy notice him
and not me.  So there you go.

62
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,723
Well, good!  Because now
you have a new partner to train.

63
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,607
Uh, Tiny? Tiny?
Ah, Tiny.

64
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,149
Send him in.

65
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,443
Ooh... I think you'll really like him.

66
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:10,044
Top of his class
at Kringle Academy.

67
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:15,296
- A little help here?
- It was a small class.

68
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,960
Please?

69
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:24,471
- I'm Lanny, callsign Treeskirt.
- Lanny?

70
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,623
I'm so excited
to be working with you!

71
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,577
I had a poster of you
on my wall growing up.

72
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:31,591
Talk about a Christmas gift, huh?

73
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:35,765
Okay!... Trasher is the last transport,
so let's get a move on.

74
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,715
Thrasher?
Thrasher the reindeer?

75
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,940
Oh, there he is!
Great garland!

76
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,187
I heard Dasher had a cousin,
but I always thought you were a myth!

77
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,279
- I am a myth.
- What?

78
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,339
Tell anyone I exist,
and you won't exist.

79
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:57,084
Wayne, what's Thrasher's
top speed?

80
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,381
Mach 2, mach 3?
I bet it's more like mach a-billion!

81
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,159
This is so tinsel!

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,989
Does the phrase "silent night"
mean anything to you?

83
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:11,109
3, 2, 1...

84
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,808
Wow! That house is
a winter wonderland.

85
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,295
We have an L-shaped
living chamber.

86
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,770
Two visible exits
to the left.

87
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:52,104
And to the east.

88
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,692
No hidden cameras.

89
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:00,937
Hey, you know, it seems like you've got
this real holiday zest going.

90
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,071
You know what?
What do you say you fly solo?

91
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,119
Solo?
Solo.

92
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:10,899
- But it's m-m... my first mission.
- You are highly trained, aren't you?

93
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:13,363
I'll report in
at regular intervals.

94
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,772
I'm going upstairs.

95
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:19,519
Right.  And I'll handle
cookie assessment.

96
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,146
Treeskirt to
Little Drummer Boy.

97
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:32,178
No creatures stirring.
Over.

98
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,579
Hmm? Oh. Mm-Hmm.
Uh-huh.  All right.  Oh.

99
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,861
Stockings are hung with care.

100
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:49,618
- Am I doing okay?
- Oh, doing fantastic.

101
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,860
That's right.
I'm being naughty.

102
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:57,296
Tell your buddy Peterson
to put me on his list.

103
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,133
Oh, a bike!

104
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,428
Oh, he's gonna be so happy!

105
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:17,342
- Ahh. Merry Christmas!
- A Christmas Special!  That's nice.

106
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,230
Do you want to watch
a Christmas Special? You do?

107
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:25,044
Oops.  Oh, another one.
Do you like that? I don't.

108
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,556
That one? too bad.

109
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,110
Oh, here we go.

110
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,577
Uh, Little Drummer Boy...

111
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,467
Mm, I could really use
some advice here.

112
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,900
Go with your gut, kid.

113
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:56,796
Merry Christmas, Big Guy.

114
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:00,854
Stale.

115
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,660
It's jingle time.

116
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,677
Open hangar doors.

117
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:29,054
- Doors open.
- Cue rosebud.

118
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,798
Instruments are holly jolly.

119
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,453
Rev up the engines.

120
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,364
Reindeer ready to roll.

121
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,659
We are go for Partridge.

122
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:57,374
He's on his way.
I've made the list, sir.

123
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,010
- You checked it twice?
- Per redundancy protocol.

124
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,695
Prep & landing teams
are under way.

125
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,013
- Everything seems to be in proper order.
- Excellent.

126
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:05,630
Thank you, miss Holly.

127
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:08,247
The Partridge is in the pear tree.
We are go for launch.

128
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:09,894
- Vehicle?
- Dash away.

129
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:11,386
- Engines?
- Dash away.

130
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,287
- Partridge?
- Dash away.

131
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,003
Dash away all!

132
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:20,770
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven...

133
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:26,625
Six, Five, Four,
Three, Two, One.

134
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,929
Ho, Ho...
Go!

135
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:43,260
Okay, people, this is it!

136
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:47,622
364 Days of preparation,
one night of perfect execution.

137
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:51,449
Nothing will go wrong.
Nothing will go wrong.

138
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,501
Sir?  There's a storm alert
over sector 7.

139
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,436
Oh, frostbite.

140
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,596
Hi, I'm Timmy.
What's your name?

141
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:01,873
I-I... huh...

142
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,637
It's Wayne.

143
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:06,667
You're a lot smaller than
Santa's helpers at the mall.

144
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,549
Are you a baby elf?

145
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,960
No, I'm not a baby.
I have a pension.

146
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,816
- Aah!
- You're squeezy.

147
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,273
Little Drummer Boy,
creature stirring!

148
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,617
ANOTHER ONE!

149
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:24,044
Security breach.
Subject has been sparkled.

150
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:27,169
Hey, is this one of the Big Guy's cookies?

151
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:28,613
Not anymore.

152
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,827
We are definitely
behind schedule now.

153
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:32,398
Then we'd better get going.

154
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,386
But... but doesn't section code 808 state
"All children shall be snug in their beds"?

155
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:43,586
So you were having
a jolly holiday downstairs.

156
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,291
Oh, yeah.
Fa la la la la.

157
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,918
What's wrong?
I mean, don't you even care?

158
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:53,076
I've been working prep & landing
for 227 years,

159
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,828
and believe me, the thrill is gone.

160
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:59,609
But this is the most tinsel job ever...
You bringing joy to children?

161
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:01,529
- Sorry!
- Look, Treeskirt,

162
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:04,980
We are just tiny ornaments
on some gigantic tree,

163
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,208
slaving away...
All for what?

164
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:10,906
"For what"? For him.

165
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:16,252
Just look at this face, Wayne.    Imagine
the joy on this face tomorrow morning.

166
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:21,805
Imagine all the great memories
he'll pass on to his children.
And his children's children.

167
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:24,733
The thrill may be gone for you, Wayne.

168
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,032
But it's not gone for him.

169
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:31,224
You'll learn, rookie.

170
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:35,461
I thought you were *the*
prep & landing guy, Wayne.

171
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:38,679
But you're just a lump of coal.

172
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:43,541
Yeah. Well, sometimes,
we don't get what we want.

173
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,119
- Yes, dear?
- Wayne, it's Magee.

174
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,689
I'm sure you've noticed
the snowstorm is pretty bad.

175
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,248
Oh, well, I have now.
I mean, uh, oh.

176
00:12:57,283 --> 00:13:00,590
You... you're not on the roof?
You're not... you're not done?

177
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,920
Okay. Fine.
We have a coal in the stocking.

178
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,465
- What?
- We're putting him to bed. Relax.

179
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,558
I told you to pull it together,
not crumble like a Christmas cookie!

180
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,350
- If you have...
- Eight Maids A-Milking, this is Jingle Belle.
Come in, Eight Maids A-Milking.

181
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:16,219
I really hate that call sign.
Can barely hear you, Jingle Belle.

182
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,133
- We are in the soup here.
- We're flying blind, man!

183
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,179
Tell her we're flying blind!

184
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:24,714
Why didn't I listen to Jerry
and stay in toy design?

185
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:29,341
Tiny... Bring me Big Red.

186
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,141
It's just a little snow, Magee.
I can handle it.

187
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,808
You don't understand, sir.
The site's not prepped.

188
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:40,543
We have no choice.

189
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,923
Figgy pudding.

190
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,457
It's never come to that.
What about Timmy?

191
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,165
Sir, with all due respect,

192
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,388
There are millions of other kids
counting on you.  It's just not safe.

193
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,209
We'll make it up to Timmy
somehow, I promise.

194
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,606
All right, then.

195
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,784
You heard her, team.

196
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:09,139
Figgy p-pudding?

197
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,780
But that means the Big Guy's
passing us by.

198
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:14,665
What about Timmy?
What about his Christmas?

199
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:20,267
Well, I, uh...
I never meant...

200
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,655
This to happen.

201
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,799
This will be the best Christmas ever.

202
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,377
Thanks, Wayne.

203
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,739
- Magee, patch me Through to the Big Guy.
- Wayne, it's over.

204
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:57,654
Patch me through, or I'll tell
everyone about you and Tiny!

205
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,786
- Patching you through.
- Hello? This is Partridge.

206
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:03,644
Sir, my name's Wayne
from Prep & Landing.

207
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,716
I need you to come to this house, sir.

208
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,018
Oh, I'm afraid Magee's
rerouting me, son.

209
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:11,224
Sir, there's a child here
that's really excited for you.

210
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:14,027
We cannot let him down.
I can land you safely.

211
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:16,372
I have a plan,
and there is time.

212
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,396
Please, sir, let me do my job.

213
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,287
I can't let Timmy down.

214
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:24,366
I was hoping you'd say that.
Let's give it a shot, my boy.

215
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:32,401
This is the most tinsel job ever,
huh, partner?

216
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:36,810
Huh... I shouldn't never
have patch him through.

217
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:38,823
Sir!

218
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:42,503
Roasting chestnuts,
he's turned back!

219
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,855
Oh! no!

220
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:52,491
Oh! no!
No, no, no, no!

221
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,212
You can't see anything in this storm!

222
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,845
Except your winter wonderland.

223
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:21,439
How are we gonna make it
through all this snow?

224
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:25,650
Laughing all the way, my friend,
laughing all the way.

225
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:33,518
Lanny, I need some rope!

226
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:46,774
Is this enough?

227
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,935
Light 'em up!

228
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,374
Good job, Treeskirt!

229
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,309
Yes!

230
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:21,190
Aah! I'm gonna die!

231
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,965
I'm alive!

232
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,472
Little Drummer Boy...  Little Drummer Boy,
we don't see the landing strip.

233
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:41,407
Almost there, sir!

234
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:50,171
We have a visual!

235
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:51,841
The landing zone is prepped!

236
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:54,031
We're going in.
Cut the engines.

237
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:00,647
Coming in too hot!

238
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:04,068
It's too late to pull up, man!
It's too late to pull up!

239
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,847
Keep it together, Dancer!

240
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:07,448
Hang on!

241
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:12,183
Huh? (gasps)
The tailhook!

242
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:56,230
Hi... I don't have an appointment, uh...
But I was wondering if, um...

243
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,708
- Relaxing... He's been expecting you.
- He is?  Oh, well, uh...

244
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,884
Okay.

245
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,610
Hey, wayne!
You're missing the party!

246
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,195
They're gonna start
the gift exchange! Whoo!

247
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,020
Uh, no. no.  You... you go ahead.
I'll catch up later.

248
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,079
Come in, Wayne.

249
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,951
Sir, I am very sorry
about last night.

250
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,978
If you want to transfer me
or fire me, I..

251
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,973
I completely understand.

252
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,692
But, please, make sure
you find Lanny a new partner.

253
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,255
He's a good elf, sir.

254
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:43,756
Well...

255
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:47,373
That's why I assigned him to you.

256
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:51,992
But don't be silly, Wayne.
I'm not going to bite your head off.

257
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:55,919
Everyone slips onto the
naughty list once in a while.

258
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:58,548
I'm glad you stopped by, though.

259
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,302
So I could say Merry Christmas.

260
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:04,551
It's... It's Timmy's house.

261
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:09,603
It's a reminder of why
our job is so important.

262
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:13,968
Now go on.   We're not getting
any younger, you know.

263
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,208
Thanks, Santa.

264
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:25,459
Oh, Wayne...
One more thing.

265
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,113
Well, what...
What did he say?

266
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,901
- He offered me a promotion.
- Wow!

267
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,487
Director of The Nice List.

268
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,753
Congratulations.

269
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,007
- I turned him down.
- What?

270
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:45,758
I'm more of a Prep & Landing guy.

271
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,667
Aah! a fruitcake!
Mmm!

272
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:01,856
Thanks, Magee!
The best Christmas ever!
