[door opens and closes]

3
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,390
Clara! Right on time.

4
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:59,183
I know, Mom. I'm so sorry!
The roads are a mess.

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,060
They always are this time of the year.

6
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,521
- That's why I asked you to come early.
- [Clara] I know.

7
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:07,525
- Wow! Mom!
- [Lydia] Hmm?

8
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,861
- [Clara] This is so beautiful.
- [Lydia] Hmm.

9
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,073
I think this is your best one ever.

10
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,615
It has to be.

11
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,326
I'm being featured
in <i>Seasons Magazine </i>for Christmas.

12
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,037
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,454
- Wow!
- [Lydia giggles]

14
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,415
- I love these windows.
- [cell phone rings]

15
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,795
- It's Bonnie.
- [Lydia] But of course.

16
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,504
Hey, Bonnie.

17
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,215
Yeah, Bonnie, slow down.

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,093
Well, yeah, it's Christmas.
We always get slammed.

19
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,930
Again?

20
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,645
Yeah, sure. I'll be right in.

22
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,276
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm?

23
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,694
I'm really sorry, but I have to go.

24
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,489
You're really wasting
your talents there, sweetheart.

25
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,742
Can we have a rain check
on baking those cookies?

26
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:58,784
[Lydia] Oh, no!

27
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,331
Your mother waits for no one,
first born or otherwise.

28
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,540
How do you think your father
became so punctual?

29
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:06,168
[both laugh]

30
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,336
He was pretty punctual.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,004
- Mm-hmm.
- I love you.

32
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,633
- I love you too. Be careful.
- I will.

33
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,010
- Bye.
- Bye.

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,229
Right there. Yes, perfect.

00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,901
Welcome back
to <i>Can You Stand The Heat!</i>

39
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,155
We started with 50 super celebrity chefs,

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,491
and managed to whittle
it down to just three!

41
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,286
So, who's it gonna be?

42
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,996
- Mike Mahoney...
- [audience applauds]

43
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,872
...whose big talent is second only

44
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,082
- to his big mouth?
- Big Mike!

45
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,417
What's that catchphrase?

46
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,586
[all] Let's get cooking!

47
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:55,300
Mike is in the house, baby!
That's right! Whoo!

48
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,468
[TV hostess] Or Sharl Shaunnessy?

49
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,431
The only baker who has what it takes
to rise to the top.

[audience gasps]

53
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:17,489
Or will it be Manhattan's
hottest celebrity chef,

54
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,325
restaurateur and bachelor, Shane Roarke?

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,704

[Shane chuckles] <i>Huh? Huh?</i>

57
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,968
Let's see it! Let's see!
Ah, ah, ah!

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,429
[chuckles] Yeah, there it is!

59
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,139
[clapping and cheering]

60
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,438
Well, we've waited so long
for the best of the best

61
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,817
to slice and dice, and sift it out.

62
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,319
And now for the winner...

63
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,070

Oh, man.

66
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,954
You are...

67
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,332
- not the winner!
- Oh, come on!

68
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,585
[mouthing] I'm sorry.

69
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,461
I'm out of here. This is [bleep].

70
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,628
These two wouldn't know the difference

71
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,298
between a puff pastry and a Danish pastry.

72
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>See you later, squids. </i>[bleep]

73
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:24,180
[laughing] <i>What the </i>[bleep].
[laughs]<i> You can't say that on TV.</i>

74
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,435
And this year's

00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,103
celebrity champion is...

76
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,495
Shane Roarke!

77
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,790
- [clapping and cheering]
- [woman] Oh, my God!

78
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,457
[Clara] Guys?

79
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,211
- Guys?
- [woman] Amazing!

80
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,673
- Oh! He's so inspiring--
- Guys!

81
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,050
If you're looking for something to do,

82
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,220
maybe your jobs
could use a little attention?

83
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,555
Yeah, I know,
but we have a really big day,

84
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,641
so, we need to get going.

85
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,521
Like now. Thank you.

86
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,608
[indistinct chatter]

87
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,447
Oh, Clara, you might as well
own this place.

88
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,492
Oh, no, I am happy managing.

89
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,119
Yeah, but your restaurant
in Chicago was great.

90
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,997
I mean, I could just imagine
what you'd do to this place.

91
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:35,252
Well, enough about that.
Let's just worry about these guests.

92
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,336
Shane won!

93
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,588
- Good for Shane.
- Everyone loves Shane.

94
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,259
I have a table of seven coming in.

95
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,759
- Can you please help me set up?
- OK.

96
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,427

Shane Roarke!

100
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:55,646
He's the country's most famous chef,
and most eligible bachelor.

101
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,567
Breaking eggs...
And breaking hearts.

102
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,276
Shane Roarke, everybody.

105
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,355
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:39,858
Here we go.

107
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,358
- Great. Thank you.
- [Clara] Enjoy.

108
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:42,694
- Thanks.
- Hey,

109
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,778
when you get a chance, could you run
some garlic bread to table three.

110
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,740
- Absolutely. You're welcome.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,533
Yeah, just go with the cab. Perfect.

112
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,036
How is everything?

113
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,288
Good. Your server
will be with you in just a minute.

114
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:55,372
Thank you.

115
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,584
How is everything over here?

116
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,255
Hey! [clapping]
We don't have all day here!

117
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,050
I'll be right there, sir.

118
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,636
- [Bonnie] I'm not 100 percent sure, but...
- What are you doing?

119
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,220
[Bonnie] I think that guy wants you...

120
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:10,387
You think?

121
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,350
Hey, can I get two glasses
of red please? Thank you.

122
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,143
[clapping]

123
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,103
- Don't clap at the waitress. She's--
- I'm getting it done.

124
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,564
- Shush. I got this one.
- Don't shush me!

125
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,151
How can I help you?

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,531
[scoffs] I ordered a rare steak
and it's not bleeding.

127
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,867
Well, you certainly seemed to have enjoyed
the first half of it.

128
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,827
Yeah, but, I didn't love it.

129
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,329
Shouldn't I love my steak...

130
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,124
Clara?

131
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,295
Well, I'm afraid I can't guarantee you
love on this steak,

132
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,632
but I can get you a new steak.
Rare, extra bloody.

133
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:48,634
Touchdown!

134
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh, wow. Well, the date is over,

135
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,225
and I am so sorry about... that.

136
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,562
Um... [clears throat] Is there a taxi
stand outside? I'll just...

137
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,065
I'll be back in just a minute.

138
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,362
I bet you're glad to be back, huh?

139
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,862
[Clara] Over the moon.

140
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,502
Ah, I can't wait to get home.
I'm exhausted.

141
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,045
I know. Me too. OK, but first
I gotta use the bathroom.

142
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,173
- Again? You just went to the bathroom.
- Yeah, [scoffs] I gotta go again.

143
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,843
- [phone ringing]
- Have you been stealing

144
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,136
cheese from the kitchen again?

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,803
So?

146
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,015
- [laughing] So, you're lactose intolerant.
- No, I'm not.

147
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,267
Cheese just makes my stomach

148
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,269
- gurgle a little bit.
- [Clara] Right. My bad.

149
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,980
- Enjoy your cheese. Yeah. Go.
- Can you hold my bag?

150
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,826
Hi, how are you? I'm just checking in.

151
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,495
- [thud]
- [Clara sighs]

152
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,546
[Shane] Can I help you with this?

153
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,758
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, don't mention it.

154
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,676
- [Clara] This isn't actually my cheese.
- Right.

155
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,178
- Well, this is a nice piece of Gruyère.
- [Clara sighs]

156
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,804
It's still not mine. It's... um...

157
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,222
- [embarrassed laugh] It's not mine.
- [Shane] A friend's.

158
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,182
Yeah.

159
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,894
- [Clara] Uh...
- [clears throat]

160
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,812
[both sigh]

161
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,609
Anyway, uh... enjoy your stay
at Thunder Mountain.

162
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,318
Thank you, um...

163
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,236
- [both] Clara.
- [Shane clears throat]

164
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,615
Right. It's... on my necklace.

165
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:34,657
[Shane] It is. Yeah.

166
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,827
- Well, have a good night.
- You too. [chuckles]

167
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,163
Bye. [laughs nervously]

168
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,508
- Do you know who that is?
- Mm-hmm, yup, mm-hmm.

169
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,467
- [excited] It's Shane--
- Shh, shh, shh.

170
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,677
- It's Shane Roarke!
- I know. I know.

171
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,263
You know, from that reality show earlier!

172
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,389
- Yeah.
- He's standing-- [giggling] Here's here!

173
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,934
Oh, he's even more handsome in real life.

174
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,727
Did he make a pass at you?

175
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,816
No, Bonnie, he handed me your cheese.

176
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,110
- [laughs]
- Come on.

177
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,240
[inaudible]

178
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,866
Great.

179
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,327
[phone rings]

180
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,716
[sighs]

181
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,333
Shane Roarke is staying at our resort!

182
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,503
Well, you know,
it's not really our resort.

183
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,297
Oh, do you think
he'll come to the restaurant?

184
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,048
Yeah. He might. He might.

185
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,092
If I were Shane Roarke
and I went to our restaurant

186
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,428
- what would I order?
- Pizza!

187
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:23,765
Yes! Pizza! I mean,
if he's the perfect man,

188
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,101
which we know he is,
he would get pizza.

189
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,562
[indistinct conversation]

190
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,691
Let's do it!

191
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,822
[engine turning over]

192
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,869
[engine starts]

193
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
[Clara] Right.

194
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,414
[indistinct conversation]

195
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,927
[both hooting and hollering]

196
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,388
[Hugh Peters] Guys, right here.

197
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,599
Christmas is just around the corner.

198
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,433
And if Thanksgiving was any indication,

199
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,562
I think we can expect it to be
at least twice as busy this year.

200
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,441
Now, I have a very exciting
announcement to make.

201
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,525
To help with the busy season,

202
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,361
and perhaps some
marketing opportunities,

203
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,238
I've hired a new head chef,

204
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,907
starting today.

205
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,077
He's a huge talent. Shane Roarke.

206
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,205
Come out, buddy!

207
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,456
Oh!

208
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,463
It's Shane Roarke! He's not a guest!

209
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,509
- He's with us!
- Uh-huh. Yup. [chuckles]

210
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,552
Now, I know Shane wanted to get started
meeting all of his staff.

211
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,181
And we all have a lot of work to do
getting ready for Christmas.

212
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,934
So, let's welcome Shane,
and make him feel at home.

213
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,062
Thank you.

214
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,110
- Hi. Clara. We met last night.
- [Shane] Hi.

215
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,903
Of course, yeah. The cheese girl.

216
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,489
Actually, no, I'm cheese girl!

217
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,615
Yeah, I know, that was my purse cheese.

218
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,451
[laughs] But who cares?

219
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm Bonnie. And you're Shane.

220
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,498
Hi, Bonnie.

221
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,208
[giggling] Yeah,
Clara was holding my purse.

222
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,586
Oh! Well, that's very nice of her.

223
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,296
- [chuckles]
- [Bonnie] She thinks

224
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,465
I'm lactose intolerant,
but I don't think I am.

225
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,467
Bonnie, remember we talked
about first impressions?

226
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,138
[Shane] OK. Uh, I mean,
that's great to know,

227
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,597
if I'm ever preparing something
for you in the kitchen.

228
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,851
- [all three laugh]
- Yeah.

229
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,479
It was nice to meet you.

230
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,149
Uh-huh. Huh.

231
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,943
- [Clara laughs]
- Wow! No,

232
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,113
that guy needs to take it down a notch
with the flirting.

233
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,032
Yeah? Was he flirting with you?

234
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,036
[Bonnie] Oh! You like him, don't you?

235
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,370
What? Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,623
Oh, you do like him. I can tell.

237
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,585
You know what, I'm going to see
if he likes you.

238
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,793
No, please don't.

239
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,504
- You can count on me.
- [Clara scoffs]

240
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,298
I didn't even say I liked him.

241
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,051
Bonnie!

242
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,054
[inaudible conversations]

243
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,866
[Shane] I'm waiting on that pizza...

244
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,620
How are we doing with those scallops?

245
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,375
[inaudible conversation]

246
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,133
Order's up.

247
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,054
[inaudible conversation]

248
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,739
[waiter] Enjoy your food.
I think you will all love it.

249
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,119
- That was...
- Jeans!

250
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,787
- Excuse me.
- But also skiing too.

251
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,831
It's-- I don't understand
why he does that everytime.

252
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,749
OK. Sorry, I'll be right back.

253
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,000
- It's not fun.
- Have fun with that.

254
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,255
- [giggling and squealing]
- [glasses clinking]

255
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,341
Hello. I'm the manager here.

256
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,719
I heard you asked to see me.
My name is Clara.

257
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,889
How's everything today?
Can we grab you some more drinks?

258
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,932
[sighs] More drinks!
What a great idea, Claire!

259
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,100
- Oh, It's Clara.
- [Janice] Oh!

260
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,352
- Uh, I'm Janice.
- And I'm the other Janice!

261
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,815
Janice and Janice. Two Janices!
[squeals]

262
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,192
We are just a couple of single girls
on vacation here in the mountains.

263
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,486
And we happened to notice
that your new chef is...

264
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,948
- [both] Shane Roarke!
- Oh, I'm afraid I can't really

265
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,033
be much help. I don't know him

266
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,951
- that well--
- We feel like we know him personally.

267
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,788
So, we were wondering
if you could ask Shane

268
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,206
if he'd like to come out and say hello?

269
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,003
I mean, we would love
to meet him. [chuckles]

270
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,129
Oh, sure. I mean, he's pretty busy...

271
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:06,506
- Thank you!
- Thanks.

272
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,842
- [glasses clinking]
- [Janice] Shane Roarke. She's gonna get...

273
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,721
- [Clara] Shane! Hi.
- Hi.

274
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,054
Um...

275
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,975
- Hi. Clara. Hi.
- Hi. Clara. Hi.

276
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,602
- Yeah, now, we've officially said hi.
- Yeah, we have.

277
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,897
Um, I'm--I'm really sorry to bother you,

278
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,273
but I have a table of young ladies.

279
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,274
They asked if you could drop by
to say hello.

280
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:26,110
I told them you were busy.
So, I can just--

281
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,403
No, no, no. It's fine.
I'll--I'll head over.

282
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:31,407
Peters says I'm never too busy
to butter up customers,

283
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,075
so, I'll... I'll head over.

284
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,162
OK. Their names
are Janice and Janice.

285
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,746
I'm sorry?

286
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,040
- Janice and Janice. Yeah.
- Two Janices!

287
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,667
Wow! Sounds interesting.

288
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,379
Yeah, well, they kind of freak me out,
but they're very excited to see you.

289
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,006
Oh, OK. Well, tell them
I'm very excited to see them.

290
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,176
- OK. [laughs]
- OK. Thanks.

291
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,844
- I'll head out.
- [Clara] OK.

292
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,472
[inaudible conversation]

293
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,557
[indistinct conversation]

294
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,061
Good afternoon, ladies.

295
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

296
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,898
- How are you? Shane.
- Janice.

297
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,608
Janice?
Very nice to meet you, Janice.

298
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,609
And?

299
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,278
- Janice.
- [Shane] You're both Janice?

300
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,951
Wow. He is so smooth.
Isn't he smooth, Clara?

301
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,160
Who?

302
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:21,749
Oh, sure, pretend you don't know.
I'll play along. Shane!

303
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,335
Hang on a second.

304
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,464
Oh, yeah. I guess he's smooth.

305
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,260
Hi, Mr. Peters.

306
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,346
Hi, Bonnie. Clara? Shall we?

307
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,763
[Clara] Sure. I'll be right there, Hugh.

308
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,728
- Hugh?
- Yeah, that's his name.

309
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,439
Really? I thought it was Peters.

310
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,277
You thought he went by mister,
and then his first name?

311
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,278
OK, don't change the subject.

312
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,115
What's he mean, "Shall we?"
Shall we what?

313
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,617
Shall we mind our own business,
maybe? [chuckles]

314
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,125
Mr. Hugh?

315
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,009
All right, guys. Why don't we
take a little bit of a break?

316
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,551
Right? We've got a busy night.

317
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,429
Cool. Good work.

318
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,307
Thank you.

319
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,477
Chef, very nice on the fryer, by the way.

320
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,644
[man] Thanks, chef!

321
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,732
OK, enough about the schedule.

322
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,692
- Yeah.
- I want to talk to you about this project.

323
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,068
What he have...

324
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,197
- [slurping]
- [Shane humming]

325
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,244
- A little soda on the rocks.
- Thank you.

326
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,167
So, you're pretty smooth
over there with your lady fans.

327
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,295
Hmm. Oh, yeah.

328
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,921
They were, uh, they were interesting,

329
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,798
that's for sure. Fun fact,
they're both named Janice.

330
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,675
- [laughs] Wow.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,804
- That is interesting.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

332
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,641
Well, I bet you have
a lot of lady fans, huh?

333
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,477
Argh! Yeah. I guess. [laughs]

334
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,188
OK, I see

335
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,730
- where this is headed.
- What?

336
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,732
I should probably tell you
I have a boyfriend.

337
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,942
Just to be clear.

338
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,861
- Oh! OK. Yeah, thank--
- Yeah.

339
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:14,987
- Thank you.
- He is, uh...

340
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,154
a city planner.

341
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,115
- His name is Clive.
- Nice.

342
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,326
You know, Bonnie and Clive.

343
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,744
Like <i>Bonnie and Clyde.</i>
Only instead of Clyde it's...

344
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,163
- Clive.
- Clive. Yeah. [laughs]

345
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,790
I mean, that's lovely.

346
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,042
So, what's up with you and Clara?

347
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,170
You guys been friends
a long time, or what?

348
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:33,506
Oh, best friends
since we were little kids.

349
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,464
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

350
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,092
We both grew up here
in Thunder Valley.

351
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,968
I never left, but Clara went to

352
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,471
Chicago for a few years to open up
her own restaurant.

353
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,306
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

354
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,516
It was a really nice place, too.

355
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:46,559
It just didn't quite work out
like she planned, you know?

356
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,605
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know,
Chicago's a tough market.

357
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,068
But anyways, now she's back,

358
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,779
totally alone,
and no boyfriend to speak of.

359
00:19:58,154 --> 00:19:59,198
[Shane chuckles]

360
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:01,991
So, there's no city planner then?

361
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:02,951
- No?
- No.

362
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,163
Yeah. Anyone could just ask her out,
and she'd probably say yes.

363
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,957
OK.

364
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,710
Oh, so, what's going on with her
and Peters over there?

365
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,256
[indistinct conversation]

366
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,298
- Really?
- Yeah.

367
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,718
[Clara laughs]

368
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,801
OK. Now...

369
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,305
Oh! No, there's nothing
going on over there.

370
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,682
- [Clara] Yeah...
- I don't... I don't think.

371
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,532
[door closes]

372
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,948
[footsteps approaching]

373
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:12,998
[Jackie] They're all one of a kind.

374
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
They're gorgeous.

375
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:17,670
They are.

376
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,756
You should pick your favorite one
and place a bid on it.

377
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,718
You know, every year,
our local artists donate these ornaments,

378
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,886
and then we raffle them off for charity.

379
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,807
That's a tradition started
by Jackie's parents

380
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,807
back in year one.

381
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,351
I see you've met my beautiful wife.

382
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,810
Hi, I'm Jackie.

383
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,770
And I'm the lucky husband, Frank Haven.

384
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,397
[laughing] I'm Shane Roarke.

385
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,317
OK. Shane Roarke.

386
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,529
I'd say, black coffee with half a creamer.

387
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,284
- [Jackie snaps fingers]
- [Frank laughs] Impressed?

388
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,368
Well, young man,
you've seen nothing yet.

389
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,957
Oh, the Mountain View
has been our life for...

390
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,166
- what honey, 22 years?
- Twenty-five years.

391
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,086
Twenty-five years, says the boss.

392
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,671
And believe me, she's always right.

393
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,090
[Jackie] Yes, I am. [chuckles]

394
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,428
So, Shane,
you're not from around here, are you?

395
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,807
No, no. Uh, I'm actually
originally from New York.

396
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,726
- Ah!
- [Shane] And, uh...

397
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,019
I've kind of been roving around
for the last 10 years.

398
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,522
[stammers] And I just took a job over
at the Thunder Mountain resort.

399
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,359
Oh, one of our favorite servers
works up there.

400
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,278
[stutters] It's the Surface, right?

401
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,740
- The Summit.
- Yeah, something like that.

402
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,409
- Yeah.
- [laughs] Her name's Clara Garrison.

403
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,911
Clara. I do know Clara.

404
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,413
She's actually...
she's actually the manager now.

405
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,040
A very good one, at that.

406
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,044
Oh, she's terrific!
She worked here part-time

407
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,296
through high school, and then full-time

408
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:45,048
for a couple of years
before she went to Chicago.

409
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,009
Jackie and I don't have children
of our own,

410
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,052
so Clara's sort of like a daughter to us.

411
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:50,887
Right.

412
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,766
So, what brings you from the Summit
to the Mountain View?

413
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,685
Uh... [sighs] history, I guess.

414
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,980
Yeah, I'm kind of...

415
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:06,278
kind of interested in some of the older,
more family-run resorts in the area.

416
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,199
Well, you've missed the height.
I mean, back in the day,

417
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:13,576
there were a good dozen or more
just along these mountains.

418
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,121
We're one of the few
that are still scrapping out a living.

419
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,666
It's just so hard to compete
with the big resorts

420
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,292
and the chains anymore, you know.

421
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,545
We still get slammed at breakfast!

422
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,632
Yeah, well, thanks to you.
Without her Eggs Florentine

423
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,134
- we'd be dead and buried by now.
- Really?

424
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,346
You should come by some morning!

425
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,306
Well, I would love that.

426
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,742
[inaudible]

427
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,959
All right. We're still waiting
on one more maple-glazed quail,

428
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,837
a seared trout, and we're going
to do the final beef carpaccio.

429
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,698
- I saw that.
- What look? There was no look.

430
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,866
I didn't say look.

431
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,349
You're still here.

432
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,020
Yeah. Um... I'm just
getting a start on tomorrow.

433
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,230
Nice.

434
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,275
[Shane] Oh, hey, I, um...

435
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,320
I just wanted to say thanks
for helping out tonight.

436
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,825
Oh, yeah, no problem. I mean,
it's better together right?

437
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:18,493
No, no, no. I know. I know.

438
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,996
But, uh, tonight was crazy busy.
[chuckles]

439
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,499
On top of being
a couple of servers short, so...

440
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,209
- thank you.
- Oh, yeah. Tell me about it.

441
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:33,424
So, I'm also assuming that you probably
didn't have time for dinner tonight?

442
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,931
No, but that's OK. I can just grab
something on the way home.

443
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:41,724
Oh, please. What do you mean?
I'm gonna be making something for myself.

444
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,229
You know? I mean, they say
I'm not terrible at this.

445
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,271
- [laughs] That's true. I mean...
- [Shane chuckles]

446
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,316
They actually have been saying
that around here, you know.

447
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,234
- Who's been saying that?
- [both laugh]

448
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,112
- That's a great idea, actually.
- OK.

449
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,573
Um, but you cooked all night.

450
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,034
How about I make us something?

451
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,912
- You?
- Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,538
- All right.
- Yes?

453
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,957
I'm not going to say no to that.

454
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:20,888
[Shane] Uh!

455
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,394
Are you sure
I can't help with anything?

456
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,605
Well, if you grabbed a bottle of wine,
I wouldn't complain.

457
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:30,982
- I mean, I can do that. Yeah.
- [laughs] Yeah?

458
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,072
That just smells really good. I just-- OK.

459
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,365
- I got this.
- All right.

460
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,714
[Shane] Wow!

461
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,842
That was fantastic.

462
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,719
Well, thank you.

463
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,431
You know, they say
I'm not terrible at this.

464
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:05,726
Mm. [chuckles] I mean, I heard that.

465
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,644
- [laughs]
- Bonnie told me

466
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,855
that you, uh, [clears throat]
had your own place.

467
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,107
- [Clara] She did, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:16,694
[Clara] Well...

469
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,865
that turned out to be
a little girl's dream that got too big.

470
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,661
At least you did it, right?

471
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:26,954
I mean, most people
just sit around dreaming.

472
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,917
Think. Imagine how proud
that little girl would have been

473
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,169
if she saw what you did?

474
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,547
Pretty proud.

475
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,968
No, I took on more than I could handle.

476
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:42,304
Maybe it was just bad timing.

477
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,765
And, I doubt it.

478
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:47,976
Yeah, maybe.

479
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,771
Either way, here I am, back at home,

480
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,567
trying to... figure out what's next.

481
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,655
Huh! I mean,
I think chocolate cake's next.

482
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:04,116
- [chuckles] Chocolate cake?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,371
Well, that was my other dream.
So, how did you know?

484
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,248
You wanted to be a chocolate cake?

485
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,915
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted.

486
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,625
[both laugh]

487
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,719
Thanks for the company tonight.
It was-- It was really great.

488
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,138
Well, it was my pleasure.
And thank you for cooking.

489
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,940
So... [clears throat]
Can I walk you to your car?

490
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,947
My car... Um, well, it's, uh,
it's currently in the shop.

491
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:47,326
And, uh, the last bus
left about an hour ago.

492
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,373
So, I've been trying to come up
with like a clever way

493
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:53,000
to ask for a ride.

494
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,501
I will give you a ride. Yeah.

495
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,752
[Clara] Thanks.

496
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,089
[Clara chuckles]

497
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,395
This is it!

498
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,232
Wow. It's a gorgeous building.

499
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,527
How long have you lived here?

500
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:25,156
I managed to pick it up
with what I had left after Chicago, so...

501
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,785
I am impressed, Ms. Clara Garrison.

502
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,080
With what? The fact
that I'm not homeless? Or...

503
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,875
- [both laugh]
- Hey, I live in a hotel

504
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,085
and all my belongings are in suitcases,

505
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,252
- so...
- [Clara laughs]

506
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,257
So, you are definitely amazing.

507
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,885
[both laugh nervously]

508
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,823
Wow, I can't believe
I'm kissing a celebrity.

509
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,497
What's wrong?

510
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,458
[stammers] Nothing, nothing, nothing.
I--I just don't-- I don't know

511
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,335
if this is the best idea.

512
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,506
I just get a lot of attention

513
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,590
from the show.
I didn't even know you watched it.

514
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:27,176
I don't. I don't watch your show.

515
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,765
I was just saying I'm surprised.

516
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,683
Like, in a good way.
I feel really stupid--

517
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,186
Hang on, hang on. I don't think
I'm explaining this right,

518
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,021
- but--
- You're definitely not. You--

519
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,356
Good night, Shane.

520
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,903
- [sights]
- [car door closes]

521
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,281
[exhales]

522
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,618
I am such a jerk.

523
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:17,810
[inaudible]

524
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,615
Two milks, one sugar.

525
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,660
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

526
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,996
- Are you ready for this morning?
- Hmm...

527
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,290
let me get halfway through
this coffee, and I will be.

528
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,167
Good.

529
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,005
You all right?

530
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,759
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, I'm just ready.

531
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,386
[Hugh] OK.

532
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,265
- It's just up here.
- [Clara] Great.

533
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,730
- There you go. Enjoy.
- [man] Thank you.

534
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,522
Jackie! Sorry to bother you.

535
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,608
Listen, Frank was right.

536
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,778
Those were the best Eggs Florentine
I have ever had.

537
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,196
[chuckles] Really?

538
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,531
Ever. And I happen
to be an expert on eggs.

539
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,700
Are you, now?

540
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,744
Just a little bit. And I'm gonna have
to get that recipe from you.

541
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,538
I taste the smoked cayenne,
but is that mustard powder in there?

542
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,583
You must put a little pinch--

543
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:25,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm afraid
that is a trade secret.

544
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,713
- [both laugh]
- OK, I'm not gonna ask.

545
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,132
[Jackie] More coffee?

546
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,093
Actually, I... I should get going to work.

547
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,427
Well, could I grab a coffee to go?

548
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,930
- Of course.
- Actually,

549
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,390
can I get two coffees to go, please?

550
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,769
- Coming right up.
- [Shane] Thank you.

551
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,746
That's Shane's car, isn't it?

552
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,249
[Clara] Uh, I don't know.

553
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,802
[indistinct chatter]

554
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,641
[chairs clattering]

555
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:21,559
Hi.

556
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,521
- Well, aren't we lucky to find you here!
- [Shane] Janice, Janice. Hi.

557
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,606
You know ladies, I...
I was actually just on my way out.

558
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,525
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah.

559
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,527
Are you too good
for a second breakfast?

560
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,778
- [both laugh and squeal]
- [door bell jingles]

561
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,947
[indistinct conversation]

562
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,536
- So...
- What'd you have for breakfast?

563
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:42,496
[stammers] Uh, I did the Eggs Florentine.

564
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,251
- [Jackie] Clara! How good to see you!
- Jackie! Aw!

565
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,378
I always save a hug for Frank.

566
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:50,547
- [Frank] Hi!
- Hi!

567
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,465
Jackie, Frank. This is Hugh Peters.

568
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,800
He owns the restaurant I work at.

569
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,677
Oh, that's right.
[stutters] The something or other.

570
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,722
- [Hugh] The Summit.
- [Frank] Yeah, sounds about right.

571
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:00,764
- Yeah.
- [laughing] It's a pleasure to meet you.

572
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:04,603
Clara, you were right.
This place is charming.

573
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,438
Guys, could we get
a couple minutes after breakfast?

574
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,773
We have a proposal
we'd like to run by you.

575
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,235
A proposal! I haven't had one
of those since Frank's.

576
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,195
Turned out pretty good.

577
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,114
- [Clara laughs]
- [Frank] I pay her to say that.

578
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,615
- [all laugh]
- Just sit down,

579
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,659
and--and we'll be with you
right after the rush, OK?

580
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,702
- [Hugh] Can wait. Can wait.
- OK. Would you like coffee?

581
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,829
[both] Yes, please.

582
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,081
- [Hugh] This way.
- [Clara] Thank you.

583
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,257
[women giggling]

584
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,635
Uh, [stammers] it's so nice
to see you guys again.

585
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,969
- [Janice] Really?
- [Shane] Really. Yeah.

586
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,972
You're-- Huh, no, no, I... [chuckles]

587
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,641
- So, you're a Pisces and we're...
- [Shane] I am.

588
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,559
- [Janice continues indistinctly]
- Hmm.

589
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,226
[Shane] What month is Pisces?

590
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,853
[Frank] All right.
This will get you started.

591
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:48,938
- [Clara] Thank you.
- [Frank] OK.

592
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:49,898
[Shane] June is Gemini.

593
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,483
So, if you could eat 10 pounds of food
what'd it be?

594
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,612
Ten pounds?
Uh... probably wings.

595
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:56,987
What is it?

596
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,739
Nothing.

597
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,284
[indistinct conversation]

598
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:03,994
I figured you might be hungry.

599
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,539
- Aw. Thank you.
- Thank you.

600
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,545
Wow, you were right, Clara.
This smells incredible.

601
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,505
I told you.

602
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,009
Dig in.

603
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:22,472
You know, ladies. I, um,
I actually really do have to go.

604
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,391
Oh, great idea!

605
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,601
- We're moving the party, Janice.
- OK. One car or two, Shane?

606
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,146
- I, uh...
- One, two. We'll figure it out!

607
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,648
- Yeah. OK.
- Oh! OK.

608
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,483
[indistinct conversation]

609
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:36,443
Oh, honey.

610
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:43,076
- So, we'll see you again soon.
- I-- I'll be back before you know it.

611
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,494
I hope so.

612
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,954
If you guys have any questions,
please call me.

613
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,248
I'd be happy to go over anything
to help you decide.

614
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,918
I'll look at it, and then
Jackie will make the decision.

615
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,211
Oh, come on. Not just me!

616
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,047
Lovely meeting you both.
Hope to hear from you soon.

617
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,802
If our Clara's involved,
I'm sure it'll work out.

618
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,054
[Jackie] Oh, that reminds me.

619
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,766
We met somebody else
who works at the resort.

620
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,726
Oh, yeah. Shawn.

621
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,268
- What--What was his last name?
- It's not Shawn.

622
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:11,646
It's Shane. Shane Roarke.

623
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,771
That sounds about right. Yeah.

624
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,773
Oh, so, he was just here for breakfast?

625
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,025
No, actually he came by yesterday.

626
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:18,902
Oh!

627
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,659
Anyway, thank you both, so much.
I'll see you soon.

628
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,577
- Have a good time, darling. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

629
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,583
- Shawn? Shane. Shane. Damn!
- No. It was Shane!

630
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,257
Everybody! As you know,
tonight the restaurant will be closed

631
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,884
for our annual charity dinner.

632
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,635
It's all in the spirit
of Christmas, of course,

633
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,096
but if it happens to throw
a little publicity our way,

634
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,347
so, be it.

635
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,389
[whispering] Don't look now,

636
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,518
but someone's throwing you
some major eye attention.

637
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,023
Let's do some good!

638
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,487
...like when you play basketball,

639
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,864
you might play hard. Use some elbow.

640
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,907
Ah, yeah.

641
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:04,907
You should go on them easier.

642
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,248
[cell phone beeps]

643
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,541
Call Clara.

644
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,213
[cell phone rings]

645
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,257
- Hey, Mom, you're on speaker.
- Hi, Mrs. Garrison.

646
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,637
Hello, Bonnie, darling.
Clara, I've called to remind you

647
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,971
<i>of our family Christmas dinner.</i>

648
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,974
Yes, it is on my radar
and scheduled in.

649
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,476
Will you be bringing someone
other than Bonnie this year?

650
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,855
Actually, Clive and I
are doing Christmas this year.

651
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,981
Good for you!

652
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,275
Mom, you know I'm too busy to date.

653
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,320
So, you're down one Bonnie
and stuck with me.

654
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:43,403
[Lydia] <i>Mm.</i>

655
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,949
I seem to recall your baby sister
making time for Barry

656
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,784
<i>- while she was at Harvard.</i>
- Mom!

657
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,869
I'm just saying. Just saying.

658
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:52,956
Mom, I've got to go.

659
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,708
- All right. Just be on time.
- [Clara] <i>I will.</i>

660
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,293
- Bye.
- [Clara] <i>Bye.</i>

661
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,128
Nice.

662
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,715
[Bonnie laughs] Got to love it.

663
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
[Clara] Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,873
Perfect. Thank you.

665
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,961
I managed to sneak you
another chocolate raspberry truffle.

666
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,505
Oh, you devil. Oh, it's so good.

667
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,215
- Thank you.
- [Clara] My pleasure.

668
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,217
The food is better than ever this year.

669
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,802
Well, we have a new chef.

670
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,764
Oh, fantastic! Honestly, though,
the best part isn't the food.

671
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,057
The best part is seeing you guys again.

672
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:55,434
[both] Aw.

673
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,394
- We look forward to seeing you every year.
- Oh, it's so nice.

674
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,271
Yeah.

675
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,188
So, are you seeing anyone?

676
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,483
- [Hugh] Clara!
- Speaking of seeing...

677
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,193
[Clara] I'll be right back.

678
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,489
I would love for you to meet
my rock star manager Clara.

679
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,324
She is one of a kind.

680
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,909
- [male guest] Clara.
- Nice to meet you.

681
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,411
- Clara, nice to meet you.
- Are you having a great time?

682
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,623
[indistinct conversation]

683
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,460
I'll just gonna check in the kitchen,
and make sure everything is OK.

684
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,460
- Absolutely.
- Great. I'll be back.

685
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,179
And I'm an idiot.

686
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,777
Clara? [clears throat]

687
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,487
Yeah?

688
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,407
Do you mind if I just have a quick word?

689
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,244
I saw you at the Mountain View
this morning...

690
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,789
with those two girls that came in.

691
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,501
[laughs] No, no. OK, I don't know
what you think you saw,

692
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,003
- but it definitely wasn't--
- Hey,

693
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,922
- you don't need to explain yourself to me.
- No, no, I was just eating,

694
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,092
and they forced me to sit with them.
I didn't have a choice.

695
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,135
Yeah, you looked really trapped.

696
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,889
Argh. I don't--I don't want to fight.

697
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,393
I really just came over
to talk to you about the other night.

698
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:20,978
Please.

699
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,817
Thank you. I...

700
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,195
I wanted to talk to you about, um...

701
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,617
your car. Uh, has...

702
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,077
has the mechanic
gotten back to you at all?

703
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,916
Yeah. It was a problem
with the alternator.

704
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,585
- It'll be ready in a few days.
- OK, great.

705
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,382
Uh, I mean, not--not great.
But I was wondering

706
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,134
if--if you... needed a...

707
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,052
I was gonna offer to take you home

708
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,472
- after work tonight-- OK. Right.
- I'm good.

709
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:02,186
I guess Mr. Peters can give you
a ride home then?

710
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,356
- You know, Shane...
- Yeah?

711
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,152
However I decide to get to work,
whether I walk or take the bus,

712
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:11,320
or get a ride with Peters,

713
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,865
- is really none of your business.
- You know, I know, I know. You're right.

714
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,867
You're right-- right, of course.

715
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:20,288
Look. Please. This isn't... [chuckles]
this isn't how I saw this going.

716
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,998
I just...
Can you just let me explain

717
00:42:23,206 --> 00:42:24,791
why I got freaked out the other night?

718
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,755
That's not necessary
because you were pretty clear.

719
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,047
No, I wasn't. Look...

720
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,717
a celebrity chef isn't something
I ever saw myself becoming.

721
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,887
And I... I misjudged you rudely,

722
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,014
and I just really
would like to be able to...

723
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,016
explain myself properly.

724
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,144
Would you...

725
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,356
would you want--want to
come back to my place

726
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,900
after we're done here tonight?

727
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,487
Because you--you cooked for me. Right?

728
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,364
And it was--it was amazing.

729
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,824
And I would just like to return the favor.

730
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,331
I... I mean, eventually I'll have to,
it might not be tonight, or...

731
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,501
Please?

732
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,713
Yeah.

733
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:13,382
Sure.

734
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,885
Dinner would be great.

735
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,887
- Great.
- [Bonnie] Great.

736
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,434
I wasn't eavesdropping.

737
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,063
[both chuckle]

738
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:37,155
So, you, uh, you live in a resort?

739
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,532
- [laughs] Yeah.
- [Clara chuckles]

740
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:41,369
Uh, I mean, you know,
it's--it's only temporary.

741
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,121
It's not home or anything.

742
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,456
I do hear they have great room service.

743
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, do they?

744
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,295
I'm just kidding.

745
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,547
Everything looks and smells amazing.

746
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,007
Uh, can I help you with anything?

747
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,927
Actually I do have a job for you.
Two jobs.

748
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,847
Number one, is I want you to relax.

749
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,016
And number two is to enjoy yourself.

750
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:07,978
So, are you relaxed?

751
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,731
- Yes.
- [Hugh] Good.

752
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,943
And are you enjoying yourself?

753
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:16,862
I am.

754
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,659
- [Clara] Oh! Are you OK? [laughs]
- [Shane] Uh, OK.

755
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,411
And it's really hot. Actually, I'm just...

756
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:25,913
One second.

757
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,664
Gonna, um...

758
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,125
And...

759
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,543
I...

760
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,880
Anyway, I'm going to... I'll be back.

761
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,300
[chuckles]

762
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,081
What a view.

763
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:12,751
It is.

764
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:17,047
I was talking about the mountain.

765
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,217
And the snow.

766
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,969
And the Christmas lights.

767
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,347
I wasn't.

768
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,527
[breathless] Oh, boy.

769
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,905
Is that a good "Oh, boy"
or a bad "Oh, boy"?

770
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,952
It's just the last time we kissed...

771
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,164
[sighs]

772
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,085
I've been on exactly...

773
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,213
five dates.

774
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,385
Three terrible ones, one crazy,
and... [chuckles]

775
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,846
one more that lasted for eight years.

776
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:10,393
Wow! That is a long date.

777
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,606
You know, the show made me
kind of look a certain way.

778
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,652
But the truth is, I'm not.

779
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,947
I'm not that guy.
I'm not even close to that guy.

780
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:27,492
Uh, so, when I meet someone now,

781
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,786
they usually expect that person
that I'm not.

782
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:36,585
You know I'm not that person. Right?

783
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,045
I do.

784
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,427
That's exactly why I wanted you
to come up here.

785
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,054
Because I wanted to apologize.

786
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:50,432
For misjudging you.

787
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,527
You know, I didn't even like your show.

788
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,824
- Oh, come on.
- I only saw it twice and...

789
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,827
personally, I wanted the other guy to win.

790
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,121
Are you kidding?

791
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,250
That guy microwaved his steak.

792
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,085
Microwaved!

793
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,878
- What!?
- It's blasphemy!

794
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,572
So...

795
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,157
what brought you here, anyway?

796
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,702
I mean, it couldn't have just been
the job offer.

797
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,581
No, you're right, it wasn't.

798
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:02,463
When I finished the show,
I made myself a promise.

799
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,255
Hmm.

800
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,425
And being here is part of the promise?

801
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:07,760
Mm-hmm.

802
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,512
It is.

803
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,431
And how long do you plan on staying?

804
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,768
I mean, my contract's for six months.

805
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:18,269
But I am...

806
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,398
currently working on something
that might keep me here

807
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,902
a little bit longer. Mm-hmm. Maybe.
- Oh?

808
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,614
I still got to do
a little bit more research first.

809
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,492
Mm. Well, aren't you mysterious?

810
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:33,702
No.

811
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,623
I want to know more about you.

812
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,501
- Me.
- Mm-hmm.

813
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,628
Well, I mean, you already know about me.

814
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,384
I'm a recovering failure.

815
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,427
Failing doesn't mean you're a failure.

816
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,139
Unless you give up...

817
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:57,934
I don't think that's you.

818
00:48:59,061 --> 00:48:59,936
Mm-mmm.

819
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,396
- No?
- Mm-mmm.

820
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,190
So, who am I?

821
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:09,905
You are strong, determined.

822
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,284
You're definitely smart.

823
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:18,164
And you are... exceedingly beautiful.

824
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,166
[both chuckle]

825
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,626
Well, I mean,
feel free to go on. You're...

826
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,422
- spot on so far.
- Am I?

827
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:30,134
Oh, OK, all right. Um...

828
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,471
you want a place of your own.

829
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,893
You want to build it, and watch it grow.

830
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,438
If I had to guess,

831
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:45,440
I'd say that you are...

832
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,775
planning on opening your own place again.

833
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,360
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm?

834
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,282
Well, I mean, I've thought about it.

835
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,407
Ah-ha.

836
00:49:57,952 --> 00:49:59,038
Whatever it is...

837
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,583
you will do it.

838
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,628
And it's going to be yours.

839
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,005
And it's going to be great.

840
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,300
[chuckles]

841
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:16,347
Hey, you don't think it's gonna be
a problem with Mr. Peters

842
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:17,847
if you keep coming over here, do you?

843
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,643
Mr. Pete--
- Yeah.

844
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,561
- Like me and Peters?
- You and Hugh, yeah.

845
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,856
No, no, we're-- that's-- that's just...

846
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,567
- It's business.
- Oh, is it?

847
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,110
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah?

848
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,612
Are you working on something big?

849
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,742
Well, I mean, I promised
I wouldn't say anything.

850
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:40,079
Ah, well, aren't you the mysterious one.

851
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,539
Just a little.

852
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,423
["Sounds Like Christmas"
by Keith Cooper playing]

853
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,349
- Thank you.
- Here you go. Enjoy.

854
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,349
Thank you.

855
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,519
- You really like him, don't you?
- [Clara chuckles]

856
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:30,938
I think I do. Yeah.

857
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,195
OK. Well, when I first met Clive
I thought he was the most boring person

858
00:52:36,277 --> 00:52:37,237
in the entire world.

859
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,405
You know, I almost didn't go
on a second date with him.

860
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,034
But then I realized, after a while,

861
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,994
he wasn't boring at all.
He was just shy.

862
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:47,414
Of course, most city planners
are so boring.

863
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,748
[Clara] No.

864
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,585
- You don't say. [chuckles]
- [Bonnie] No, I--I do say.

865
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,213
But the fact is, Clive is the--
He just is the funniest,

866
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,215
most exciting city planner
I have ever met.

867
00:52:57,298 --> 00:53:00,260
And I feel really lucky
I gave him a chance.

868
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,096
I really like Clive.

869
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,472
Me too.

870
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,599
No, I know
Shane isn't a city planner or anything.

871
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,769
- But I guess famous chefs can be fun, too.
- [Clara chuckles]

872
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,065
Yeah, I guess they can.

873
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,528
Well, here's to chefs
and city planners.

874
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:25,202
You know the craziest thing?
Guess what he [stutters] ordered?

875
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,788
- What?
- Carrots.

876
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,748
Really? I thought he was gonna order
some kind of deer.

877
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,210
- I don't know...
- He would never!

878
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,920
- Clara?
- Yeah.

879
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,588
Can I see you in my office
for a minute, please?

880
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:37,588
Oh, yeah, sure.

881
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,387
Oh, oh. The principal's office.
Somebody's in trouble.

882
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,097
Oh, you didn't hear?

883
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,764
I am trouble.

884
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,476
Yes, you are!

885
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,231
Hey.

886
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,693
Shut the door if you don't mind
and have a seat.

887
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,277
[door closes]

888
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,742
I see that you've been spending
a lot of time with Shane lately.

889
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,289
Yes, my own personal time.

890
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,081
Is that a problem?

891
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,460
No, no, not per se.

892
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:18,797
I just-- I wonder if you've had enough
free time to work on our little proposal.

893
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,215
I mean, have you even spoken
to the Havens lately?

894
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,344
Yes, actually! Um, I see them
almost every day at breakfast.

895
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,514
Oh. OK. Um...

896
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,603
You know, I--I, uh...
I got you something.

897
00:54:35,646 --> 00:54:38,150
What? What is this?

898
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,027
It's just a little Christmas present.

899
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,487
Oh, Hugh.

900
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,032
I didn't get you anything.

901
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,326
Don't be silly. Just--just open it.

902
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:52,998
[Clara chuckles]

903
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,460
Wow. This is beautiful.

904
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,130
I don't know what to say.

905
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:02,965
Thank you.

906
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,010
You deserve it, Clara.

907
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,221
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

908
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,097
And if this deal goes through,
you can buy jewelry yourself

909
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,807
that'll make that look like a knock-off.

910
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,438
But... if you could encourage them,

911
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:18,773
maybe speed things up.

912
00:55:18,856 --> 00:55:21,108
I'd love to get the deal done
before the year end.

913
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,152
Before New Year’s?

914
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:26,239
Um...

915
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,286
Uh, I think they were kind of hoping
for a bit of time with this.

916
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,206
Ah.

917
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,960
All right. This, um,
this was supposed to be a surprise,

918
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,380
but I was hoping to close the deal
sooner because...

919
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,050
I have a project that I want
to send you to New York for.

920
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:47,302
New York?

921
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,681
Like you want me to oversee
another acquisition or...

922
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,559
Actually, I want to invest
in a new restaurant.

923
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,186
It would be yours. Ours.

924
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:58,855
But because I'm here
doing the Haven deal,

925
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:00,440
if we speed it up,

926
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,943
that would open up
the New York opportunity for you.

927
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,530
Yeah! Wow!

928
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:08,907
It's great.

929
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,621
You know what? Leave it to me.

930
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,458
They trust me and I think I can help
speed them along.

931
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,545
- I know you can.
- You can count on me.

932
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:25,257
Good. Uh, so?

933
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,260
Yeah, uh, the schedule.

934
00:56:28,342 --> 00:56:32,472
It's just Bonnie's Thursday,
we need to switch it...

935
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:48,739
- Oh, hi, there!
- Hi. Here.

936
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

937
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:57,956
So, I've been meaning to ask.

938
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,250
Um... what are you doing
for Christmas?

939
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,793
I don't know. I haven't, uh,

940
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,672
I haven't really thought about it.
I might--I might go back to the city.

941
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:07,548
Hmm.

942
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:09,175
Hmm-hmm.

943
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,010
Well, that makes sense.

944
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,221
I'm sure you probably want
to see your family.

945
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,764
[both chuckle]

946
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,893
Have you told me about your family yet?

947
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:21,021
You know, I don't think I have.

948
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:26,193
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- No. No, just me.

949
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,362
Oh, you're an only child.

950
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,570
[both chuckle]

951
00:57:29,695 --> 00:57:34,826
- Oh, now everything makes complete sense.
- What is that supposed to mean?

952
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:36,327
You mean I'm weird?

953
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,329
No, I'm just kidding.

954
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,125
But I suppose it's all the more reason

955
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,210
you should go home
and see your parents, right?

956
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:46,505
Yeah.

957
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,010
- What?
- I want to tell you something.

958
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,721
OK.

959
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,474
I'm not supposed to say
anything, but, um...

960
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,311
I'd really like to share this with you.

961
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:05,106
[stammers] I'm all ears.
I can keep a secret.

962
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,318
OK. So, you know the project
that Peters and I

963
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,612
- have been working on? Right?
- Hmm.

964
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,364
Well, it has to do with the Mountain View.

965
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,282
- Really?
- Yeah.

966
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,411
He wants to buy them out and renovate it

967
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,579
and turn it into this beautiful
upscale boutique hotel.

968
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,916
And, of course, we would keep
Jackie and Frank on,

969
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,460
but the best part is...
is I would be running it for six months.

970
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:28,255
OK.

971
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,800
No, this is more than OK.
I mean, this is huge for me.

972
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,677
I'd be overseeing everything.

973
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,722
And then today, he told me
that if I could speed this deal along,

974
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,849
he wants to send me to New York.

975
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,186
Yeah, but Peters got you involved

976
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,605
because of your connection
to the Havens, is that right?

977
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:52,903
Well, I'd like to think
it's because of my experience,

978
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,407
but, yeah,
the Havens are like family to me.

979
00:58:56,907 --> 00:58:57,992
They trust me.

980
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,454
Of course. Of course they trust you.

981
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,331
But do you trust Peters?

982
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,378
Why are you being so negative about this?

983
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:10,838
I thought you'd be happy for me.

984
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,257
No, no, no, it's not that
I'm not happy for you.

985
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,842
I'm happy for you. I'm just...

986
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:18,472
Look, when I first took the job here,
I made a couple of calls.

987
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,059
And Hugh doesn't exactly have

988
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,518
- the best reputation.
- [Clara scoffs]

989
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:25,186
What?

990
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,733
So, you can sign a big fat deal with him,
and I can't?

991
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:32,985
No, I just work for the guy.
All right? It's only temporary.

992
00:59:34,653 --> 00:59:36,572
[scoffs] I'm so glad I told you this.

993
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,367
Clara, I'm sorry. It's not...
it's not what I mean. I'm just saying...

994
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,663
that whatever he tells you
about this property

995
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:48,376
or anything, you--you can't just assume
it to be true, right?

996
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,045
You got to take it with a grain of salt.

997
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,128
[Clara sighs]

998
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,048
But did you ever think
maybe this is all happening

999
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,592
because I'm actually good at my job?

1000
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,592
[Shane] No, you are!

1001
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,344
You're most certainly good at your job,

1002
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,304
but I'm just saying
you might still have blinders on

1003
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:01,764
because of what happened
to you in Chicago.

1004
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,393
OK, I'm sorry. That's not...
that's not what I meant.

1005
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,146
What I meant to say is he might not be
being honest with you.

1006
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,606
And I just want to look out for you.

1007
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,108
OK?

1008
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,902
I told you this
because I was really excited.

1009
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,364
I don't need your approval.
I can take care of myself.

1010
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:20,449
Clara, listen! Clara! Please!

1011
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,159
Merry Christmas.

1012
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:52,023
[Lydia] Oh, she is just the cutest!

1013
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,608
Does she have her daddy's eyes or what?

1014
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,902
- [Darlene] Yes, she does.
- [Lydia and Barry laugh]

1015
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,947
I just want to say how thankful I am

1016
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,074
to have all of our loved ones
together for Christmas.

1017
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,367
Yes, baby.

1018
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,663
This was always
your father's favorite time of year,

1019
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,123
and not just because of the slopes!

1020
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:12,168
But nothing made him happier
than having us all together.

1021
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,380
Maybe next year we'll have a full house.
Right, Clara?

1022
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:18,842
[all laugh]

1023
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,010
I'm kidding.

1024
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,677
To family.

1025
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,387
[all] To family!

1026
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,472
[Lydia] Cheers!

1027
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,231
Darlene, would you lead us in prayer?

1028
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,608
- I'd love to.
- OK.

1029
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,737
Dear Lord,
thank you for bringing us together

1030
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,778
during this special time.

1031
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,072
For blessing us
with all this delicious food

1032
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,326
to nourish our bodies.
In the Lord's name,

1033
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,827
- Amen.
- [all] Amen!

1034
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:46,869
[Lydia] Thank you, darling.

1035
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,371
All right, let's dig in.

1036
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,706
Barry, would you do us the honors?

1037
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:51,916
- Yes, I would.
- [Lydia] Thank you.

1038
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,545
[Lydia coddles, chuckles]

1039
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:57,213
[Lydia] So, Darlene,

1040
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,797
any exciting new cases?

1041
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,300
I just started a new case.
It's been very busy. Yes.

1042
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,429
So, I can't say too much about it
right now, but, yeah.

1043
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,222
[Lydia] And where are my pictures
of the baby?

1044
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,516
[Darlene] We--We have one for you.
Don't you worry.

1045
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,894
Yeah. We got lots of photos.
So, yeah.

1046
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,438
- It's good.
- [Lydia] I'm so proud of you.

1047
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:23,657
[Lydia] Oh,
I really outdid myself this year.

1048
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:25,699
- [Clara] You did!
- [Lydia laughs]

1049
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,452
Lydia, I've been meaning to ask.
How did your photo shoot go

1050
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,871
- for your gingerbread house?
- Ah, it was for <i>Seasons Magazine.</i>

1051
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,916
It went amazing, you know.

1052
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:35,001
Personally,
I think I should be on the cover!

1053
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,585
[all laugh]

1054
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,170
Or at least like a two-page spread.

1055
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:39,172
- [Barry] Yeah.
- Centerfold.

1056
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,840
- [Barry] Yeah.
- [Clara] You know what, I'm just gonna...

1057
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,594
I'm just going to clear this
out of the way for everyone.

1058
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:46,137
- [Lydia] Thank you, Clara.
- Thanks.

1059
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,097
- Yeah. Excuse me, Barry.
- Mm-hmm.

1060
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,559
So, um, how are things at work?

1061
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:55,021
- [Barry] Oh, it's going really well.
- [Lydia] Really well? Good. Yeah.

1062
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,440
[chatting continues]

1063
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,032
[phone rings]

1064
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:13,164
Well, hello, Clara!
Merry Christmas Eve.

1065
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,498
Clive says hi.

1066
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:15,875
- Clive! Say hi!
- Hi.

1067
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,751
Hi, Clive.

1068
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:20,255
[Bonnie] OK, s <i>o, how was the meal?</i>
<i>How's the family?</i>

1069
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:22,298
You know.

1070
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,967
My favorite couple doing so well.

1071
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,302
It's, uh...

1072
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:30,389
amazing, and it's absolutely killing me.
[chuckles]

1073
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,474
Do you want to meet for a drink?

1074
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,268
Uh, yeah, of course.

1075
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:36,688
Well, let me just check with Clive.

1076
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,065
Is it OK if I meet Clara for a drink?

1077
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,858
- Yup.
- Clive says yup.

1078
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:44,362
OK, great. I'll meet you--
I'll meet you there.

1079
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,447
OK. Bye.

1080
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,492
Thanks, babe. See you later.

1081
01:03:54,371 --> 01:03:55,331
[sighs]

1082
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,376
- Hey, honey. Everything OK?
- Hey.

1083
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,338
Yeah. Everything's fine.

1084
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,423
Mom, do you think, um...

1085
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,675
It'd be OK for you
to go have a drink with Bonnie?

1086
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:09,219
- Yeah.
- [laughs] Sure.

1087
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:10,929
Thank you.

1088
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,434
You know, honey, things can change

1089
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,230
from one Christmas to the next.
I'm just saying. [chuckles]

1090
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,317
Thank you, Mom.

1091
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:23,735
You're welcome.

1092
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,820
[Clara sighs]

1093
01:04:29,114 --> 01:04:30,115
Now, go have fun.

1094
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:32,994
- OK. I'll see you after.
- [Lydia chuckles]

1095
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,460
- [hostess] Hi.
- Hey.

1096
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:42,420
How are you doing?

1097
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,306
[Bonnie] Thanks for the drink!

1098
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:55,641
[Clara] No problem.

1099
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,684
[laughs]

1100
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,188
Thank you for coming.

1101
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,817
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1102
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:06,777
- Hey, Mike!
- [Mike] Yeah?

1103
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,655
- How about a couple of drinks?
- [Mike] Sure, no problem.

1104
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,324
Christmas... can be a difficult time.

1105
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,619
[Mike] Yeah. Here you go.

1106
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,163
- Thanks, Mike.
- [Mike] You're welcome.

1107
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,501
To best friends and better days.

1108
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,086
- Cheers.
- [glasses clinking]

1109
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:33,637
It's just like everyone
was so... happy.

1110
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,474
My sister with her perfect husband,

1111
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,643
and he's just equally happy with her.

1112
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,019
And they're both incredibly happy
with their child.

1113
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,230
I mean, it was just...

1114
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:44,858
I'm telling you, Bonnie, it was horrible!

1115
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,110
I'm really sorry to hear
about all that happiness.

1116
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:50,070
- That sucks.
- Right?

1117
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,786
Well, I'm afraid
I have some happy news?

1118
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,163
What?

1119
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,668
[Bonnie] I'm engaged!

1120
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,507
- [gasps] Oh, Bonnie!
- [Bonnie giggles]

1121
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,635
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

1122
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,722
- Oh, you're crying?
- No.

1123
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,224
Of course not. I'm not. I'm not.

1124
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,559
- You are.
- No, I'm-- They're happy tears.

1125
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,519
- They're, uh...
- They don't look happy.

1126
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,148
They're happy. I'm happy.
I'm so happy for you!

1127
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,233
When are you gonna do it?

1128
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,320
I don't know. Maybe in the spring.

1129
01:06:30,402 --> 01:06:32,947
Or... [scoffs] a few years from now.

1130
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,532
It depends on how long it takes me
to make my own dress.

1131
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,452
I don't even know how to sew.

1132
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,458
My best friend is getting married.

1133
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,251
To a terrific Clive.

1134
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,007
And I've fallen for a guy

1135
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:55,677
who may not be that guy.
Or he may be that guy

1136
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,096
and I just wrecked everything,

1137
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,099
and I may never even see that guy again.

1138
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,101
Except at work.

1139
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,603
At the restaurant.

1140
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,440
And just five days a week.

1141
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,858
More with overtime.

1142
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:14,614
Yeah. [sighs]
I'm-- I'm going to quit my job.

1143
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,407
[Bonnie] Well, that's a great idea.

1144
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:20,452
[cell phone rings]

1145
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,583
Hey, Hugh.
How's... how's your Christmas?

1146
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,710
- [children giggling]
- No, the ex-wife dropped off the kids,

1147
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,922
unannounced, and I'm just trying
to get some work done.

1148
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,259
Oh, that... sounds... fun!

1149
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,844
Uh, look. I need you to go to the office

1150
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:38,387
and pick up something for me, please.

1151
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,389
Uh, yeah, sure. No problem.

1152
01:07:40,472 --> 01:07:43,726
I am totally capable
of doing that right now.

1153
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:47,605
Good. There are documents
in a manila envelope on my desk.

1154
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,356
I'd get them myself, but I'm stuck here.

1155
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,568
Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem.
I'll... I'll pick them up

1156
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,318
and swing by first thing in the morning.

1157
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,862
- See you then.
- Yes, you will!

1158
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,114
No, no, no. No more cookies.

1159
01:07:57,197 --> 01:07:58,074
- No, that’s enough.
- [children continue giggling]

1160
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,284
I gotta go. I got to parent here.

1161
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:04,079
- No, seriously. That's five. We're done.
- [children giggling]

1162
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,418
What was that about?

1163
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,253
It's a secret!

1164
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:12,922
I get told secrets now. No big deal.

1165
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,259
Well, you can tell me, too!

1166
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,427
Peters just left some paperwork

1167
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,054
at the restaurant
that I have to go pick up.

1168
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:22,599
Well, I am in!

1169
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:24,559
Well...

1170
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,060
This is my fourth glass,
so, I can't drive.

1171
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,145
- [Clara chuckles]
- Ah!

1172
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,773
I'll get Clive to drive!

1173
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,773
Clive, this is where I work.

1174
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,782
- All right. Come on in.
- [Bonnie] Whoa!

1175
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:21,908
Hugh's office.

1176
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,409
Really nice. I like it.

1177
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,704
OK, what are we looking for again?

1178
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,667
A yellow envelope. Like this.

1179
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,503
[cabinet drawer clunking]

1180
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:38,173
Honey, I... I think that might be locked.

1181
01:09:38,256 --> 01:09:39,591
No, it's just stuck.

1182
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,802
B-Bonnie, I...

1183
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,306
- See!
- [Clara] Bonnie, I...

1184
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:47,809
I got it.

1185
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,476
Me too!

1186
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:52,270
I probably think it's this one
that was on his desk

1187
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,189
exactly where he told me
it was gonna be.

1188
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:57,443
Well, this is yellow as well,
so, I think it deserves a look.

1189
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,655
This is a...
Oh, this is Shane's contract.

1190
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:05,702
That's a lot of zeros.

1191
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,912
This one's just a lot of parking lots.

1192
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:11,707
What?

1193
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,418
- Pretty boring!
- [Clara] Oh...

1194
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:17,671
Oh, no, no.
This is, uh... this is just our, uh...

1195
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,048
What?

1196
01:10:22,342 --> 01:10:23,636
You've got to be kidding me.

1197
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,680
What? Is it about me?

1198
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,140
Clive, you're a city planner, right?

1199
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,059
Correct. Why?

1200
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,688
Because we need to go to your office.

1201
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,983
- Yay! Oh, my gosh.
- No, no, no.

1202
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:38,067
- Yes!
- We don't do that.

1203
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,359
- Oh, we're going!
- Or-- You know what?

1204
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,113
- [Jackie] Aw.
- [Frank] Here.

1205
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:44,698
Ah, you know, we forgot
to share the mistletoe.

1206
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,493
That's because
we don't need any mistletoe.

1207
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,869
- [Frank] Hmm. We don't.
- [knocking at the door]

1208
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:49,787
Shoot. Who's it?

1209
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,373
[Frank] Hey! Look who came in

1210
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:55,917
- from the cold. Come here!
- [Jackie] Merry Christmas, Shane!

1211
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:56,918
[Shane] Merry Christmas.

1212
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,546
[Jackie] Aw! Oh!

1213
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:02,048
- I'm not intruding at all, am I?
- No, of course not.

1214
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,342
Absolutely not! You know
we love guests at Christmas.

1215
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,095
OK.

1216
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,349
Oh! You look like you could use
something to eat.

1217
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:14,479
How about I make you a nice sandwich,
or Frank can make you a drink?

1218
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,483
I'd love a sandwich.

1219
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:20,234
OK, you got it.

1220
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:22,987
- Thanks, honey.
- Thanks, Jackie.

1221
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,032
Come on. Take your jacket off.
Make yourself at home.

1222
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,618
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

1223
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:32,537
[indistinct conversation]

1224
01:11:32,704 --> 01:11:34,247
- [Clara] Bonnie!
- This is great.

1225
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,833
This is so exciting!

1226
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,252
[Clive] I don't know why I'm doing this.

1227
01:11:38,543 --> 01:11:39,796
- This is insane.
- Come on. Please, Clive.

1228
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:42,631
You're doing it because
it's an exciting secret mission.

1229
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,966
And because you love me.

1230
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,177
Get in. Get in. Quietly.

1231
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:48,845
[inaudible]

1232
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:58,980
- But we love him.
- Yeah.

1233
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:02,693
When I first came here,

1234
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,737
I didn't--I didn't tell you guys
what I was looking for.

1235
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,154
And I didn't... didn't show you this.

1236
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:09,867
Aw.

1237
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,743
[Shane] That's my parents
on their honeymoon.

1238
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,748
Yeah, that picture hung up in our kitchen
for as long as I can remember.

1239
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,210
They never really said where they took it,

1240
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:21,503
and I didn't really ask
because I was a kid.

1241
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,548
But they said it was somewhere
in the American mountainside,

1242
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,760
and that one day they'd...
they'd visit again.

1243
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,637
But--But they--they never did.

1244
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:34,516
And you think they stayed here?

1245
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,143
[Shane] I don't know.

1246
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,229
I don't know. I kind of...

1247
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:40,398
You know, I've been ruling out
some of the other places in the area,

1248
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,527
but most of them have been
torn down or long closed.

1249
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:49,614
Yeah. I'm so sorry.
I don't recognize them at all.

1250
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,661
Of course, this doesn't mean anything
because when this photo was taken

1251
01:12:53,743 --> 01:12:55,371
my parents would've been
running the place,

1252
01:12:55,453 --> 01:12:56,956
and I would've just been a little kid.

1253
01:12:57,038 --> 01:12:59,625
- But, honey, I do recognize that cushion.
- Hmm.

1254
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,918
Yeah, yeah.
That's--That's the one right over there.

1255
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:04,838
Yeah, but the trouble is these cushions
are all over the place, you know.

1256
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,091
Right.

1257
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,676
I--I don't know if it helps,
but on the back

1258
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,012
- is a... a date stamped there.
- Hmm.

1259
01:13:12,345 --> 01:13:14,765
- Oh, in the 80's.
- Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1260
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:18,269
You see, we had a fire here in '92,

1261
01:13:18,935 --> 01:13:20,854
and it destroyed almost all the records.

1262
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,983
Otherwise, we could've looked up
their names in the log book.

1263
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,694
[Shane] Right. Yeah, I was...

1264
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:30,030
I was just hoping to find
that ornament, but...

1265
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,699
if it were here, you guys probably...

1266
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,784
probably auctioned it off anyways.

1267
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:35,744
[Frank] Yeah.

1268
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:36,746
[Jackie] Whoa!

1269
01:13:37,954 --> 01:13:40,957
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1270
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,920
Wait. Here, check this out.
Here, take this. Take this.

1271
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:44,962
OK.

1272
01:13:50,216 --> 01:13:51,469
Oh, there's no way.

1273
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,079
I thought you guys would've...

1274
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:20,997
I thought...

1275
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,710
I thought you guys would've sold these.

1276
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:28,463
Well... yes, we would've,
but not that one.

1277
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,298
That one is special.

1278
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,511
That one my mother made the year
they built this place.

1279
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:37,264
And every Christmas Eve we have
our guests put it on the tree.

1280
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:41,476
So, if your parents stayed here
over Christmas...

1281
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:45,730
they would've been asked
to do the honors.

1282
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,608
It's our way of making our guests

1283
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,443
feel like they're family
at Christmas time.

1284
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,283
[sobs]

1285
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:00,954
So, they were here.

1286
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,666
They were here.

1287
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,836
[Frank] So, Shane...

1288
01:15:08,628 --> 01:15:10,922
would you like to do the honors?

1289
01:15:18,471 --> 01:15:19,515
You know, I...

1290
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:24,353
I'd actually like to share this
with someone.

1291
01:15:24,936 --> 01:15:26,021
If that's OK.

1292
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,488
[voice breaking] Thank you for this.

1293
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,792
Did you find it yet?

1294
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,252
I literally just started looking!

1295
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,172
It's, uh... Peters. Hugh Peters.
- [Bonnie scoffs]

1296
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:55,176
- [Bonnie] Hugh.
- Oh. OK, here it is.

1297
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,470
It looks like he's made
some exploratory proposals.

1298
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,015
What?

1299
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,018
[Bonnie] What is it?

1300
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:08,980
It's just a bunch of condos,
or parking lots, and...

1301
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,815
Wait, this is not what we talked about.

1302
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,318
- I don't understand what this is.
- [Clive] Let me take these

1303
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,277
and make a copy.

1304
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,569
You can read them in the morning, Clara.

1305
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,529
And then you are gonna destroy them.

1306
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,990
And then we'll pretend
that this never happened. OK?

1307
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,659
OK.

1308
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,496
- All right.
- [Clara] Thank you.

1309
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,875
I love you guys! Bonnie and Clive!

1310
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:28,876
[all chuckle]

1311
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:32,171
- We're criminals!
- [Clive] Oh, heaven help me.

1312
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:33,213
[all chuckle]

1313
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,104
[Lydia humming a Christmas song]

1314
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,277
Oh, Merry Christmas, sunshine.

1315
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,238
Merry Christmas, Mom. Thank you.

1316
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,699
Oh. Someone had
a little bit too much fun last night.

1317
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:02,868
Mm-hmm.

1318
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:03,993
[Lydia chuckles]

1319
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:08,957
[sighs]

1320
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:13,587
Where'd you find these?

1321
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,421
They were scattered in the foyer.

1322
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:21,554
I--

1323
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,306
[Lydia continues humming]

1324
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,769
I can't believe he did this.

1325
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,189
How about a bagel and lox?

1326
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,153
A Bloody Mary?

1327
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,533
[Clara] Mom, I'm so sorry.

1328
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,911
I promise I'll be back, OK?
I just have to do something.

1329
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,037
No breakfast?

1330
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,960
[car approaching]

1331
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,237
[knocking on door]

1332
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,613
[Hugh] Yeah, I'm coming!

1333
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:29,997
Clara.

1334
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,167
- Did you get the folder?
- Oh, you mean Shane's contract? Yes.

1335
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,460
Thanks. I have to get these off
this morning.

1336
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:35,502
And there's this!

1337
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,463
You don't want to renovate
the Mountain View.

1338
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:40,757
You don't want to "restore it
to its former glory".

1339
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:41,884
You want to tear it down

1340
01:18:42,091 --> 01:18:44,511
for condos, and concessions
and parking lots!

1341
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,721
[Hugh] These are just
exploratory proposals.

1342
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,307
Where did you get these?

1343
01:18:49,515 --> 01:18:51,935
You used me
to get to Frank and Jackie.

1344
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:53,645
[Hugh] And you couldn't even
get that done.

1345
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,774
They called me this morning
to tell me that the deal is dead.

1346
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,277
Yeah, it turns out your boyfriend Shane
convinced them to shut it down.

1347
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,070
I never should've trusted that guy.

1348
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,239
He's not my boyfriend.
And Shane's in New York.

1349
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,240
[Hugh snickers]

1350
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,492
Is that--Is that what he said?

1351
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:10,453
Yeah, it looks like Santa's flying past
both of our houses this Christmas.

1352
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,832
Yeah, well, you can take
your stupid necklace back, too.

1353
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,212
I hope you realize you're fired!

1354
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,090
Oh, I quit!

1355
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,685
[engine turning over]

1356
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:41,694
Come on!

1357
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:43,487
- [knocking on the car]
- What?

1358
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,697
[Shane] Merry Christmas.

1359
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,783
Can I give you a ride?

1360
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:53,622
[chuckles] Come on.

1361
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,296
[railroad crossing
bells blaring]

1362
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,220
[train whistling in the distance]

1363
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,807
- [Shane] It's a long train.
- [sighs]

1364
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,810
How did you even find me?

1365
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,898
I went to your mother's house.

1366
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,153
Well, she told me
that you were at Bonnie and Clive's.

1367
01:20:24,235 --> 01:20:25,945
And so I went there and, um...

1368
01:20:26,904 --> 01:20:29,283
I mean, they told me about
your little crime spree last night.

1369
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,536
And then I kind of figured out
where you might be headed.

1370
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:34,787
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

1371
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,832
but I went to the office,
there were two envelopes and--

1372
01:20:36,914 --> 01:20:38,375
[Shane] I didn't come here for the job.

1373
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,380
I came here because
I was looking for something,

1374
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,131
that promise that I made to myself.

1375
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:48,301
And that's why I went
to the Mountain View.

1376
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,721
And that's why I was there last night.

1377
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:04,359
These are my parents.

1378
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:13,243
Their honeymoon was the one and only
vacation that they ever took.

1379
01:21:16,704 --> 01:21:18,623
You know, they lived in New York City,
and they could...

1380
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,167
they could barely make ends meet, so...

1381
01:21:23,002 --> 01:21:24,296
it was really difficult for them.

1382
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,925
My father was a cook at a greasy spoon.

1383
01:21:28,007 --> 01:21:29,217
My mother was a server.

1384
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,095
And as a kid I saw...

1385
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:36,766
I saw how hard they struggled
in their careers, you know.

1386
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,395
[chuckles] But I guess that's...

1387
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,231
that's where I developed
my love for cooking.

1388
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:50,279
When I started to get successful
I promised them that I'd slow down

1389
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,908
and find myself a beautiful little spot

1390
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,952
like the one
that started them off so right.

1391
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,247
But I--I didn't.

1392
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,503
Three years ago,
my mother died of cancer.

1393
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:11,385
Another year later, my father suffered
a massive heart attack.

1394
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,934
So, here I am... [sighs]
three years too late,

1395
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,979
trying to make good
on a promise to a family

1396
01:22:22,061 --> 01:22:23,771
that I didn't even deserve.

1397
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,693
You know any family
would be lucky to have you.

1398
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:32,029
That's really sweet.

1399
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,537
Now, come on.
I want to show you something.

1400
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,011
[geese honking in the distance]

1401
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:18,784
[Shane] Come on in.

1402
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:21,913
[both] Merry Christmas!

1403
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,542
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1404
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,170
Dinner will be served
in the main dining room

1405
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:29,337
in a few minutes.

1406
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:42,643
I would actually like to give you
your Christmas present.

1407
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:55,988
It's just like the picture.

1408
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,283
Mm-hmm.
Well, would you do the honors?

1409
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:01,787
Please?

1410
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:17,344
[Frank] Gotcha!

1411
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:28,104
That's the most thoughtful gift
anyone could ever give me.

1412
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,730
Oh, that's not your gift.

1413
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,484
- What?
- No, no. This is your gift.

1414
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,786
It took me a long time to figure out

1415
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:44,704
what I wanted to do
for the rest of my life.

1416
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:49,835
But when the picture
brought me to you...

1417
01:24:51,627 --> 01:24:56,007
I knew that this... [chuckles]
this was the right choice.

1418
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,854
Jackie and Frank
have agreed to sell their hotel.

1419
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,231
But only to you.

1420
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,654
Shane, I can't afford that.

1421
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:20,032
I want to invest...

1422
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,493
solely in your business, Clara...

1423
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:26,954
because you deserve it.

1424
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:30,458
You can fix this place up

1425
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,170
any way you want.

1426
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:36,297
Jackie and Frank have agreed

1427
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:38,591
to stick around and work for you.

1428
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,302
I mean, I'd like to hand in my resume

1429
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,387
for the head chef, of course,
and do all the cooking...

1430
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,309
minus the Eggs Florentine.

1431
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:53,105
But you don't have to hire me.

1432
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,943
You don't have to do anything
you don't want...

1433
01:26:00,404 --> 01:26:01,657
because it's all yours.

1434
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:09,706
Can it be ours?

1435
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:19,298
I love you.

1436
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,301
I love you.

1437
01:26:40,444 --> 01:26:41,279
You should know...

1438
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:43,989
I just got you a scarf.

1439
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:46,784
[laughing] That's just what I wanted.

1440
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,085
Merry Christmas.

1441
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:58,630
Merry Christmas.

1442
01:27:05,177 --> 01:27:07,514
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

So, my friend Mario
is a liftie over at the gondola.

1446
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,154
And he says he could sneak us
up the mountain for a late night ski.

1447
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,654
You want to go?

1448
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:27,701
You mean another exciting mission? Yes!

1449

- See! I knew you weren't boring.
- [Clive chuckles]

1450

All right! Let's go do this.

- Now? Oh, OK!
- Right now! Right now!

She loves it.

1456

There you are.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

1457
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,018
I've been watching your show.

1458
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:57,898
Uh, Ms. Garrison,
I'm gonna have to explain.

1459
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,859
Uh, you see on the show,
we have these personas.

1460
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,610
- [baby murmuring]
- Yeah, he's not actually that bad.

1461
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:03,819
Yeah. I'm really not.

1462
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:06,948
Uh, Clara, I know that
he's playing a character. [chuckles]

1463
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:08,240
And your brilliant, OK.

1464
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:09,576
- [exhales]
- That's exactly why I want

1465
01:28:09,658 --> 01:28:10,659
to pick your brain.

1466
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:14,288
See, I've been thinking
about branding myself

1467
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:16,917
in the gourmet gingerbread
market. Mm-hmm.

1468
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,585
- [Shane] Oh! Uh...
- Yeah!

1469
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:22,506
Uh, yeah, listen, I have like three
or four contacts in that market.

1470
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:24,507
Really? I was featured
in <i>Seasons Magazine.</i>

1471
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:25,466
Oh, is that right?

1472
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,345
- She tells everyone!
- I should've been on the cover.

1473
01:28:28,552 --> 01:28:31,597
But, you know, it was like
a two-page spread. It was great!

1474
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,557
I will be right back, I've got a copy.

1475
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,519
Matter of fact,
I'm going to autograph it for you.

1476
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,270
- [stutters] I'll cheers to that!
- All right. Cheers!
