1
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,116
- Okay. Are we doing...
- Hi.

2
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,851
- How are you?
- I'm not comin' out there.

3
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,055
It's only a day and a half of work,
and you gonna be making $150.

4
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,658
- I look like a damn fool.
- I'm gonna come in.

5
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,429
Okay. One, two, thre...

6
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,496
You better stop it.

7
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,766
Eileen, you come in on three.
You don't say, "One, two," and come in.

8
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:08,400
You say, "Three." Then you come in.

9
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:13,206
Look at you. You are
dressed for success.

10
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,307
I look like the whole
damn red-light district.

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,644
I ain't had nothing like this
on since I was on that pole.

12
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:21,814
Ooh. Well, just think of this as
another pole. The North Pole.

13
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,615
They don't make it
rain at the North Pole.

14
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,518
At my age, I can't
get no rain nowhere.

15
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:27,998
I get a little drizzle,
but them quarters hurt.

16
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:32,625
No, no, no. Well, this is beautiful.

17
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,962
Just think of this as a little
extra money for you and Cora.

18
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,764
Honey, I don't buy Cora
nothing for Christmas.

19
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,665
I ain't bought her nothing
since she was seven years old.

20
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,100
- You're kidding.
- That's right.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,037
Cora asked me for some money
for some dolls named Starz.

22
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,972
I couldn't afford it.
She just wanted them Starz.

23
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,040
So all day Christmas,
she made me feel bad.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,377
That night, Christmas dinner,
she's still sitting at the table crying.

25
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,013
I knocked the hell out of her.
You know what happened?

26
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,682
She saw stars. And she never
asked me for another gift.

27
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,984
- You are dreadful. Yes, you are.
- The truth.

28
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,819
- I can't do this, Eileen.
- Yes, you can. Stop.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,388
- Now, just smile.
- Okay. I'm smiling.

30
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,456
Now, you should see...
Come over here.

31
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,025
I gotta take you where you working.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,429
You should see the lovely gifts
I bought for my daughter.

33
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,865
- How she doing?
- Oh, she is excellent.

34
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,033
You know she went to New
York to get a degree...

35
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,871
got her master's and up and
moved to Alabama of all places.

36
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,573
- What the hell she move to Alabama for?
- Who knows.

37
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,877
Anyway, she took a little job there in
some little, small school, you know.

38
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,717
She says she wants to start a farm.

39
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:32,685
- A farm? What she starting a farm for?
- I don't know. I don't know.

40
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:36,222
But anyway, you know she got
tons of offers down here in Atlanta.

41
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,957
But she didn't want to,
so what can you do?

42
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,661
- Maybe she's trying to get away from you.
- You better stop that.

43
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,530
- Where we going?
- My daughter loves me.

44
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,735
Round yon Virgin Mother...

45
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,449
- Was that you singing?
- No, ma'am.

46
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,075
There's no one else in there,
Bailey McCoy.

47
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,012
Come on. Walk with me.
You're late again.

48
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,379
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,715
- I'm gonna have to talk to your parents.
- No.

50
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:06,318
I just woke up late.
I'll be here on time. I promise.

51
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,887
Budget cuts, budget cuts.

52
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:10,090
All right. Go on in class.

53
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,092
- We'll talk about this later. Okay?
- Okay.

54
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,431
And your singing.

55
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,175
I'm not gonna come in
here and listen to this.

56
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,510
All right, people!

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,908
Now, we may have to cancel
the Christmas Jubilee this year.

58
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,545
- No way!
- We don't have the budget!

59
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,480
Mayor, you hold on right there.

60
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,483
All right? Now, I grew
"poinsetters" for this.

61
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:37,884
Poinsettias.

62
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,687
- That's what I said.
- No, you didn't.

63
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,454
If this Christmas
Jubilee don't happen...

64
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,356
what am I gonna do with
all them "poinsetters"?

65
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,759
- Poinsettias.
- Stop. Do I look stupid?

66
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,760
- Tanner, I understand.
- No, sir...

67
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,963
with all due respect,
I don't think you do.

68
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,765
Since they built that dam upriver,
we've been barely surviving.

69
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,069
Between that and the drought...

70
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,103
managed to put most of
our crops out of business.

71
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,105
We need this Christmas Jubilee
to happen. You hear me?

72
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,143
We don't have the money.
I talked to the city council, didn't I?

73
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,411
You did, Your Honor.
He talked to him. I heard him.

74
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,848
- Take it out of the school.
- Hold on, Tanner McCoy.

75
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,084
We've already cut
the school's budget...

76
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,652
and as principal,
I have to draw the line.

77
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,488
We have four teachers
teaching several classes.

78
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,692
If we cut back more, we'll not be
able to finish the school year.

79
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,562
I don't care.
Somebody has to do something.

80
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,531
We have to have this
Christmas Jubilee.

81
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,268
It helps too many people around here
make enough money just to stay open.

82
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,302
We don't have the budget!

83
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,144
When we elected you as mayor,
you said you would help us!

84
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,976
I know. I'm sorry.

85
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:41,980
Folks around here don't take too kindly
to politicians not keeping their word.

86
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,957
You keep putting all these good people
against the wall and see what happens.

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,189
Come on, fellas. Geez.

88
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,369
- This is ridiculous.
- Absolutely.

89
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,242
- You believe that guy?
- That was unpleasant.

90
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,266
Yes, it was.

91
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,067
- This is where you'll be working.
- Okay.

92
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,002
Okay? Have you ever
done sales before?

93
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,874
- Yes, I sold trees.
- Christmas trees?

94
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,942
When you smoke 'em, they make
you feel like it's Christmas.

95
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,011
If you don't stop that nasty talk.

96
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,180
Stop it. I mean,
where goods were exchanged.

97
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,281
I was exchanging my
goodies back in the day.

98
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,817
Yes, indeed.

99
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,997
- I got to bring...
- On the black market.

100
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,624
- I got to bring you back to church.
- You ain't bringing me to no church.

101
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:27,060
I ain't goin' to no church.
The devil is a lie.

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,194
- And you still married to him.
- Honey, honey...

103
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,264
- Speak of the devil, listen. Listen.
- What, what, what?

104
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,499
- Y'all want me to work the register?
- No, no.

105
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,067
- Other people take...
- You sure?

106
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,970
You have to be bonded for that job.

107
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,971
If I took the register,
I'd be bonded out.

108
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,840
Okay. Yeah. No, no, no, no.

109
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,744
Listen, let's go over a little quick
review of what you're supposed to do.

110
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,646
- You teach me.
- You're supposed to direct the customers...

111
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,582
when they ask you for something,
and you can refer to this.

112
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,851
Okay? Now,
kitchenware is on the fifth floor.

113
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:54,420
- Kitchenware, fifth floor.
- Yes.

114
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,422
- Women's apparel is on the second...
- Y'all sell pears?

115
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,391
Y'all got produce up there?

116
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,994
- Clothing. Women's clothing.
- Say, "Clothing." Don't say, "A pears."

117
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,829
I don't know what
"apparels" is. "A pears."

118
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,130
Okay. Young adults
is on the third floor.

119
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,002
- Young adults on the third floor.
- Makeup and perfume is here.

120
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,603
And over there across the hall.

121
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,939
- I get it. I'll be fine.
- All right, and listen.

122
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,774
Most important,
everybody gets the same greeting.

123
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,043
When they come in,
you look them in the face...

124
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,880
you smile pretty and you say,
"Merry Christmas.

125
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,250
It's a beautiful day at Tifton's.

126
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,754
Joy to you and yours.
Yes, may I help you?"

127
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,656
That what I say?
Fine. I will say that.

128
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,024
- You wanna go over it once?
- All right.

129
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,927
- Here's a customer. Okay.
- Can you help me?

130
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:36,663
- Yes. Merry...
- Yes.

131
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,331
Mary had a little...

132
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,399
- No, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

133
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,569
- It's a beautiful day at Tip...
- Tifton's.

134
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:45,904
- Tap... Tip... Tiptoes.
- Joy to you.

135
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:48,608
Joy to the world and the Lord
is come, and happy Easter.

136
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,177
What can... What can I
do for you at Tifton's?

137
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,356
Thank you. I'm looking
for women's lingerie.

138
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,581
Honey? Who the lingerie for?

139
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,420
For me, of course.

140
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,788
I don't know about you
wearing the lingeries.

141
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,290
Those days are over, honey.
Somebody should've told you it's passed.

142
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,161
The lingeries is for young
people with tight, firm stuff.

143
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,629
What I would suggest you do, hunty...

144
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,499
I would suggest you walk
across the street to Target...

145
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,237
and ask them for some of those
really nice big, big-girl drawers...

146
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,238
so that you will be comfortable.

147
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:22,274
You don't wanna walk around
with a slingshot up your butt.

148
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,875
- Eileen!
- Come, come, come.

149
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,444
Come. Let me help you.

150
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,346
- You are so rude!
- She's something.

151
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,483
No, you are the one that's rude
anytime you bring lingerie to a man.

152
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,586
Who was the 37th president
of the United States?

153
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,266
I know.

154
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:41,637
Bailey, do you know?

155
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,731
I know the answer.

156
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,901
I didn't ask you. I asked Bailey.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,271
He don't know. He's always dirty.

158
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,807
And he's just a farm boy.

159
00:07:54,906 --> 00:08:00,245
Yes, but he's the only one to get
an A on all three of his last tests.

160
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,648
What did you get, Lucy?

161
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,250
Or you, Larry?

162
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,759
There will be no
bullying in this class.

163
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,757
I'll see you all tomorrow.
Do your homework.

164
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,358
Look over the list of songs
for the Christmas Jubilee.

165
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,362
Christmas is five days away.

166
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,507
Hold on a second, Bailey.

167
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,774
You gotta start speaking up
and participating in class.

168
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,608
I know you knew the answer.

169
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,010
You're are so smart and talented.

170
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,215
You get an A on every test.
You gotta believe in yourself.

171
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,884
Lucy's right.
I'm just an old farm boy.

172
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,655
There is no such thing
as "just a farm boy."

173
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:47,065
You are smart. You can
be anything you want.

174
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,730
I can only imagine if you could
just stay awake in class.

175
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,466
- Are you up late at night?
- No, ma'am.

176
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,205
I want you to sing the lead
solo at the Christmas Jubilee.

177
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,072
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

178
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,582
- Yes, you can.
- No.

179
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,650
You know what? I really
gotta go, Miss Williams.

180
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,591
My daddy's gonna be
waiting for me at home.

181
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,090
Go on.

182
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,331
Hello?

183
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,433
I don't hear from you in six years...

184
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,803
and you call me out of the
blue because you need my help.

185
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,472
Don't blame that on me.

186
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,408
You're the one who married Kelly
and stopped returning my calls.

187
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,177
You're not still bitter, are you?

188
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,788
Maybe. How is she?

189
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,554
I don't know. We're divorced.

190
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,385
Good. She was such a tramp.

191
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:51,023
I can't believe you married her and
dumped me. That's what you get.

192
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,192
Okay, okay.

193
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,128
Hey, pull up, It was high school.
Am I forgiven?

194
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:59,764
That depends. Can you help
me with my school situation?

195
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,701
- So you need sponsorship?
- Yes.

196
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,769
A call came in just as I
was leaving a meeting..

197
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,606
With a company that's in
the middle of a PR nightmare.

198
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,942
They could use some
goodwill right now.

199
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,778
Actually, in a town like yours.
So your timing may be perfect.

200
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,514
Tell me about it.

201
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,451
Can't do that until
we have a contract.

202
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,221
- You don't trust me?
- No, no, no, it's not that.

203
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,525
I have to protect my
interests, that's all.

204
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,259
Tell you what.

205
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,595
I'll come down with a contract,
you get your people to sign...

206
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,364
and I'm sure I can pull in...

207
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,408
at least a hundred grand for
your school and its event.

208
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,903
$100,000. That would be great.

209
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,905
How soon can you get here?

210
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,774
You need the money
right away, don't you?

211
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,576
Yeah. So you're willing
to drive down to Alabama?

212
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,113
I will drive over tomorrow.

213
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,615
We'll get the contract signed,
then I'll have to leave...

214
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,552
but I'll be back for the event.

215
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,731
That would be fantastic.

216
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,057
Oliver, thank you so much.

217
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,292
See you soon.

218
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,493
- You got it.
- Bye.

219
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,865
Child, that Powerball is going up.

220
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,168
Hello? Hey, I need y'all to
go get me some scratch-offs.

221
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,169
- Yeah, and play the numbers for me.
- Can you help me?

222
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,772
That Powerball has
gotten really high.

223
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,173
Play number 22...

224
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,241
- Excuse me.
- 17,5 and 6.

225
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,144
Go play them numbers, and bring
me a bunch of scratch offs. Yeah.

226
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,713
Just two, three of 'em.
Don't spend a lot of money.

227
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,048
I need some help!

228
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,951
Hold on, 'cause somebody's
screaming at me.

229
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,130
I'm getting ready to
choke her. Hold on.

230
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,158
Lady, you gonna need a damn
doctor if you holler at me again.

231
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,027
Do you understand?
Now, what can I help you with?

232
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,028
- I need a watch for my husband.
- A men's watch.

233
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,265
A men's watch. You know,
I like it with a leather band.

234
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,768
- You know, a nice thin watch.
- Here are some men's...

235
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,971
Oh, hell. It's time for my break.

236
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,905
- Time for my break.
- Break?

237
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,474
No, wait.

238
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,042
- You're so rude.
- Bye, bye, bye.

239
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,878
- You rude as hell. You rude as hell.
- Please. I need a watch.

240
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,347
Get out of my way. I'm trying
to go to the break room.

241
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,525
Wait! Come back!

242
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,465
You still here?

243
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,024
He called me back.

244
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,203
Yeah? And?

245
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:12,831
He thinks he can get us
$100,000 in sponsorship money.

246
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,767
$100,000?

247
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,102
- Oh, my goodness, that would be so great.
- I know.

248
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,437
That would not only
pay for the Jubilee...

249
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,240
that would take us well into
next year's school year.

250
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,677
We could get new books,
maybe even a new computer.

251
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,580
Wait, calm down. It hasn't
happened yet. It's not done.

252
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,349
Okay, but I have faith that it is.

253
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:34,820
Lacey, thank you so much for
doing this. I really appreciate it.

254
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,323
I know this school is not the best,
but it is all we got.

255
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,860
And I know you could have gone
anywhere in the country...

256
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,028
with the credentials you have.

257
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,504
- I love it here.
- Thank you.

258
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,967
He's coming down tomorrow
with the contract.

259
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,937
This is so wonderful!
I gotta call the mayor.

260
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,072
- Yes.
- He's gonna be so excited.

261
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,274
This is going to be a wonderful
Christmas after all!

262
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,953
It's gonna be fantastic.

263
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,950
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

264
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,643
- Hello?
- I must be dialing the wrong number.

265
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,712
You said that already,
but you called back five times.

266
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,548
So what number you trying to get?

267
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,982
I'm trying to reach
my daughter, Lacey.

268
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,385
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
she just walked in. Hold on.

269
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,566
- Who is that?
- Your mama.

270
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,261
- Hi, Mama.
- Who was that?

271
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:51,864
That was Conner.

272
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,543
Conner?

273
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,936
That's the guy you hired
to help you with the farm?

274
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,738
Yeah, that's him.

275
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,573
Okay. I don't know if I
like him up there with you.

276
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:03,142
Suppose he gets fresh...

277
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,543
and you don't have no man
up there to protect you.

278
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,746
Mama, I'm fine. What's going on?

279
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,282
I can't wait until you
taste the dinner...

280
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,585
I have prepared for
you for Christmas.

281
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:15,187
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

282
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,697
I'm not gonna be able
to come home this year.

283
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,658
What?

284
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,760
Uh-uh. It's Christmas.

285
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,629
I know, it's just I'm just
getting settled in...

286
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,798
and the farm needs a lot of work.

287
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,301
Uh-uh. You not no
farmer in the dell now.

288
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,870
It's not just the farm.

289
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,172
They've also decided to
extended the school year...

290
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,740
to the day before Christmas.

291
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,610
- What kind of school is that?
- We lost a lot of days...

292
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,745
because of the storms this summer,
so we have to make them up,

293
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,115
And I'm helping the kids prepare
songs for the Christmas Jubilee.

294
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,086
And we have a budget crisis.
So it's just too busy right now, Mom.

295
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,086
I'll come up there.

296
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,587
- No.
- Yes.

297
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,657
- I haven't seen you in nine months...
- It's not the right time.

298
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,658
And you don't drive.

299
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,261
I can get somebody to
drive up there with me.

300
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,630
I can ask your Aunt
Madea to come with me.

301
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,900
Mama, can we just skip it this year?
It's only Christmas.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,469
You bite your tongue,

303
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,837
Christmas is the time of year...

304
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:10,282
when we celebrate the birth of
Jesus with our families and...

305
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,613
Lacey, I don't have
to tell you that...

306
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,416
you and I are the
only family we have,

307
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,596
I know. Mom, are you crying?

308
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,556
What was that, Conner?

309
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,758
I didn't say anything.

310
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,494
I'm sorry. Conner needs
my help, Mama. I gotta go.

311
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,764
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Love you Bye,

312
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,903
Do not look at me like that.
You don't understand.

313
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,878
I didn't say a word.

314
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,278
Are you okay?

315
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,417
Girl, I don't know why I let you talk
me into comin' and doin' this job.

316
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,452
- I didn't take my medicine this morning.
- What medicine?

317
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,758
Five milligrams
of "Don't choke that ho."

318
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,692
These customers gettin' right...

319
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,826
I feel I'm getting ready
to maybe catch a case.

320
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,472
- I could spit.
- What's wrong with you?

321
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,238
Lacey's not coming for Christmas.

322
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,601
That ain't no problem.
Children grow up.

323
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,570
They don't wanna come home sometimes.

324
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:13,249
Something's wrong.

325
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,474
- Eileen?
- What?

326
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:18,677
I know that look in your eye.
Don't go jumpin' to no conclusion.

327
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,513
I don't jump to conclusions.

328
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,515
Last time you went to
the doctor, you had a rash.

329
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:27,820
Walked up in there, told the man
you had cancer and you was dying.

330
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,658
Madea, many people in my
family have died of cancer.

331
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,692
- I know your family.
- Yes.

332
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,162
- My grandmother.
- Got hit by a bus.

333
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:41,267
But she had cancer. My uncle Bayrod.

334
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,003
- Drowned.
- Because he had cancer.

335
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:45,803
- Eileen?
- What?

336
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:48,106
No, no, no, no. Something is wrong.

337
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,842
Something is wrong with my child,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

338
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,778
She's down there in the country,
and I don't know what's going on.

339
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,381
I haven't seen where she works,
where she live.

340
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,951
- It's just awful!
- Your daughter is grown.

341
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,953
Leave her alone. If she want to
come home, she will come home.

342
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,633
What you planning on doing?

343
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,691
I'm gonna go down there.

344
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,192
I'd like to see that,
'cause you don't drive.

345
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,262
- You do.
- Child, I ain't goin' to no Alabama.

346
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,933
Last time I was in Alabama, I was chained
to Andy Young and Jesse Jackson.

347
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,273
- You marched?
- We wasn't upright when we was marching.

348
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,008
- We gonna go down there.
- I'm not driving to no Alabama.

349
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:26,010
All my stuff is illegal. I don't
like driving through Georgia.

350
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,314
You think I'm gettin' ready
to drive through Alabama?

351
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,382
- I'll pay you.
- What time you wanna leave?

352
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,483
Okay. Good.

353
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,552
No, child. I can't get on
the road with my Cadillac.

354
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,790
It's got 4,785,000 miles on it,
and I just changed the oil in it.

355
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,858
Every light on the dashboard say...

356
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,266
"You crazy as hell if
you go anywhere in me."

357
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:48,000
- Madea...
- I can't do it, hon. I'm sorry.

358
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,181
Have you ever thought maybe she
just don't want to see you, Eileen?

359
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,006
My daughter loves me.

360
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:57,009
She loves spending time with me.

361
00:17:57,108 --> 00:18:00,412
All right, honey. If you find a ride,
I'll go up there with you.

362
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,023
All right. Well, I will work on it.

363
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,005
Conner.

364
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,632
- What the hell you think you're doin'?
- What are you talking about?

365
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,534
I was down at the feed store.

366
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,670
They tell me you're planning
on planting corn this year.

367
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,305
Yeah, I was.

368
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:28,539
I plant corn.

369
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,309
Well, actually, what I'm
working on can help all of us.

370
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,479
- What you're working on?
- Yeah.

371
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:37,016
You think you learned something down
in that college that I don't know about?

372
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,855
- That's not what I meant, Tanner.
- No, you don't.

373
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,388
And you better find
something else to plant.

374
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,157
You been gone from around
here for far too long.

375
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,826
I mean it, Conner.

376
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:51,666
Otherwise, I'll be here every day,
kick your ass like I did back in school.

377
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,575
Eileen, we've had a lot of
complaints about your friend.

378
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,144
Oh, no.

379
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,278
Hey there. I was
getting ready to go...

380
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:10,249
- What's the matter?
- We're going to have to ask you to leave.

381
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:14,153
Good, it's about damn time.
I get out of... Give me my check.

382
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,661
We'll mail it to you.

383
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,023
No, honey. Eileen,
you better tell her.

384
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,960
Ain't nobody gonna mail me no check.
I didn't mail my work up in here.

385
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,328
You ain't mailing me no check.
Where's my money?

386
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,098
Madea, go home. I'll call you later.

387
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,567
I don't give a damn who calling who.
Somebody gonna give me my money.

388
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,769
Would you please leave quietly?

389
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,971
Oh, sure. You want
me to leave quietly?

390
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,807
You want me to leave quietly?

391
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,076
I will show you how
to leave damn quietly.

392
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,045
Y'all gonna give me my damn money.

393
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:44,048
But before I get my damn purse,
I'm gonna get money out this register.

394
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,851
- Excuse me.
- No, no.

395
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,753
No, you can't do that. Put... Madea.

396
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,756
Where my purse?
Unlock the damn thing!

397
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:53,692
I got my purse here. This is $150.

398
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,494
- This is what you owe me.
- Put that money back.

399
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,564
I'm gonna take something else.
I'm gonna take this dress.

400
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,632
- Stop it!
- Take whatever I want out of here.

401
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:02,733
What's this pulling on me?

402
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,470
You're embarrassing us.

403
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,472
What the hell y'all looking at?
What the hell all y'all looking at?

404
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,843
It's Christmas, and I'm takin'
what the hell I want up in here!

405
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:14,378
What y'all gonna do about it?
What y'all gonna do about it?

406
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,015
- I'll take this too.
- She didn't take her medication today.

407
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,984
You got me coming up here,
trying to work in this place...

408
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,787
and I don't know
what the hell gonna...

409
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,955
Get out the way!
What the hell goin' on?

410
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,358
- I know what the hell I'm doing!
- She has never acted like this before.

411
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,494
I'm fabulous. I'm gone
with the wind fabulous.

412
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,333
I am so sorry.

413
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,618
Hi. I'm Lacey Williams,
Bailey's teacher.

414
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,560
- Right. Come on in.
- Thank you.

415
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,326
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

416
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,663
I just stopped by to talk to you.

417
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,833
I graded another one of Bailey's
homework assignments...

418
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,233
Listen, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,570
He has to help his daddy at night,
so he doesn't get much time to study.

420
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,840
Then he gets up early in the
morning to work with him...

421
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,920
so I'll just have to get
on him to do better.

422
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,818
He can't get any better.

423
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,849
- He gets straight A's.
- What?

424
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,519
Yeah. And to know he works after
school and in the morning...

425
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,454
is even more impressive.

426
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:34,261
He really should go to a gifted
school with a fine arts department.

427
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,301
Wow.

428
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,401
I always knew he was smart.
I didn't know he was that smart.

429
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,971
Me and his daddy never
got much schoolin'.

430
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,508
You really think Bailey could
make it outside of this place?

431
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,381
I know he can.

432
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,645
I mean, that's really
all I want for him.

433
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,548
Bailey is always telling me
how good you are to him...

434
00:21:57,648 --> 00:22:01,220
and that you defend him in front
of those other kids, so thank you.

435
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,756
- Well, he's a very special boy.
- Yeah, he is.

436
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,657
- Have a seat.
- Sure. Thank you.

437
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,269
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes.

438
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,440
Thanks.

439
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,878
Thank you.

440
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:22,507
He also told me you want him to
sing at the Christmas Jubilee?

441
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,942
Yes. He has a beautiful voice.

442
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,679
You think the Jubilee is
gonna happen this year?

443
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,248
Yes, haven't you heard?

444
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,916
I got a friend of mine to
get us a sponsorship for it.

445
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,919
So it's definitely gonna happen.

446
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,792
- That's great news.
- Yeah, it really is.

447
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:44,028
Oh, hell. What do you want?

448
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:47,267
- Hi, I'm Lacey Williams.
- I know who you are.

449
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:50,635
You're Bailey's teacher.
Bailey's gonna be late to school.

450
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,907
He's got a lot of work to do here,
that's if he makes it at all.

451
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,050
No need come around
here no more. Okay?

452
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,217
I am so sorry.

453
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,426
Merry Christmas.

454
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,522
Oliver, this is so funny.

455
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,960
I hadn't spoken to your mother
in a while, and we got talking...

456
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,163
and she said you were drivin'
to Alabama to see Lacey!

457
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:20,499
Miss Eileen, I'm happy
to have the company.

458
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:23,934
Did I tell you I take blood pressure
medicine that makes me have to pee?

459
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,172
- I'll have to go to the bathroom soon.
- Okay, go in the bush.

460
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:30,443
I'm not putting my tush over no bush.
I don't know what's wrong with you.

461
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,048
The leaves fell off
of it, but it work!

462
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,449
- Jesus. Baby...
- It the wintertime.

463
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:39,651
Just keep your eyes ahead.

464
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,820
Okay? No, no, no. She's always
like this, since a child.

465
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,388
- Yeah, since my childhood.
- Something's wrong.

466
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,957
Something's wrong, but we accept it.

467
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,026
You sure you didn't tell
her we were coming?

468
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,162
I wanted this to be a big surprise!

469
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:51,840
I'm sure.

470
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:55,967
'Cause she's gonna be
so happy to see you!

471
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:00,172
Madea, I told him how much
Lacey talks about him.

472
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:03,508
Why you hollerin' like I'm in the back
of an airplane and you in first class?

473
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,111
I can hear you. You right here.

474
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,079
All I'm saying is this...

475
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,082
- What's your name, boy? Olive Oil?
- Oliver.

476
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,650
All I'm saying is this.

477
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,853
If she wanted to talk to you,
she would have called you all the time.

478
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:16,555
Don't get your hopes
up listening to Eileen.

479
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:19,857
Don't listen to her. You two
are gonna be together again.

480
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,259
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I see it on your face.

481
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,994
I see it on your face. Yeah!

482
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,997
I would like to see us
have another chance.

483
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:28,700
Y'all was in high school back then.
I got to pee, son.

484
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,202
You been driving around
in circles for way too long.

485
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,338
Go on over there. Pull over there,
ask these people directions.

486
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,708
I'm gonna go in here
and use the bathroom.

487
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,609
No, Madea.
This place don't look right.

488
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,945
Eileen, here. This a...
Child, please.

489
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,615
I grew up in the country.
Ain't nobody in here.

490
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:45,795
He what sittin'
there willy-whilin'. Ask him.

491
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,086
Lord, this thing is high.
You gotta get me a step.

492
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:51,323
'Scuse me, sir.
You look like a nice man.

493
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,592
How you doin'? We are lost.
He trying to find direction.

494
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,727
I need a bathroom. Is there
a bathroom here somewhere?

495
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,028
Yes, ma'am. Right over yonder.

496
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:01,073
Get the directions here.
I got me to pee.

497
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,637
Got to pee. Hell...

498
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,112
What the...

499
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,487
Go! Drive! Drive, Olive Oil, drive!

500
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:24,955
Put the pedal to the metal.
Get the hell outta here!

501
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,526
- They're tryin' to get me!
- What did you do?

502
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,036
Drive! Hell, they're KKK!

503
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:40,806
- This ain't the right address, is it?
- That's what she said.

504
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:45,143
This can't be the right address.
These people might not be friendly.

505
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:49,847
Look, this is 2013,
and it's almost Christmas.

506
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,583
Sure it'll be fine.

507
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,118
Boy, did you see what I
just went through in town?

508
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,686
True.

509
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,088
This just don't feel right.

510
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,992
Up here in these woods,
ain't nobody around but us and trees.

511
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,173
I don't like this.
Go knock on the door.

512
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:08,467
- Thanks a lot.
- What you worried about, son?

513
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,535
Somebody got to
live to tell the story.

514
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:13,070
Tell 'em what happened to you.
Somebody got be an activist.

515
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,173
Somebody got to call Sharpton.

516
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,681
Never mind.

517
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,362
Conner, where are you going?

518
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,198
- Hey, what's going on?
- I mentioned Tanner and he lost it.

519
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:27,768
- Conner!
- I've been waiting to see this.

520
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,869
- I'm goin' with you, boy.
- Conner!

521
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,003
Conner!

522
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:48,049
- Uh-oh. Who is that?
- I told you this was the wrong address.

523
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,923
We gotta go. Back up.

524
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,954
There she is! Pull up.

525
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:55,589
We're at the right place.

526
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,598
- Come on. Hurry up.
- There she is.

527
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:02,336
- Lacey!
- Look at you.

528
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,443
Oh, my word. What are you doing here?

529
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,741
I hitched a ride
with Oliver. Surprise!

530
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,309
Surprise!

531
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,679
- We came.
- Surprise.

532
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:19,357
Who are you?

533
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,750
I'm Conner.

534
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,192
Girl, what the coroner doing here?
Who done died?

535
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:32,432
You are the farmhand that
she hired. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

536
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:35,096
I am Eileen, her mother.

537
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:39,507
And this is Madea,
her great-aunt on my daddy's side.

538
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,171
She sure don't look happy to see us.

539
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,373
You better bite your tongue.

540
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:48,486
She is happy to see
me anytime. Tell her.

541
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:55,549
That don't look like happiness, honey.
That look like puredee constipation.

542
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:57,618
Hi, Conner.

543
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,086
How are ya? How ya doing?

544
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:01,088
This handsome thing...

545
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:03,858
this is Oliver, her boyfriend.

546
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,693
Her boyfriend?

547
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:07,931
Ex-boyfriend.

548
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:11,566
It was nice of you to call him.

549
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:14,269
That was a nice ruse to
get to see him. Fund-raiser.

550
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:16,337
No, it wasn't a ruse.

551
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,240
You know you miss him.

552
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:21,209
Anyway, could you get my bags,
farmhand, please?

553
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:23,445
- Yeah.
- I'll help.

554
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,214
Lacey, come show us this farm.

555
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,416
A little dusty, dusty.

556
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:32,621
Come, my dear. I knew that.

557
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:35,323
Baby, you know you got asthma.

558
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,325
Mama, I don't have asthma anymore.

559
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,627
Yeah, but you still
gotta be careful...

560
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:42,364
because that could lead to cancer.

561
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:44,932
Everything don't lead to cancer,
Eileen. Lord, help her.

562
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,434
I'm gonna open the door.
Y'all need fresh air up in here.

563
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,971
Got all these animals. This is
a nice room. I'll stay in here.

564
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,439
- Good, good, good.
- Sure.

565
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:53,974
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree?

566
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,544
- No, I don't.
- Oh, my God.

567
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:58,646
- That's why you wanted me to come here.
- Yeah, that's exactly why.

568
00:28:58,747 --> 00:29:00,382
- I'm gonna take this room.
- Okay.

569
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:01,817
- Okay?
- That's nice too.

570
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,518
- That's a nice room.
- Thank you.

571
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,520
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- Yeah, put it in the room on the end.

572
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,222
- I'm staying down there.
- All right.

573
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,057
- All right.
- Is this your room here?

574
00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:12,426
- It's my room.
- It's lovely.

575
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:14,195
Thank you. It's not clean.

576
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,397
- Okay, now where's the kitchen?
- Let's go that way.

577
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:18,133
- It's in there. Go ahead.
- I'm comin'.

578
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,101
Don't be pushing on me.

579
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:22,537
We saw this. This is the
dining room. It's yellow.

580
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,272
It's yellow. It's bright yellow!

581
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:26,942
It's nice, Mama, huh?

582
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,477
Yeah, it's not my cup
of tea, but you know.

583
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:31,880
- Back porch and everything.
- Aunt Madea, you like it?

584
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,782
- Yeah, look at all the animals.
- It's very nice. Yes.

585
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:36,852
Ask the man to bring
the groceries in.

586
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,520
- They're in the trunk of the car.
- His name is Conner.

587
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:43,391
I don't like you being up
here with him by yourself.

588
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,894
What is Oliver supposed to think,
you living with a man?

589
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,063
Why should I care what Oliver thinks?

590
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,565
- You should. He still wants you.
- Mama, please.

591
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,334
No, and you still want him.

592
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,669
I know it. I got that feeling.

593
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:57,239
I want some grandbabies.
What you waiting on?

594
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,740
Eileen, stop meddling with that girl.

595
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,251
Okay? You is in everybody's business.
Just leave this child alone.

596
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:05,980
You have been talking
since we got in the car.

597
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,317
You talk too much, Eileen. Please,
just shut up for a little while here.

598
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,152
Leave this child alone.
She living her life.

599
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:14,127
She happy out here in the
farm playing Old MacDonald.

600
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:26,567
- Any more?
- Just the groceries.

601
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,135
All right.

602
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:30,316
- Hi.
- Wow.

603
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,818
- It's great to see you, Lacey.
- Yeah, you too.

604
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,045
Let me put these down,
and I'll be ready to go to school.

605
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:38,552
- Yeah.
- All right?

606
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,020
So, you didn't tell me
your boyfriend was coming.

607
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:48,390
High school. Non-factor, trust me.

608
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,592
My mother... I can't believe
she just showed up.

609
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:52,727
And your parents are on their way.

610
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:56,298
Yep. Gonna be here right after
you get back from school.

611
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,599
I know. What are we gonna do?

612
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,438
You better think of something.

613
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:04,343
- Baby...
- Boyfriend.

614
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:08,542
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes, sure.

615
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:12,413
Hold on. Hold on. I heard
somebody say, "Go." Oh, Lord.

616
00:31:12,513 --> 00:31:14,682
Take me anywhere. I got to
get away from your mama.

617
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:17,085
I'll go to hell and back
to get away from her.

618
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:19,086
She talk too damn much.
Can I go with y'all?

619
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:23,090
Okay. Maybe you can keep an eye on
my class while I go into the meeting.

620
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:25,559
I'm sorry. Watch your class?

621
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,862
She wants me to watch
her class. Children?

622
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,596
Child, me and children
don't get along.

623
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,199
Now, let me see.

624
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:32,599
Ankle-biting...

625
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,336
disease-carrying...

626
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:38,415
little children of God,
or your mama...

627
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:42,509
satanic, loud-mouthed,
diarrhea woman from hell.

628
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,848
I think I'll go with the children.
Praise God.

629
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:48,450
- All right.
- I'll drop you back off on my way home.

630
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:50,518
Okay, close your trunk, son.
Close your trunk.

631
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,287
I'm gonna ride with him.

632
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:55,656
No offense to y'all car,
'cause this a nice car.

633
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:57,959
But this bring back memories, child.

634
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:00,996
I got pregnant. Meat Loaf was
playing "Dashboard Light."

635
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:04,164
I was sitting up there, and I kept
hitting my head on that steering wheel.

636
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:06,601
It was just awful.
It was an awful time.

637
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:09,069
Look. The door even sound the same.

638
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,574
Child, this is just what it's...
Yep, that bring back memories.

639
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:14,375
Watch this.

640
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,611
That's what I used to do. Drop it.

641
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:20,347
That car built for comfort and
built for speed, just like me.

642
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:22,784
This a nice truck, but how
I'm s'posed to get in here?

643
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:25,252
- Pull the seat back.
- I'll sit in the back. Hold on.

644
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,788
No, you don't have to...
Yeah, just pull that back.

645
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:30,791
You got to get some of them
things to help me get in here.

646
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:33,560
Is there something to...
Hold on. I got it.

647
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,529
Yeah, that's it. Come on in.

648
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,731
Boy, you got to get a low car here.

649
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,302
- You 'bout to make me mad.
- Give me your hand.

650
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:45,882
- Now, hold on.
- All right, I got you.

651
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:50,144
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

652
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:53,914
This is my Aunt Mabel.
But everybody calls her Madea.

653
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,817
I have to go to a meeting down
the hall with Ms. Porter...

654
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:00,055
and I asked Miss Madea
to keep an eye on you.

655
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:03,357
Now, you know what to do and
you know how to behave, right?

656
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,992
Yes, ma'am.

657
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,461
- I'll be right back. Thanks, Madea.
- Yeah, I love it.

658
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:10,097
I love well-behaved children.
That's wonderful.

659
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,935
Y'all look so nice.

660
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:21,209
Hello. Hello. Now, y'all got to
go back to the Stepford children.

661
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:24,878
Don't act like you... Don't act
like this. Now, calm the hell down.

662
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:28,615
I'm in here. Do yourself a favor.
Do the right thing.

663
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,219
- You belong in this class?
- Yes, ma'am.

664
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:33,855
- Okay. What's your name?
- Bailey.

665
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,522
Bailey? Okay. Well, go on.

666
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:38,692
Your teacher went down the hall,
and I'm sitting in for her. Have a seat.

667
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,595
You better hope she comes back.

668
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:43,798
She's the only teacher
that likes you here.

669
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:50,070
Don't sit by me. You are so dirty.

670
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:52,440
Leave that boy alone. Where else
he gonna sit? Sit down, son.

671
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,075
Sit down. Don't worry about her.

672
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:57,578
Don't you ever pick on somebody just
'cause you can. Do you understand?

673
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,646
They used to do that to me
when I was in kindergarten.

674
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,584
'Cause I was six feet tall,
they all want to talk about me.

675
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:05,086
I had a full figure and
curves and all that stuff.

676
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:07,555
They wanted to make fun of me.
But I wasn't having it.

677
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:11,291
You understand? I fought back.
That's why I got tough-skinned.

678
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:14,161
You may have to fight back sometimes.
Do you understand?

679
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:18,298
Don't worry about these people in
here trying to make you feel bad.

680
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,268
You got to be nice to people.
Pass it on, niceness.

681
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,271
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

682
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:27,007
All right, I'm going to write
my name on the board...

683
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,744
so you all will know what my name is.

684
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:33,050
Ain't no chalk.
Y'all ain't got no chalk?

685
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,949
Ain't got no eraser either.
"No cause..."

686
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,853
Okay. I don't know
what all that mean.

687
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:42,262
All right. Well,
what we gonna do is...

688
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:44,759
I'm gonna tell y'all a story.

689
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:48,496
This is the story of Christmas.
Christmas.

690
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:53,001
This is what I learned when I
went to school... Sunday school.

691
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:57,411
This is the story of the nativities.

692
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,177
Little baby Jesus was born.

693
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:04,856
He was born to the Virgin Mary...

694
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,717
J. Blige, and as Mary was on tour...

695
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,619
she met this man named Joe...

696
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,688
Manganiello, who played a werewolf.

697
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:16,391
And he was in love with her.
She said, "Joe.

698
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,826
I am thou-ist with the child-ist.

699
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:21,695
And the holiness is come upon me...

700
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:24,206
and I'm going to have a baby-ist."

701
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,003
And Joe said, "Really?"

702
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,172
They ain't know what to do.

703
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:33,240
So he went on and stayed with her...

704
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,710
and they went on 'cause they
was expecting the holy child.

705
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,278
That's right.

706
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:42,784
And the Bible say in
second "Deuteronomo"...

707
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:47,889
that when he came to the earth...

708
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:51,726
he came through the Virgin...
piña colada.

709
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,795
And as she was there...

710
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:56,831
they were trying to find
somewhere to have the baby...

711
00:35:56,931 --> 00:36:00,668
but they kept going to all these hotels,
and wouldn't none of 'em let them in.

712
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:02,704
Marriott. Shut the door.

713
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:04,938
Hilton. Shut the door.

714
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,675
Tried to get to the Ritz-Carlton,
they said, "You don't belong here."

715
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:10,744
Everybody just got put out.
They went to the Motel 6.

716
00:36:10,844 --> 00:36:14,449
They didn't even leave the light
on for her. She was in the dark.

717
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:18,018
Anyway, there was Mary...

718
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,788
'bout to have that baby,
so she sat down at a bus stop.

719
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,889
MARTA bus passed by,
wouldn't even pick her up...

720
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:25,760
to take her to the holy
city of Birmingham.

721
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,831
And as she sat there,
she went into laborer.

722
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,000
And as she started laboring...

723
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,068
a mangy dog walked up beside her.

724
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:37,639
See, God will send you a dog when
you need it, even if you don't.

725
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,706
And that dog said,
"What's wrong with you?"

726
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:43,610
And as she sat there,
she had that baby...

727
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,681
and that baby came
next to that mangy dog.

728
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,983
That's why they say he
was born in a mangy.

729
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,219
Hallelujah. Let the Lord use ya.

730
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,356
Okay, that's the story of the baby Jesus.
That's the hip-hop version.

731
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:58,900
I'm glad I went to church
and to Sunday school. Okay.

732
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,072
Where my purse?

733
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:05,876
Where my purse?

734
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,269
Y'all ain't seen what
happened to my purse?

735
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,005
I'm gonna tell y'all another story.

736
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,240
This is the story of Easter Sunday.

737
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,143
Jesus was hanging
between two thieves.

738
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:18,746
One was Baranibus and the
other was the Dinosaurus.

739
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:20,983
Somebody better find
my purse right now.

740
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:26,086
- All we have to do is sign that thing?
- Yes.

741
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:28,456
Lacey told me you needed
the money right away.

742
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:31,192
So I spoke with my boss and
got the money in advance.

743
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,371
We're both very sure we'll
get the sponsorship.

744
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,862
What's in it for you?

745
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:39,400
Well, my company gets paid a
10% commission by the company.

746
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,469
You get the entire 100 grand.

747
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:44,304
It will help us with the shortfall.

748
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:46,840
- Is everything okay, Wilbur?
- Yes, Your Honor.

749
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,021
It's good. It is good.

750
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:52,625
All right then. Let's do this.

751
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,621
Wonderful. Here you go.

752
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:04,826
Now, we'll bring the sponsors down
to the Jubilee for a photo op.

753
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:07,563
- That's all we ask.
- Of course.

754
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:09,963
- Thank you, son.
- You got it.

755
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:11,632
Thank you so much.

756
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,967
You have no idea how
much we needed this.

757
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:16,170
- It's my pleasure.
- Lacey.

758
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:19,351
- Thank you.
- This is my town too.

759
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:21,853
Glad I can help.

760
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:24,411
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

761
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,090
After you.

762
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:29,050
There you go.

763
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,059
You have no clue how much
you've just helped us. I mean...

764
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:35,733
It was my pleasure.
I'm glad I could help.

765
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:39,659
- Thank you again.
- You got it.

766
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,963
- Here.
- What's this?

767
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:44,731
- It's your Christmas present.
- No. I can't take that.

768
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,268
- Sure you can.
- I really can't.

769
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,777
You've already done
enough for us. Thank you.

770
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,242
What are you doing?

771
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,547
Your mother told me she
thought you missed me.

772
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:02,884
Look, I know we were children,
but I think about you still.

773
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:04,885
Listen, Oliver,
that was a long time ago...

774
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:07,355
- and I actually have to tell you...
- Lacey!

775
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:09,690
- Get in here. Quick!
- Excuse me.

776
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,369
Hurry!

777
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,594
There's a weird woman in here.

778
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,730
What they did back in the day...

779
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,197
Lacey, who is this?

780
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:19,634
- My aunt Madea.
- Hi.

781
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,068
What are you doing?

782
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:24,271
I was just teaching these
children a lesson on Jesus...

783
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:26,807
from the time he was born
until the time he died on Earth.

784
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,443
She tried to steal my purse, but I
taught her a lesson. Here you go.

785
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:32,980
Now you have been crowned
the Christmas... Praise. Hallelujah.

786
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,416
- I got her, didn't I? I got her, Bailey.
- Yes, ma'am.

787
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:38,552
'Scuse me. Oliver, take me to the house.
I'm getting the hell outta here.

788
00:39:38,652 --> 00:39:40,454
We'll talk when I get
back for the Jubilee.

789
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:43,726
Lucy. How do you even...
How did she...

790
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:49,141
That's a nice-lookin' tree.

791
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,016
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

792
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,119
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

793
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:14,789
I rushed home. How's my mother?

794
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,291
I don't know. She only
said two words to me.

795
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:19,226
You think of how you're
gonna handle this yet?

796
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:21,161
No. Were you able to
talk to your parents?

797
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:22,840
Nope, no cell phone.

798
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:27,672
Guess I'll have to talk to
'em now 'cause they're here.

799
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,739
- Hey, hey!
- Hi, y'all!

800
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,708
Hey, hey! Look at you!

801
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,614
Don't you go nowhere.

802
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:38,512
I'm gonna get your mama.

803
00:40:38,612 --> 00:40:41,349
- I look all right?
- Yeah, you look great.

804
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,483
- Son! Son!
- Mama! Daddy!

805
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,288
Look at you!

806
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:47,623
Daddy, not the bear hug!

807
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:50,891
Your old man still got it, don't he?

808
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,360
Look at my Grizzly Adams.

809
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,838
Look at you. You look
like a mountain man.

810
00:40:57,632 --> 00:41:00,701
Hey, Son, see this? This ain't fat.
This is all foreskin.

811
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,869
Buddy, stop. Don't start so early.

812
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,704
- You must be Lacey.
- Yes.

813
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:06,373
Look at you!

814
00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:08,108
- Oh, my!
- You put her down.

815
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,844
You don't gotta break
her and snap her neck.

816
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:13,114
Just give him a little nudge
to the flapjacks there.

817
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:16,182
He'll put you down.
Where are my manners?

818
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:19,353
I am Conner's mama.
Please call me Mrs. Williams.

819
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:21,856
- Hi.
- I kiddin'! You...

820
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:25,003
Call me Kim or Mama.
Just don't call me late for dinner.

821
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,994
I'm joshing you.

822
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:29,396
- Look how pretty. She's very pretty.
- Thank you.

823
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:32,065
She is even more beautiful than
I ever could have imagined.

824
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,201
Thank you.

825
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,003
So nice to finally meet you.

826
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,572
You too.

827
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,141
Look at this place.

828
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,577
It is beautiful.
This place is stupendous.

829
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:45,947
My mama and daddy...
Sorry. I'm sorry.

830
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:48,449
They just would've been
so proud. Thank you.

831
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,184
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama.

832
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:53,219
I was so upset when I
heard you two eloped.

833
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,722
I thought maybe you'd
come down to Louisiana...

834
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:58,559
and went up the bayou for the
Swamp Manor to get hitched.

835
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:01,929
We would have thrown you
such a shindig. You know that.

836
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:03,998
Hey, I'm glad y'all did elope.

837
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:06,400
You done saved me
an assload of money.

838
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,969
So I appreciate it.

839
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,204
Well, you've spent enough
money on me already, Daddy.

840
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:12,606
- I'm glad you recognize that.
- Honey, we love you.

841
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:14,742
Anything you want, my son. Anything.

842
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:16,077
Well...

843
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,813
Have you two eaten?

844
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:21,626
No, but...

845
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,485
Good, 'cause I caught
Christmas dinner.

846
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:25,987
Caught?

847
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:30,260
We are gonna have hot possum potpie.
I'm gonna make it.

848
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,927
It's good. Nice flaky crust.

849
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:34,494
Gonna have possum stew...

850
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,130
and your uncle DeWayne done
got me some white lightning.

851
00:42:37,231 --> 00:42:39,367
Here, let me take this, Daddy.

852
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:41,969
Actually, Lacey's a vegetarian.

853
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:45,039
She's a vegetarianist? On a farm.

854
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:47,108
- Honey, that must be hard.
- That don't mean nothing.

855
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:50,644
We's Baptist, and we still like a
nice possum stew every now and then.

856
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:53,847
No, Buddy. It means
she doesn't eat meat.

857
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:57,117
- She doesn't eat meat.
- Oh, you're a tofu farter.

858
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:59,186
- Daddy.
- Ain't nothing wrong with that.

859
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,454
I like tofu farters. God bless you.

860
00:43:01,554 --> 00:43:03,523
All I'm saying, Son,
if she don't eat meat...

861
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:07,170
that might be a bad thing when it
comes to certain parts of the anatomy.

862
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:11,097
Mama, can you please... I'm sorry.

863
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:13,000
We just met her. Now, stop.

864
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,536
- Start slow, all right?
- I was just kidding.

865
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,103
I'm sorry. He's crazy.

866
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:19,273
What are we doing standing
out here getting all dusty?

867
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:22,510
Let's go inside and get
our meal on. I'm starvin'.

868
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,478
I brought you some spices
from your Aunt Tutu's garden.

869
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,047
- Okay. Mama...
- You're gonna love 'em.

870
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,784
- Let me go get that.
- Hang on, y'all.

871
00:43:29,884 --> 00:43:32,362
Lacey's mama is cookin'.

872
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,755
Lacey's ma... She's here?

873
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:36,289
- Your mama's here now?
- Yes.

874
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:38,793
- Her mama is here, Buddy.
- Hey, hey! All right.

875
00:43:38,893 --> 00:43:40,628
Looks like we get
to meet the in-laws.

876
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:42,996
Actually, we kind of have a problem.

877
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:44,364
What's the problem?

878
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:46,670
Lacey hadn't told her
mama that we're married.

879
00:43:47,268 --> 00:43:49,369
- What?
- Why ain't you told her?

880
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:50,637
Well...

881
00:43:50,737 --> 00:43:53,306
my mother had dreams
for my entire life...

882
00:43:53,407 --> 00:43:56,487
and Conner was not in that dream.

883
00:43:58,878 --> 00:44:00,347
I'm sorry. I do...

884
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:03,416
- I don't understand.
- I think I do. Let me ask you something.

885
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,791
When she had them dreams,
was they in color or black-and-white?

886
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,329
She doesn't want you
with a white man.

887
00:44:15,996 --> 00:44:18,331
I'm sorry. That's awful.

888
00:44:18,431 --> 00:44:20,400
Honey, we taught
all of our children...

889
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,670
"Never see color. Only see heart."

890
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:26,072
- Isn't that right, Conner?
- That's right.

891
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:29,777
It's such a shame she does not
know what kind of person you are.

892
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,378
I'll tell you who he is.

893
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,949
Always taught him to
look at a woman's heart.

894
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,117
'Cause that's where their rack hangs.

895
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,385
Daddy.

896
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:40,621
I'm just kiddin'.
She got a nice rack.

897
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,456
Your mama used to have a nice rack.

898
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:45,659
Now she bends over, just looks
like she's got a 7-10 split.

899
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:48,195
- What the hell does that mean?
- It's a bowling term.

900
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:50,498
- I don't like that, Daddy.
- I don't either.

901
00:44:50,597 --> 00:44:53,934
I'm just kiddin'. I still like to go to
the bowling alley every now and then.

902
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:56,170
- You're sexy to me.
- Will you hush?

903
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:58,972
I'm gonna start talking about
all your wrinkly, saggy parts.

904
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,210
- It's like a turkey giblet in there.
- That was over the line.

905
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,882
Well, honey, Conner,
who does she think you are?

906
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:09,219
She thinks I'm the farm help.

907
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,786
- Well, there's a switcheroo.
- The farm help.

908
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:15,456
Do you think we should leave?
I think we should maybe leave.

909
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:18,358
I ain't goin' nowhere.
Hell, I just drove up here.

910
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:21,394
- I am tired. I want a beer.
- I don't want you guys to leave.

911
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:23,938
Well, what should we do?

912
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,201
Can you give me
some time to tell her?

913
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,105
I mean, I have to break it to
her gently. She's been very sick.

914
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:33,407
- Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.

915
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:35,909
- What's wrong?
- She has a weak heart.

916
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,144
Then by all means, you just...

917
00:45:38,244 --> 00:45:40,481
take your time and tell
her when you're ready.

918
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:42,416
- Thank you.
- Okay.

919
00:45:42,516 --> 00:45:45,219
We don't want her ticker
to tock out on you here.

920
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:47,086
- We'll behave ourselves.
- Yeah.

921
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:48,922
- You know what we'll be?
- What?

922
00:45:49,023 --> 00:45:51,525
- Parents of the help.
- That's right. Parents of the help.

923
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,561
- "Can I get you something?"
- Let's head in.

924
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,963
- Come on.
- Daddy, behave.

925
00:45:57,063 --> 00:45:59,867
I'll behave. Like a bull in a rodeo.

926
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,670
- Did you paint this? This is fabulous.
- I started.

927
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:04,672
- Still needs some work.
- Where you at?

928
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:06,773
I bet this house run them
in the double figures.

929
00:46:06,873 --> 00:46:08,242
- Hey, Madea.
- Hey!

930
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:10,344
- This is my mama, Kim.
- How you doin'?

931
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:12,346
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Medium.

932
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:14,280
And this is my daddy, Buddy.

933
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,083
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doin', Buddy?

934
00:46:16,182 --> 00:46:18,552
- I'm doing well.
- I see y'all brought a bag.

935
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,231
No, that's just my wife.

936
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,358
Forgive my husband. He is
just a horse's ass and a half.

937
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,360
- Wait. I smell cookin'.
- Yeah, that's Eileen.

938
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,496
- Her mama was up in there cooking.
- Where is she?

939
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:31,798
She was in the kitchen,
but she went to the backyard.

940
00:46:31,898 --> 00:46:33,733
Come on. Sit down. Take a load off.

941
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,469
Take a load off. Y'all sit a spell.

942
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,639
- Y'all want something to drink?
- I believe I'll have something.

943
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:41,641
I like you. You're a nice lady.

944
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:43,710
Don't be flirting with me
in front of your wife.

945
00:46:43,811 --> 00:46:46,585
If I put this thing on,
you won't be able to get rid of it.

946
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,884
I'll have him pay my rent,
car note and everything else.

947
00:46:49,983 --> 00:46:51,653
I'm from the old school.

948
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:54,387
Believe me, he can't help it.

949
00:46:54,487 --> 00:46:56,990
And if you can stand him,
you're welcome to him, right?

950
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,360
- Hey, Conner, get me a beer.
- Yes, sir.

951
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,927
Well, Miss Madea...

952
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,998
looks like we're gonna be spending
Christmas dinner together this year...

953
00:47:04,097 --> 00:47:05,565
but don't you worry.

954
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,836
We could care less you're black.

955
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,072
"African-American," Buddy.

956
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:15,074
Right, whatever. African-American.

957
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:17,478
That's all right. I don't care
that y'all are white America...

958
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,914
Angro... Angrola-Saxons...
Saxophonists.

959
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:23,253
I don't care. That don't matter at
all that y'all Anglo-Saxophonists.

960
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:25,518
I like her.

961
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,054
She's got a good sense of humor
and those big, sturdy feet.

962
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:31,391
You need a good sense of
humor with this group in here.

963
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:33,960
- Here, Daddy, beer. Drink up.
- Appreciate it.

964
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,231
- Please, drink up.
- I'll tell you what, Son.

965
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,666
That last girl you with
was so dadgum ugly...

966
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:41,869
my dog humped her leg
and shut his eyeballs.

967
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:44,708
Oh, stop it. He's awful!

968
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:49,576
"He shut his eyeballs." That's ugly.

969
00:47:49,675 --> 00:47:53,280
Please forgive my husband.
He is a wannabe comedian.

970
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,847
You are no Jeff Foxworthy.

971
00:47:54,947 --> 00:47:57,483
Well, I try to be,
but who can? Who can?

972
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,753
Did you hear the one about the
two rabbis and the black dude?

973
00:48:00,853 --> 00:48:02,588
- Daddy.
- No.

974
00:48:02,688 --> 00:48:05,159
Did you hear the one about the
stray bullet that killed the redneck...

975
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,460
for telling the story about the
rabbis and the black dude?

976
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:09,139
It's hilarious!

977
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,800
I got him, didn't I? I got him.

978
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,844
- Y'all get your ass shot.
- I like her. I do.

979
00:48:16,836 --> 00:48:19,041
I do too. She likes to hang.

980
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:22,608
No, ain't gonna be no
hanging around here now.

981
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,744
No, he didn't mean that.
He meant that...

982
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:27,547
You calm the hell down?
You are so politically correct.

983
00:48:27,648 --> 00:48:29,449
They're having fun.
I'm having fun too.

984
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,925
I wasn't offended.
Hell, I got a pistol.

985
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,188
I knew she knew that.
Let me ask you this.

986
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:36,757
Do you know Oprah?

987
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:38,659
Honey, I told you...

988
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:41,161
all black folk don't
necessarily know each other.

989
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,300
- Could've fooled me.
- Do I look like Paul Bunyan or what?

990
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,414
Actually, you sure in the hell do.
And the Jolly Green Giant too. Ho-ho-ho.

991
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,740
- Farmhand, please help me.
- His name is Conner.

992
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,875
Whew!

993
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,010
I think the tree...

994
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,079
would look good right here.

995
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:01,347
If you don't mind me butting in...

996
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:04,784
I think it would look really
pretty right here by the window...

997
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:07,554
and that way all the
passersby can enjoy it.

998
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,224
That's where we had it every year.

999
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:12,793
- And who are you?
- That's a pretty tree.

1000
00:49:12,893 --> 00:49:15,061
I am... I'm Conner's mom.

1001
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,641
That's Kim and that's Buddy.
These are Coroner's parents.

1002
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:22,902
This is Eileen. I wanna scream.
I mean, Eileen.

1003
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:27,974
Trees are for the family,
not for strangers.

1004
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:30,077
What the hell these
people doing here?

1005
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:33,257
Mama, they came to visit
Conner for Christmas.

1006
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,353
Really? That is just
like my daughter.

1007
00:49:39,452 --> 00:49:41,054
I raised you right.

1008
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:45,592
My daughter has always been
good with helping the help.

1009
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,728
Yes.

1010
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:50,530
- Where you staying?
- We're thinking of staying here.

1011
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,266
Yeah. We drove all the
way up from Louisiana...

1012
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,003
to spend Christmas
with Conner and Lacey.

1013
00:49:57,003 --> 00:49:59,914
It'll be a little cramped...

1014
00:50:00,673 --> 00:50:02,411
but we'll make do.

1015
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:07,081
Madea and I will share a room.

1016
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:09,382
You, Buddy and...

1017
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:10,550
Kim.

1018
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,920
Kim, take another room...

1019
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:14,855
- and Carver...
- Conner.

1020
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:16,255
- That's what I said.
- Conner.

1021
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:18,867
Yes, Carver, you can take the sofa.

1022
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,329
Let me get some decorations.

1023
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:24,931
Okay. I just...

1024
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:28,402
So many memories just coming
back to me bein' here.

1025
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:32,472
To tell you, Lacey, my mama,
she loved this place. She did.

1026
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:35,541
I'm so happy you all came
back here to take care of it.

1027
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,050
Welcome.

1028
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:40,114
Well, my daughter's
paying the mortgage...

1029
00:50:40,213 --> 00:50:42,449
so I hope you bring
in a crop this year.

1030
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:44,952
I told you not to buy this farm.

1031
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:48,989
That dam up north caused a lot of
problems this year for the farmers.

1032
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,693
But Conner, he's got him a new
strain of corn that takes less water.

1033
00:50:52,793 --> 00:50:54,427
Now, how's that work, Conner?

1034
00:50:54,527 --> 00:50:57,998
I studied agriculture
at New York State.

1035
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,632
Is that where you two met?

1036
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:01,367
Yeah. He's brilliant.

1037
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:04,271
Gets it from his old man.
Runs in the genes.

1038
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:07,641
At the science of it,
not so much the farming.

1039
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,010
So genius, little Einstein,
little Stephen Hawkins.

1040
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,114
We used to call him
"Smarty Britches" when he was little.

1041
00:51:14,213 --> 00:51:17,951
If you put some Viagra in that
tree's water, it'll stay up all year.

1042
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,860
You better put some Viagra in your water.
See what happen with your tree.

1043
00:51:25,192 --> 00:51:28,528
- All right, let's decorate.
- No, thank you. I can manage.

1044
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:31,431
I brought some decorations
from Atlanta...

1045
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,867
and I work at one of the
finest department stores...

1046
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:36,202
so I know a thing or two about taste.

1047
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,882
Where...

1048
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,273
Where did you get this tree?

1049
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:42,509
I mean, you have a beautiful
Christmas tree...

1050
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:46,121
right outside the kitchen
window and none in the house.

1051
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:49,893
What's wrong?

1052
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,552
Please don't tell me that's
your granddaddy's tree.

1053
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,153
Oh, dear God.

1054
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:57,324
Mama, was there a yellow ribbon
wrapped around that tree?

1055
00:51:57,423 --> 00:51:59,264
Yes, and I cut it off.

1056
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,130
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1057
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,934
What happened? What?

1058
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:07,967
My mama planted that tree...

1059
00:52:08,068 --> 00:52:10,545
in memory of my granddaddy.

1060
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:16,842
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

1061
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:18,679
This doesn't make any sense. Lacey.

1062
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:22,715
Did these people come
when you bought this land?

1063
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:26,693
This is your land now.
You can do what you want to with it.

1064
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,088
Excuse me.

1065
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,657
You don't look so good.

1066
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:32,992
Feeling a little light-headed.

1067
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:34,994
Well, sit down then. Sit down.

1068
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:36,503
Okay.

1069
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:41,068
It's all these strange people
in this house, that's what it is.

1070
00:52:41,168 --> 00:52:43,269
It ain't them people,
it's you! Hell, you!

1071
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,440
You lost your damn mind.
You done lost your damn mind!

1072
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:50,210
Anytime you see somebody with a
yellow ribbon on the tree, Eileen...

1073
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,945
a yellow ribbon,
that means a memoriam.

1074
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,248
Don't you know what that means?

1075
00:52:54,347 --> 00:52:56,717
Everybody in the USA knows
what a memoriam is...

1076
00:52:56,817 --> 00:52:58,818
when you see a yellow
ribbon on a damn tree.

1077
00:52:58,918 --> 00:53:00,487
You work on my nerves.

1078
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:03,889
That poor woman is probably crying
'cause you cut down her daddy's tree.

1079
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,958
What wrong with you,
cutting down her daddy's tree?

1080
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,128
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna make this plain.

1081
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:10,130
You're gonna go to bed,
slip into a coma...

1082
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,965
and everybody gonna wonder
what happened to you.

1083
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:14,635
I did it. It's Christmas, damn it!

1084
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:17,670
I don't know, Buddy.
I don't think I can deal with this.

1085
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:20,106
I don't like it. It's wrong.

1086
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:24,210
I can't pretend to be somebody.
I'm not an actress. I'm not Reba.

1087
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:27,079
Maybe we should just leave.
Let's pack up and leave tomorrow.

1088
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:29,081
No, we're not going back home.
We're staying here.

1089
00:53:29,181 --> 00:53:30,751
- It's Christmas.
- And that woman...

1090
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:34,655
she cuts down my daddy's memory tree
and acts like she doesn't even care!

1091
00:53:34,755 --> 00:53:36,722
Honey, I know. It stinks. I get it.

1092
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:38,791
You know what?
We'll get you another tree.

1093
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:41,927
I want that tree. I want my
daddy's tree. What about our son?

1094
00:53:42,027 --> 00:53:44,597
Conner just stands there and doesn't
say anything back to this woman.

1095
00:53:44,697 --> 00:53:47,668
He's just pretending,
just saying nothin' to this woman.

1096
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:51,538
Sweetheart, you know our kid.
He can't tell no to anybody.

1097
00:53:51,637 --> 00:53:53,106
Let him figure it out.

1098
00:53:53,206 --> 00:53:54,940
- You want some of this?
- No, not now.

1099
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:58,177
- You know you want some of this.
- I don't. It's too much for me.

1100
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,179
Remember that game we
played when we was kids?

1101
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,248
- Mystery Date?
- No, the Ghost and the Damsel.

1102
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:04,318
- You remember that?
- Buddy Williams...

1103
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:07,454
We are not playing... This is not the
time or the place. Don't you dare.

1104
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:09,822
Go take a cold shower
and get off of me.

1105
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:11,791
Go throw some milk on that thing.

1106
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:14,472
I think I left my bag in...

1107
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:17,509
one of my bags here.

1108
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:24,938
- You think she noticed me?
- Yes!

1109
00:54:25,038 --> 00:54:27,675
- Yes!
- Oh, damn.

1110
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,880
How to stop diabetes before it starts.
That's what AARP talking about.

1111
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,059
You got to read this,
this is pretty good.

1112
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,483
- Hi.
- Hey.

1113
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,820
Heard about the sponsorship?

1114
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:54,554
Yeah, just found out about it.

1115
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:57,123
- We got a problem.
- What's that?

1116
00:54:57,224 --> 00:54:59,463
Sponsor is Sheldon Construction.

1117
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:05,666
Same Sheldon Construction that built
the dam that put us all out of business?

1118
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:09,177
- That's the one.
- Hell no. You see?

1119
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:11,849
Unbelievable.

1120
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:18,360
Eileen, what you doin'?

1121
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,961
I knew it.

1122
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,231
He's in the Ku Klux Klan.

1123
00:55:22,331 --> 00:55:23,909
What?

1124
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,003
He was wearing the sheet
when I went in the room.

1125
00:55:28,103 --> 00:55:30,039
Them people are not
in no Ku Klux Klan.

1126
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,907
I saw the Klan today.
That ain't the Klan.

1127
00:55:32,007 --> 00:55:35,510
- They probably trying to make up the bed.
- I know the Klan when I see it.

1128
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,980
There you go, overreacting,
like you always do.

1129
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,557
- Yes, he is.
- Always jump to conclusions.

1130
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:42,717
Stop jumping to conclusions.

1131
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:45,228
No, baby. No.

1132
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,289
I know what I saw.

1133
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:49,425
Eileen, you gonna
get your pressure up.

1134
00:55:49,525 --> 00:55:54,063
I'm gonna sleep with
one eye open tonight.

1135
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:58,400
Yes. Oh, Lord, my poor daughter,
she's so naive.

1136
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:01,269
She don't know what's going on.
She don't have a clue.

1137
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:04,172
You don't have a clue, talkin'
about sleeping with one eye open.

1138
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:06,942
I hope it's not the lazy one,
'cause that one always look closed.

1139
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,844
Them people are not in the Klan.

1140
00:56:08,943 --> 00:56:11,112
You put all of this stuff
in front of that door.

1141
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:12,847
All that stuff in
front the damn door.

1142
00:56:12,947 --> 00:56:16,184
I go to the bathroom, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 times a night...

1143
00:56:16,284 --> 00:56:18,186
and if I laugh too hard,
I squirt pee.

1144
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:19,989
You got to move that stuff.

1145
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:23,465
How can I go to the bathroom at
night with all that in front the door?

1146
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:27,996
What this?

1147
00:56:28,097 --> 00:56:30,871
- I can't sit on this cup!
- Then stand up.

1148
00:57:09,804 --> 00:57:11,273
Conner, I'm sorry.

1149
00:57:11,373 --> 00:57:13,918
- Can I ask you something?
- What's that?

1150
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,581
- Are you ashamed of me?
- No.

1151
00:57:18,681 --> 00:57:20,815
Then why won't you tell her?

1152
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:24,987
I've never let my mother
down my entire life. Okay?

1153
00:57:25,086 --> 00:57:28,990
I've done everything
she wanted. Always.

1154
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,034
And this is the first time I've
done something that I want.

1155
00:57:33,561 --> 00:57:35,630
Conner, it's gonna break her heart.

1156
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:37,199
You gotta understand that.

1157
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:39,802
You have to understand
how this makes me feel.

1158
00:57:39,902 --> 00:57:43,380
I love you. I'm proud of us.
I don't care who knows.

1159
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:50,715
- Are you coming to bed?
- You mean the sofa, right?

1160
00:57:51,313 --> 00:57:53,715
You know the walls are thin.

1161
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:56,021
My patience is getting
there with this.

1162
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,862
And I told her, "You better
get the hell on out the way."

1163
00:58:07,963 --> 00:58:10,231
Lord, that was funny.
Your mama was something else.

1164
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:12,070
Here you are, Miss Murphy.

1165
00:58:13,434 --> 00:58:15,637
Three little eggs.

1166
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:17,545
Mama, it's fine.

1167
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,175
Would you like some coffee, Conner?

1168
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:23,322
No, I gotta tend to the animals.

1169
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:29,351
I can give you a few
pointers if you want to.

1170
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:31,353
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Okay, great.

1171
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:33,532
All right. I'll be outside
if y'all need me.

1172
00:58:34,123 --> 00:58:36,759
What kind of farmhand
don't know about farmin'?

1173
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:39,661
- He knows the science of it, Mama.
- No, I heard that last night.

1174
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:42,097
Wait. Why are you
always defending him?

1175
00:58:42,197 --> 00:58:44,777
'Cause she like him.

1176
00:58:46,201 --> 00:58:48,938
Over my dead body will she end
up with somebody like that.

1177
00:58:49,038 --> 00:58:50,548
Somebody like what?

1178
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,909
I don't wanna talk about it. We don't
make those kind of jokes, okay?

1179
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,045
Hush up, Dragon Lady.
Hush the hell up.

1180
00:58:57,146 --> 00:59:00,516
If she like him, she like him.
That's all that is. Just hush.

1181
00:59:00,615 --> 00:59:02,418
Excuse me. Good morning, y'all.

1182
00:59:02,518 --> 00:59:05,920
This room brings back
so many memories.

1183
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:07,889
Smells like farm.

1184
00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:09,458
Good morning, Miss Mandela.

1185
00:59:09,557 --> 00:59:11,534
Not Mandela, honey. Madea.

1186
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,762
Madea, honey. Hi, sweetheart.

1187
00:59:14,862 --> 00:59:16,798
Mrs. Williams,
would you like some coffee?

1188
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:20,135
- I'm gonna get it myself.
- Don't you have to go to school?

1189
00:59:20,235 --> 00:59:23,405
Actually, I do. I'm on my way.
I'll talk to you later.

1190
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:25,106
Bye, Miss Mandela.

1191
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:28,844
I had such a crazy,
crazy-ass dream last night.

1192
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:30,945
- Really?
- Yeah. What are you cooking?

1193
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:33,983
- Can I help? I'm good in the kitchen.
- No, I don't need your help.

1194
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,059
Eileen!

1195
00:59:35,983 --> 00:59:38,155
What? I don't need her help.

1196
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:43,057
I understand. I like to cook
alone myself sometimes too.

1197
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:44,626
- Thank you.
- All right then.

1198
00:59:44,726 --> 00:59:45,862
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1199
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,929
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1200
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,998
That ain't being Christian,
being that mean to that woman.

1201
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:52,735
I don't eat food from the KKK.

1202
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:56,405
That woman ain't in no KKK.
Hush that foolishness. Hell.

1203
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,773
- I love you, Son.
- Love you too.

1204
00:59:58,873 --> 01:00:00,476
Stay warm, okay?

1205
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:10,496
- Stop babying him.
- You need to start babying him.

1206
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,088
What's the matter with you?

1207
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:15,791
You did not need to be so
mean to that woman yesterday.

1208
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:18,092
She don't need to be
coming around here.

1209
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:21,030
She seems nice. She just
wants the best for Bailey.

1210
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:23,766
I know what's the best for Bailey,
and that's keeping this place running.

1211
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:25,501
He can learn something in school.

1212
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:28,036
Maybe become something
more than the two of us.

1213
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:31,012
Yeah? Well, school is
gonna have to wait.

1214
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,376
Gotta get these "poinsetters" sold.

1215
01:00:34,476 --> 01:00:37,813
Think I'm gonna go down to Harrisburg.
Try sell 'em over there.

1216
01:00:37,913 --> 01:00:40,748
If you would have talked to Lacey,
you would've found out...

1217
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,985
that she has got sponsorship for
the Jubilee, so it is happening.

1218
01:00:44,085 --> 01:00:46,454
So you can sell your
poinsettias at the Jubilee.

1219
01:00:46,554 --> 01:00:48,760
- Who's the sponsor?
- I don't know.

1220
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:54,195
Who does she think she is?

1221
01:00:54,295 --> 01:00:56,297
What you mad for, huh?

1222
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:58,400
The Jubilee is happening.

1223
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,536
We don't need her help.
She ain't from around here.

1224
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:04,873
- Well, that's just plain dumb.
- You watch your back talk, Amber.

1225
01:01:04,972 --> 01:01:07,349
And you watch your
front talk, Tanner.

1226
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:14,282
- Hi.
- Hey.

1227
01:01:14,882 --> 01:01:16,621
Heard about the sponsorship?

1228
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:19,355
Yeah, just found out about it.

1229
01:01:19,454 --> 01:01:21,923
- We got a problem.
- What's that?

1230
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:24,262
Sponsor is Sheldon Construction.

1231
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,465
Same Sheldon Construction that built
the dam that put us all out of business?

1232
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:33,976
- That's the one.
- Hell no. You see?

1233
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,648
Unbelievable.

1234
01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:41,856
There is no such thing
as "just a farm boy."

1235
01:01:41,956 --> 01:01:45,264
You are smart. You can
be anything you want.

1236
01:01:46,693 --> 01:01:49,931
I can only imagine if you could
just stay awake in class.

1237
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,666
- Are you up late at night?
- No, ma'am.

1238
01:01:52,766 --> 01:01:56,405
I want you to sing the lead
solo at the Christmas Jubilee.

1239
01:01:57,371 --> 01:01:59,273
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1240
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:01,782
- Yes, you can.
- No.

1241
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:05,851
You know what? I really
gotta go, Miss Williams.

1242
01:02:07,414 --> 01:02:09,791
My daddy's gonna be
waiting for me at home.

1243
01:02:12,643 --> 01:02:15,349
Child, these nipples so tough,
you need a mammogram.

1244
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:17,983
Don't look at me like that.

1245
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:20,684
- But you giving milk.
- Well, hello.

1246
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:23,063
Hey there.

1247
01:02:24,288 --> 01:02:26,789
- How are ya?
- Thems pigs was starving to death.

1248
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:29,592
I slopped them, and I've been
trying to get milk for Eileen.

1249
01:02:29,693 --> 01:02:32,128
- She's in there trying to cook something.
- Look, he's trying.

1250
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:35,331
- We sure do appreciate you helpin'.
- No. That's fine.

1251
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:38,469
I'll show him how to do it when he
come out of that laboratory thing.

1252
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:41,103
Look like he growing marijuana.
He ain't growing marijuana, is he?

1253
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:44,074
No, he ain't doing that.
Look, he's a smart kid, you know.

1254
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,481
He just, well...

1255
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:49,646
- What?
- I'm a truck driver.

1256
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:52,215
I'm out on the road a lot,
you know, and...

1257
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:55,485
he always stayed with his mom
and his grandparents here.

1258
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,655
I tell you what, it broke my
heart to be gone so much...

1259
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:02,860
but I just kind of feel a little
guilty about the way he turned out.

1260
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,429
- How he turn out?
- Kind of passive, I guess.

1261
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:07,731
Kind of lets people
walk all over him.

1262
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:11,934
I mean, he used to get beat
up a lot in school, bullied.

1263
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:13,704
- Oh, he's soft.
- He's soft.

1264
01:03:13,804 --> 01:03:16,340
This kid, Tanner, used to
beat him up all the time.

1265
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,342
And he still lives here, that Tanner.

1266
01:03:18,442 --> 01:03:21,043
When a person gets tired of a bully,
they handle it, you understand?

1267
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:24,581
You shut it down and you realize that
you ain't gonna deal with it no more.

1268
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:27,284
- Boy, that's the truth.
- Gotta wait for that.

1269
01:03:27,384 --> 01:03:29,719
Hey, we were just talking about you.

1270
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,288
- Yeah?
- It was all good stuff.

1271
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:33,356
- All good stuff.
- Good.

1272
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:36,094
That one, she just will
not let you milk her.

1273
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,666
- The black-and-white one?
- Yep.

1274
01:03:41,797 --> 01:03:45,402
There's a reason why you couldn't get
milk from the black-and-white one, son.

1275
01:03:47,436 --> 01:03:50,074
If somebody pull on your testicles,
will you give 'em milk?

1276
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,342
Don't answer that.

1277
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:55,144
That's a bull.
You can't milk no bull.

1278
01:03:55,244 --> 01:03:57,324
You serious, trying to milk a bull?

1279
01:03:58,447 --> 01:03:59,617
Blessed.

1280
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:03,320
Son, you got to slop them
pigs early in the morning.

1281
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,822
Then you gotta milk these cows
'cause they nipples is tough.

1282
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:09,525
And you can't be gentle.
You got to pull them nipples.

1283
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,695
You got to pull them things.
Pull 'em hard.

1284
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:14,231
Pull 'em. Pull 'em. Pull 'em.

1285
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:18,708
You're used to that. Hell, his mama
breast-fed him until he was in ninth grade.

1286
01:04:19,702 --> 01:04:23,250
Shut your mouth! Ninth grade?
Her nipples ought to have corrosion.

1287
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,208
Yeah. That's right.
You ought to see them things.

1288
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:28,478
They look like cake decorator bags.

1289
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,447
Dad, stop it. Come on.

1290
01:04:31,547 --> 01:04:35,152
Y'all, sometimes I just think
I'm not cut out for this.

1291
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:38,663
Well, hey, it's just a nipple!

1292
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,157
Daddy, I'm talking about farming.

1293
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:43,059
Well, hey, farming's hard, Son.

1294
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:45,068
Yes, farming's hard.
You know what else is hard?

1295
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:47,030
Keeping up a lie...

1296
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,766
'cause the longer you let it live,
the harder it is to kill.

1297
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:51,668
- Ain't that right?
- You got that right.

1298
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,603
You're a smart woman.

1299
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:56,606
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

1300
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:58,507
I'm talking about you and Lacey.

1301
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:00,744
You wanna tell Eileen, or you
want me to tell her y'all together?

1302
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:02,981
- Daddy!
- Hey, I didn't say nothin'.

1303
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:05,248
- Who told you?
- You just did.

1304
01:05:05,347 --> 01:05:07,384
Whole body language. Tensed up.

1305
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:09,885
When I walked in the house
the other day, I saw them shoes.

1306
01:05:09,985 --> 01:05:12,322
I see the way you look at her,
the way she look at you.

1307
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:14,958
- Y'all need to say something.
- It's not me. I wanna tell her.

1308
01:05:15,057 --> 01:05:17,960
It's Lacey. She says she doesn't
think she can handle it.

1309
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:20,297
We just need a defibrillator.
She gonna have a heart attack.

1310
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:22,032
She gonna clutch the pearls and die.

1311
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:24,201
But we'll get a defibrillator.
She'll be all right.

1312
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,380
But it's all right.
Y'all just dating.

1313
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:28,338
Dating?

1314
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,552
They're married.

1315
01:05:32,074 --> 01:05:33,585
Oh, she dead.

1316
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:35,751
Flatline. Just...

1317
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,983
Dead. Lord have mercy,
that's going to kill her.

1318
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,418
Lacey said she's gonna
tell her on Christmas.

1319
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:44,420
She fixin' to kill her
mama on Christmas Day?

1320
01:05:44,521 --> 01:05:47,123
- What kind of Christmas present is that?
- Oh, damn.

1321
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:50,027
Y'all better have some
nitroglycerin or something.

1322
01:05:50,126 --> 01:05:52,094
That's a damn shame.
Gonna kill that woman on...

1323
01:05:52,195 --> 01:05:54,275
Hell, I'm stuck in the mud.

1324
01:05:56,867 --> 01:05:58,168
Hell, this ain't mud!

1325
01:05:58,268 --> 01:06:00,813
- You all right?
- I done fell in bull...

1326
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:07,579
Keep going. Help each other out.

1327
01:06:09,012 --> 01:06:11,414
- Hi. What's going on?
- It's bad.

1328
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:13,315
Oliver called and told the mayor...

1329
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:17,420
that we couldn't have any references
to the nativity or Jesus.

1330
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:20,257
- What?
- The sponsors don't want it.

1331
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:22,958
No. No, something
is wrong. I'll call him.

1332
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:25,139
Well, the mayor wants to see you now.

1333
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,172
- Come on.
- Okay.

1334
01:06:29,331 --> 01:06:31,070
Who does he think he is?

1335
01:06:32,768 --> 01:06:34,538
All right! That's enough!

1336
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:36,806
That's enough!

1337
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:38,641
One at a time!

1338
01:06:38,742 --> 01:06:40,376
I'm very upset.

1339
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:42,878
She is trying to take
Christ out of Christmas.

1340
01:06:42,978 --> 01:06:45,715
Next thing you know they'll
wanna take prayer out of church!

1341
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:47,784
You see what happened when
they took prayer out of schools.

1342
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:48,851
We did.

1343
01:06:48,952 --> 01:06:51,221
Wilbur, what does it say?

1344
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,858
Well, the contract says...
no nativity.

1345
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,494
No Jesus reference whatsoever.

1346
01:06:57,594 --> 01:06:59,996
Not even a little drummer boy.

1347
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,565
Unbelievable.

1348
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,666
Why didn't it say that the
first time you read it?

1349
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,936
Well, it was in the small print.

1350
01:07:06,036 --> 01:07:08,003
I didn't have my glasses on.

1351
01:07:08,103 --> 01:07:10,539
I didn't have my glasses on!
I couldn't see!

1352
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:12,375
- This is awful!
- Wait.

1353
01:07:12,474 --> 01:07:14,554
This has got to be a mistake.

1354
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:17,280
Let me call Oliver. How about that?

1355
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,682
All righty. You go right ahead.

1356
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:21,918
I've already talked to him
about this, but have at it.

1357
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:23,425
Okay.

1358
01:07:24,353 --> 01:07:26,364
- Put it on speaker.
- Yeah.

1359
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:28,436
Okay.

1360
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,702
Hello?

1361
01:07:38,802 --> 01:07:42,105
- Hi Oliver.
- Hey. Guess you talked to the mayor.

1362
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:45,275
Yes, we are all here on speakerphone.

1363
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,577
Yeah, I don't see
what the big deal is.

1364
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:50,480
They want it to be called Holiday
Jubilee instead of Christmas.

1365
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:52,782
Yeah, and they don't need
references to religious figures.

1366
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,786
How do we talk about Christmas
without talking about Jesus?

1367
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:58,121
- Yeah, how do we?
- It happens all the time,

1368
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:00,190
Santa Claus is okay.

1369
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,960
Make it about Santa Claus and
not about the birth of Christ.

1370
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:08,231
And the songs for the Jubilee should
be about everything but Christ.

1371
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:11,501
Sing songs like Here Comes
Santa Claus, White Christmas.

1372
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,036
White Christmas.

1373
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:16,038
There ain't nothing white about
a Bucktussle, Alabama Christmas!

1374
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:17,873
- It don't snow here!
- That's right.

1375
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:21,043
Okay, Oliver, we did not
sign up for this. Okay?

1376
01:08:21,144 --> 01:08:22,612
Yes, you did.

1377
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,917
I am a Christian,
and this is some bull...

1378
01:08:28,518 --> 01:08:30,787
The heads of the company are
coming down on a private jet...

1379
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:32,021
A private jet.

1380
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:33,856
To be filmed with the
school at the Jubilee,

1381
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:35,992
I did you a favor here,
and this will ruin me.

1382
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:37,993
You can't do this to me now.

1383
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:42,164
I can't just turn them around.
You have to figure this one out.

1384
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:44,667
- You hold on there, son.
- That's right. You get it straight.

1385
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:47,671
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor,
you got the money and we have a deal.

1386
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,738
- Give him his money back.
- Yeah.

1387
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:51,307
- We spent it.
- Yeah.

1388
01:08:51,408 --> 01:08:53,042
- On what?
- The Jubilee!

1389
01:08:53,143 --> 01:08:56,712
And much-needed school supplies.
And catching up on school bills.

1390
01:08:56,813 --> 01:08:59,615
Listen, I'm sorry, but we're coming.

1391
01:08:59,716 --> 01:09:02,051
This is my career
you're talking about.

1392
01:09:02,152 --> 01:09:03,730
I'll see you tomorrow.

1393
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,456
Move, move. Now, watch out.

1394
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:10,594
Well, now this is a fine
mess you've gotten us into.

1395
01:09:10,694 --> 01:09:12,162
She should be fired.

1396
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:14,530
- Now hold on a second.
- Mr. Mayor...

1397
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:16,099
have you heard?

1398
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:18,167
We were talking about the
changes they want made.

1399
01:09:18,268 --> 01:09:21,975
That's not what I was talking about.
I was talking about the sponsor.

1400
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:24,673
- Sheldon Construction.
- What?

1401
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,243
That's right.

1402
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:27,810
The same folks...

1403
01:09:27,911 --> 01:09:31,146
that built a dam to save Jasper
and left us without a river.

1404
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:33,250
She brought this mess here
and she should be fired.

1405
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,150
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring...

1406
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:38,921
We don't care what the
hell you meant. Do we?

1407
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,523
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1408
01:09:40,622 --> 01:09:42,658
You brought an awful situation here.

1409
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:44,860
Get out of here and let us handle it.

1410
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:47,264
- Go back to wherever you come from.
- Now hold on.

1411
01:09:47,363 --> 01:09:49,171
You do not have to
talk to her like that.

1412
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:51,412
Mr. Mayor.

1413
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:54,604
You fire her. Right now.

1414
01:09:54,703 --> 01:09:56,545
Do it.

1415
01:09:58,007 --> 01:10:01,645
- Lacey, I'm sorry.
- There we go.

1416
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:05,225
I understand.

1417
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:11,020
You believe that? Sheldon.

1418
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:13,029
This is a hell of a mess.

1419
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,403
You all do your homework, okay?

1420
01:10:26,903 --> 01:10:30,176
And... be good for your new teacher.

1421
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:33,820
Where are you going?

1422
01:10:36,246 --> 01:10:37,984
I made a mistake...

1423
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,917
and now I have to leave.

1424
01:10:41,016 --> 01:10:44,894
No. I'll sing. I'll do the solo.

1425
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:49,059
I don't think there's gonna be
a Christmas Jubilee this year.

1426
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:51,161
I don't want you to go.

1427
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:53,563
Bailey, you are so special.

1428
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:56,140
You always remember that.

1429
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,337
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

1430
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:02,015
You all are.

1431
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:05,886
I'll see you.

1432
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:10,046
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

1433
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,253
Good job, boys.

1434
01:11:24,094 --> 01:11:26,061
I just got done telling Madea...

1435
01:11:26,162 --> 01:11:29,298
that you was in here all alone
with Eileen, and she said that...

1436
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:32,445
I said you was in here with
the beast of the southern wild.

1437
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:36,206
I tried. That woman is stubborn.

1438
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:38,875
I tried. I asked her if
I could help her cook.

1439
01:11:38,975 --> 01:11:40,443
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

1440
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:42,444
Yeah, I know. She's difficult.

1441
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:44,514
It's all right. She got a problem,
but it's all right.

1442
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:46,783
- Y'all want some lemonade?
- No, I'm good.

1443
01:11:46,882 --> 01:11:48,518
- I'm good. Thank you.
- There you are.

1444
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:51,020
I've been worried about you.

1445
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:54,090
You were out there
with them for a while.

1446
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,158
Yeah. I was conflicted.

1447
01:11:56,259 --> 01:12:00,896
I didn't know if I should look
for you or watch the food.

1448
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:03,600
I didn't let her near our food.

1449
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:08,570
You whisper like a damn bullhorn.
That woman ain't gonna hurt us.

1450
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:10,640
We don't know that, do we?

1451
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:12,375
What y'all talking about over there?

1452
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:14,782
She just thinks y'all
are tryin' to kill us.

1453
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:17,780
- Tryin' to kill you?
- Good heavens!

1454
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:20,350
- You're nuts!
- I've never hurt a flea or a fly.

1455
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:22,418
I've seen her shoot
a deer once though.

1456
01:12:22,519 --> 01:12:25,822
I never. I would never shoot little
Bambi sipping water in a pond.

1457
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,858
I'm just gonna ask y'all.
I'm gonna put it out on the table.

1458
01:12:28,957 --> 01:12:30,326
- Be honest.
- What is it?

1459
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:32,163
Y'all in the Ku Klux Klan?

1460
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:34,930
- That's what she wanna know.
- Get outta here!

1461
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:37,000
Heavens no. Why would she...

1462
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,868
- Buddy, the other night with the sheet.
- Oh, with the sheet!

1463
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,470
Yes! Explain that.

1464
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,539
We used to play this game, all right?

1465
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,542
Buddy and I, when we
were young, he would...

1466
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:48,278
It was called the
Ghost and the Damsel.

1467
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:50,345
And he would blindfold me.

1468
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:52,916
Then he'd put a sheet
above himself...

1469
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:55,051
and then I would have
to search about...

1470
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:57,186
and capture the rapture,
if you know what I mean.

1471
01:12:57,287 --> 01:12:58,854
Mama!

1472
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:00,457
I am sorry, Conner.

1473
01:13:00,556 --> 01:13:02,826
- That's just nasty.
- Sorry, Son.

1474
01:13:02,926 --> 01:13:05,060
- But I like it.
- I know.

1475
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,529
It can be fun. It can be.

1476
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:10,466
That is so inappropriate.

1477
01:13:10,567 --> 01:13:14,136
You two need to learn how to
respect my daughter's house.

1478
01:13:15,003 --> 01:13:17,774
- Eileen, you might wanna let that go.
- No.

1479
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:19,943
They come in here taking
advantage of her...

1480
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:23,445
eating her food, and they're
acting like they own the place.

1481
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:25,715
- I don't like it.
- You need to let that go.

1482
01:13:25,814 --> 01:13:28,417
Well, I don't like...

1483
01:13:28,518 --> 01:13:30,686
- Mama...
- that you...

1484
01:13:30,787 --> 01:13:32,255
Mama, sit down.

1485
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:34,890
You cut down my family's memory tree.

1486
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,960
That's what I don't like.

1487
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,560
Excuse me?

1488
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:41,663
I can deal with a lot of things.
They know it.

1489
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:44,199
But this is downright wrong...

1490
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,243
and now I am getting very upset!

1491
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:51,240
Why would you plant his memory
tree on my daughter's land...

1492
01:13:51,341 --> 01:13:53,309
and how was I supposed to know that?

1493
01:13:53,408 --> 01:13:55,377
Oh, I don't know.

1494
01:13:55,478 --> 01:13:58,480
Maybe because it had a
yellow ribbon around it?

1495
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,182
That doesn't mean anything.

1496
01:14:00,283 --> 01:14:03,720
In most countries, in most places,
to sane-thinking people...

1497
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:06,488
a yellow ribbon means something.

1498
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:10,560
Now you just calm down, missy. Okay?

1499
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:14,663
Now, Lacey, are you gonna
let her talk to me like this?

1500
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:16,666
- Mama, calm down.
- Put your finger down...

1501
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:19,005
or I will cut it off and deep-fry it!

1502
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:22,838
You need to leave my
daughter's house.

1503
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:24,806
- Mama, stop it! Stop!
- No!

1504
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:26,775
Eileen, you need to
stop right now, honey.

1505
01:14:26,876 --> 01:14:29,712
What are they doing here anyway?
Tomorrow is Christmas!

1506
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:31,346
They are not your family!

1507
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:33,682
- Let's get out of here.
- No, hold up.

1508
01:14:33,783 --> 01:14:36,085
Come on back here.
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

1509
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:38,820
- Now, Madea...
- Ain't nobody goin' no damn where.

1510
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:40,890
Madea, whose side are you on?

1511
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:43,359
- Let 'em leave.
- No, I'm on the side of right.

1512
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,561
- That's the side I'm on. Lacey?
- Yes.

1513
01:14:45,662 --> 01:14:48,664
- Tell your mama.
- What? Tell me what?

1514
01:14:48,765 --> 01:14:52,005
Spit it out before I punch you,
put your teeth down your throat!

1515
01:14:54,537 --> 01:14:57,480
Mama... Conner and I are married.

1516
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:03,987
- Catch her.
- Get the defibrillator.

1517
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:11,730
Lacey. Your father.

1518
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:15,692
I know, Mama. I know he was
murdered by a white man, but...

1519
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:17,292
- What happened?
- What?

1520
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:20,662
My father was killed by a
white man on Christmas Eve...

1521
01:15:20,762 --> 01:15:22,564
trying to protect my mother's honor.

1522
01:15:22,664 --> 01:15:24,667
- That's awful.
- Good Lord.

1523
01:15:24,766 --> 01:15:27,770
- Who told you that?
- Mama.

1524
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:31,039
Eileen, you oughta be ashamed...
Child, that's some straight-up bull...

1525
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,547
Madea!

1526
01:15:33,141 --> 01:15:35,721
Your daddy wasn't
killed by no white man.

1527
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:38,680
He left your mama for a white
woman when you was two...

1528
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:41,117
and your mama has been bitter
with white people ever since.

1529
01:15:41,216 --> 01:15:42,685
- What?
- Yes, years ago.

1530
01:15:42,784 --> 01:15:47,090
Ran off and joined the circus.
And now they on Glee,

1531
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:48,658
Good show.

1532
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,600
Glee? Mama, is this true?

1533
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:54,197
Mama!

1534
01:15:54,296 --> 01:15:59,935
Lacey, I am so disappointed in you.

1535
01:16:00,036 --> 01:16:02,412
Look at her trying to
turn it around on you.

1536
01:16:03,405 --> 01:16:04,984
Girl, please.

1537
01:16:09,746 --> 01:16:11,552
You're disappointed in me?

1538
01:16:12,314 --> 01:16:14,550
Well, that went well.

1539
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:16,957
At least she didn't have
another heart attack.

1540
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:20,657
- Another one?
- Yeah, Madea.

1541
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:23,659
Didn't you know that my mother
had a heart attack last year?

1542
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,895
Your mama lied to you. She had gas.

1543
01:16:25,994 --> 01:16:28,831
Got to the doctor, she was clutching
her heart and the pearls.

1544
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:31,234
Got there, doctor say it's gas.

1545
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:34,837
- Wait, what?
- They put one of them rods up there.

1546
01:16:34,936 --> 01:16:37,806
Came flowing out like the River Jordan
and that was it. It was all over.

1547
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:39,375
I had that once too.

1548
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,978
Put it in there, come out sounding
like brakes coming out of...

1549
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:44,488
The air pressure coming
out of one of them big rigs.

1550
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:47,750
There it is. Then they tell
her she had heartburn.

1551
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,586
- She didn't have no heart attack.
- She had heartburn?

1552
01:16:50,685 --> 01:16:53,323
She needs some of that Prilosec OTC.

1553
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:57,426
She been manipulating you.
She as healthy as an ox.

1554
01:16:57,527 --> 01:16:59,628
Well, that woman's a
pretty pissed off ox.

1555
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:02,109
Don't get behind her.

1556
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:06,502
Don't light a match. Don't get
her next to an open flame.

1557
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:08,070
We'll all have burnt heads.

1558
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:10,841
Yeah, her farts can spell
her name, they so bad.

1559
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:17,180
- Mama, he got her fired.
- That's all right. I'm upset too.

1560
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:20,451
We should go, boy. We got work to do.

1561
01:17:23,386 --> 01:17:25,587
Why'd you do that to Mrs. Williams?

1562
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:28,658
You know, she's a nice lady.
Why'd you get her fired?

1563
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:30,792
You don't know what's
going on here, Bailey.

1564
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:33,395
I know you don't like people
'cause of the way they look.

1565
01:17:33,496 --> 01:17:36,439
That ain't right! That's what
kids do to me at school!

1566
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:41,009
It ain't fair. She's nice to me.

1567
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:44,207
Don't you ever...

1568
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:46,274
talk to me like that again.

1569
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,144
You hear me?

1570
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:50,323
Get out on that plow.

1571
01:17:55,952 --> 01:17:57,920
He is right, and you know it.

1572
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,921
She made a deal with the devil.

1573
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:02,859
No, you're actin' more like
the devil than she is.

1574
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:05,038
And this is Christmas, Tanner.

1575
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:19,742
This child still sitting out there.
That's just crazy as hell.

1576
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:21,310
Where y'all going?

1577
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:23,179
Well, Miss Media,
we're gonna bring her...

1578
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:24,747
My name is Madea, honey.

1579
01:18:24,846 --> 01:18:26,314
- Madea.
- Thank you.

1580
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:28,917
We're gonna bring her hot chocolate
to warm her hard, hard heart.

1581
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:31,256
Hot chocolate does wonders.
It's delicious.

1582
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:34,791
That's what got y'all in trouble,
the hot chocolate.

1583
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:36,993
Your son with the hot chocolate.

1584
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,060
I'm telling you. Let me
explain something to you.

1585
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:40,962
Let me make this clear to y'all.

1586
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:43,032
Leave her out there.
She is grown, sitting there.

1587
01:18:43,131 --> 01:18:46,101
If she want to come in the house,
she know how to get in. Leave her alone.

1588
01:18:46,202 --> 01:18:48,938
We're gonna go out and try.
We'll talk to her a bit.

1589
01:18:49,037 --> 01:18:50,506
Go on. Go on.

1590
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:52,542
Okay. You better wear a cup.

1591
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:54,220
That's comforting.

1592
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:03,286
Boy, this is something else,
isn't it? It's freezing.

1593
01:19:03,386 --> 01:19:05,387
Remember, Buddy,
kill her with kindness.

1594
01:19:05,488 --> 01:19:07,457
My weenie is an inny right now.

1595
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:11,092
Try to have as much charm with your
voice as you do with your weenie.

1596
01:19:11,193 --> 01:19:13,895
Well, tell you what.
I ain't used to this cold weather.

1597
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:16,131
I know. All right?

1598
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:18,201
I'm gonna have to wipe
with an ice scraper tonight.

1599
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:20,603
Smile's all in patience.
Ask the Lord.

1600
01:19:20,703 --> 01:19:22,805
Lord, help us. The Serenity Prayer.

1601
01:19:22,904 --> 01:19:26,676
There ain't no cabs out here.
You wanna come back in the house?

1602
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:28,310
I'm fine right here.

1603
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:30,889
I made you some pipin' hot chocolate.

1604
01:19:31,546 --> 01:19:34,417
Thank you. I don't
want any chocolate.

1605
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:36,255
My son likes chocolate.

1606
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,756
Go ahead and laugh. This is awful.

1607
01:19:40,855 --> 01:19:43,592
What's so awful about it?

1608
01:19:43,693 --> 01:19:47,296
What world are you living in?
They are asking for trouble.

1609
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:48,831
Eileen, I...

1610
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:51,100
Mrs. Murphy to you.

1611
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,170
Miss Murphy, you can take a knife
and cut all three of us right now.

1612
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,238
You know what's gonna happen?
We're gonna bleed red.

1613
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,740
Blood red. We're all the same inside.

1614
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,510
That's true.

1615
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:03,884
Mrs. Murphy, if I may...

1616
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,951
our children, no matter what we think,
they will live their own lives.

1617
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:12,654
- The world is changing.
- Not that much.

1618
01:20:12,755 --> 01:20:16,359
It is changing,
and that is a good thing.

1619
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:20,195
Every generation sees
a little less division...

1620
01:20:20,296 --> 01:20:25,402
and a little more open
minds and open hearts.

1621
01:20:26,534 --> 01:20:29,505
I think we should be
happy and proud...

1622
01:20:29,604 --> 01:20:32,041
that our kids, our children...

1623
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:35,744
see people as people.

1624
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:37,646
That was beautiful.

1625
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:39,814
- That was unbelievable.
- Thank you. I mean it.

1626
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:42,585
Come in the house and get
to know us. We're good folks.

1627
01:20:42,685 --> 01:20:45,520
I know damn well you hear
me calling you. Eileen!

1628
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:47,355
Traitor!

1629
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:49,391
- Satan!
- Judas!

1630
01:20:49,492 --> 01:20:51,092
Beelzebub!

1631
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:52,694
Come in. It is cold.

1632
01:20:52,795 --> 01:20:55,398
You got these people out here trying
to tempt you back in the house...

1633
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:58,568
like a wet cat on a cold Sunday
morning who needs some milk.

1634
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,302
Come in the house.
You're out here freezing.

1635
01:21:00,403 --> 01:21:03,805
Your ankles is whiter than snow.
Look like you been kicking flour.

1636
01:21:03,905 --> 01:21:06,247
My gosh, they are white.
Look, we are related.

1637
01:21:07,176 --> 01:21:10,579
I will not step into
that house of lies.

1638
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,315
The girl is married. You can't
control every minute of her life.

1639
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:15,150
Do you understand? It is Christmas.

1640
01:21:15,251 --> 01:21:18,720
Give this child the gift of being
able to do whatever she want to do.

1641
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:21,890
You can't run her life for her.
Do you understand that?

1642
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,560
Ain't no cab comin'. You gonna
be sitting out here freezin'.

1643
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:27,529
We gonna come out here tomorrow,
you gonna be a black Statue of Liberty...

1644
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,265
just sitting down on your ass.

1645
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:31,600
Come on in the house!
You know what? That's fine.

1646
01:21:31,701 --> 01:21:33,703
You don't want to come in
'cause you mad about something?

1647
01:21:33,802 --> 01:21:35,805
You can't get everything your way.

1648
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:39,074
You ever woke up on Christmas morning
and didn't get the gift you wanted?

1649
01:21:39,175 --> 01:21:42,310
This is it. You didn't get the gift you
wanted. Bring your ass in the house.

1650
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:44,646
Y'all wastin' your time,
'cause she stubborn as a mule.

1651
01:21:44,747 --> 01:21:47,984
I'm going in. You wanna sit out here
and freeze, sit your ass out here...

1652
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:50,386
sit your ass out here and freeze!

1653
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:52,622
Sit there as long as you want.
I don't give a damn.

1654
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:54,689
Sit there and turn
into a damn Popsicle!

1655
01:21:54,789 --> 01:21:57,827
Freeze all the hell you want.
You done lost your damn mind!

1656
01:21:57,926 --> 01:21:59,335
Amen.

1657
01:22:03,064 --> 01:22:06,469
Come on inside. You'll freeze
to death. Ain't no cab coming.

1658
01:22:06,569 --> 01:22:08,871
- I can't believe that.
- We tried our best.

1659
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:11,006
Let's go in and play
charades with Madea.

1660
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:13,186
Then I will walk to town.

1661
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,650
And I'll take the Greyhound bus.

1662
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:25,563
I don't need none of them.
Not one of them.

1663
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:32,033
Hey.

1664
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:36,498
Your mama's still out in the cold.
You may want to talk to her.

1665
01:22:36,599 --> 01:22:39,502
- She doesn't want to talk to me.
- You sure about that?

1666
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:41,237
I know my mother.

1667
01:22:41,337 --> 01:22:43,872
Apparently you don't know
her as well as you think.

1668
01:22:43,972 --> 01:22:45,940
And what's that supposed to mean?

1669
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:49,511
She's been manipulating
you your entire life.

1670
01:22:49,612 --> 01:22:53,515
She lied to you about your daddy
and about her heart attacks.

1671
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:55,083
It's just not right.

1672
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:57,086
Can you stop talking
about my mother now?

1673
01:22:57,185 --> 01:23:00,389
I'm not talkin' about your mother.
I'm just statin' the obvious.

1674
01:23:00,488 --> 01:23:02,291
I'm not trying to attack you or her.

1675
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:04,527
Good, because I've been
attacked enough today.

1676
01:23:04,627 --> 01:23:08,963
Between my mother and my job and...
It's just all a bit much.

1677
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:11,667
And everybody's mad at me
because of the sponsor...

1678
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:14,506
I didn't know it was from
Sheldon Construction Company.

1679
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:17,283
Tanner McCoy. Yeah, okay.

1680
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:20,547
- What about Tanner?
- Nothing.

1681
01:23:21,342 --> 01:23:23,719
- Baby.
- I said "nothing."

1682
01:23:24,814 --> 01:23:26,894
What did Tanner do?

1683
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,887
He was so nasty.
And then he got me fired.

1684
01:23:34,722 --> 01:23:36,859
- Conner.
- Son of a bitch.

1685
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,061
Conner, where are you going?

1686
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:42,898
- Hey, what's going on?
- I mentioned Tanner and he lost it.

1687
01:23:42,997 --> 01:23:45,467
- Conner!
- I've been waiting to see this.

1688
01:23:45,568 --> 01:23:47,569
- I'm goin' with you, boy.
- Conner!

1689
01:23:54,369 --> 01:23:55,703
Conner!

1690
01:24:05,688 --> 01:24:09,591
Hot dog, it's cold out here.
It's all right. It's all right then.

1691
01:24:09,692 --> 01:24:11,100
Help!

1692
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:18,934
What in the...
Oh, Jesus, no, you don't.

1693
01:24:19,033 --> 01:24:23,305
- Hey.
- Someone there? Hello?

1694
01:24:23,404 --> 01:24:25,109
I'm here.

1695
01:24:27,643 --> 01:24:29,221
I can't move.

1696
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,516
All right now. We gotta
get outta here. Come on.

1697
01:24:35,016 --> 01:24:36,484
- I'm stuck.
- Can you move your...

1698
01:24:36,585 --> 01:24:38,130
My leg's caught.

1699
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,899
I don't wanna die.

1700
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:43,603
- Nobody's gonna die.
- I have a little boy.

1701
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:47,073
Push.

1702
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:50,899
I got you.

1703
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,101
Got it.

1704
01:24:54,536 --> 01:24:56,206
Go ahead.

1705
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:00,587
I got you.

1706
01:25:23,798 --> 01:25:27,108
You're good. How are your legs? Okay.

1707
01:25:29,203 --> 01:25:30,672
- How's your head?
- All right.

1708
01:25:30,773 --> 01:25:33,614
All right. Get up. Get up.

1709
01:25:35,444 --> 01:25:37,524
Help. Help.

1710
01:25:39,314 --> 01:25:41,860
Get off my mother-in-law,
you son of a bitch!

1711
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,720
- Hey! Don't hurt him! Stop it!
- Leave him be!

1712
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,355
Come on!

1713
01:25:47,456 --> 01:25:50,893
Don't you ever, ever say a word to
my wife again. You understand me?

1714
01:25:50,993 --> 01:25:53,695
- What did he say about Lacey?
- Get in the truck.

1715
01:25:53,796 --> 01:25:55,698
I will not step foot
back in that house!

1716
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:57,765
I am not in the mood
for your foolishness.

1717
01:25:57,865 --> 01:25:59,569
Now get your ass in that truck!

1718
01:26:01,904 --> 01:26:03,639
Now I'm plantin' corn...

1719
01:26:03,738 --> 01:26:07,082
and there ain't a damn
thing you can do about it.

1720
01:26:18,186 --> 01:26:19,765
Get out of here.

1721
01:26:34,603 --> 01:26:36,505
Babe, I wish you
wouldn't have done that.

1722
01:26:36,604 --> 01:26:37,907
It had to be done.

1723
01:26:38,006 --> 01:26:40,909
Nothing stops somebody like him from
bullying people except pushing back.

1724
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:44,646
That's right. That kid's been a terror
to Conner since he was a little boy.

1725
01:26:44,747 --> 01:26:47,515
I'm glad you done what you did, Son.
I'm proud of you.

1726
01:26:47,615 --> 01:26:50,219
Stood up for himself,
and that's a good thing.

1727
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:51,921
I'm with you, Lacey. I don't like it.

1728
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,988
I just wanna tell you
all how sorry I am.

1729
01:26:54,088 --> 01:26:56,425
I should have told my
mom from the beginning.

1730
01:26:56,524 --> 01:26:59,028
That is the truth.
You should've told her.

1731
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:01,963
We have met your mama
and we understand.

1732
01:27:02,064 --> 01:27:04,033
She crazy as hell. Didn't I tell you?

1733
01:27:04,132 --> 01:27:06,270
- She's cuckoo.
- That's right.

1734
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,537
I don't like you all
talking about me.

1735
01:27:09,637 --> 01:27:11,273
No, Mrs. Murphy, I'm sorry.

1736
01:27:11,372 --> 01:27:14,109
We were just saying that God
makes everyone different...

1737
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:17,289
and you are a gem in God's ring.

1738
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:22,650
And I don't like the
way you spoke to me.

1739
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:25,453
Well, I'm sorry. I was angry.

1740
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:29,725
- What did you say?
- He told her to get her ass in the truck.

1741
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:33,064
- And what did you do?
- She got her ass in the truck.

1742
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:36,265
Go ahead and laugh.

1743
01:27:36,364 --> 01:27:38,500
Hold on, Eileen.
Y'all need to let all this go.

1744
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,569
You lied. She done lie. Everybody lied.
Here a lie, there a lie.

1745
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:44,573
It's Christmas now. You need to
go down there and buy her a tree.

1746
01:27:44,672 --> 01:27:47,141
And plant it in the backyard.
Get her a ribbon.

1747
01:27:47,242 --> 01:27:48,711
- A yellow one.
- I'm sorry.

1748
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,613
I just wanted to give my
daughter a proper wedding.

1749
01:27:51,712 --> 01:27:54,149
Mama, you've always been overbearing.

1750
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:57,118
I did it for me. Not for you.

1751
01:27:57,219 --> 01:28:00,055
I love you, and I'm sorry...

1752
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:02,323
that I didn't tell you,
but this is my life.

1753
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:06,028
And he loves me,
and he treats me oh so well.

1754
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:09,264
I'm sorry. I just didn't
want you to get hurt.

1755
01:28:09,363 --> 01:28:13,002
Mama, he's not gonna hurt me.
He's as gentle as a lamb.

1756
01:28:14,735 --> 01:28:17,748
No, he's not. He beat that
man down to the ground.

1757
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:21,476
Come on. That guy had it comin',
and everybody knows it.

1758
01:28:21,577 --> 01:28:24,487
Well, he did say he
was protecting you.

1759
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:27,048
I love your daughter, Miss Murphy.

1760
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:30,284
I'll never let anything
happen to her. I promise.

1761
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:32,020
That makes two of us.

1762
01:28:32,121 --> 01:28:37,329
Okay. Well, this is all new to me.
I don't know, but... I'll try.

1763
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:43,164
Nothing beats a failure but a try.

1764
01:28:43,265 --> 01:28:46,100
- Now we're making some progress.
- Yeah.

1765
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:47,939
A try's a try, right?

1766
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:53,542
Oh, boy. That's Tanner.
That's trouble.

1767
01:28:53,641 --> 01:28:55,743
He's still got it.
I knew you got it in you.

1768
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:57,287
- Now, don't.
- Baby...

1769
01:28:58,313 --> 01:29:02,150
You get off my property, Tanner McCoy,
before I knock you on your ass again.

1770
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:04,752
- Give him a chance.
- He's just coming here to start trouble.

1771
01:29:04,853 --> 01:29:08,662
- No, he's not.
- I want to apologize.

1772
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:11,960
- What?
- I want to...

1773
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,969
say thank you.

1774
01:29:14,962 --> 01:29:17,372
- I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
- Eileen.

1775
01:29:17,899 --> 01:29:20,002
Miss Eileen.

1776
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:24,206
He told me what you did
for him. So... thank you.

1777
01:29:24,305 --> 01:29:26,783
Oh, thank you!

1778
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:30,912
He really is a good man.

1779
01:29:31,012 --> 01:29:32,980
He's just been so troubled...

1780
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,319
with all that's been
going on with the dam.

1781
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,298
Thank you.

1782
01:29:45,827 --> 01:29:48,063
Tanner, I've been working
on a new strain of corn...

1783
01:29:48,162 --> 01:29:49,965
that doesn't need as much water.

1784
01:29:50,064 --> 01:29:52,577
I could use your help with it.

1785
01:29:55,069 --> 01:29:57,274
Yeah. I'd be glad to.

1786
01:30:04,011 --> 01:30:06,381
I'm sorry I wanted to get you fired.

1787
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,217
I'm gonna talk to the
mayor tomorrow. Promise.

1788
01:30:09,318 --> 01:30:11,286
I'm sure he's still very upset.

1789
01:30:11,386 --> 01:30:15,123
Having to choose between going
on with Jubilee or getting sued...

1790
01:30:15,224 --> 01:30:16,958
is pretty crazy.

1791
01:30:17,059 --> 01:30:19,962
The town's going on with it,
but we're not happy...

1792
01:30:20,061 --> 01:30:23,966
about not being able to say
Jesus or celebrate his birth.

1793
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:25,967
You know, Bailey's been practicing...

1794
01:30:26,068 --> 01:30:28,648
and all the kids are really sad.

1795
01:30:29,637 --> 01:30:33,015
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,
and I have an idea.

1796
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:36,778
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

1797
01:30:36,877 --> 01:30:38,846
Jingle all the way

1798
01:30:38,947 --> 01:30:41,583
- We are live...
- Look at all the news vans.

1799
01:30:43,252 --> 01:30:46,020
This old town has never
had this much attention.

1800
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:48,789
Well, since the whorehouse
closed down in 1970.

1801
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:51,960
- That was a sad day.
- What do you think about the celebration?

1802
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:55,130
Well, I say Christmas is about Jesus.

1803
01:30:55,229 --> 01:30:58,833
I ran down here. I ran for my life!

1804
01:30:58,934 --> 01:31:00,969
'Cause I was gonna start a fire.

1805
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:02,871
"O Lord Jesus is a fire."

1806
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,605
Ain't nobody got time for that.

1807
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:06,942
- Hell no.
- Hold on there.

1808
01:31:07,042 --> 01:31:09,711
- We need to shut this down.
- Just wait a sec.

1809
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,512
See what she's got to say.

1810
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:13,948
I told them to hide the kids,
hide they wife...

1811
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,851
and hide they Santa Claus,
'cause it's crazy around here.

1812
01:31:16,952 --> 01:31:18,921
Thank you so much. This is lovely.

1813
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,657
I got a candy apple.
Where y'all went?

1814
01:31:21,756 --> 01:31:24,497
Merry Christmas. How you doing?
Where y'all went?

1815
01:31:25,761 --> 01:31:28,296
There they is, over there.
Hey, Oliver, how ya doin'?

1816
01:31:28,396 --> 01:31:31,033
Good to see you. Good to
see you. All right, all right.

1817
01:31:32,134 --> 01:31:35,976
Listen, listen, we have a contract.
You see those people over there?

1818
01:31:36,637 --> 01:31:38,479
They are very powerful.

1819
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,710
You have to take down the nativity.

1820
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,389
Okay, that's it.

1821
01:31:43,979 --> 01:31:46,414
May I have everyone's attention?

1822
01:31:46,515 --> 01:31:47,815
What is she doing?

1823
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:49,551
Hello, Bucktussle.

1824
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:52,354
I want to thank you all for coming
out to the Christmas Jubilee.

1825
01:31:52,453 --> 01:31:55,489
- Look at your daughter.
- Isn't she beautiful?

1826
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:57,559
I'd also like to thank Sheldon
Construction Company...

1827
01:31:57,658 --> 01:32:00,171
for sponsoring this
Christmas celebration.

1828
01:32:03,532 --> 01:32:07,269
Christmas is about giving back,
and with all the world watching...

1829
01:32:07,368 --> 01:32:11,372
not only did Sheldon Construction
Company fund this event...

1830
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:13,442
but they've also agreed to release...

1831
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:18,148
150,000 gallons of water a day
down the river to the farmers.

1832
01:32:19,648 --> 01:32:21,055
Thank you.

1833
01:32:26,488 --> 01:32:29,068
- What are you doing?
- Giving goodwill towards men.

1834
01:32:29,658 --> 01:32:32,094
- Thank you, Mr. Sheldon.
- She's smart.

1835
01:32:32,194 --> 01:32:35,096
- I told you.
- Aren't you glad you didn't do anything?

1836
01:32:35,197 --> 01:32:36,597
- You care about getting back...
- Yeah.

1837
01:32:36,698 --> 01:32:38,867
To the heart of who we are as people.

1838
01:32:38,966 --> 01:32:42,537
You are so proud to
be a part of a town...

1839
01:32:42,636 --> 01:32:44,840
that doesn't mind keeping
the Christ in Christmas...

1840
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:47,609
so much so, that they are
presenting the McCoy School...

1841
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:52,224
with $100,000 a year
for the next four years.

1842
01:33:00,354 --> 01:33:02,591
- Yeah! Yes!
- Yes, yes!

1843
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:06,228
Such a fantastic Christmas
gift to the city, sir.

1844
01:33:06,328 --> 01:33:09,230
- Can you give us a comment?
- So without further ado...

1845
01:33:09,331 --> 01:33:11,432
let the Christmas Jubilee begin.

1846
01:33:11,533 --> 01:33:13,112
Come on.

1847
01:33:16,404 --> 01:33:20,475
Well, hello, Bucktussle,
and welcome...

1848
01:33:21,243 --> 01:33:23,948
welcome to the Christmas
Jubilee and Fair.

1849
01:33:24,746 --> 01:33:26,648
The children of McCoy School...

1850
01:33:26,747 --> 01:33:29,518
have put together a little
presentation for us all...

1851
01:33:29,618 --> 01:33:32,421
and this has all been under the
direction of their current teacher...

1852
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,488
May be wrong for that.

1853
01:33:34,588 --> 01:33:36,557
I am so proud of the kids.

1854
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:38,092
Mrs. Lacey Williams.

1855
01:33:38,193 --> 01:33:41,162
- Did she say, "Mrs. Lacey Williams"?
- It was all her idea.

1856
01:33:41,262 --> 01:33:44,832
- Yep, she did.
- So, thank you, Lacey, for everything.

1857
01:33:44,932 --> 01:33:50,645
And now the children of McCoy School,
featuring Bailey McCoy.

1858
01:33:52,373 --> 01:33:54,252
That's my boy!

1859
01:33:56,877 --> 01:34:01,216
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

1860
01:34:01,315 --> 01:34:04,819
<i>That your baby boy</i>

1861
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,291
<i>Would give sight to the blind man?</i>

1862
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:13,662
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

1863
01:34:13,761 --> 01:34:16,497
- <i>That your baby boy</i>
- Hey, baby.

1864
01:34:16,597 --> 01:34:18,065
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1865
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:22,738
<i>Would calm a storm with his hand?</i>

1866
01:34:22,837 --> 01:34:25,740
<i>Did you know</i>

1867
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:29,377
<i>That your baby boy</i>

1868
01:34:29,478 --> 01:34:34,850
<i>Has walked where angels trod</i>

1869
01:34:34,949 --> 01:34:40,988
<i>And when you kiss your little baby</i>

1870
01:34:41,088 --> 01:34:46,761
<i>You have kissed the face of God?</i>

1871
01:34:46,862 --> 01:34:51,069
<i>Mary, did you</i>

1872
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:56,304
<i>Know?</i>

1873
01:35:22,831 --> 01:35:24,899
You don't need to
have no lingerie on.

1874
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,936
Eileen, tell him we've been shopping
at Tifton's for over 15 years.

1875
01:35:29,037 --> 01:35:31,206
Yes, okay. I'm gonna help her.

1876
01:35:31,305 --> 01:35:33,041
Okay, go help her. Fifteen years.

1877
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,676
Well, 15 years ago maybe
that lingerie worked.

1878
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:37,612
But now the lingerie
don't work, honey.

1879
01:35:37,712 --> 01:35:39,180
You are so insulting!

1880
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,248
I am not insulting.
I am telling you the truth.

1881
01:35:41,349 --> 01:35:42,984
You shouldn't have
on no damn lingerie.

1882
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:44,786
I'm trying to save you
some embarrassment.

1883
01:35:44,886 --> 01:35:47,622
Put on that damn lingerie, look like
you got hair damage on your ass.

1884
01:35:47,721 --> 01:35:51,827
I mean, come on now. Come on, honey.
I'm trying to help y'all.

1885
01:35:51,926 --> 01:35:54,429
- Is this good?
- There you go trying to control everything.

1886
01:35:54,529 --> 01:35:56,730
- I am not trying to...
- Let me get the lines clean.

1887
01:35:56,831 --> 01:35:58,300
Let me get the eye lines clean...

1888
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:00,635
'cause I got a single on
me and a single on you.

1889
01:36:00,734 --> 01:36:02,703
And Maysie's sitting in the
editing room right now cussing...

1890
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:04,439
'cause we're talking
all over each other.

1891
01:36:04,538 --> 01:36:07,042
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree!

1892
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:09,109
- Mama.
- What? No, really!

1893
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,679
That's why you wanted me here...

1894
01:36:10,779 --> 01:36:13,314
- Yup, that's exactly why.
- I'll clean up and straighten out.

1895
01:36:13,414 --> 01:36:15,850
I'm gonna take this room.
Let me go straighten up a little.

1896
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:17,853
- Then we'll go...
- She talks so much.

1897
01:36:17,953 --> 01:36:20,521
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- All right, come on.

1898
01:36:20,622 --> 01:36:22,702
What you talking about?
You just talking all over everybody.

1899
01:36:26,728 --> 01:36:29,331
- Hi.
- Look, they do it in unison.

1900
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,300
They all do it in unison.
That's nice. Unison is nice.

1901
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:34,769
The unison is very nice.

1902
01:36:34,868 --> 01:36:36,904
You tryin' to correct me?
I say it's "u-nis-on."

1903
01:36:37,005 --> 01:36:38,506
No, Aunt Madea.

1904
01:36:38,606 --> 01:36:40,341
So I have a meeting down the hall...

1905
01:36:40,442 --> 01:36:43,011
Any unison when they sang unison.

1906
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:46,680
No, ma'am, it's not.
But that's fine. That's okay.

1907
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:48,416
I have a meeting down the hall...

1908
01:36:48,515 --> 01:36:50,652
I thought it was "unison",
and "a cappollo."

1909
01:36:50,752 --> 01:36:53,220
When they sang in no music,
what is that?

1910
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,456
No music?

1911
01:36:54,555 --> 01:36:56,858
Yeah, when you sang and there ain't
no music, ain't that a "cappollo"?

1912
01:36:56,957 --> 01:36:58,693
No, that's a cappella.

1913
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:00,694
I don't know much about music.

1914
01:37:00,795 --> 01:37:03,306
Me and Ike Turner didn't make it.
He went on with Tina.

1915
01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:06,134
That's okay. That's okay.

1916
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:07,969
I would beat the hell out of him.

1917
01:37:08,069 --> 01:37:10,204
Ike wasn't gonna put his hands
on me. That's all I'm saying.

1918
01:37:10,305 --> 01:37:12,073
I'm sorry. Say what you're
saying to the children.

1919
01:37:12,172 --> 01:37:13,574
- Are you done? Okay.
- Yes!

1920
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:15,577
I have a meeting down the hall...

1921
01:37:15,676 --> 01:37:17,845
You ain't getting testy with me, are you?
Talkin' about "Are you done?"

1922
01:37:17,945 --> 01:37:20,215
- No, of course not.
- Okay.

1923
01:37:20,314 --> 01:37:23,752
Let's start over from the top, 'cause
that's gonna make it in the gag reel.

1924
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:24,819
Speed.

1925
01:37:24,918 --> 01:37:26,387
- White lightning?
- Yeah, moonshine.

1926
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:28,390
You want to take a snort?

1927
01:37:28,489 --> 01:37:29,791
Nope, I'll pass.

1928
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:32,694
Boy, it'll put some hair on
your chest, I'll guarantee ya.

1929
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:36,398
Stop it. Come on.
Talk about hair on your chest.

1930
01:37:36,497 --> 01:37:38,399
I could French-braid his.

1931
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,435
That's right. I could
put a little bow on it.

1932
01:37:40,534 --> 01:37:43,572
She's too pretty to have
hair on her chest. Really.

1933
01:37:43,671 --> 01:37:45,673
I gotta tell you, I got rid of mine.

1934
01:37:45,774 --> 01:37:47,742
Little bat hairs
attached to needles...

1935
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:50,011
soaked in cucumber juice
and a boatload of Nair.

1936
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:52,113
Gone, like that, if you
ever have a problem with...

1937
01:37:52,212 --> 01:37:54,682
I've seen a mosquito
so daggone big...

1938
01:37:54,783 --> 01:37:57,418
it was dry-humping a wiener
dog right there on the porch.

1939
01:37:57,519 --> 01:38:01,088
She's way prettier than the
last one. She looked like...

1940
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:02,596
Tyler Perry.

1941
01:38:05,694 --> 01:38:07,494
Boy, I tell you what, Son,
she's way prettier...

1942
01:38:07,595 --> 01:38:09,497
than that last girl you was with.

1943
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:11,608
Good night. She looked
like old Tyler Perry.

1944
01:38:14,703 --> 01:38:16,604
All right. Keep going.

1945
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,206
Oh, my God.

1946
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:20,041
Where are my manners?

1947
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,710
I'll do one it one more time. Ready?

1948
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,310
Where are my manners?

1949
01:38:23,411 --> 01:38:25,380
But this'un,
you done good on this'un.

1950
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:27,815
Shut the...

1951
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:31,086
I need to introduce myself,
but where are my manners?

1952
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:32,787
I am...

1953
01:38:35,289 --> 01:38:36,925
- All right.
- It's okay, Mama.

1954
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:39,400
I know. It's gonna roll at the
end of the movie. All right.

1955
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:42,197
I'm a truck driver.

1956
01:38:42,296 --> 01:38:45,567
Been out on the road a lot.
Long-haul truck driver.

1957
01:38:45,667 --> 01:38:46,967
You run long hos?

1958
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:48,336
No, long haul.

1959
01:38:48,435 --> 01:38:50,037
Oh, haw, like haw.

1960
01:38:50,137 --> 01:38:51,605
- Hauling.
- Oh, hauling.

1961
01:38:51,706 --> 01:38:54,908
Like your eucalyptus.
Menthol. "Hall." Haul.

1962
01:38:55,009 --> 01:38:56,310
Not "hole." Haul.

1963
01:38:56,411 --> 01:38:58,779
- A hole, a haul, okay.
- But anyway...

1964
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,788
he still lives here, that Tanner.

1965
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,818
Kid's still beating him up?

1966
01:39:03,917 --> 01:39:05,386
Yeah, he's still beating him up.

1967
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:07,555
The little kid?
He's too big for that.

1968
01:39:07,654 --> 01:39:09,923
No, he's big now.
He's a regular-sized kid.

1969
01:39:10,024 --> 01:39:12,594
I mean, he growed with...
He growed with Conner.

1970
01:39:12,694 --> 01:39:15,729
Tanner, he's regular size.
He ain't like a dwarf or nothin'.

1971
01:39:15,829 --> 01:39:17,865
- He growed?
- Yeah, he growed up that tall.

1972
01:39:17,966 --> 01:39:20,635
He ain't a dwarf. I mean,
shoot, he'd take a dwarf.

1973
01:39:20,734 --> 01:39:22,369
He'd kick ass out of a dwarf.

1974
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:23,938
Hell, I hope so.

1975
01:39:24,037 --> 01:39:26,573
It's just regular-sized
kids he got trouble with.

1976
01:39:26,673 --> 01:39:29,711
- Okay. Okay.
- But he's good in the dwarf department.

1977
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:32,479
I need a dictionary to keep
up with you sometime, honey.

1978
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:36,317
If you're gonna do it, then you
need to do it and keep doin' her...

1979
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:39,554
and then when you're done doin' her,
you keep doin' her again...

1980
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:42,023
'cause you wanna keep doin'
what it is you need to do...

1981
01:39:42,122 --> 01:39:44,463
in order to do what
you need to be doin'.

1982
01:39:45,393 --> 01:39:46,664
Ain't that right?

1983
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:49,197
She told you that lie too?

1984
01:39:49,296 --> 01:39:51,666
She didn't have no damn heart attack.

1985
01:39:51,765 --> 01:39:55,036
She had gas. We got her to the hospital,
they said she had gas.

1986
01:39:55,136 --> 01:39:56,104
What?

1987
01:39:56,203 --> 01:39:59,649
They ran one of them pipes in there,
she farted, it was over.

1988
01:40:05,345 --> 01:40:07,282
Yeah, she had gas.

1989
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:09,884
She had gas. She had gas.

1990
01:40:09,984 --> 01:40:12,953
They hit her in the stomach real
hard and she farted. It was over.

1991
01:40:13,054 --> 01:40:14,555
Then she had heartburn.

1992
01:40:14,655 --> 01:40:17,565
Sounds like she needs
some Prilosec OTC.

1993
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,328
Get out my way!

1994
01:40:20,427 --> 01:40:22,730
I don't need to be here
in this stuck-up-ass...

1995
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:24,298
bougie-ass store nowhere.

1996
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:27,309
I don't need to be up in
there with y'all! Go to hell!

1997
01:40:30,904 --> 01:40:33,712
Where's my damn car?
Where's my damn car?

1998
01:40:35,176 --> 01:40:36,686
Shut the hell up.

1999
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:44,720
Cut.
