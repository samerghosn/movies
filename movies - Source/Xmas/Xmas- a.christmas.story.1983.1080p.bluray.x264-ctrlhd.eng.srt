2
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,378
Ah, there it is. My house.

3
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:01,683
And good old Cleveland Street. How could I ever forget it?

4
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:05,253
And there I am, with that dumb round face and...

5
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:07,153
that stupid stocking cap.

6
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,960
But no matter. Christmas was on its way.

7
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:14,059
Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...

8
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:16,992
around which the entire kid year revolved.

9
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:44,625
Downtown Hohman was prepared for its yearly bacchanalia of...

10
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:47,356
peace on earth and good will to men.

11
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:41,013
Higbees' corner window was traditionally a high-water mark...

12
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,078
of the pre-Christmas season.

13
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:48,657
First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff, jostled in wonderment...

14
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:52,562
before a golden tinkling display...

15
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:56,027
of mechanized, electronic joy.

16
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,411
Wow, there it is.

17
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,918
The holy grail of Christmas gifts.

18
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,887
The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...

19
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:50,117
air rifle.

20
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:52,994
And there he is.

21
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:54,985
Red Ryder himself.

22
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,730
In his hand was the knurled stock of as coolly deadly-looking...

23
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,794
a piece of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on.

24
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,503
For weeks, I had been scheming to get my mitts on one of these...

25
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:15,310
fearsome blue-steel beauties.

26
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:19,749
My fevered brain seethed with the effort of trying to come up with...

27
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:23,689
the infinitely subtle devices necessary to implant...

28
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,957
the Red Ryder range model air rifle indelibly...

29
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,629
into my parents' subconscious.

30
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:30,866
Ralphie!

31
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,368
Randy!

32
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:34,366
Down here in two minutes!

33
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,739
And I mean two minutes!

34
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:39,274
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!

35
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:46,913
Cut it out.

36
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:15,907
My mother, grabbing for her copy of Look magazine...

37
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:20,613
would find herself cleverly trapped into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.

38
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,854
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.

39
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,650
What's that?

40
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:30,956
Well, for Christ's sake, the Sox traded Bullfrog...

41
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,155
the only player they've got, for Shottenhoffer.

42
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,858
"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer, a utility infielder.

43
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,092
Got a whole goddamned team of utility infielders.

44
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,569
That's nice.

45
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,638
Ralphie, on the double!

46
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,505
Did you hear about this guy who swallowed a yo-yo?

47
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,873
Swallowed a yo-yo?

48
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,273
On a bet.

49
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,872
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.

50
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,948
They write the silliest things in the newspapers.

51
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,982
What do you mean, silly? I mean that's real news.

52
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,183
That's not like that politics slop.

53
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:06,957
What is the name of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

54
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,463
Victor. His name is Victor.

55
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,361
How the hell did you know that?

56
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,861
Everybody knows that.

57
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,168
That's another one of your silly puzzles?

58
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,708
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.

59
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:23,145
Could be worth $50,000.

60
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,046
What kind is it this time?

61
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:29,613
Name the great characters in American literature.

62
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,847
Victor? The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

63
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:37,358
Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right BB gun hint.

64
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:38,862
It had to be firm, but subtle.

65
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,124
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store.

66
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,875
They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.

67
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,712
I could tell that I was in imminent danger of over-playing my hand.

68
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,451
Casually, I switched tactics.

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,212
Hey, Dad!

70
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,787
I'll bet you'll never guess what I got you for Christmas.

71
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,658
A new furnace.

72
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,055
That's a good one, Dad.

73
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,697
My old man was one of the most feared furnace-fighters...

74
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,534
in northern Indiana.

75
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,636
Hurry up, you're going to be late for school.

76
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,309
Yeah. I'm running late already.

77
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,103
Round one was over.

78
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,107
Parents, one.

79
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,307
Kids, zip.

80
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,718
I could feel the Christmas noose beginning to tighten.

81
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:37,024
Maybe what happened next was inevitable.

82
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:39,685
Ralphie, what would you like for Christmas?

83
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,022
Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.

84
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,156
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle.

85
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,335
No. Shoot your eye out.

86
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:53,170
Oh, no! It was the classic mother-BB gun block.

87
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,133
"You'll shoot your eye out."

88
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:59,006
That deadly phrase uttered many times before by hundreds...

89
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:01,082
of mothers was not surmountable...

90
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,174
by any means known to kid-dom.

91
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:07,152
But such was my mania, my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...

92
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:10,520
that I immediately began to rebuild the dike.

93
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:14,721
I was just kidding. Even though Flick is getting one.

94
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:16,830
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

95
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:19,458
I couldn't believe my own ears. Tinkertoys?

96
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,000
She'd never buy it.

97
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,267
BB guns are dangerous.

98
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,930
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.

99
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:34,647
Randy, will you eat? There are starving people in China.

100
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,755
Mothers know nothing about creeping marauders...

101
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,920
burrowing through the snow toward the kitchen...

102
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:52,525
where only you, and you alone, stand between your tiny...

103
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:55,432
huddled family and insensate evil.

104
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:06,544
Save us, Ralphie! I just knew those bad guys...

105
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:09,051
would be coming for us in the end!

106
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:13,184
Don't worry, Dad. As long as I got OI' Blue...

107
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,294
What've we got here, folks?

108
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:22,298
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

109
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,930
Well, just me and my trusty old...

110
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:28,732
Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle.

111
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,799
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.

112
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:34,272
Well, I think I better have a look here.

113
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:49,386
Oh, no!

114
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,159
It's OI' Blue!

115
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:53,863
Oh, no!

116
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,258
Cheese it, boys!

117
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:12,044
There's another one! He's a dead-eye, ain't he?

118
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,816
Okay, Ralphie!

119
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:23,987
You win this time, but we'll be back!

120
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,400
Adiиоs, Bart.

121
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:34,766
But if you do come back, you'll be pushing up daisies!

122
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,179
And don't you forget it!

123
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,805
Well, son, you saved us!

124
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,909
We were goners for sure! And you saved us!

125
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,759
Oldsmobile!

126
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,687
A pile of junk!

127
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:01,127
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!

128
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:06,002
Some men are Baptists, others Catholics. My father was an Oldsmobile man.

129
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:10,367
That son of a bitch would freeze up in the middle of summer on the Equator!

130
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,106
Little pitchers...

131
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,406
Hold it!

132
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:28,318
It's a clinker!

133
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:32,258
That blasted, stupid furnace.

134
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,664
Dadgummit!

135
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,396
Damn skates!

136
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,506
For Christ's sake, open up the damper, will you?

137
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,276
Who the hell turned it all the way down again?

138
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,274
Blasted!

139
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,661
In the heat of battle, my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...

140
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,269
that as far as we know is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan.

141
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,082
Preparing to go to school was like getting ready...

142
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,619
for extended deep-sea diving.

143
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,310
Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!

144
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,010
Just wait, Ralph!

145
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:52,806
My kid brother looked like a tick about to pop.

146
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:53,678
What?

147
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:55,714
What is it?

148
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,347
What is it?

149
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,625
What is it?

150
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,625
I can't put my arms down!

151
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:19,767
Well, put your arms down when you get to school.

152
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,231
Hey, Flick! Wait up.

153
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:52,604
Wait up!

154
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:54,369
So what are you doing?

155
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:57,046
What does it look like I'm doing? Picking goobers?

156
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:00,683
Hey, listen, smart ass. I asked my old man about sticking...

157
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,152
your tongue to metal light poles in winter...

158
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,622
and he says it will freeze right to the pole just like I told you.

159
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:07,882
Baloney.

160
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,927
What would your old man know about anything?

161
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,294
He knows because he once saw a guy stick his tongue...

162
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:15,960
to a railroad track on a bet and the fire department had to come...

163
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:19,903
to get the guy's tongue off the track because he couldn't get it off.

164
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:21,735
Come on, guys, wait up!

165
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,297
Come on, guys!

166
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:26,006
Come on, guys, wait up!

167
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,649
I can't get up!

168
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:35,716
I can't get up!

169
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:36,720
Help!

170
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:40,421
I can't get out! Help me!

171
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,488
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

172
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,394
I can't get up!

173
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:49,665
Come on.

174
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,068
Get up. Sit up. Come on.

175
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,340
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

176
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,740
Come on, you're all right!

177
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:06,953
Miss Shields!

178
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:09,012
All right, everyone...

179
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,750
take your seats, please.

180
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,597
Good morning, class.

181
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:24,001
Good morning, Miss Shields.

182
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:01,241
Open your books to Page 32.

183
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,177
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...

184
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:17,284
You're full of beans and so's your old man.

185
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,690
Says who?

186
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,690
Says me.

187
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,662
Well, I double-dare you.

188
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,325
The exact exchange and nuance...

189
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,925
of phrase in this ritual is very important.

190
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,732
Are you kidding? Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?

191
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:32,808
That's dumb.

192
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,844
That's 'cause you know it will stick!

193
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:36,536
You're full of it.

194
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,207
Well, I double dog-dare you!

195
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,980
Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.

196
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,647
What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?

197
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,280
And finally, the coup de grace of all dares...

198
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,758
the sinister triple dog-dare!

199
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,921
I triple dog-dare you!

200
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,399
Schwartz created a slight breach of etiquette...

201
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,129
by skipping the triple-dare and going right for the throat.

202
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,535
All right, all right.

203
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:14,082
Go on, smart ass, and do it!

204
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:15,582
I'm going!

205
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:20,314
Flick's spine stiffened, his lips curled in a defiant sneer.

206
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,826
There was no going back now.

207
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:27,455
This is nothing.

208
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,462
Stuck? Stuck!

209
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:35,630
Stuck! Stuck!

210
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:42,638
Jeez!

211
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,214
It really works!

212
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:45,715
Look at him!

213
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,460
Ralphie, come back!

214
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:59,429
Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!

215
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,930
But the bell rang!

216
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,758
What are we going to do?

217
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,558
I don't know! The bell rang!

218
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:16,009
Where's Flick?

219
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,081
Has anyone seen Flick?

220
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:20,981
Flick? Flick who?

221
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:23,180
He was at recess, wasn't he?

222
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:27,315
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

223
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:36,366
I said has anyone seen Flick?

224
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,365
Yes, Esther Jane?

225
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:48,038
Oh, my God!

226
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:11,393
Holy cow, it's the fire department!

227
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:20,241
Wow, it's the cops!

228
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:16,762
Now, I know that some of you put Flick up to this.

229
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:22,035
But, he has refused to say who.

230
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,274
But those who did it know their blame.

231
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,479
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...

232
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:36,681
is far worse than any punishment you might receive.

233
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:43,124
Now, don't you feel terrible?

234
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:47,067
Don't you feel remorse for what you have done?

235
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:52,236
That's all I'm going to say about poor Flick.

236
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:58,736
Adults love to say things like that. But kids know better.

237
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:02,649
We knew darn well it was always better not to get caught.

238
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:06,017
Now, boys and girls, I'm going to give you an assignment.

239
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,919
I want you to write...

240
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,188
a theme.

241
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,097
"What I want for Christmas."

242
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:19,959
The clouds lifted.

243
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,904
And I want it handed in tomorrow morning...

244
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:26,067
I saw a faint gleam of light at the other end of...

245
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,008
the black cave of doom.

246
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,105
I knew that when Miss Shields read my magnificent, eloquent theme...

247
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,981
that she would sympathize with my plight...

248
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:38,249
and everything would work out, somehow.

249
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,073
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

250
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,072
Did it hurt, Flick?

251
00:21:58,072 --> 00:21:59,872
No. I never felt a thing.

252
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,372
It just caught me off-guard.

253
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,874
You sure were bawling.

254
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:04,274
I never bawled!

255
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,883
Baloney.

256
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,589
Scut Farkus!

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,795
Scut Farkus! What a rotten name. We were trapped.

258
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:27,772
There he stood, between us and the alley.

259
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,900
Scut Farkus, staring out at us with his yellow eyes.

260
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:34,475
He had yellow eyes! So help me God, yellow eyes.

261
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:52,693
Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.

262
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:54,256
Mean. Rotten.

263
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,734
His lips curled over his green teeth.

264
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:59,237
Randy lay there like a slug.

265
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,365
It was his only defense.

266
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:07,340
Say "uncle."

267
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Uncle!

268
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,217
Louder!

269
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:22,061
In our world, you were either a bully, a toady...

270
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,792
or one of the nameless rabble of victims.

271
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,059
All right.

272
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,825
Who's next?

273
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:54,990
In the jungles of kid-dom, the mind switches gears rapidly.

274
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,890
Weeks ago I had sent away for my Little Orphan Annie...

275
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,992
secret society decoder pen.

276
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:02,236
Oh, skunked again.

277
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,932
No matter. Today I had serious work to do.

278
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:07,735
"What I want for Christmas."

279
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,938
"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock...

280
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,878
"and this thing which tells time."

281
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:14,447
Wow, that's great.

282
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:17,542
"I think that everybody should have a Red Ryder BB gun.

283
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:19,518
"They're very good for Christmas.

284
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:23,649
"I don't think that a football's a very good Christmas present."

285
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,952
Oh, rarely had the words poured from my penny pencil...

286
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,827
with such feverish fluidity.

287
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,797
I've won! I've won!

288
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:49,246
The Bumpus hounds.

289
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:53,215
Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, had at least...

290
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:55,154
785 smelly hound dogs.

291
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,525
And they ignored every other human being on earth but my old man.

292
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:03,796
I won!

293
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,196
I won!

294
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:08,538
What?

295
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,465
A major prize!

296
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,700
I won!

297
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,535
Hey, look at that. Look at that. A Western Union telegram.

298
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,809
Tonight, he's coming tonight. Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!

299
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:19,543
What does this mean here?

300
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,413
It means it's coming tonight!

301
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,419
I called Ernie McClosky at the freight depot.

302
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:26,320
He said the telegram was late, the prize was already there...

303
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,585
he was going to send it on tonight.

304
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:32,093
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me. It's my gift.

305
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,464
You know, maybe it'll be one of those Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...

306
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,207
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

307
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,470
Or it could be a bowling alley.

308
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,240
A guy down in Terre Haute won a bowling alley.

309
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,111
How are they going to deliver a bowling alley here tonight?

310
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,951
They could send the deed, for cripesake. I mean...

311
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,588
I didn't expect they were going to send the whole damn bowling alley.

312
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,491
Yeah, well. How about eating? I'm starving to death.

313
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,491
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.

314
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,566
Every family has a kid who won't eat.

315
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:19,969
My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily in over three years.

316
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,182
Oh, Randy, don't play with your food, eat it!

317
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,419
Starving people would be happy to have that.

318
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,519
Can I have some more red cabbage?

319
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,662
Stop playing with your food, or I'll give you something to cry about.

320
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,265
You better stop fooling around with it and eat it or you'll be sorry.

321
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:53,010
Can I please have some more?

322
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,607
My mother had not had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.

323
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:01,812
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.

324
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,014
I hate meatloaf.

325
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,783
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.

326
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,958
Where's my screwdriver and plumber's helper?

327
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,396
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.

328
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,725
My mother was more subtle.

329
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,533
How do the little piggies go?

330
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,672
That's right. Oink, oink.

331
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:24,073
Now, show me how the piggies eat. This is your trough.

332
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,146
Show me how the piggies eat.

333
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,382
Be a good boy. Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

334
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:00,376
Oh, my.

335
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,818
Mommy's little piggy.

336
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:24,570
It's here.

337
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:33,078
Are you Parker?

338
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,743
All right, sign here.

339
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:35,743
Yeah. Well, what is it?

340
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:37,080
I don't know.

341
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:38,812
What's in it?

342
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,754
Here. Bring it in.

343
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:43,224
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here. Move your tails.

344
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:46,785
Bring it right on in. Right here. Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.

345
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,988
That's right.

346
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:50,257
Right.

347
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,131
Here, bring it right in, fellas. That's it. Here we go.

348
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:55,329
A little more. Little more.

349
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:56,429
That's it.

350
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:00,904
Watch the lady.

351
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,315
Thanks a lot, guys.

352
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:12,720
Merry Christmas.

353
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,691
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie. Go on.

354
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,286
"Fra-gi-ley."

355
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:21,130
That must be Italian.

356
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,830
I think that says "fragile."

357
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,659
Oh, yeah.

358
00:29:26,003 --> 00:29:27,436
Here we go.

359
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,440
They did a job on this, you know?

360
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,018
No, here, Ralph, hold this.

361
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,489
There could be anything in there!

362
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:54,725
Jesus!

363
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:59,067
Maybe they forgot.

364
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:02,137
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.

365
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:10,180
Would you look at that?

366
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,280
What?

367
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,715
Would you look at that?

368
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:17,812
What is it?

369
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:19,923
It's a leg!

370
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:21,519
But what is it?

371
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,862
Well, it's a leg.

372
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,596
You know, like in a statue.

373
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:27,156
Statue?

374
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:28,156
Yeah, statue!

375
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,496
Yeah, statue!

376
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:32,227
Ralphie!

377
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:36,608
My mother was trying to insinuate herself between us and the statue.

378
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:38,868
Holy smoke, would you...

379
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:40,913
Do you know what this is?

380
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,448
This is a lamp.

381
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,347
It was indeed a lamp.

382
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:49,286
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!

383
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:52,154
I don't know.

384
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:55,687
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

385
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,462
The old man's eyes boggled...

386
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,190
overcome by art.

387
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:03,235
I know just the place for it.

388
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:06,295
Right in the middle of our front room window!

389
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:26,957
Jesus, God.

390
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:31,899
Honey?

391
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,229
No. It's all right.

392
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,570
Let's see...

393
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:41,308
This goes to the radio and this goes to the...

394
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,901
Well, it's just one too many.

395
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:49,872
Well, let's see.

396
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:53,182
The snap of a few sparks, a quick whiff of ozone...

397
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:56,712
and the lamp blazed forth in unparalleled glory.

398
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,449
Look at that! Will you look at that?

399
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,823
Isn't that glorious?

400
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,360
It's indescribably beautiful. It reminds me of the Fourth of July!

401
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:09,171
Turn off all the lights.

402
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:11,172
I wanna see what it looks like from the street.

403
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,638
I'll go get the dining room.

404
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:14,038
Couldn't we talk this over?

405
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:37,929
Move it a little bit to the right. A little that way.

406
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:42,229
Just a little... More to the right.

407
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:45,297
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!

408
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:47,672
Right there. That's wonderful.

409
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,436
Parker, what is that?

410
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:51,413
Don't bother me now. Can't you see I'm busy?

411
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:53,077
Yeah, but what is that?

412
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:54,277
It's a major award.

413
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:56,683
A major award?

414
00:32:57,721 --> 00:33:00,281
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that. It looks like a lamp.

415
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:03,758
It is a lamp, you nincompoop. But it's a major award.

416
00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:05,089
I won it.

417
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,159
Damn, hell, you say you won it?

418
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,059
Yeah.

419
00:33:08,232 --> 00:33:10,894
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.

420
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,733
The entire neighborhood was turned on.

421
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:16,705
You should see what it looks like from out here!

422
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:19,843
It could be seen up and down Cleveland Street.

423
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,879
The symbol of the old man's victory.

424
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,174
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.

425
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:27,740
Isn't it about time for somebody's favorite radio program?

426
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,752
Holy smokes, it was 6:45.

427
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,050
Only one thing that could've dragged me away...

428
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:38,118
from the soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window.

429
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,840
Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.

430
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,573
Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.

431
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:57,512
I could still taste it.

432
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,048
Hey, you turned the light off!

433
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:21,173
I knew I was handing Miss Shields a masterpiece.

434
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,942
Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy, would excuse me from theme writing...

435
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,571
for the rest of my natural life.

436
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:37,050
You call this a paragraph?

437
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:41,621
Margins! Margins! "F"!

438
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,360
My life's work down the drain.

439
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,164
A semicolon, you dolt!

440
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:49,326
A period.

441
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:50,398
"F"!

442
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:54,939
Oh, I should weep if I have to read one more "F"!

443
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,135
Ralphie Parker.

444
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:16,422
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.

445
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,455
Listen to this sentence.

446
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:23,235
"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock...

447
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:27,201
"and this thing which tells time."

448
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:30,505
Poetry.

449
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:32,045
Sheer poetry.

450
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:35,611
Ralph, an "A+."

451
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:37,642
My Ralph!

452
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,888
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

453
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,223
"A+"!

454
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,155
Is there something you want, Ralph?

455
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:27,462
I'm just turning in my theme.

456
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,300
Well, you can take your seat now.

457
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:35,537
Take your seat.

458
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,659
Come on, you guys.

459
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,371
Get in the car. Get in the car.

460
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:07,438
If we don't hurry we're going to miss all the good trees!

461
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,074
My mother was about to make another brilliant maneuver...

462
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:16,152
in the legendary battle of the lamp.

463
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:21,122
The epic struggle which followed lives in the folklore of Cleveland Street...

464
00:37:21,225 --> 00:37:22,522
to this very day.

465
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:25,391
Don't want to waste electricity.

466
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:27,325
"Don't want to waste electricity."

467
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:30,125
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

468
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,832
You folks looking for a tree? We got 300 trees.

469
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:41,174
This is the Christmas tree emporium of the entire Midwest.

470
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:44,772
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree than this here tree.

471
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:47,243
This here tree is built to last.

472
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,149
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.

473
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,552
Okay. Now here's a tree.

474
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:56,491
This here is a tree.

475
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:59,064
That's a little skimpy in the front.

476
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,964
Well, you just put it in the corner.

477
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,762
Haven't you got a big tree?

478
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:04,762
Hell, this ain't no tree.

479
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,704
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

480
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:11,141
Wait'll the dogs see that one.

481
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:12,970
Don't you think it's a little large?

482
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:16,344
Listen, Christmas only comes once a year. Why not?

483
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:17,513
How much?

484
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:18,613
I'll knock off $2...

485
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:20,810
because I can see you're a man who knows his trees.

486
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,287
This isn't one of those trees that all the needles falls off, is it?

487
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,085
No, that's them balsams.

488
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:28,888
The old man loved bargaining as much as an Arab trader...

489
00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:30,691
and he was twice as shrewd.

490
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:33,163
You know, Dew Lock just bought one of those brand new...

491
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,461
green plastic trees.

492
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:39,097
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...

493
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:41,639
green pipe cleaners.

494
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:44,368
This is a very nice tree.

495
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:46,978
I'll throw in some rope and tie it to your car for you.

496
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:48,513
You got a deal.

497
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:49,545
Deal.

498
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:11,131
Damn it. Blow out!

499
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,138
Not again.

500
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:23,782
Four minutes!

501
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:25,375
Time me.

502
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,351
Actually, my old man loved it.

503
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:31,755
He always saw himself in the pits at the Indianapolis Speedway...

504
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,849
in the 500.

505
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:40,834
My old man's spare tires were actually only tires...

506
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:42,096
in the academic sense.

507
00:39:42,304 --> 00:39:44,864
They were round. They had once been made of rubber.

508
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:52,405
Ralphie, why don't you go help your father?

509
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:53,647
Really? Can I?

510
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:54,474
Yes.

511
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,151
Watch the traffic, there.

512
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:56,951
Okay.

513
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,311
It was the first time that it had been suggested that...

514
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:02,754
I go help my father with anything.

515
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:08,759
What are you doing here?

516
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:09,659
Mom says I should help.

517
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,860
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

518
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:16,034
Yeah, that's it.

519
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:18,035
Here. Hold this.

520
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:25,203
No, not that way. Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.

521
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:25,713
How?

522
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:26,213
Like this.

523
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:28,182
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.

524
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,242
There's four of them. And we got it!

525
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:35,088
There it is.

526
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:38,521
That son of a gun. I'm gonna get that dirty...

527
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:39,759
There we go.

528
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,330
For one brief moment I saw all the bolts silhouetted...

529
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,925
against the lights of the traffic. And then they were gone.

530
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,800
Oh, fudge!

531
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,410
Only I didn't say "fudge."

532
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,343
I said the word.

533
00:40:57,547 --> 00:41:00,778
The big one. The queen mother of dirty words.

534
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:03,518
The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.

535
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:05,487
What did you say?

536
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,121
That's what I thought you said.

537
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,395
Get in the car.

538
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:19,326
Go on.

539
00:41:19,404 --> 00:41:21,668
It was all over. I was dead.

540
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:24,534
What would it be? The guillotine? Hanging?

541
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,510
The chair? The rack? The Chinese water torture?

542
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:32,005
Mere child's play compared to what surely awaited me.

543
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:37,116
Everything go all right?

544
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:53,532
Eight minutes.

545
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:58,174
Do you know what your son just said?

546
00:41:58,174 --> 00:41:59,174
No. What?

547
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:02,210
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

548
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:06,612
Ralphie!

549
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,622
Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.

550
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:15,922
My personal preference is for Lux, but I found Palmolive had a nice...

551
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:18,188
piquant, after-dinner flavor.

552
00:42:18,263 --> 00:42:21,790
Heady, but with just a touch of mellow smoothness.

553
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:27,605
Lifebuoy, on the other hand...

554
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:31,474
You ready to tell me?

555
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:38,742
All right. Where did you hear that word?

556
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:42,820
Now I had heard that word at least 10 times a day from my old man.

557
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:45,287
My father worked in profanity the way...

558
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:47,825
other artists might work in oils or clay.

559
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:50,623
It was his true medium. A master.

560
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:53,097
But I chickened out. And I blurted out...

561
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:55,234
the first name that came to mind.

562
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:56,564
Schwartz!

563
00:42:58,272 --> 00:42:59,864
I see.

564
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:14,119
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

565
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:18,113
Mrs. Schwartz, do you know what Ralph just said?

566
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:20,894
No.

567
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:22,686
He said...

568
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:26,189
Not that!

569
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,662
Yes, that.

570
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:29,271
Do you know where he heard it?

571
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:30,871
Probably from his father.

572
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:33,363
No! He heard it from your son!

573
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:34,430
What?

574
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:43,779
What'd I do, Mom?

575
00:43:44,553 --> 00:43:46,521
Why? I didn't do nothing!

576
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,223
Another shot of mysterious, inexorable, official justice.

577
00:43:55,797 --> 00:44:00,564
Rinse out and go to bed. Am I glad you finished your homework!

578
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:03,670
Get right into bed, and I don't want to see any lights on.

579
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:06,707
You are being punished, so no comic book reading!

580
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,800
I'll come in, and if any lights are on...

581
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:11,812
Don't you give me that look! You're gonna get it!

582
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:36,333
Three blocks away, Schwartz was getting his.

583
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:40,374
There has never been a kid who didn't believe...

584
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:44,445
vaguely but insistently, that he would be stricken blind...

585
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:48,415
before he reached 21. And then they'd be sorry.

586
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,993
Why, it's Ralph!

587
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,096
Well, come on in, Ralph. Where've you been?

588
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,438
Why, he's carrying a cane!

589
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,998
What is it, Ralph? What happened?

590
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,942
Why, he's blind!

591
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:16,844
Blind? Oh, my God!

592
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,645
Ralph, is it something we did?

593
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,586
What brought you to this lonely state?

594
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,825
Ralph, please tell us no matter how it hurts. What did we do?

595
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,457
Look, I can't.

596
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:33,429
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.

597
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:35,565
What brought you to this?

598
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,237
Soap poisoning.

599
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,448
Oh, how could we do it?

600
00:45:57,122 --> 00:46:00,182
I'll manage to get along, somehow.

601
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,594
I'll never forgive myself.

602
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,594
Thanks, Mom.

603
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:06,356
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

604
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,230
I feel awful!

605
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,124
Thank you, Heather.

606
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,092
Merry Christmas.

607
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:36,992
Merry Christmas.

608
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:38,593
Thank you, Flick.

609
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:40,789
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

610
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,886
I just thought that you'd be getting tired of the same old stuff.

611
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,261
Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.

612
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,859
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

613
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,104
Merry Christmas.

614
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:26,107
Happy New Year.

615
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,008
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

616
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:57,669
The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine, in order to get...

617
00:47:57,779 --> 00:48:01,215
the Ovaltine inner seal to send off for my Little Orphan Annie...

618
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:04,810
secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.

619
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:08,283
I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."

620
00:48:08,357 --> 00:48:10,086
My decoder pen!

621
00:48:14,464 --> 00:48:15,931
All right!

622
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:24,070
"Be it known to all that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed...

623
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,904
"a member of the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and...

624
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,877
"is entitled to all the honors and benefits occurring thereto."

625
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:32,540
Signed, Little Orphan Annie.

626
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:35,148
Countersigned, Pierre Andre!

627
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:36,815
In ink!

628
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:40,547
Honors and benefits. Already at the age of nine.

629
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:47,727
Come on. Let's get on with it.

630
00:48:47,798 --> 00:48:50,767
I don't need all that jazz about smugglers and pirates.

631
00:48:51,802 --> 00:48:54,362
Listen tomorrow night for the concluding adventure of...

632
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:57,463
The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time...

633
00:48:57,608 --> 00:49:01,669
for Annie's secret message for you members of the secret circle.

634
00:49:02,446 --> 00:49:04,539
Remember, kids, only members of...

635
00:49:04,615 --> 00:49:08,676
Annie's secret circle can decode Annie's secret message.

636
00:49:08,886 --> 00:49:11,980
Remember, Annie is depending on you.

637
00:49:12,923 --> 00:49:15,084
Set your pins to B-2.

638
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,587
Here is the message.

639
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,227
12. 11. 2...

640
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:21,765
I am in my first secret meeting.

641
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,597
...25. 14. 11. 18.

642
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,432
16. 23...

643
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:28,199
Pierre was in great voice tonight.

644
00:49:28,273 --> 00:49:32,039
I could tell that tonight's message was really important.

645
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:33,501
...3. 25.

646
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:37,775
That's a message from Annie herself. Remember, don't tell anyone.

647
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:44,555
Ninety seconds later I'm in the only room in the house...

648
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:47,921
where a boy of nine can sit in privacy and decode.

649
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:52,989
Ah! "B." I went to the next.

650
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:56,627
"E." The first word is "be"!

651
00:49:57,102 --> 00:50:00,196
"S." It was coming easier now. "U."

652
00:50:02,007 --> 00:50:04,601
Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.

653
00:50:05,277 --> 00:50:07,006
I'll be right down, Ma.

654
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:08,511
Gee whiz.

655
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:13,109
"T. O."

656
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:16,553
"Be sure to." Be sure to what?

657
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:19,385
What was Little Orphan Annie trying to say? Be sure to what?

658
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:22,584
Ralphie! Randy has got to go! Will you please come out?

659
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,391
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!

660
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:27,232
I was getting closer now.

661
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:30,303
The tension was terrible. What was it?

662
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,600
The fate of the planet may hang in the balance.

663
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,198
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!

664
00:50:36,142 --> 00:50:38,770
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

665
00:50:39,145 --> 00:50:41,875
Almost there! My fingers flew.

666
00:50:41,982 --> 00:50:43,643
My mind was a steel trap.

667
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,149
Every pore vibrated.

668
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:47,213
It was almost clear.

669
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:48,411
Yes!

670
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:56,823
Ovaltine?

671
00:51:00,568 --> 00:51:02,297
A crummy commercial?

672
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:06,463
Son of a bitch!

673
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:11,200
I went out to face the world again.

674
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:12,778
Wiser.

675
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:27,193
Red cabbage?

676
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:30,230
No, that's for tomorrow night. You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

677
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,134
You filthy system!

678
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:35,863
I hate it!

679
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:38,666
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!

680
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:51,751
What happened next was a family controversy for years.

681
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:09,797
What was that? What happened?

682
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,476
What happened?

683
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:17,735
What broke?

684
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:19,777
I don't know what happened.

685
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:22,113
I was watering my plant and...

686
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:25,182
I broke your lamp.

687
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,031
Don't you touch that!

688
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,167
You were always jealous of this lamp.

689
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:47,376
Jealous of a plastic leg?

690
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:48,638
Jealous!

691
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:51,042
Jealous because I won.

692
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,440
That's ridiculous! Jealous?

693
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:55,711
Jealous of what?

694
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:58,251
That is...

695
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:02,281
the ugliest lamp I have ever seen in my entire life!

696
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:04,217
Now it was out.

697
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:05,925
Get the glue.

698
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:08,761
We're out of glue.

699
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:15,402
You used up all the glue on purpose!

700
00:53:17,242 --> 00:53:19,642
The old man stood quivering with fury...

701
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:22,178
stammering as he tried to come up with a real crusher.

702
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,842
All he got out was:

703
00:53:23,915 --> 00:53:25,212
Not a finger!

704
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,188
With as much dignity as he could muster...

705
00:54:08,294 --> 00:54:10,854
the old man gathered up the sad remains...

706
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:13,488
of his shattered major award.

707
00:54:14,366 --> 00:54:17,164
Later that night, alone in the backyard...

708
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,401
he buried it next to the garage.

709
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:21,666
Now I could never be sure...

710
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:25,736
but I thought that I heard the sound of taps being played...

711
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:27,308
gently.

712
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:29,443
Know what I'm getting my old man for Christmas?

713
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,313
What?

714
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:31,313
A rose that squirts.

715
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:33,443
People come to smell it, it squirts them.

716
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,747
I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.

717
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:37,147
A Flit gun?

718
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:41,654
Stop right there!

719
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,798
Ordinarily, if Dill so much as said "hi" to you, you felt great...

720
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:49,826
warm inside. But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.

721
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:52,765
I can't now, Grover. I've gotta go see Miss Shields.

722
00:54:53,106 --> 00:54:56,007
Hey, come here! Get over here!

723
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:58,377
Come on, you! Hey, come here!

724
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:00,813
You! Come here!

725
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:01,776
Who, me?

726
00:55:02,016 --> 00:55:03,417
No, your Aunt Tilly.

727
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:04,917
Yeah, you. Get over here!

728
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,111
I left Flick to certain annihilation.

729
00:55:09,156 --> 00:55:11,647
But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.

730
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:14,094
Uncle! Uncle!

731
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,090
All right, class.

732
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:23,129
I have your Christmas themes for you.

733
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:25,536
I'm pleased.

734
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,335
In general, you did very well.

735
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:35,039
However, I was disappointed in the margins.

736
00:55:37,686 --> 00:55:39,278
This is it.

737
00:55:40,656 --> 00:55:42,851
"C+"? No, it can't be.

738
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:44,691
C+?

739
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,885
C+!

740
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:55,898
Oh, no!

741
00:55:57,072 --> 00:55:58,733
"You'll shoot your eye out"?

742
00:56:01,076 --> 00:56:03,044
My mother must have gotten to Miss Shields.

743
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:04,803
There could be no other explanation.

744
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,210
You'll shoot your eye out. You'll shoot your eye out.

745
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:15,519
Was there no end to this conspiracy of irrational prejudice...

746
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:17,890
against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?

747
00:56:18,094 --> 00:56:22,292
These multiplication questions were most missed in our last math test.

748
00:56:22,398 --> 00:56:23,956
Would you answer in unison, please?

749
00:56:24,267 --> 00:56:27,168
I was surrounded by happier kids who were all going to get...

750
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,828
what they wanted for Christmas.

751
00:56:29,205 --> 00:56:30,433
...fifty-six.

752
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:02,629
Hey, four-eyes!

753
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:05,266
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?

754
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:07,934
Maybe you'd like another one!

755
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:14,473
Listen, jerk.

756
00:57:14,718 --> 00:57:18,017
When I tell you to come, you better come!

757
00:57:19,224 --> 00:57:21,692
What? Are you going to cry now?

758
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:25,659
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.

759
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:27,521
Cry!

760
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,463
Deep in the recesses of my brain...

761
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:32,968
a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.

762
00:57:46,718 --> 00:57:47,844
Something had happened.

763
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:52,012
A fuse blew and I had gone out of my skull.

764
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:03,567
I'm telling my dad!

765
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,063
Hey, Ralphie!

766
00:58:13,913 --> 00:58:16,040
Beat him up! Beat him up!

767
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,794
Did you hear what he said?

768
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:39,838
I have since heard of people under...

769
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,603
extreme duress speaking in strange tongues.

770
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,368
I became conscious that a steady torrent of obscenities...

771
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:51,847
and swearing of all kinds was pouring out of me as I screamed.

772
00:59:00,694 --> 00:59:02,252
Ralphie!

773
00:59:19,147 --> 00:59:21,012
We're going home. Come on.

774
00:59:40,135 --> 00:59:43,104
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

775
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:49,042
Put your head down in here.

776
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:51,639
Come on, get down in here.

777
00:59:52,748 --> 00:59:54,306
Settle down.

778
00:59:56,618 --> 01:00:00,349
I want you to go in there and lie down in your room for a while.

779
01:00:01,456 --> 01:00:03,583
Ralphie, just settle down.

780
01:00:07,296 --> 01:00:09,059
Here, dry off.

781
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:11,266
All right, calm down.

782
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:13,835
All right. Now go lie down.

783
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,150
The light was getting purple and soft outside.

784
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:39,125
Almost time for my father to come home from work.

785
01:00:59,516 --> 01:01:01,108
What's the matter? What you crying for?

786
01:01:02,086 --> 01:01:04,520
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.

787
01:01:05,122 --> 01:01:06,589
No, he's not.

788
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:08,089
Yes, he is, too.

789
01:01:08,192 --> 01:01:09,750
No, he's not.

790
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,058
I promise you Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

791
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:16,456
Why don't you come on out of there?

792
01:01:20,038 --> 01:01:21,198
Would you like some milk?

793
01:01:23,074 --> 01:01:24,803
You would?

794
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:32,643
Here you go.

795
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,009
All right?

796
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,450
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

797
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:54,432
I heard the car roar up the driveway, and a wave of terror broke over me.

798
01:01:54,674 --> 01:01:57,700
He'll know what I said, the awful things that I said.

799
01:01:57,944 --> 01:01:59,741
Get out of here!

800
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:03,678
Go on home, you mangy mutts. Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...

801
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:04,678
Hey, Bumpus!

802
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,218
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!

803
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:11,381
Hey, come on, what's for dinner? I'm starving to death.

804
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:33,906
Well, what happened today?

805
01:02:34,614 --> 01:02:35,945
Where's your glasses?

806
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:39,045
Did you lose your glasses again?

807
01:02:39,419 --> 01:02:40,351
Ralphie.

808
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,781
Remember, you left these on the radio again.

809
01:02:44,024 --> 01:02:46,857
Now try not to do that anymore.

810
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:49,452
So what else happened today?

811
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:52,363
Nothing much.

812
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:53,897
Ralphie had a fight.

813
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:55,463
A fight?

814
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:57,000
What kind of a fight?

815
01:02:59,439 --> 01:03:01,498
You know how boys are.

816
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:05,044
I gave him a talking to.

817
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:09,814
I see that the Bears are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

818
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:12,448
Oh, yeah.

819
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,645
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

820
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:16,856
He'll freeze his keister off out there.

821
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:23,419
I slowly began to realize I was not about to be destroyed.

822
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:25,265
The Chicago Bears.

823
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:27,357
The terror of the midway.

824
01:03:28,336 --> 01:03:31,828
From then on, things were different between me and my mother.

825
01:03:34,108 --> 01:03:37,168
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

826
01:03:37,345 --> 01:03:38,471
But Bears, never.

827
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,438
Strange.

828
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:45,448
Even something as monumental as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...

829
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:47,211
as it came to be known...

830
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,983
was pushed out of my mind as I struggled for a way out...

831
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,892
of the impenetrable BB gun web...

832
01:03:52,961 --> 01:03:55,020
in which my mother had me trapped.

833
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,456
Santa!

834
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,895
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

835
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:01,262
Of course! Santa.

836
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,629
The big man. The head honcho.

837
01:04:03,872 --> 01:04:05,100
The connection.

838
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,968
My mother had slipped up this time.

839
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:31,760
Mickey!

840
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:51,379
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.

841
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,482
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace. Just be still!

842
01:05:05,136 --> 01:05:07,570
Mom, this is just the same old dumb parade as last year.

843
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:09,968
Ralphie, will you please calm down.

844
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:10,868
Mom--

845
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:11,902
Hush!

846
01:05:11,902 --> 01:05:12,902
Shut up, Ralphie!

847
01:05:22,521 --> 01:05:23,317
There he is!

848
01:05:23,388 --> 01:05:25,549
Santa!

849
01:05:32,864 --> 01:05:35,355
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

850
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,233
Can we go now? Can we go?

851
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:38,333
Yes, we can go now.

852
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,665
Come on, Ralphie.

853
01:05:52,317 --> 01:05:54,410
Merry Christmas!

854
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:59,489
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

855
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:14,800
Ralphie, look over there.

856
01:06:14,874 --> 01:06:17,900
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.

857
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,844
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him. We'll see you later, okay?

858
01:06:20,913 --> 01:06:24,076
Stay together, you hear? And don't get lost.

859
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:28,745
Come on.

860
01:06:28,888 --> 01:06:30,355
Let's go.

861
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,887
Young man.

862
01:06:35,062 --> 01:06:36,188
Hey, kid.

863
01:06:36,563 --> 01:06:38,324
Just where do you think you're going?

864
01:06:38,324 --> 01:06:40,124
We're going up to see Santa.

865
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:43,766
The line ends here. It begins there.

866
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:45,899
Merry Christmas!

867
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:49,200
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.

868
01:06:55,115 --> 01:06:56,548
Come on.

869
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:05,255
The line waiting to see Santa stretched all the way back to Terre Haute!

870
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:07,793
And I was at the end of it.

871
01:07:10,131 --> 01:07:12,190
I like Santa.

872
01:07:16,571 --> 01:07:18,766
Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.

873
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:23,868
Moments before zero hour, it did not pay to take chances.

874
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:28,942
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.

875
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:32,243
My pretty...

876
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:34,614
What a tasty little boy.

877
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:38,791
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.

878
01:07:43,198 --> 01:07:45,325
I like The Wizard of Oz.

879
01:07:48,604 --> 01:07:50,538
I like the Tin Man.

880
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:58,839
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.

881
01:08:00,482 --> 01:08:02,541
Come on up on Santa's lap.

882
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:07,088
There's a wet one. And what's your name, little boy?

883
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:08,278
Billy.

884
01:08:08,357 --> 01:08:09,551
Come on, Randy.

885
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:14,323
And what do you want for Christmas, Billy? A toy truck?

886
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:16,365
Get him off my lap.

887
01:08:16,499 --> 01:08:18,296
Quick, get me a towel.

888
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:28,135
I hate the smell of tapioca.

889
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,115
Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00 and our store is closing.

890
01:08:33,516 --> 01:08:36,451
9:00! Great Scott! The store is gonna close!

891
01:08:37,487 --> 01:08:40,081
Santa can't wait all night.

892
01:08:40,657 --> 01:08:42,750
Come on up on Santa's lap.

893
01:08:52,536 --> 01:08:53,662
Get moving, kid.

894
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,700
Quit dragging your feet.

895
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,378
Get him out of here.

896
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:23,862
Come on, kid.

897
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:32,432
Come on up.

898
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:46,280
And what's your name, little boy?

899
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:49,861
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!

900
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:57,562
Listen, little boy, we got a lot of people waiting here, so get going!

901
01:09:59,772 --> 01:10:02,741
What do you want for Christmas, little boy?

902
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:05,202
My mind had gone blank.

903
01:10:05,344 --> 01:10:07,574
Frantically I tried to remember what it was I wanted.

904
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:09,205
I was blowing it, blowing it.

905
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:15,311
How about a nice football?

906
01:10:15,455 --> 01:10:18,447
Football. What's a football?

907
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:21,285
Without conscious will, my voice squeaked out:

908
01:10:21,394 --> 01:10:22,622
Football.

909
01:10:23,162 --> 01:10:24,754
Okay, get him out of here.

910
01:10:25,298 --> 01:10:28,631
A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?

911
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:31,067
Wake up, stupid, wake up!

912
01:10:38,879 --> 01:10:41,973
I want an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot...

913
01:10:42,082 --> 01:10:43,140
range model air rifle.

914
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:46,914
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

915
01:10:48,655 --> 01:10:50,452
Merry Christmas.

916
01:11:06,173 --> 01:11:07,970
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

917
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:18,519
Well, did you see Santa Claus?

918
01:11:19,087 --> 01:11:21,521
Did you tell him what you wanted for Christmas?

919
01:11:21,623 --> 01:11:25,354
Did he ask you if you'd been a good boy all year?

920
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,488
No.

921
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:29,455
Don't worry, he knows.

922
01:11:30,164 --> 01:11:31,688
He always knows.

923
01:11:34,469 --> 01:11:37,097
Merry Christmas.

924
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:40,371
Okay, down you go.

925
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:41,802
Bye, Chris.

926
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:54,452
That's fine.

927
01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:57,817
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!

928
01:11:59,728 --> 01:12:01,355
Well, the green string is out.

929
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:03,727
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.

930
01:12:03,999 --> 01:12:06,092
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.

931
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:07,361
I'm not color blind.

932
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:09,627
I'm not color blind, either.

933
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:14,799
There, see, I told you it was green.

934
01:12:17,314 --> 01:12:19,441
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

935
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:22,316
Hold it right there!

936
01:12:22,953 --> 01:12:24,716
A fuse is out.

937
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:28,918
The old man could replace fuses quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.

938
01:12:28,992 --> 01:12:30,619
He bought them by the gross.

939
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:38,262
Oh, Ralph.

940
01:12:38,568 --> 01:12:40,934
My, isn't that pretty?

941
01:12:41,104 --> 01:12:42,401
That son of a gun.

942
01:12:44,374 --> 01:12:45,568
Yeah. No.

943
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:47,370
That star is crooked.

944
01:12:47,644 --> 01:12:49,578
That star is perfectly straight.

945
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:53,576
Oh, you've got to be careful.

946
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:54,176
I am.

947
01:12:56,887 --> 01:13:00,015
It's just... Let me get it fixed. That's all right.

948
01:13:06,097 --> 01:13:07,621
Perfect.

949
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:12,332
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

950
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:14,394
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up this house...

951
01:13:14,472 --> 01:13:17,498
just because some boys weren't in bed when he came by.

952
01:13:17,642 --> 01:13:20,236
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...

953
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:22,836
a little while ago, going up the other side of the street.

954
01:13:23,914 --> 01:13:25,245
All right, you two, upstairs.

955
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:28,410
Go on the double, on the double.

956
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:41,023
Okay, let's get them.

957
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:46,457
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!

958
01:14:57,177 --> 01:14:59,270
Santa Claus had come!

959
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:05,045
Wow! A truck! That's mine!

960
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:07,849
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

961
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,411
What's in here?

962
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:10,782
It's hard.

963
01:15:11,126 --> 01:15:14,186
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!

964
01:15:23,271 --> 01:15:24,568
Does this raise?

965
01:15:39,754 --> 01:15:40,982
Merry Christmas.

966
01:15:42,457 --> 01:15:44,789
Merry Christmas, you two.

967
01:15:45,594 --> 01:15:48,290
Randy, no. Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

968
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:50,191
I want to play Santa!

969
01:15:50,191 --> 01:15:51,791
Well, wait a minute, Randy.

970
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:53,767
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

971
01:15:54,136 --> 01:15:56,263
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

972
01:15:56,539 --> 01:15:57,373
Come on, Ralphie.

973
01:15:57,373 --> 01:15:58,473
Who should I start with?

974
01:15:58,774 --> 01:16:01,072
Well, give Randy a present.

975
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:05,341
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you right over there.

976
01:16:05,447 --> 01:16:07,881
She always sends you such wonderful presents.

977
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,946
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.

978
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:32,332
Christmas had come. Officially. We plunged into the cornucopia...

979
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:36,277
quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.

980
01:16:36,413 --> 01:16:37,846
Didn't I get a tie this year?

981
01:16:44,988 --> 01:16:46,587
A zeppelin!

982
01:16:46,587 --> 01:16:48,287
A can of Simonize.

983
01:16:49,092 --> 01:16:52,255
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you? Show everybody.

984
01:16:57,435 --> 01:16:58,299
I don't want to.

985
01:16:58,903 --> 01:17:01,337
Ralphie, show everybody what Aunt Clara gave you.

986
01:17:02,273 --> 01:17:05,106
Aunt Clara had for years labored under the delusion that...

987
01:17:05,176 --> 01:17:09,704
I was not only perpetually four years old, but also a girl.

988
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:14,082
She just always gives you the nicest things, Ralphie.

989
01:17:18,589 --> 01:17:21,387
Oh, isn't that sweet?

990
01:17:21,826 --> 01:17:23,524
Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you--

991
01:17:23,524 --> 01:17:24,624
I don't want to!

992
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:27,129
Go upstairs right now and try on that present!

993
01:17:27,232 --> 01:17:30,599
She went to all that trouble to make it! Now go on.

994
01:17:38,277 --> 01:17:42,441
While Ralphie is changing, I'm going to play Santa Claus.

995
01:17:42,514 --> 01:17:44,141
Now, let me see what can I find.

996
01:17:44,349 --> 01:17:47,910
I see something! Randy.

997
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:49,916
This is for you, honey.

998
01:17:50,789 --> 01:17:52,723
And this is for Daddy.

999
01:17:55,661 --> 01:17:56,355
Here.

1000
01:17:56,428 --> 01:17:58,293
From me to you.

1001
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:02,396
Thanks a lot.

1002
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:05,032
I wonder what it could be?

1003
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:09,031
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

1004
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:11,504
Well, it's a blue ball!

1005
01:18:13,179 --> 01:18:14,942
It's a bowling ball.

1006
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:17,211
Thank you, darling.

1007
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:18,845
Do you like it?

1008
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:20,445
Yes, very much. Very much.

1009
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:22,052
Ralphie.

1010
01:18:22,255 --> 01:18:24,280
We're waiting.

1011
01:18:24,457 --> 01:18:26,015
Oh, come on, Mom.

1012
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:28,120
Right now!

1013
01:18:38,205 --> 01:18:41,834
Lmmediately my feet began to sweat as those two fluffy little bunnies...

1014
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:45,276
with the blue button eyes stared sappily up at me.

1015
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:48,709
Come down here so I can see you better.

1016
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,347
I just hoped Flick would never spot them...

1017
01:18:51,485 --> 01:18:54,784
as the word of this humiliation could easily make life...

1018
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,688
at Warren G. Harding School a veritable hell.

1019
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:01,116
Isn't that cute?

1020
01:19:01,795 --> 01:19:05,424
That is the most precious thing I've ever seen in my life.

1021
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:07,131
Shut up, Randy.

1022
01:19:08,135 --> 01:19:10,228
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.

1023
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,335
He does not!

1024
01:19:13,335 --> 01:19:14,135
He does, too.

1025
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:15,904
He looks like a pink nightmare.

1026
01:19:16,578 --> 01:19:18,569
Are you happy wearing that?

1027
01:19:18,913 --> 01:19:19,902
Do you want to take it off?

1028
01:19:20,115 --> 01:19:21,343
You tell the kid to take it off.

1029
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:24,385
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits. Go on and take it off.

1030
01:19:24,452 --> 01:19:26,113
Take it off!

1031
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:31,624
My God, will you look at that mess?

1032
01:19:32,027 --> 01:19:33,661
Who's going to clean the papers up?

1033
01:19:33,661 --> 01:19:34,461
Not me.

1034
01:19:35,864 --> 01:19:37,096
Randy did it last year.

1035
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:38,196
Well, he can do it again.

1036
01:19:40,769 --> 01:19:43,670
You know, this wine is not bad. It's not good either, but...

1037
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:44,998
You want a sip?

1038
01:19:44,999 --> 01:19:46,299
No, you don't.

1039
01:19:47,777 --> 01:19:48,869
Did you have a nice Christmas?

1040
01:19:49,612 --> 01:19:50,579
Yeah, pretty nice.

1041
01:19:50,679 --> 01:19:52,146
Did you get everything you wanted?

1042
01:19:53,115 --> 01:19:54,777
Well, almost.

1043
01:19:54,777 --> 01:19:55,777
Almost?

1044
01:19:55,885 --> 01:19:57,512
Well, that's life.

1045
01:19:58,187 --> 01:19:59,882
Well, there's always next Christmas.

1046
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,490
That's funny.

1047
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,191
What's that over there behind the desk?

1048
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:09,162
Where?

1049
01:20:09,231 --> 01:20:11,062
Behind the desk, against the wall over there.

1050
01:20:13,903 --> 01:20:15,234
Why don't you go check it out?

1051
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:33,219
What did we put over there, honey?

1052
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:36,784
Santa Claus probably put it.

1053
01:21:13,664 --> 01:21:17,498
Oh, it was beautiful. I could hardly wait to try it out.

1054
01:21:18,269 --> 01:21:19,930
Do you know how to load it?

1055
01:21:23,374 --> 01:21:24,636
That's right.

1056
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:33,215
Be careful.

1057
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:35,118
Don't. They run all over.

1058
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,222
Close her up. Close it up.

1059
01:21:44,296 --> 01:21:46,992
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1060
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:47,866
Sure.

1061
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:48,566
Okay.

1062
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:50,160
But outside.

1063
01:21:50,269 --> 01:21:52,134
I still say those things are dangerous.

1064
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:56,233
Put on your galoshes and your coat. It's cold out.

1065
01:21:59,678 --> 01:22:02,613
I had one when I was eight years old.

1066
01:22:03,216 --> 01:22:05,741
What if he hurts himself? Ralphie, your coat!

1067
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:08,955
Don't shoot any animals or birds!

1068
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:10,955
Except the Bumpuses' dogs!

1069
01:22:12,559 --> 01:22:14,550
Be careful, Ralphie!

1070
01:22:15,228 --> 01:22:18,322
Now it is well known throughout the Midwest that the old man...

1071
01:22:18,398 --> 01:22:20,263
is a turkey junkie.

1072
01:22:21,134 --> 01:22:25,434
A bona fide garley turkicanus freak. A few days before Christmas...

1073
01:22:25,572 --> 01:22:29,668
his eyes would begin to gleam with a wild and ravenous light.

1074
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:37,946
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1075
01:22:51,932 --> 01:22:53,866
Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!

1076
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:55,592
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

1077
01:22:56,070 --> 01:23:00,336
You'll shoot your eye out, you'll shoot your eye out!

1078
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:04,472
Ralphie, you be careful out there. Don't shoot your eye out!

1079
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:06,604
She hadn't seen! She didn't know!

1080
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:09,842
My eye's all right. The BB must've hit my glasses.

1081
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,947
My glasses! Oh, no!

1082
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,682
Where are my glasses?

1083
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,088
Few things brought such swift and terrible retribution...

1084
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:22,163
on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!

1085
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,763
Stop!

1086
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,448
Oh, no!

1087
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:46,182
Oh, no! Pulverized.

1088
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:02,231
For a moment I thought, I'll fake it. They'll never know the lens is gone!

1089
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:07,740
Randomly, my mind evolved a spectacular plot.

1090
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:10,104
Let's see, an icicle!

1091
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,812
Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!

1092
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:17,347
It would work. It had to work. Quickly, I whipped up some tears.

1093
01:24:23,627 --> 01:24:26,391
What's the matter, honey? What happened?

1094
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:27,691
What happened? Let me see that.

1095
01:24:27,764 --> 01:24:31,530
There was this icicle and it fell off the garage and it hit me.

1096
01:24:35,906 --> 01:24:36,737
What is it?

1097
01:24:36,737 --> 01:24:39,137
No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.

1098
01:24:43,313 --> 01:24:44,803
Wake up, Randy.

1099
01:24:49,586 --> 01:24:50,917
Oh, God.

1100
01:24:51,088 --> 01:24:54,148
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.

1101
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:58,355
And I tried to get out of the way, but I...

1102
01:25:00,298 --> 01:25:04,200
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1103
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:06,230
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.

1104
01:25:06,304 --> 01:25:08,431
Those icicles have been known to kill people.

1105
01:25:14,679 --> 01:25:16,380
What's going on up there?

1106
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,080
Nothing. We'll be right down.

1107
01:25:18,383 --> 01:25:21,045
You stay away from that turkey! It's got an hour to cook.

1108
01:25:21,152 --> 01:25:22,312
You'll get worms!

1109
01:25:27,492 --> 01:25:28,982
But what about my glasses?

1110
01:25:29,561 --> 01:25:31,893
You can wear the old ones with the crack in them...

1111
01:25:31,964 --> 01:25:33,795
until we get you some new ones.

1112
01:25:36,635 --> 01:25:38,535
I had pulled it off!

1113
01:25:39,938 --> 01:25:41,803
But I left my gun outside.

1114
01:25:43,108 --> 01:25:45,975
When you get dressed you can go out and get your gun.

1115
01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:47,543
Hold that on there.

1116
01:25:48,046 --> 01:25:49,638
Life is like that.

1117
01:25:50,115 --> 01:25:55,052
Sometimes at the height of our reveries, when our joy is at its zenith...

1118
01:25:55,154 --> 01:25:58,055
when all is most right with the world...

1119
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:01,523
the most unthinkable disasters descend upon us.

1120
01:26:16,976 --> 01:26:18,534
Oh, turkey!

1121
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:36,590
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!

1122
01:26:51,812 --> 01:26:55,407
The heavenly aroma still hung heavy in the house. But it was gone.

1123
01:26:55,549 --> 01:26:58,575
All gone. No turkey. No turkey sandwiches.

1124
01:26:58,652 --> 01:27:02,679
No turkey salad. No turkey gravy, turkey hash, turkey a la king...

1125
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,087
or gallons of turkey soup.

1126
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:04,886
Gone.

1127
01:27:04,959 --> 01:27:06,221
All gone.

1128
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:11,854
All right.

1129
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:13,231
Everybody upstairs.

1130
01:27:13,468 --> 01:27:14,765
Get dressed.

1131
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:18,428
We are going out to eat.

1132
01:27:42,731 --> 01:27:47,191
No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."

1133
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:48,399
Sing like this:

1134
01:27:56,846 --> 01:27:58,336
Try again.

1135
01:28:08,357 --> 01:28:09,551
Stop!

1136
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:12,089
Sing something else.

1137
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:26,734
No!

1138
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:27,902
Stop!

1139
01:28:28,779 --> 01:28:31,043
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1140
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,521
Oh, I'm sorry.

1141
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:46,022
It's a beautiful duck.

1142
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:48,091
It really is.

1143
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:50,526
But you see...

1144
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:53,832
What?

1145
01:28:53,904 --> 01:28:55,872
It's smiling at me.

1146
01:29:01,446 --> 01:29:02,538
Okay?

1147
01:29:03,948 --> 01:29:05,381
Beautiful!

1148
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,945
That Christmas would live in our memories...

1149
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:14,491
as the Christmas when we were introduced to Chinese turkey.

1150
01:29:15,927 --> 01:29:17,918
All was right with the world.

1151
01:29:38,884 --> 01:29:41,182
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.

1152
01:29:42,021 --> 01:29:43,989
Is that beautiful!

1153
01:30:29,936 --> 01:30:34,202
Next to me in the blackness lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.

1154
01:30:34,974 --> 01:30:37,306
The greatest Christmas gift I had ever received...

1155
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,843
or would ever receive.

1156
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:43,677
Gradually, I drifted off to sleep, pranging ducks on the wing...

1157
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:46,276
and getting off spectacular hip shots.
