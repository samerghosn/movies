and not fifteen?

00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,820
Why doesn't this angel
come once every year?

285
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:15,253
Or every Thursday
afternoon for tea?

286

And why in all of God's
green Earth, Gladbury'!

Gospel of John chapter one.

00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:47,091
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:52,491
The same was in
the beginning with God.

531

All things were made by him;

532
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:59,091
and without him was not any
thing made that was made.

533
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:03,723
In him was life; and the
life was the light of men.

534
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:06,124
And the light
shineth in darkness;

535
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,920
and the darkness
comprehend it not."

00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:19,723
"And the impediment
to his tongue was loosed,

537
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:22,451
and he spoke plainly."

00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:28,914
Now Charlie, we are going
to loose that tongue of yours.

a step of faith.

Mrs. Hopewell.

713
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,532
A friend of mine may be
coming to Gladbury for a while.

714

stay with you and Herbert.

715

as long as she likes.

stumbled about in the dark ages,

when it should
be lighting the way.

749
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:42,364
In fact, I believe that
the church should

750
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:45,386
be the first place to
embrace the future.

751
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:48,930
Indeed. Now this I have to see.

00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,030
[DAVID] Miss Barstow,
does this mean that you'll

753
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,031
finally be coming to church?

754
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,196
[Emily laughs]

755
00:49:55,196 --> 00:49:57,355
Twenty-nine prayers.

756
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,263
And only one can be answered.

757
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:04,263
You mean thirty, dear.
Thirty candles.

758
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:05,895
No, I'm certain
there were twenty-nine.

759
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:07,862
[EDWARD] Bea, there were
thirty candles hanging

760
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,596
the night of the angel's visit.

761
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:11,960
There're always thirty candles.

762
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:15,529
Twenty-nine!

763
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,428

764
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:20,929
Don't say it Edward,
please don't say it out loud.

765

768
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:39,260

About twenty.

769
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:41,289

Then I want thirty.

770
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,955
No, thirty-five bulbs.

772
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,594
The circuit can only support
so many watts, Reverend.

773
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,461
[DAVID] Then install another
circuit. Install five circuits.

774
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:53,294

this church to surpass

776
00:50:56,461 --> 00:50:58,794
[HERBERT] Reverend Richmond,
could you tell me why

777
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:01,960
there are men digging
in the church yard,

778
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:04,553
and fiddling in
our sanctuary walls.

779
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:08,294
You leave that. My grandfather
carved that altar.

780
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:13,783
[DAVID] Herbert! I ordered them
here to install electricity.

781
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:16,093
Electricity?

782
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:18,227
Electricity is the future.

783
00:51:18,228 --> 00:51:19,627
And a more
practical one at that.

784
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:20,727

785
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:24,227
How will our treasury
stand this extravagance?

786
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,760
Don't trouble yourself,
Mr. Hopewell.

787
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:29,057
I've covered the
cost personally.

788
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:30,960
Consider it my contribution to a

789
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:33,694

Gladbury': history.

790
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,959

at the coming nativity service.

this with an open mind.

candles or lanterns to change.

01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:55,850
We did everything we knew to do.

1048
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,475
We gave away every last candle,
and this one came back.

1049

Twice.

1050
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:10,082
This could be
our miracle, Edward.

1051
01:15:19,316 --> 01:15:21,715
I hope I'm not overstepping
my boundaries,

1052
01:15:21,716 --> 01:15:25,479
but I know just the person to
give the candle to this year.

1053
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,208
David Richmond.

1054
01:15:29,515 --> 01:15:31,708
Think of it, Edward.

1055
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:35,149
Your father gave the candle
to Reverend Pillington.

1056
01:15:35,149 --> 01:15:38,048
And as we know, David is a far
greater wretch than he ever was.

1057
01:15:38,049 --> 01:15:40,381
[BEA] You make a compelling
argument, but I don't--

1058
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:42,814
Don't tell me you've
given the candle away.

1059
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:50,038
This is the candle,
isn't it'! Splendid.

1060
01:15:50,215 --> 01:15:52,215
Then we're in agreement?

1061

[BEA] Lady Camdon,
I don't think--

1062
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:59,315
[EDWARD]Yes, we'll give
the candle to David.

he could use a little light.

weren't the first choice.

What am I to do with it.

1074
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,668
Just light it and...
just light it.

1075

It's true.

Cousin Charlie was given
this blasted Christmas Candle,

and the poor boy
has given it to me.

1088

Who could refuse
a gift like that?

1089
01:18:28,477 --> 01:18:30,477
Now all I can do is pray.

I owe it to him.

That is a problem.

[DAVID] On the contrary.
A great and wondrous miracle

1100
01:18:58,476 --> 01:19:00,567
has taken place this
Christmas season.

1101
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:05,242
It seems that the angel
has blessed not one,

1102
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:08,242
but two Christmas
Candles this year.

1103
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:11,508
And now that I think of it,
how small is my faith,

1104
01:19:11,509 --> 01:19:14,242
to think that this angel
might stop at two.

1105
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:16,174
Why not three or four?

1106
01:19:16,343 --> 01:19:18,209
Or maybe there are no
limits to the blessings

1107
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:20,408
the Good Lord might
bestow upon Gladbury.

1108
01:19:20,408 --> 01:19:21,674
[BEA]
Well, we can explain.

1109
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:23,008
Edward tripped, and then--

1110
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,009
you came around.

1111
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:24,908
There was an accident.

1112

Yes, we'd lost the candle.

1113
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:28,074
So I said, "Why don't we
give all the candles?"

Bea.

1115
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:29,708

1116
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:30,975
We meant no harm.

1117
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:32,669
But you've given us false hope.

Surely you can see that.

How could you?

01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:44,874
How could you question my

Gladbury when you, yourselves
so blatantly misled them?

1122

I fear this Christmas will end
in nothing but disappointment,

1123
01:19:50,674 --> 01:19:52,807

Allow me, Reverend.

It's time.

1133
01:20:56,706 --> 01:21:02,006
On Christmas Eve, we light
the final candle of Advent,

in Christ do we find the hope,

to speak on the virtue

So Reverend, have you changed
your mind about Gladbury?

confirmed my suspicions.
