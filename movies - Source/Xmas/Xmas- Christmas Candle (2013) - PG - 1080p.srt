[match ignition]

3
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,385
[NARRATOR]
There's a story that has been

4
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:56,818
passed down for centuries,

5
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,876
from father to son.

6
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,518
Legend has it a
certain man came

7
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,383
to live in the
village of Gladbury.

8
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:10,218
He was a good-hearted man,

9
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,311
devoted to his
family and his craft.

10
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:19,614
The candle maker brought
light to the entire village.

11
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:23,051
But he longed to give them more.

12
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:25,384
Life was hard in Gladbury,

13
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:29,339
and the people had
become disheartened.

14
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,550
[NARRATOR] Night and day,
the candle maker worked,

15
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:39,506
pouring his heart and
his prayers into each candle.

16
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,784
But on the first
Sunday of Advent,

17
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:47,351
all he had left to give...
was a single prayer,

18
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:54,550
not for himself, but for
Gladbury, for his son,

19
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,448
and for all the sons
and daughters to come.

20
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,474
Silence was the only answer
he would receive that night.

21
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,673
Or so it seemed.

22
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:08,510
[NARRATOR] An angel
blessed a single candle.

23
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:14,948
The heavenly gift was given
to the ones who needed it most,

24
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:17,381
with the simple instruction:

25
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,177
Light this and pray.

26
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:31,646
[NARRATOR] The children
hoped for an answered prayer.

27
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,980
But what they
received was a miracle.

28
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:37,613
On Christmas Eve,
the village rejoiced

29
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:41,047
upon hearing of
their change of fortune,

30
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,547
for such things do happen.

31
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:47,309
And from them, legends are born.

32
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,447
As the tale is told,
every twenty-five years,

33
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:54,380
the angel visits
The Haddington Chandlery,

34
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,142
and every time
a prayer is answered.

35
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:06,012
But even the greatest
stories must come to an end.

36
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:09,879
Much has changed
in two hundred years.

37
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,437
In a world illuminated
by modern marvels,

38
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,536
who needs the
light of a simple candle?

39
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:24,502
[bustling about and voices]

40
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,546
[YOUNG BOY]
I'm starving.

41
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:30,341
[ABNER]
How are you'! Hello.

42
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:35,645
[ABNER]
How we doing'! Alright?

43
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,045
[DAVID]
Yeah, very good, yeah.

44
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,274
Hope they'll be bringing
some more soon.

45
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:40,978
[ABNER]
Bless you little lady.

46
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,545
[GIRL]
ls it soup again'!

47
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,670
[ABNER]
God bless you, sir.

48
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,345
[MISS FOSTER] There's no
longer a place for you here!

49
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:47,978
[RUTH]
Please!

50
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,511
[MISS FOSTER] I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

51
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:51,671
Orders came straight
from the top.

52
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,111
[MISS FOSTER]
You should learn to keep your

53
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:57,374
affections to yourself,
Ruth Goodchild!

54
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:11,105
[MISS FOSTER] And don't even
think about coming back!

55
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,209
[WOMAN PASSERBY]
Serves you right.

56
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:22,006
[Ruth begins to weep]

57
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,137
Abner, will you take
over for a second?

58
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:29,035
Yes. God bless you, sir.

59
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:39,311
[Ruth weeping]

60
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,537
Hello, miss.

61
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,104
Miss.

62
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:45,007
What do you want'!

63
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,172
I only mean to help.

64
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,473
[DAVID] It's no Buckingham
Palace, Miss Goodchild.

65
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,976
But you'll be safe here.

66
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:11,443
And with three meals
a day, you won't go hungry.

67
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:15,205
When the baby comes, what then'!

68
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,875
Well, perhaps there's someone...

69
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:20,308
No.There's nobody.

70
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,609
Or rather there was,
but he found someone else

71
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,837
and dismissed me
from work today.

72
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,641
[DAVID]
Don't lose hope, miss.

73
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:32,608
We'll find a place
for you and your baby.

74
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,708
[ABNER]
God bless you, sir.

75
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,840
[LADY CAMDON]
Reverend Richmond?

76
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:07,974
Friend of yours?

77
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:09,107
I have no idea.

78
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,640
God bless you.

79
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,936
Reverend David Richmond.

80
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:15,774
So you really
have left the pulpit.

81
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:18,174
Nonsense.This is my pulpit now.

82
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,873
Soup, soap, and salvation.

83
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,305
And please,
I'm only known as David here.

84
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,806
Have we met?

85
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:28,306
We might have, had you not
rejected my last three letters.

86
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,607
Ah, yes, Lady Camdon
of Gladbury, in the flesh.

87
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,273
But I'm sorry that you've
traveled so far only

88
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:37,805
to hear me decline your
offer once again.

89
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:41,000
My place is here,
helping the needy.

90
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,206
You, sir, have you
heard this man preach?

91
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,706
Can't say that I have.

92
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,806
[LADY CAMDON] Villagers
flocked to London to hear him.

93
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,039
I once sat by a fisherman
who rode his boat

94
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,339
twelve miles for one sermon.

95
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,806
It was along time ago.

96
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,362
But I'll never forget.

97
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:01,102
David Richmond, miracle man.

98
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:03,305
In the midst of
my own great loss,

99
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:06,931
it was your words
that revived my faith.

100
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:11,639
Any able bodied man
can serve a bowl of soup,

101
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,605
but few men have
a gift like yours.

102
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,306
My only hope is that
you choose to serve

103
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,533
where your gift is needed most.

104
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:26,872
God bless you.

105
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,337
[BOY] Thank you very much, sir.

106
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,269
[ABNER] Perhaps you
should think about it, David.

107
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,360
[ABNER]
God bless you.Well done, sir.

108
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,471
[ABNER]
That's it, take a bowl.

109
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:45,267
Sorry.

110
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:53,171
[DAVID] Dear Lady Camdon,
your recent visit was a

111
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:56,970
timely reminder of
the life I left behind.

112
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,603
Though tragedy has
altered my course,

113
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:02,866
I can no longer stray from
my calling in the pulpit.

114
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,269
I humbly accept the offer
to serve your parish in the

115
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,202
place of the late
Reverend Pillington.

116
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:13,836
I shall arrive in Gladbury
the Friday before Advent.

117
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:17,031
Yours truly, David Richmond.

118
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,970
[EMILY]
Come on, boy!

119
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,636
Come on! Move on!

120
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,370
You silly old thing. Come on!

121
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,268
Move on!

122
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,328
Come on!

123
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,335
Might I offer you
some assistance?

124
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,598
Thank you, I'm quite capable!

125
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,269
Well, if it wouldn't be too
forward of me, I could--

126
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,530
[EMILY]
No!

127
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:48,427
I'm not a sack of potatoes.

128
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,499
Come on!

129
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:55,163
[EMILY]
Come on, boy. Come on!

130
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,167
[EMILY]
I don't need your help.

131
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:01,662
[DAVID]
Come on. Come on.

132
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:04,125
Come on.

133
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:15,468
[DAVID] And where are
you headed, miss'!

134
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:17,035
Miss Barstow.

135
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,502
I'm headed to London
by way of Gladbury.

136
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,001
And the people of Gladbury,

137
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,967
they allow a lady to
venture on her own'!

138
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:25,600
It's the Christmas season.
The whole town's in a fuss.

139
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,301
[DAVID] But Christmas
isn't for weeks.

140
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,968
[EMILY] I take it you've
never been to Gladbury.

141
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,168
Is it really so bad?

142
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:31,634
It is.

143
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,657
[DAVID]Whoa,
steady boy. Come on!

144
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:37,467
Come on, come on, come on!

145
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:40,367
Whoa.Whoa.

146
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,633
[EMILY] Especially
this Christmas

147
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,033
with the new minister
set to arrive.

148
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,267
Reverend High and
Mighty from London.

149
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,600
I hope they dislike
him very much.

150
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:53,033
Thank you. I hate to be indebted
to anyone, much less a stranger.

151
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,167
It's an easy debt to forgive.

152
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:58,361
"Reverend High and
Mighty" at your service.

153
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,466
Reverend. How providential.

154
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,366
Oh, we shall see.

155
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:07,500
Might you have
any words of advice?

156
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,659
Yes.

157
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,459
Retreat.

158
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,432
Walk on.

159
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,099
Very well then.
I look forward to

160
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,033
seeing you at
church on Sunday!

161
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,666
[Emily laughs]

162
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,792
Walk on.

163
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,499
[EDWARD]
Thank you Ebenezer.

164
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,999
<i>REM Hurry up, Edward.</i>

165
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,798
We don't want the new
minister thinking the

166
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,856
Haddingtons are a pair
of village bumpkins.

167
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,166
Codswallop my dear,
you look lovely.

168
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,798
I come from a long line of
bumpkins, and I'm proud of it.

169
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,322
Who wouldn't love
Gladbury at Christmas?

170
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,426
[MAN]
He's here!

171
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:54,931
[GIRLS]
There he is!

172
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58,790
[villagers greet David]

173
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,655
[crowd gasps]

174
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:13,264
Hello.

175
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:15,787
[HERBERT] Alright gentlefolk,
make some space.

176
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:18,461
Oh here, allow me.

177
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:23,531
Herbert Hopewell,
at your service.

178
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,759
Me and the Missus'll
be looking after you.

179
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:29,097
[DAVID] Oh.Thank you,
but I can manage.

180
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,996
Not while I'm still breathing.

181
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:34,192
Reverend Richmond,
welcome to Gladbury.

182
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:37,464
I'm Bea Haddington,
and this is my Edward.

183
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:39,192
Edward Haddington.

184
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,153
Of Haddington Chandlery.

185
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:45,422
Home of the Christmas Candle...'!

186
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,255
<i>Um.</i>

187
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,092
Oh, you haven't heard of us.

188
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:58,163
That's alright,
you'll have a chance

189
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:00,322
to meet the reverend
soon enough.

190
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,162
Lovely to see you.

191
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,263
All of you!

192
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,126
Let's see the church, eh?

193
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,823
[church bells ring]
[organ playing]

194
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:18,829
[ELEANOR] â™ª On a starry
night in Bethlehem, â™ª

195
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:24,329
â™ª A child was born
to bring light to men. â™ª

196
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:29,762
â™ª And our faith waned,
our eyes grew dim â™ª

197
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:36,529
â™ª In a candle's light
we found hope again. â™ª

198
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,328
There are miracles
all around,

199
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,028
Are you alright?

200
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,517
[HERBERT] There she is,
a special soul.

201
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:47,828
â™ª Miracles yet to be found. â™ª

202
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,428
Sometimes I think
I'm hearing an angel.

203
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:53,194
â™ª Hid in every heart is
an answered prayer. â™ª

204
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,627
That's my <i>lady...</i>
Eleanor.

205
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:03,755
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

206
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,660
[ELEANOR] Off with
that muddy coat!

207
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:12,093
Did you crawl all
the way from London?

208
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:18,294
[ELEANOR]
Come on, britches too.

209
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,927
You're not the first clergyman
I've seen in his underpants.

210
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,587
[Herbert laughs]

211
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:26,923
[Eleanor giggles]

212
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,292
[ELEANOR]
I'll just get these cleaned up.

213
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,327
[Eleanor giggles]

214
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:40,826
Weâ€™re just across the
garden if you need us.

215
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,860
Anything at all.

216
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,486
Welcome to Gladbury, Reverend.

217
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:51,793
Jesus said, "Ye are
the light of the world."

218
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:55,859
A city that is set on
a hill cannot be hid.

219
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,758
[parishioner coughs]

220
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,683
Neither do men light a candle
and put it under a bushel,

221
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,486
But on a candlestick.

222
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:12,682
And it giveth light unto
all that are in the house.

223
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:16,687
Let your light
so shine before men.

224
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,492
That they may
see your good works.

225
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:23,758
And glorify your Father,
which is in Heaven.

226
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,691
Thank you Reverend.

227
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,125
Is he talking about
our Christmas Candle?

228
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,358
I think he's gettin' to it.

229
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,756
[DAVID]
You sir!

230
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,959
Would you hide this
candle under a bushel?

231
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,591
No sir, I wouldn't.

232
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:37,825
Of course not.

233
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,125
And you, Mrs. Haddington?

234
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,023
Would you conceal
this candle under your hat?

235
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,124
Lovely as it is.

236
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,818
[BEA]
No, no, never.

237
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:51,157
[DAVID] Candles
belong on candlesticks,

238
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:53,991
giving light to everyone.

239
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,657
[DAVID]
What then is this light

240
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:59,783
that draws men to
our Heavenly Father?

241
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:05,855
Is it signs and wonders'!
Angels and miracles?

242
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:11,290
[DAVID]
Of course not!

243
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,357
[93335]

244
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:16,856
[DAVID] It is our good works
that shine before men

245
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:19,789
and glorify our
Father in Heaven.

246
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,290
<i>No.</i>

247
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,813
Not one word about
the Christmas Candle.

248
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:29,452
Better luck next time.

249
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:31,422
[LADY CAMDON]
Reverend Richmond.

250
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:32,423
Lady Camdon.

251
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,956
What a fascinating sermon.

252
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:35,183
Thank you.

253
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,356
And yet so unlike the sermons
for which you're loved.

254
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:41,456
That's not to
worry you, Reverend.

255
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:44,190
You'll do very
well here in Gladbury.

256
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,247
I'll make sure of it.

257
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,119
[DAVID] "An early Christmas gift
for you and all of Gladbury."

258
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,323
This is quite unexpected.

259
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,022
A gift from the
Countess of Gladbury!

260
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:00,522
Whatever could it be?

261
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:02,613
Whatever could it be, eh?

262
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:08,321
Gladbury': most
beloved Advent sermons.

263
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:09,845
Tried and true.

264
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,655
[HERBERT] Some of these sermons
are two hundred years old.

265
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,589
And I imagine her ladyship
expects me to use these sermons.

266
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:21,121
Well, I can think of no
better way to preserve

267
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:23,489
the legacy of the
Christmas Candle.

268
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:26,322
Forgive my ignorance, but what
is this Christmas Candle?

269
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:30,414
I think you'll find everything
you're looking for in here.

270
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,515
[DAVID]
This is preposterous!

271
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,245
I thought you might
stop by, Reverend.

272
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:46,354
Tea?

273
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:48,253
Had I known that the people
of this town were expecting

274
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:49,754
to hear such fairy
tales from the pulpit,

275
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:50,621
I never would have come!

276
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:53,454
The Christmas Candle is
no fairy tale, I assure you.

277
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,455
[DAVID] Oh, then I suppose
that you have seen

278
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:57,488
this magical wish
granting angel'!

279
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:58,612
<i>No.</i>

280
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,281
But he has.

281
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,653
[DAVID] Ah, yes,
the candle maker.

282
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:07,754
Do I have some
questions for you.

283
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:10,587
Why one Christmas Candle,
and not fifteen?

284
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,820
Why doesn't this angel
come once every year?

285
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:15,253
Or every Thursday
afternoon for tea?

286
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:18,152
And why in all of God's
green Earth, Gladbury'!

287
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:19,586
[EDWARD]
Why Bethlehem?

288
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:21,486
Why a babe in a manger?

289
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:24,520
Who could possibly hope to
understand the ways of the Lord'!

290
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,419
But I see no reason to
promote superstitions

291
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
or raise false hopes.

292
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,186
[LADY CAMDON] People of
Gladbury lead difficult lives.

293
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:33,584
Even the slightest hope of a
miracle keeps their faith alive.

294
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:37,119
Only to be crushed when
their prayers go unanswered.

295
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,519
If this is what your
people need, then I--

296
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,819
[LADY CAMDON]
What our people need is hope.

297
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,945
And you can give it to them.

298
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,619
I know this firsthand.

299
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,074
Lady Camdon, I'm not the
"miracle man" that you remember.

300
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,149
Coming to Gladbury
was a mistake.

301
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,919
[EDWARD] On that
we are in agreement.

302
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,185
[LADY CAMDON]
But what if it were providence

303
00:19:58,186 --> 00:19:59,947
that brought you here?

304
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,818
I think you should stay.

305
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:08,119
[EDWARD]Why prolong
the inevitable?

306
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,607
Just until Christmas.

307
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:13,647
[LADY CAMDON]
This is the year.

308
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,749
Please, David, consider it.

309
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,609
[VICTORIA] Let's go
play in the garden.

310
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:26,607
[BOY] Victoria, wait for me!

311
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,484
[DAVID] I take it you're not
much of a horsewoman.

312
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,683
[EMILY] If it isn't the
ever-helpful reverend.

313
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,741
[DAVID]Well that depends
on who you're asking.

314
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:42,318
I fear I have little to offer
the people of Gladbury.

315
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,483
[EMILY] Don't pity
yourself, Reverend.

316
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:47,416
Though I did warn you.
This town is mad.

317
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:50,810
[DAVID] All their hopes
wrapped up in one candle.

318
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,417
Oh, not just any candle,
the Christmas Candle.

319
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,008
[DAVID] Miss Barstow, do I
detect an air of skepticism.

320
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:59,250
[EMILY]The Christmas
Candle': no different than

321
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,250
old wives' tales or
your Bible stories.

322
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,182
Take no offense, Reverend.

323
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,150
So you're not a believer then'!

324
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,116
I'm a believer...
in common sense.

325
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:14,243
If something seems too good to
be true, then most likely it is.

326
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,178
They'll find out soon enough.

327
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,349
In fifty years, will anyone
know what a candle is'!

328
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:21,482
Doubtful, we've already
stepped into the

329
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:23,483
Modern age in my father's shop,

330
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,971
and I must say,
it's electrifying.

331
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,316
"London Lamp 8' Electric"?

332
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,416
[EMILY] The bane of Edward
Haddington': existence.

333
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,748
And worse, founded
by his very own son.

334
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,015
Of course.
Thomas Haddington.

335
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:37,416
He's the Haddington':
only child,

336
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,915
So the fairy tale ends with him.

337
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,246
[DAVID]What's this for'!
ls this for the Christmas tree'!

338
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,782
I envy him.

339
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,348
He left Gladbury when
he had the chance.

340
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,473
You'd be wise to do the same.

341
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,776
[DAVID]
And what about you'?

342
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:53,515
[EMILY] My time will come.

343
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:57,447
When Father's health improves
and he can manage on his own.

344
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,148
[DAVID] Perhaps
we'll find ourselves

345
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,581
In London next Christmas.

346
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:03,582
[EMILY] If you make it out
of Gladbury intact.

347
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:07,014
â™ª Oh come all ye faithful. â™ª

348
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:10,448
â™ª Joyful and triumphant. â™ª

349
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:18,681
â™ª Oh come ye oh come
ye to Bethlehem. â™ª

350
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:22,447
â™ª Come and behold Him, â™ª

351
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:25,781
â™ª Born the king of angels. â™ª

352
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:29,413
â™ª Oh come let us adore Him. â™ª

353
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,580
â™ª Oh come let us adore Him. â™ª

354
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:41,843
â™ª Oh come let us adore
Him, Christ the Lord. â™ª

355
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,969
[citizens talking
and moving about]

356
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:50,513
[WILLIAM] You must
be the new Reverend.

357
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:52,411
I'm William Barstow.

358
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,579
Illness kept me from
church on Sunday,

359
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,580
but I've heard about you.

360
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,944
Oh?

361
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,646
My daughter told me the
new reverend is more

362
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,847
than eager to lend
a helping hand,

363
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,438
even if it does mean
wading through mud.

364
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:12,976
Oh yes, the spirited
Miss Barstow.

365
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:18,346
[WILLIAM] I've prayed for
something to bring

366
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,445
my Emily back to the church.

367
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,742
Here's hoping it's you.

368
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:28,673
[WILLIAM] Do you
have your request?

369
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:30,606
Go on then.

370
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,912
[WILLIAM]
My nephew's a special boy.

371
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:40,844
Lots of faith.Wants to
be a preacher, like you.

372
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,512
[crowd oohs and awws]

373
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:46,011
[EDWARD]
Ladies and gentlemen!

374
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:52,112
Gentlefolks of Gladbury, welcome
to this very special night.

375
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:56,411
Now feast your eyes on
the amazing, wondrous,

376
00:23:56,411 --> 00:24:01,778
mystical visions bestowed on
generations of Haddingtons.

377
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:08,233
Gladbury': very
own Christmas Candle!

378
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:12,511
[EDWARD]There's a story
that's been passed down

379
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:16,603
for centuries from
father to son.

380
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:24,177
On the first Sunday of Advent,
my great-great-great-grandfather

381
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,410
was awakened by a
wondrous light.

382
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,638
[WILLIAM] Poor boy's
parents died a few years back.

383
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:32,402
We all have our stories.

384
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:35,010
[WILLIAM] Everyone
here is holding out

385
00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:37,143
for the Christmas Candle.

386
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,810
[crowd oohs and awws]

387
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,610
And where's your request?

388
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,476
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

389
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:45,568
I'd much rather Charlie
receive the Candle.

390
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,642
[WILLIAM]
Will you be joining us?

391
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:56,666
[DAVID] Not tonight. I believe
I have a sermon to prepare.

392
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:01,310
[EDWARD] And so he gave the
first Christmas Candle to orphan

393
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,642
children with Gladbury':
most beloved instruction:

394
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,609
light this and pray.

395
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,409
[ELEANOR] â™ª Hid in every
heart is an answered prayer. â™ª

396
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,569
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

397
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,842
Yes, yes, I know the song.

398
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:22,502
But we won't
be singing it today.

399
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:26,342
It's the first Sunday in Advent,
we sing it every year.

400
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,103
But it's tradition.

401
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,608
Well, we'll just make
some new traditions, eh?

402
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:36,972
We're just grateful we've
got a reverend in the pulpit.

403
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:39,608
Well, I hope you
won't refuse my lady's

404
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:42,597
other favorite
Christmas tradition.

405
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:50,239
Gladbury': very own
Christmas Chasuble.

406
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:12,162
Welcome.

407
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:17,007
The first candle of Advent
is the candle of hope.

408
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:18,939
But hope in what?

409
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:22,607
An answered prayer? A miracle?

410
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:24,607
A Christmas Candle?

411
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,672
I'm told that tonight
marks the return

412
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:29,173
of this remarkable tradition.

413
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:31,571
Isn't that right Mr. Haddington?

414
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,639
Yes, it is.

415
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,573
[DAVID] And I'm sure
that you know this,

416
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:43,472
But for my benefit, who here has
put in a request for the candle?

417
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,138
[DAVID]Well,
surely not everyone

418
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,172
can receive the
Christmas Candle.

419
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,106
And yet we all have needs.

420
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:54,231
So what hope do we have?

421
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:57,805
Will we abandon our faith?

422
00:26:57,806 --> 00:26:59,931
Fall into despair?

423
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:04,139
Hm'! I hope not.

424
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:07,128
And I dare say
that we will not!

425
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:11,838
We light this candle to remind
us that our hope does not

426
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,931
come from earthly things,
but from above.

427
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:21,305
From the God who came to us
one starry night in Bethlehem,

428
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:23,772
and promises to
come again one day.

429
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:26,805
And that,
good people of Gladbury,

430
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:28,771
is miracle enough.

431
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:31,135
[93335]

432
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,271
God bless you.

433
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,931
[EDWARD]
Ignore him, dear.

434
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:44,266
Ah, Mr. Barstow. And if
it isn't the future reverend.

435
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:48,137
I understand that we'll be
hearing your sermons one day.

436
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:50,126
Do you have a
favorite scripture?

437
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,664
Uh--

438
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,402
Go on, don't be shy.

439
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,270
[WILLIAM] Charlie reads
his Bible every day.

440
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:05,634
[EMILY]
Charlie!

441
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,403
Poor boy would do
anything for that candle.

442
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:15,903
[WILLIAM] Hasn't
been able to say a

443
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,893
word since his parents died.

444
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,636
[chaotic chatter]

445
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,069
[WOMAN]
Mrs. Haddington!

446
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,831
[MAN]
Take my request!

447
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:49,002
[MAN]
Has he been yet, sir?

448
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:51,268
What are we going to do?

449
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,569
Wish the candle came
with a name attached.

450
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:55,235
What if we already know?

451
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,602
What?

452
00:28:56,602 --> 00:29:00,466
The candle.What if we
already know who should get it?

453
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,430
But we can't!

454
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,602
It's going to take
a miracle, Bea.

455
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:06,968
I mean,Thomas has
been gone for ten years!

456
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:09,763
He's not going to
come home on his own.

457
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:14,001
Keeping the Christmas Candle
for ourselves is so selfish!

458
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,468
Is it?

459
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:17,468
I mean, think of the people.
For two hundred years,

460
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:21,094
our family has been
alight to Gladbury.

461
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,267
Does the flame go out with us?

462
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,765
Keep the Christmas Candle?

463
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,392
For the good of Gladbury.

464
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:37,923
<i>â™ª</i>

465
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:21,165
Edward!

466
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:27,755
[dramatic ethereal music]

467
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:19,487
[blast]

468
00:31:23,564 --> 00:31:25,630
Well don't look at me!
Get the candle!

469
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:28,597
[EDWARD]
Oh yes, yes of course!

470
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:30,957
[Edward trips]
[Bea cries out]

471
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:35,130
[BEA]
Why, Edward!

472
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,797
[EDWARD]
I couldn't see!

473
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,787
It must be here somewhere.

474
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,263
It must be.

475
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:42,730
Must be here.
Where is it?

476
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:45,725
Where is it?
Oh Edward!

477
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,919
Where is it?

478
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:49,893
Oh!

479
00:31:52,297 --> 00:31:55,922
I've lost the Christmas Candle.

480
00:31:56,963 --> 00:31:59,495
Oh surely this is
God punishing us.

481
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:01,163
[BEA] Oh don't talk
like that, Edward.

482
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:06,460
I was--I was foolish to
think that candle was ours.

483
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:26,657
Is it all clear?

484
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:30,058
[BEA]
Seems to be.

485
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:35,427
[BEA] Edward!
The reverend is here!

486
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:37,492
Hide the candles!

487
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:41,328
[DAVID] Mr. Haddington.
Mrs. Haddington.

488
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:43,123
[BEA] What a
pleasant surprise.

489
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,625
[DAVID] I imagine your
night was eventful.

490
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:49,485
So is it here?

491
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:54,727
The Christmas Candle?

492
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:56,161
Yes, yes it's here somewhere.

493
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,162
Bea, Bea.

494
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:58,594
Of course you're not
going to show it to me,

495
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,458
but that's not why I came.

496
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:04,393
The people's requests
for the candle...

497
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:06,417
...may I see them?

498
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:15,895
[BEA] What do you suppose he
intends to do with them'!

499
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:19,088
[EDWARD]
I don't know. Pray'!

500
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:21,589
That's what we should be doing.

501
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:24,093
We've got to
make it better, Bea.

502
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:25,992
Yes, but how?

503
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:30,053
[DAVID]
All done. Thank you.

504
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:33,660
You may have one candle
to give, but I hope to

505
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,649
give everyone a little
light this Christmas.

506
00:33:36,794 --> 00:33:37,760
That's it!

507
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,626
What?

508
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:41,787
I mean... that's a lovely idea.

509
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:43,727
Well, you mustn't delay.

510
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:46,426
So much to be done
before Christmas.

511
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:47,393
Good day to you.

512
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:49,393
[BEA] Yes, yes, God speed
to you on your quest.

513
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,154
What's got into you?

514
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:59,086
We give them away. All of them.

515
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:01,459
And have the
entire village think

516
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,892
they've got the actual
Christmas Candle?

517
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:05,126
We won't tell them that.

518
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,625
We'll tell them what
this family has told

519
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,456
them for generations:
to light it and pray.

520
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:12,993
But this is Gladbury.
People talk.

521
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:16,592
Edward, somebody':
miracle is in this basket.

522
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:19,490
And we won't let it go to waste!

523
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:24,124
[WILLIAM] Charlie,
the reverend has offered

524
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,284
to give you Bible lessons.

525
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,125
[William coughs]

526
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,818
[DAVID]
Hello, Charlie.

527
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,818
Why don't we start with the
Gospel of John chapter one.

528
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:47,091
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

529
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,758
and the Word was God.

530
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:52,491
The same was in
the beginning with God.

531
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,624
All things were made by him;

532
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:59,091
and without him was not any
thing made that was made.

533
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:03,723
In him was life; and the
life was the light of men.

534
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:06,124
And the light
shineth in darkness;

535
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,920
and the darkness
comprehend it not."

536
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:19,723
"And the impediment
to his tongue was loosed,

537
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:22,451
and he spoke plainly."

538
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:28,914
Now Charlie, we are going
to loose that tongue of yours.

539
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,450
Open wide.

540
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:34,986
<i>And...</i>

541
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:41,146
[DAVID]
Very good.

542
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:43,116
<i>And...</i>

543
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:48,288
Louder.

544
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:52,586
[nonsensical sounds]

545
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,752
Louder.

546
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:24,547
[knock at window]

547
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,421
Light this and pray, Charlie.

548
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:35,115
Even if it's only in your heart.

549
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:37,150
God will hear you.

550
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,253
[DAVID]
Good morning, Mr. Finch.

551
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,087
What brings you to our home?

552
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:05,087
[DAVID] I understand you
have requested the candle.

553
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:07,985
I wondered if
I might be of service.

554
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:12,986
Reverend, meet my family.

555
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:14,554
My wife, Delilah.

556
00:37:14,554 --> 00:37:15,453
Hello.

557
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:16,454
[PHINEAS]
Children.

558
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:18,120
This is my father, Oliver.

559
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,211
[OLIVER]
The new reverend!

560
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,549
[PHINEAS]
Over here, Dad.

561
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:24,384
Come on.

562
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:26,285
Don't suppose you
could help the old man

563
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,386
get his hands on the
Christmas Candle?

564
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:30,252
Maybe put in a word
to the Haddingtons.

565
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:31,453
[OLIVER]
Hogwash.

566
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,986
The next time I see,
I hope to be

567
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,252
looking at the Good
Lord himself.

568
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:42,152
In the meantime, I'll walk
by faith, right Reverend?

569
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,142
Right.

570
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:49,453
Oh thank you.Thank you so much!

571
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:52,044
It'll be a happy
Christmas after all!

572
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:57,384
Remember, children,
this is our little secret.

573
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:23,085
Reverend Richmond! Do come in.

574
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:26,318
I've been praying for
company, Reverend.

575
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:29,283
[DAVID] Why waste a prayer
when I can meet the need?

576
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:33,910
So you'll find me a
knitting companion?

577
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:39,539
<i>I... shall.</i>

578
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:46,708
[KIDS]
Coming!

579
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,484
Don't waste a candle
on an old man like me.

580
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:54,575
Oliver, there's no such
thing as a wasted prayer.

581
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,416
[MRS. BICKERTON] My stove
doesn't work, and my husband

582
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:04,247
ran off and left me all on my
own with a colicky baby.

583
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,316
Oh, and then yesterday
the wall fell down,

584
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:10,716
and my goat left me, too.

585
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:14,479
I shall keep an eye out...
for both of them.

586
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:21,944
The Reverend fixing our roof.

587
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:25,049
We so desperately need it.

588
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,783
Speaking of which, Agnes, my
dumpling, hadn't you a request?

589
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,874
[DAVID] Ah, yes,
Miss Agnes Chumley.

590
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,708
But I see it is
an unspoken request.

591
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:38,882
Well, go on.

592
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:41,644
A silent request
is no request at all.

593
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,749
I'm praying for a husband.

594
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,873
By Easter.

595
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:04,648
Mrs. Haddington.

596
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:05,748
What brings you here?

597
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:06,914
[BEA] I've come to
let you know that

598
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:08,781
your request has been heard.

599
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,805
Oh what a dear,
but I couldn't accept.

600
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:15,573
That handsome young
reverend has been helping me.

601
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,407
[BEA]
I see.

602
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:37,305
[BEA] Agnes, dear,
light this and pray.

603
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,071
Mother!

604
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:46,376
It's the devil's work!

605
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,213
[WIDOW LEONARD]
You tell her, Reverend.

606
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:51,613
It's unnatural.

607
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:52,879
What'!

608
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,710
Ungodly.

609
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:57,135
Yes.

610
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:01,080
[DAVID] And the light
shineth in Gladbury,

611
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,913
and yet the people
comprehend it not.

612
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:03,746
[Emily laughs]

613
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:06,579
[EMILY] Make fun all you want,
you've decided to stay here.

614
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,807
Just long enough
to do some good.

615
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,472
I have a letter
to post for London.

616
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:16,779
Ruth Goodchild.
To a lady no less.

617
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,946
[DAVID]
Yes, she's a guest of the

618
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:20,478
Salvation Army in a
difficult situation.

619
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,468
She's just a girl really.

620
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:26,811
Stockings. Sweets.

621
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,446
May I help you?

622
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:36,639
I'm looking for, well, uh,
a lot of things actually.

624
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:40,878
Thank you.

627
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:47,079
It's alphabetical.

628
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,244
I see.

629
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:50,445
[DAVID] Well, to do much,
one must be organized.

630
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:53,611
You really do want to
help these people, don't you'!

631
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,407
Of course I do.

632
00:41:56,478 --> 00:42:00,739
[church organ]

633
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:03,877
[DAVID]
Welcome everyone.

634
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:08,144
We light the second candle
of Advent in the love of God.

635
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:10,477
During Advent,
God pierces the darkness

636
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:13,637
of the world with
divine light and love.

637
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:20,637
Because he loved us, he sent
his son to light the way.

638
00:42:21,778 --> 00:42:24,539
Though we must wait
for Christmas day,

639
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:29,644
we must not wait to love
one another as Christ did.

640
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:32,973
Does your neighbor need
a miracle this Christmas?

641
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:36,876
Well why not be that miracle?

642
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:38,309

Reverend!

644
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,810
Hello Mr. Collins.

645
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,409
Thought maybe
you could use a hand.

646
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,138
You know, "be the miracle."

have to say that. Come on.

I'm so sorry.

Feels... it feels
a lot like seeing!

See Reverend, you
are a miracle worker.

[DAVID]
Hello.

667
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,707
That's a lot of food, Reverend.

668
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,036
Well, you have a
lot of mouths to feed.

Why not?

675
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:01,271
[WIDOW LEONARD]
I know we fast during Advent

676
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:03,605
and save the feasting
for Christmas day,

677
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:08,766
but having company,
that's like Christmas to me.

678

the candle of joy.

688
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:52,302
When Christ was born,
God used angels to proclaim

689
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:54,634
"good tidings of great joy."

690
00:46:54,635 --> 00:46:57,068
To all mankind.

Now, we are the messengers
of this good news.

For with every good deed,
every act of kindness,

693
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:09,096
Christ is born again
and again in our lives.

Now let us go forth,
as joyful messengers,

695

doing the work of God.

00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:23,901
Your work in this town is
impressive, Reverend Richmond.

00:47:29,402 --> 00:47:30,390
Mrs. Chumley.

701
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:32,466
Miss Chumley.

702
00:47:32,968 --> 00:47:36,593
How lovely to see
a sister in the Lord.

703
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:38,967
Well go on my dear,
what have you to say?

704
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:41,467
I've already made my wishes
known to the Reverend.

705
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:44,025
And now I'm taking
a step of faith.

706
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:46,928
Thank you.

707
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,866
[DAVID] Another prayer that
will never be answered.

708
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:56,766
Well, I for one am
happy to see that

709
00:47:56,767 --> 00:47:58,434
In spite of all your efforts,

710
00:47:58,434 --> 00:48:02,593
you are still inspiring
hope for a miracle.

711
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:15,199
Come in.

712
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,299
[DAVID]
Mrs. Hopewell.

713
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,532
A friend of mine may be
coming to Gladbury for a while.

714
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:22,299
I wondered if she might
stay with you and Herbert.

715
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,732
[ELEANOR] She can stay
as long as she likes.

716
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:25,265
[DAVID] Thank you!
Her name's Ruth.

717
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,698
My colleague Abner
will bring her from London.

718
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:30,193
Oh, please, allow me.

719
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,932
[ELEANOR]
This is no job for a reverend.

720
00:48:31,932 --> 00:48:32,898
[DAVID]
Nonsense.

721
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:34,865
[ELEANOR]
This is no job for a lady.

722
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:38,929
Mrs. Hopewell.
Whatever is the matter?

723
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:41,099
No, I won't do it.

724
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,431
[DOCTOR] Herbert, you're one
good shock away from the grave.

725
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:46,065
I'll get plenty of
rest in Heaven.

726
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:47,032
Herbert.

727
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:48,766
[DOCTOR] Which
may not be that far off.

728
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:50,532
You've got a weak heart.

729
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,465
I have a strong faith.

730
00:48:52,465 --> 00:48:55,298
God will either cure me,
or He'll call me home.

731
00:48:55,298 --> 00:48:57,564
[ELEANOR] Of course
he will, but you have to rest.

732
00:48:57,565 --> 00:48:59,197
[DOCTOR] No more
carrying heavy boxes,

733
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:00,964
climbing ladders,
or chopping wood.

734
00:49:00,965 --> 00:49:01,965
Do you hear me?

735
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:04,090
But that's my job!

736
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,798
I will chop the wood.

737
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:08,798
No. No m'lady, I won't have it.

738
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:11,064
Please. Pray for him, Reverend.

739
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:12,758
[DAVID]
Certainly.

740
00:49:13,698 --> 00:49:17,131
Our Father in Heaven, please
grant your servant Herbert with

741
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:18,598
the good sense to follow the

742
00:49:18,598 --> 00:49:22,121
doctor's orders and
get some rest.

743
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,063
[DAVID] I've had
enough of Herbert

744
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:29,397
hauling crates of candles.

745
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:32,464
Besides, it's high time
that Gladbury see the light.

746
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:36,263
[EMILY] Electricity...
In the church.

747
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,630
For too long the church has
stumbled about in the dark ages,

748
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,863
when it should
be lighting the way.

749
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:42,364
In fact, I believe that
the church should

750
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:45,386
be the first place to
embrace the future.

751
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:48,930
Indeed. Now this I have to see.

752
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,030
[DAVID] Miss Barstow,
does this mean that you'll

753
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,031
finally be coming to church?

754
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,196
[Emily laughs]

755
00:49:55,196 --> 00:49:57,355
Twenty-nine prayers.

756
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,263
And only one can be answered.

757
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:04,263
You mean thirty, dear.
Thirty candles.

758
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:05,895
No, I'm certain
there were twenty-nine.

759
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:07,862
[EDWARD] Bea, there were
thirty candles hanging

760
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,596
the night of the angel's visit.

761
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:11,960
There're always thirty candles.

762
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:15,529
Twenty-nine!

763
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,428
Bea, a candle is--

764
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:20,929
Don't say it Edward,
please don't say it out loud.

765
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:24,089
We've lost the candle.

766
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:28,892
[hammering and voices]

767
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:37,861
I'm curious to know the maximum
number you've ever installed.

768
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:39,260
[ELECTRICIAN]
About twenty.

769
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:41,289
[DAVID]
Then I want thirty.

770
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:43,955
No, thirty-five bulbs.

771
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:46,362
I question the safety of it.

772
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,594
The circuit can only support
so many watts, Reverend.

773
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,461
[DAVID] Then install another
circuit. Install five circuits.

774
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:53,294
I want the light in
this church to surpass

775
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:56,460
the brightness of one
thousand candles.

776
00:50:56,461 --> 00:50:58,794
[HERBERT] Reverend Richmond,
could you tell me why

777
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:01,960
there are men digging
in the church yard,

778
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:04,553
and fiddling in
our sanctuary walls.

779
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:08,294
You leave that. My grandfather
carved that altar.

780
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:13,783
[DAVID] Herbert! I ordered them
here to install electricity.

781
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:16,093
Electricity?

782
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:18,227
Electricity is the future.

783
00:51:18,228 --> 00:51:19,627
And a more
practical one at that.

784
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:20,727
Practical you say'!

785
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:24,227
How will our treasury
stand this extravagance?

786
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,760
Don't trouble yourself,
Mr. Hopewell.

787
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:29,057
I've covered the
cost personally.

788
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:30,960
Consider it my contribution to a

789
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:33,694
brighter chapter of
Gladbury': history.

790
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,959
I plan to unveil the electricity
at the coming nativity service.

791
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,449
Herbert, your heart.

792
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:40,393
Sit down, love.

793
00:51:40,394 --> 00:51:41,726
Aye.

794
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:44,259
[DAVID] Please, think of
this with an open mind.

795
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,859
Think of Herbert. No cumbersome
candles or lanterns to change.

796
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,559
You of all people should
see the value in that.

797
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,458
[ELEANOR]
You could use a lighter load.

798
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:57,059
L...What'll I do with all
the Haddington candles?

799
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,459
Well, <i>I...</i> I imagine that
we can return them.

800
00:52:00,459 --> 00:52:03,516
In fact, that's the
task that I'll gladly take on.

801
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:06,750
[BEA] Oh, it's got to
be here somewhere.

802
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,224
Edward!

803
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,188
I have a feeling Edward.

804
00:52:15,459 --> 00:52:17,890
I have a feeling
this is the one.

805
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,622
The Christmas Candle.

806
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:24,050
What are you suggesting?

807
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:26,092
I'm not suggesting anything.

808
00:52:26,092 --> 00:52:28,524
I'm... asking.

809
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:30,591
[knock at the door]

810
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:31,785
Mr. Haddington.

811
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:33,224
Reverend.

812
00:52:33,225 --> 00:52:35,059
I regret to inform
you that St. Mark's

813
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:37,251
no longer requires your candles.

814
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,224
But that's a standing order.

815
00:52:39,225 --> 00:52:41,282
It has been for
two hundred years.

816
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,291
It's standing no more,
I'm afraid.

817
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,457
But I just delivered
three crates.

818
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,257
Yes,thank you,
but we only need one.

819
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:50,621
<i>But... but--</i>

820
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:53,849
[DAVID] Trust me when I say,
it's for the good of Gladbury.

821
00:52:54,025 --> 00:52:56,457
[BEA] What does he know
about the good of Gladbury?

822
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:59,219
This is our legacy,
and he's meddling with it.

823
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:02,581
I say we light the candle
right now. We've earned it.

824
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,950
We're going to
give this candle away.

825
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:09,747
To whom'!

826
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,917
[BEA]
Of course.

827
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:23,380
<i>â™ª</i>

828
00:53:27,556 --> 00:53:29,920

God bless you, ma'am.

00:53:44,423 --> 00:53:45,753

These are ready to go.

830
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,623

832
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,956
[BEA] Whatever will
they think of next?

833
00:53:59,956 --> 00:54:01,888
[SECRETARY]
May I help you?

834
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:06,454
Um, we're here to
see Thomas Haddington.

835
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,012
And you are?

836
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:11,682
We're his parents.

837
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,421
We have a gift for our son.

838
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:14,789
[SECRETARY]
Mr. Haddington': away.

839
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:17,277
But I'd be happy to
receive it on his behalf.

840
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:19,684
[EDWARD] Perhaps we
could leave it for him.

841
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:33,415
[EDWARD]You watch,
Bea, he'll come home.

842
00:54:39,055 --> 00:54:45,621
â™ª ...of redeeming grace. â™ª

â™ª Jesus, Lord at thy birth. â™ª

845
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,409
In my short time in Gladbury,
I have seen many miracles.

846
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:16,053
I have seen angels at work.

847
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:20,520
I have seen them on the
rooftops, at kitchen tables,

848
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,213
and in this very sanctuary.

849
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,952
In fact, I see these angels now.

850
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,418
Mr. Hardy Collins.

851
00:55:30,886 --> 00:55:32,579
Dear Ms. Leonard.

852
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:38,186
Herbert Hopewell. And every
single one of you who has

853
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:40,451
allowed the light of
Christ to shine through

854
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:42,885
your good works this
Advent season.

855
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:45,752
From what I've read
of Gladbury': past,

856
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,786
this town has
glowed with a certain

857
00:55:47,786 --> 00:55:50,619
miraculous light
for generations.

858
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:57,040
But today marks the dawning
of a new age in Gladbury.

859
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:18,618
[DAVID] It is my hope that
in centuries to come,

860
00:56:18,618 --> 00:56:23,949
our beloved church will
shine even brighter still.

861
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,408
Ghastly.

862
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:40,616
[WIDOW LEONARD]
It's witchcraft! Witchcraft

863
00:56:40,617 --> 00:56:43,378
in the house of the Lord.

864
00:56:43,684 --> 00:56:46,950

Get the children!

[DAVID]
Remain calm!

874
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:18,942
[OLIVER] My hat!

875
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:35,780
Please, everyone, remain calm!

876
00:57:38,082 --> 00:57:40,843
[HERBERT] No,
my grandfather's altar!

877
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,439
[DAVID]
Herbert!

878
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:54,104
[DAVID]
Herbert!

879
00:57:58,415 --> 00:58:00,745
[DAVID] ls he going
to be alright?

880
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:06,076
[DOCTOR]
He's dead.

881
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:12,571
<i>â™ª</i>

882
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:00,711
[EMILY]
Reverend!

883
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:06,746
Miss Barstow.

884
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:09,235
It's my father.
He's called for you.

885
00:59:21,046 --> 00:59:22,773
[EMILY]
You're alright, Father.

886
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:27,871
Reverend Richmond's arrived.

887
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:31,736
Pray for me, Reverend.

888
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:35,875
What ails you, Mr. Barstow?

889
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:39,434
Dr. Clem': diagnosed
Father with consumption.

890
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:45,777
[EMILY] Said he's
done all he can do.

891
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:48,074
[WILLIAM]
God'll do the rest.

892
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:50,378
Right, Reverend?

893
00:59:56,112 --> 01:00:00,601
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

894
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:08,606
[EMILY] Do you have anything
to say for yourself'!

895
01:00:08,945 --> 01:00:11,910
I'm sorry, but I can't give your
father what he's asking for.

896
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:12,844
All he wants is--

897
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:14,511
I know what he wants.

898
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:15,910
[EMILY]
Then give it to him.

899
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,210
You're a minister;
he's a dying man.

900
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:19,944
You can't give him
a simple prayer?

901
01:00:19,944 --> 01:00:22,342
Look, if it's so simple,
then why don't you do it?

902
01:00:26,344 --> 01:00:28,866
I don't believe in miracles.

903
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:32,708
The fourth candle of Advent,
our last before Christmas Eve,

904
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:37,936
represents the peace of God,
who passes all understanding.

905
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:41,173
In the coming days of Christmas,

906
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:44,207
let us be instruments
of this peace,

907
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,875
Shining light where
there is darkness,

908
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:50,040
hope where there is despair,

909
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:54,030
sowing joy where
there is sadness...

910
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,239
...and faith where
there is doubt.

911
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:19,573
You asked me
to fill your pulpit,

912
01:02:19,574 --> 01:02:22,040
and instead
I emptied your church.

913
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,666
You mustn't take all the credit.

914
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,235
I did ask you to come.

915
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:31,563
I am a man of faith,
Lady Camdon.

916
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:34,939
I believe God worked
in the appointed time.

917
01:02:35,673 --> 01:02:39,873
But in our modern age,
the lame don't walk,

918
01:02:39,873 --> 01:02:44,205
blind men do not see,
and the sick die.

919
01:02:44,206 --> 01:02:46,729
But sometimes they live.

920
01:02:48,606 --> 01:02:50,765
Walk with me, Reverend.

921
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:55,871
[LADY CAMDON]
Twenty-five years ago,

922
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:59,272
our town suffered
great hardship.

923
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:00,605
That's when the Haddingtons gave

924
01:03:00,606 --> 01:03:02,938
The candle to
Reverend Pillington.

925
01:03:02,939 --> 01:03:05,598
But when he lit
the candle to pray...

926
01:03:06,538 --> 01:03:09,663
...well, he nearly burned
the vestry to the ground.

927
01:03:10,072 --> 01:03:12,671
The poor dear was in despair,

928
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:16,005
and then, within
the church walls,

929
01:03:16,006 --> 01:03:18,171
a treasure was discovered,

930
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:21,399
several gold crosses
and a ruby brooch.

931
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:23,696
A hidden treasure?

932
01:03:23,872 --> 01:03:26,571
Well, had it not
been for the fire,

933
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,505
it would've remained hidden.

934
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:31,238
And thankfully, there was just
enough to repair the church

935
01:03:31,238 --> 01:03:33,004
And to provide for Gladbury's

936
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:35,596
impoverished
families that winter.

937
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:39,570
The very first
Christmas Candle

938
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:42,765
went to my
great-great-great-grandmother.

939
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:49,069
Once she was a
hopeless orphan, and then...

940
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:58,770
Miracles are part of
our inheritance, Reverend.

941
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:00,827
Tell that to Mrs. Hopewell.

942
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,403
I believe you'll find
Mrs. Hopewell': faith to be much

943
01:04:04,404 --> 01:04:07,665
stronger than the grief
she's feeling now.

944
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,770
Your doubts don't
trouble me, Reverend.

945
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:17,702
On the contrary,
they inspire my faith.

946
01:04:46,003 --> 01:04:47,935
[honk]

947
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:08,901
[BEA] Edward,
have a look at this!

948
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:12,901
It's a carriage
that pulls itself!

949
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:14,890
In all my days...

950
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:23,492
Bea! It's Thomas!

951
01:05:24,002 --> 01:05:25,234
It's Thomas.

952
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:27,200
[THOMAS]
Father. Mother.

953
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:35,830
Oh, look at you,
handsome and fancy!

954
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:37,767
That carriage of yours!

955
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:41,100
It's called a Stanley Steamer,
one of the first of its kind.

956
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,363
I had it shipped from America.

957
01:05:43,534 --> 01:05:44,933
[EDWARD] Shall I help you
bring in your luggage?

958
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:46,267
[THOMAS] Oh,
I'm not staying, Father.

959
01:05:46,267 --> 01:05:48,858
Oh, not staying, don't be silly.

960
01:05:49,267 --> 01:05:50,666
I'm married, Mother.

961
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,758
I'm on the way to
meet her family now.

962
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,431
Getting married.

963
01:05:56,834 --> 01:06:00,200
Name's Priscilla.
She's the daughter of a baron.

964
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,996
Oh! And, are you happy?

965
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,888
I'm finally making a name
for myself, for the family.

966
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,999
Business is expanding,

967
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,057
and one day I'll
introduce you to Priscilla.

968
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:21,196
Why did you come?

969
01:06:31,399 --> 01:06:35,699
I know how much this candle
means to you, to Gladbury,

970
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:38,028
but it's lost on me.

971
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:43,831
You must light it and pray,
and then you'll see.

972
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:45,098
See what, Mother?

973
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:46,599
A miracle?

974
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:48,432
Gladbury needs you, son.

975
01:06:48,432 --> 01:06:50,198
The world needs me.

976
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:54,188
I'm lighting up entire cities.

977
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:03,032
It was good to see you.

978
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,691
Both of you.

979
01:07:06,198 --> 01:07:08,255
[THOMAS]
Merry Christmas.

980
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:12,027
Thomas, the miracles, the angel,
you saw it with your own eyes.

981
01:07:12,365 --> 01:07:16,922
I was a child. I saw
what I wanted to see.

982
01:07:17,398 --> 01:07:18,997
Goodbye.

983
01:07:18,998 --> 01:07:20,759
[BEA]
Thomas.

984
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:18,685
Reverend.

985
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:21,594
I would like to see your father.

986
01:08:35,162 --> 01:08:37,821
[William coughing]

987
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:42,726
[EMILY]
Father. Father.

988
01:08:53,728 --> 01:08:57,422
[DAVID]
Mr. Barstow, if I may.

989
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:08,861
[DAVID] And it came to
pass that a certain

990
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:12,027
blind man sat by the
wayside begging,

991
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:17,187
He cried, "Jesus, thou Son of
David, have mercy on me."

992
01:09:17,394 --> 01:09:19,327
And Jesus said unto him,

993
01:09:19,327 --> 01:09:22,260
"What wilt though that
I should do unto thee?"

994
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,593
The blind man said unto him,

995
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,826
"Lord, that I might
receive my sight."

996
01:09:27,827 --> 01:09:33,993
And Jesus said, "Go thy way;
thy faith has made thee whole."

997
01:09:33,994 --> 01:09:36,693
And immediately
he received his sight

998
01:09:36,693 --> 01:09:39,591
and followed Jesus in the way.

999
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,593
Did I not say to you
that if you would believe,

1000
01:09:42,593 --> 01:09:44,426
You would see the glory of God.

1001
01:09:44,426 --> 01:09:45,592
And they took away
the stone from the

1002
01:09:45,593 --> 01:09:47,526
place where the
dead man was lying,

1003
01:09:47,526 --> 01:09:50,025
and Jesus lifted up
his eyes and said,

1004
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:52,159
"Father, I thank you
that you have heard..."

1005
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,192
And these are written
that you might believe

1006
01:09:54,193 --> 01:09:57,092
that Jesus is the
Christ, the son of God,

1007
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:59,426
and that in believing,
you might have life.

1008
01:09:59,426 --> 01:10:01,858
Behold there came a leper
and worshipped him,

1009
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:05,725
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean."

1010
01:10:05,726 --> 01:10:07,026
And Jesus put forth his hand...

1011
01:10:07,026 --> 01:10:09,159
My little daughter is
at the point of death.

1012
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:12,025
I pray thee, Lord,
come and lay hands on her,

1013
01:10:12,026 --> 01:10:13,692
that she might be healed.

1014
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:17,556
If I may but touch his
garment, I shall be whole.

1015
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:20,258
If thou canst believe, all
things are possible to him...

1016
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,157
The father of
the child cried out,

1017
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:26,857
"Lord, I believe,
help my unbelief!"

1018
01:10:26,858 --> 01:10:31,091
And he said to her,
"Damsel, arise."

1019
01:10:31,092 --> 01:10:34,158
And they were astonished,
a great astonishment.

1020
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,920
Speak the word,
and my servant shall be here.

1021
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:40,091
<i>â™ª</i>

1022
01:10:40,092 --> 01:10:45,888
And Jesus said unto them,
"Thy faith has made you whole."

1023
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:52,847
<i>â™ª</i>

1024
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:14,248
David. David.

1025
01:11:17,991 --> 01:11:20,014
He's asleep.

1026
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,523
[DAVID] My wife and daughter
died of consumption.

1027
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:46,483
I prayed. I even
believed for a miracle.

1028
01:11:53,356 --> 01:11:55,515
[DAVID]
But God did nothing.

1029
01:11:58,055 --> 01:11:59,749
Oh, David.

1030
01:12:02,922 --> 01:12:08,150
[DAVID] One day my faith was so
certain, and then it was gone.

1031
01:12:10,356 --> 01:12:13,583
There was a time
when I could not...

1032
01:12:14,922 --> 01:12:19,752
...utter a prayer or step
foot in a church.

1033
01:12:23,855 --> 01:12:27,412
I believe I've made
my peace with God.

1034
01:12:30,088 --> 01:12:33,054
But still I was a
different man before.

1035
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:40,548
The love I shared,
the hope I had...

1036
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:47,410
Some things,
they cannot be restored.

1037
01:12:49,188 --> 01:12:51,415
I do hope you're wrong.

1038
01:12:55,487 --> 01:12:58,510
Such a hope is too great a risk.

1039
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,077
But I wonder what you
risk living without it.

1040
01:13:18,886 --> 01:13:20,511
[DAVID] [weakly]
I should go.

1041
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:39,050
[Emily sobs]

1042
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,216
Bea.

1043
01:14:44,217 --> 01:14:47,550
He won't light it.
I'll light it for him.

1044
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:49,141
It's of no use.

1045
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,649
Anyway, we don't even
know if it's the right one.

1046
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,550
Well then we'll find out.

1047
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:55,850
We did everything we knew to do.

1048
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,475
We gave away every last candle,
and this one came back.

1049
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,306
Twice.

1050
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:10,082
This could be
our miracle, Edward.

1051
01:15:19,316 --> 01:15:21,715
I hope I'm not overstepping
my boundaries,

1052
01:15:21,716 --> 01:15:25,479
but I know just the person to
give the candle to this year.

1053
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,208
David Richmond.

1054
01:15:29,515 --> 01:15:31,708
Think of it, Edward.

1055
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:35,149
Your father gave the candle
to Reverend Pillington.

1056
01:15:35,149 --> 01:15:38,048
And as we know, David is a far
greater wretch than he ever was.

1057
01:15:38,049 --> 01:15:40,381
[BEA] You make a compelling
argument, but I don't--

1058
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:42,814
Don't tell me you've
given the candle away.

1059
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:50,038
This is the candle,
isn't it'! Splendid.

1060
01:15:50,215 --> 01:15:52,215
Then we're in agreement?

1061
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,348
[BEA] Lady Camdon,
I don't think--

1062
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:59,315
[EDWARD]Yes, we'll give
the candle to David.

1063
01:15:59,315 --> 01:16:00,678
Good.

1064
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:06,408
[LADY CAMDON] Lord knows,
he could use a little light.

1065
01:16:09,748 --> 01:16:13,078
But he doesn't
even believe in the candle.

1066
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:19,537
Edward.

1067
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:27,243
Edward, please!

1068
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,880
Mr. Haddington.

1069
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,903
May I have a word'!

1070
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,309
The Christmas Candle.

1071
01:16:49,413 --> 01:16:51,813
You're giving the candle to me?

1072
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:55,802
[EDWARD]Well, you
weren't the first choice.

1073
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,509
What am I to do with it.

1074
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,668
Just light it and...
just light it.

1075
01:17:08,913 --> 01:17:13,368
Just do something
good for Gladbury.

1076
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:42,306
[DAVID]
Emily.

1077
01:17:51,311 --> 01:17:52,834
[DAVID]
In church.

1078
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:55,235
And on your own accord.

1079
01:17:55,411 --> 01:17:57,172
It's true.

1080
01:17:58,378 --> 01:18:01,344
Am I to think that
you've come to believe?

1081
01:18:01,712 --> 01:18:03,507
I don't know.

1082
01:18:04,044 --> 01:18:05,839
I want to.

1083
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:09,210
In times like this,
it would be comforting.

1084
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:11,336
Don't think less of me.

1085
01:18:13,677 --> 01:18:15,404
I have a problem.

1086
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:20,177
Cousin Charlie was given
this blasted Christmas Candle,

1087
01:18:20,177 --> 01:18:24,701
and the poor boy
has given it to me.

1088
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:28,477
Who could refuse
a gift like that?

1089
01:18:28,477 --> 01:18:30,477
Now all I can do is pray.

1090
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:33,909
I feel as though
I owe it to him.

1091
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:40,009
That is a problem.

1092
01:18:40,977 --> 01:18:41,810
[banging on door]

1093
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,742
[EDWARD]
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

1094
01:18:47,043 --> 01:18:49,176
Reverend Richmond, Miss Barstow.

1095
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:51,043
[DAVID]
Mr. Haddington, a word.

1096
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:52,242
Reverend!

1097
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:54,299
Miss Barstow!

1098
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:55,576
Is there a problem?

1099
01:18:55,576 --> 01:18:58,475
[DAVID] On the contrary.
A great and wondrous miracle

1100
01:18:58,476 --> 01:19:00,567
has taken place this
Christmas season.

1101
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:05,242
It seems that the angel
has blessed not one,

1102
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:08,242
but two Christmas
Candles this year.

1103
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:11,508
And now that I think of it,
how small is my faith,

1104
01:19:11,509 --> 01:19:14,242
to think that this angel
might stop at two.

1105
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:16,174
Why not three or four?

1106
01:19:16,343 --> 01:19:18,209
Or maybe there are no
limits to the blessings

1107
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:20,408
the Good Lord might
bestow upon Gladbury.

1108
01:19:20,408 --> 01:19:21,674
[BEA]
Well, we can explain.

1109
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:23,008
Edward tripped, and then--

1110
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,009
you came around.

1111
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:24,908
There was an accident.

1112
01:19:24,909 --> 01:19:26,541
Yes, we'd lost the candle.

1113
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:28,074
So I said, "Why don't we
give all the candles?"

1114
01:19:28,075 --> 01:19:28,909
Bea.

1115
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:29,708
And Edward said--

1116
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:30,975
We meant no harm.

1117
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:32,669
But you've given us false hope.

1118
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:35,136
Surely you can see that.

1119
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:41,369
How could you?

1120
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:44,874
How could you question my
intentions for the people of

1121
01:19:44,874 --> 01:19:48,307
Gladbury when you, yourselves
so blatantly misled them?

1122
01:19:48,308 --> 01:19:50,674
I fear this Christmas will end
in nothing but disappointment,

1123
01:19:50,674 --> 01:19:52,807
And you and your fairy
tales are to blame.

1124
01:19:52,808 --> 01:19:54,001
[Bea gasps]

1125
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:59,970
Perhaps it was providence
that kept me in Gladbury.

1126
01:20:02,307 --> 01:20:07,873
<i>â™ª</i>

1127
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:09,873
Well, here we are again.

1128
01:20:09,873 --> 01:20:11,964
[DAVID]
Thank you, Mrs. Hopewell.

1129
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,163
I can never repay you.

1130
01:20:23,974 --> 01:20:27,202
I know what it is
to suffer a great loss.

1131
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:35,169
Allow me, Reverend.

1132
01:20:51,739 --> 01:20:53,399
It's time.

1133
01:20:56,706 --> 01:21:02,006
On Christmas Eve, we light
the final candle of Advent,

1134
01:21:02,006 --> 01:21:07,739
the Christ Candle, for only
in Christ do we find the hope,

1135
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:13,638
love, joy, and peace that we
have come to know this season.

1136
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:18,670
Christmas Eve
holds a special place

1137
01:21:18,671 --> 01:21:21,671
in the heart of every believer,

1138
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:26,831
and nowhere is this more true
than in the town of Gladbury.

1139
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:34,204
Many of you have no
doubt come to rejoice

1140
01:21:34,204 --> 01:21:36,830
in the miracle of the
Christmas Candle.

1141
01:21:38,204 --> 01:21:41,704
But regretfully,
tonight you shall see this

1142
01:21:41,705 --> 01:21:45,864
long-standing tradition
come to an end.

1143
01:21:46,071 --> 01:21:49,162
[gasps]

1144
01:22:09,503 --> 01:22:11,492
Father?

1145
01:22:14,236 --> 01:22:16,836
I would now like to ask
the recipient of the

1146
01:22:16,836 --> 01:22:21,030
Christmas Candle
to please stand.

1147
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:27,298
[murmurs]

1148
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:30,636
[DAVID] Now more than
ever I see the urgent need

1149
01:22:30,636 --> 01:22:33,136
to speak on the virtue
of enduring faith,

1150
01:22:33,136 --> 01:22:34,169
a faith that endures

1151
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,869
disappointment, and
unanswered prayer.

1152
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:40,368
A faith that relies not on
the hollow promises of men,

1153
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:43,062
but on the sovereignty
of Almighty God.

1154
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:45,700
<i>I...</i>

1155
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:49,797
<i>I...</i>

1156
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:51,569
I've got something to say!

1157
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:53,830
[gasps and chatter]

1158
01:23:02,568 --> 01:23:04,035
I can speak!

1159
01:23:04,035 --> 01:23:05,868
[joyful voices]

1160
01:23:05,868 --> 01:23:08,467
I prayed. Every day I prayed,

1161
01:23:08,468 --> 01:23:11,668
And then I woke up this
morning, and I could talk.

1162
01:23:11,668 --> 01:23:14,725
I don't understand it.
I even gave my candle away.

1163
01:23:15,635 --> 01:23:18,067
But my favorite scripture says,

1164
01:23:18,068 --> 01:23:20,835
"With God,
all things are possible."

1165
01:23:20,835 --> 01:23:25,062
Now I'm never going to stop
talking, especially about this!

1166
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:27,892
[applause]

1167
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:32,334
I don't know how this happened,

1168
01:23:32,335 --> 01:23:35,734
but my wife also received
the Christmas Candle.

1169
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:37,067
For my husband.

1170
01:23:37,068 --> 01:23:40,397
As many of you know,
I was stuck on the bottle.

1171
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:43,000
Like never before, I prayed.

1172
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:45,700
And I found I was
drinking less and less.

1173
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:47,792
Which really is a miracle.

1174
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,700
[applause]

1175
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:53,500
I was hopeless.

1176
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,489
I'd lost everything.

1177
01:23:56,967 --> 01:24:00,365
And now, nothing': lost at all.

1178
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:03,532
It's all been found.

1179
01:24:03,533 --> 01:24:05,658
[applause]

1180
01:24:06,566 --> 01:24:09,133
[MR. FINCH] I've been out
of a job for some time now,

1181
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,732
and found myself
in debt up to my ears.

1182
01:24:11,733 --> 01:24:13,166
But then, our landlady--

1183
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,466
[MRS. FINCH] She forgave
us our debts in full.

1184
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:17,199
[MR. FINCH] And if
that wasn't enough,

1185
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,399
well I found work
at the Leonard house.

1186
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:22,332
It makes a man feel good to
provide for his family again.

1187
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:26,166
And my wife, she's found
a good friend in Ms. Leonard.

1188
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:27,399
[MRS. FINCH]
Yes, this dear woman,

1189
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:29,232
she's taught our kids to knit.

1190
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:30,965
[laughs and applause]

1191
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:32,399
[JOE] [on verge of tears]
My name's Joe.

1192
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:34,065
I'm not really a religious man.

1193
01:24:34,066 --> 01:24:38,828
I asked for the candle,
and it's saved my cat.

1194
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:43,226
It may not seem much, but
she means a great deal to me.

1195
01:24:43,865 --> 01:24:46,331
I never thought I'd get
the Christmas Candle,

1196
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,732
but thank God I did.

1197
01:24:47,732 --> 01:24:50,298
[applause]

1198
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:54,064
[PHINEAS]The candle was
for me old man, Oliver Barber.

1199
01:24:54,065 --> 01:24:54,964
[DELILAH]
He was blind.

1200
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:58,954
As you may have heard,
dad died this morning.

1201
01:24:59,699 --> 01:25:02,365
[DELILAH] And just before
he left us, he whispered,

1202
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:03,631
"I can see."

1203
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:08,198
"I can see." His prayer was
answered,just as he'd hoped.

1204
01:25:08,198 --> 01:25:10,720
He saw Jesus.

1205
01:25:15,831 --> 01:25:17,997
When I received the candle,

1206
01:25:17,998 --> 01:25:20,731
I thought my prayer'd
be answered one way,

1207
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:23,330
so I took a step of faith.

1208
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:26,320
Only it was in
the wrong direction.

1209
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:29,797
But then I stumbled into
the arms of Hardy Collins,

1210
01:25:29,798 --> 01:25:32,130
the man of my dreams,

1211
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:34,963
and just this morning,
he asked me to be his wife.

1212
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,331
[excited gasps]

1213
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,297
My answer's yes!

1214
01:25:40,964 --> 01:25:43,830
[EMILY]
I don't know what to say,

1215
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:50,228
except I prayed for
my father, and here he is.

1216
01:25:53,463 --> 01:25:56,729
[WOMAN] I hadn't spoke
to my sister in ten years.

1217
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:59,830
I even stopped coming
to church because of her.

1218
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,529
But we both
received the candle...

1219
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:06,729
So Reverend, have you changed
your mind about Gladbury?

1220
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:10,127
I'm afraid this has only
confirmed my suspicions.

1221
01:26:10,363 --> 01:26:12,658
How can you not believe?

1222
01:26:13,196 --> 01:26:18,562
I believe...
but I do not belong.

1223
01:26:18,562 --> 01:26:20,062

01:26:20,063 --> 01:26:22,392
[applause]

1225
01:26:27,462 --> 01:26:29,223
Quite a night.

1226
01:26:30,028 --> 01:26:32,460
More than I could have imagined.

1227
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:37,186
I know he'll come back, Edward.

1228
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:43,455
Not tonight. Maybe not until
after we've both gone,

1229
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:46,395
but I don't have
to see it to believe

1230
01:26:46,395 --> 01:26:49,554
that our son will
come home again.

1231

[thunder]

1232
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:58,389

me in my unbelief.

â™ª Like a candle': flame, â™ª

â™ª Hope will lead us there. â™ª

[DAVID]
â™ª When the darkness comes, â™ª

1240
01:27:49,993 --> 01:27:52,859
â™ª Let the light shine through, â™ª

1241
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:58,558
â™ª A spark of faith
will ignite in you. â™ª

â™ª In a candle': glow,

â™ª In a simple prayer
in the empty tomb. â™ª

[BOTH] There are
miracles all around. â™ª

01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:42,818
Abner!

1250
01:28:43,158 --> 01:28:45,991
It's Ruth!There's
been an accident,

1251
01:28:45,991 --> 01:28:47,291
The carriage overturned.

1252
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:48,357
We've got to hurry.

1253
01:28:48,358 --> 01:28:50,290
She's about to have the baby.

1254
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,890
[DAVID]Where is she'!
ls she alright?

1255
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:54,291
[ABNER] About a mile away.
She needs a doctor.

1256
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:56,654
[DAVID] We can take
Miss Barstow': cart.

1257
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:58,484
[EMILY] Come on, boy, come on!

1258
01:29:01,624 --> 01:29:03,056
[DAVID]
Come on!

1259
01:29:14,123 --> 01:29:16,356
[DAVID] Abner, are you sure
that this is the way'!

1260
01:29:16,357 --> 01:29:18,380
[ABNER]
Straight on, keep going.

1261
01:29:19,524 --> 01:29:22,490
[DAVID]
Whoa! Whoa!

1262
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,123
[DAVID]
How much further is it?

1263
01:29:32,123 --> 01:29:34,555
[ABNER] Just round the bend,
where the road drops off.

1264
01:29:34,556 --> 01:29:37,222
[EMILY] I'll come with you.
I know these woods.

1265
01:29:37,222 --> 01:29:39,688
[ABNER] I'll be
ready with the horse.

1266
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:57,356
[DAVID] Have we
made a wrong turn?

1267
01:29:57,356 --> 01:30:00,955
[EMILY] I don't think so,
there should be a clearing.

1268
01:30:00,956 --> 01:30:03,320
[DAVID] How will
we ever find her?

1269
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:17,186
[EMILY] That won't do us
any good, not in this.

1270
01:30:19,155 --> 01:30:21,678
[DAVID] It's one of the
Haddington candles.

1271
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:29,610
[EMILY]
I have three left.

1272
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:37,816
[DAVID]
Try again.

1273
01:30:50,854 --> 01:30:56,886
[DAVID]Wait! Please,
God, keep Ruth safe.

1274
01:30:56,887 --> 01:30:59,285
Help us find her.

1275
01:31:02,954 --> 01:31:04,886
[DAVID]
Try again.

1276
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:12,042
Please, God.We need a miracle.

1277
01:31:20,019 --> 01:31:21,849
[EMILY]
What's happening?

1278
01:31:24,986 --> 01:31:27,316
[DAVID]
A miracle is happening.

1279
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:32,377
[DAVID]
Let's go.

1280
01:31:37,485 --> 01:31:39,281
[DAVID]
Let's go.

1281
01:31:53,852 --> 01:31:55,374
[DAVID]
Ruth!

1282
01:31:55,686 --> 01:31:58,686
Ruth! Thank God we found you.

1283
01:31:58,686 --> 01:32:00,447
[RUTH]
Mr. Richmond.

1284
01:32:01,686 --> 01:32:03,651
You're safe now.

1285
01:32:12,618 --> 01:32:14,846
[baby cries]

1286
01:32:16,152 --> 01:32:18,185
[CHARLIE]
Faster, Uncle, faster!

1287
01:32:18,185 --> 01:32:19,684
[DAVID]
Dear Lady Camdon,

1288
01:32:19,685 --> 01:32:20,785
[WILLIAM]
Charlie...

1289
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,951
[DAVID] Every minister aspires
to leave his mark on a parish,

1290
01:32:23,952 --> 01:32:28,518
but truth be told, Gladbury
has left its mark on me.

1291
01:32:28,518 --> 01:32:30,618
In spite of my best efforts,

1292
01:32:30,618 --> 01:32:33,950
I witnessed many miracles
this Advent season.

1293
01:32:33,951 --> 01:32:36,815
None more remarkable than
my own change of heart.

1294
01:32:37,484 --> 01:32:41,649
If you will have me, I will be
honored to remain in Gladbury,

1295
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,350
for many Christmases to come.

1296
01:32:43,351 --> 01:32:44,384
[DAVID] [to couple]
Congratulations.

1297
01:32:44,384 --> 01:32:47,838
[DAVID]Your miracle man,
David Richmond.

1298
01:32:49,051 --> 01:32:52,108
Ah, the Reverend Richmond.

1299
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,216
Happy Christmas.

1300
01:32:54,216 --> 01:32:56,307
Happy Christmas to you.

1301
01:32:57,383 --> 01:32:59,549
I don't quite know what to say,

1302
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:02,016
except for there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

1303
01:33:02,016 --> 01:33:03,845
[ELEANOR]
Let me take that.

1304
01:33:05,849 --> 01:33:08,149
[BEA] But you knew
about this all along?

1305
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,383
I had an inkling, but I didn't
know for sure until

1306
01:33:10,383 --> 01:33:13,315
Ruth confirmed
Thomas was the father.

1307
01:33:23,816 --> 01:33:25,509
Are you ready?

1308
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:30,679
[DAVID] Come,
meet your grandchild.

1309
01:33:31,816 --> 01:33:37,839
Ruth, this is Mr. and Mrs.
Haddington,Thomas' parents.

1310
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:40,172
I hardly know what to say.

1311
01:33:46,548 --> 01:33:48,776
He has your eyes.

1312
01:33:49,381 --> 01:33:51,347
Have you named him?

1313
01:33:51,648 --> 01:33:54,341
I'd like to name
him after my father.

1314
01:33:54,782 --> 01:33:56,873
He looks like an Edward.

1315
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,606
Isn't that a fine name?

1316
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:02,770
May I?

1317
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:14,477
[BEA]
Our grandson.

1318
01:34:20,114 --> 01:34:21,841
Edward.

1319
01:34:36,814 --> 01:34:38,177
[DAVID]
Emily!

1320
01:34:42,947 --> 01:34:44,470
I was hoping, uh...

1321
01:34:47,113 --> 01:34:48,840
Yes;

1322
01:34:50,314 --> 01:34:53,473
I was hoping that we might
spend Christmas together.

1323
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,368
Your first
Christmas in Gladbury.

1324
01:34:58,147 --> 01:34:59,874
And your last.

1325
01:35:01,047 --> 01:35:04,013
Gladbury has a funny
way of keeping people.

1326
01:35:04,513 --> 01:35:08,673
I used to mind it.
I don't anymore.

1327
01:35:22,212 --> 01:35:26,974
Forgive me.The moment
seemed providential.

1328
01:35:35,312 --> 01:35:36,645
[DAVID] Does this mean
I'll be seeing you

1329
01:35:36,645 --> 01:35:38,378
in church from now on?

1330
01:35:38,378 --> 01:35:40,537
[Emily chuckles]
