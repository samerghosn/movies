SHIM Eun-Ha

3
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:29,167
CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST

4
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,603
Attention! At ease!

5
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:07,846
Attention! Bow to the principal!

6
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:20,394
At the start of this new school year,

7
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,230
I hope you all have new resolutions...

8
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:03,377
Dr. Kim to the Outpatients Clinic, please.

9
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,608
When I was a kid...

10
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:31,610
...I always sat alone in the playground

11
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:34,113
after the other boys had gone,

12
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,950
...thinking about my late mother

13
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,985
It struck me that

14
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:41,822
we'd all disappear in the end...

15
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:44,125
...my father, my sister,

16
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:46,060
all my best friends.

17
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,613
Can I help you?

18
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,081
My photos should be ready...

19
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:06,885
- The name is? - Choi Myung-Suk

20
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,688
You took them two days ago.

21
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,190
Here they are.

22
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,210
Sorry... it's not a very good likeness...

23
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,103
Let me just fix your hair a little.

24
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,143
That's much better.

25
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,486
Just a touch higher on this side.

26
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,924
It's all right as it is.

27
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,527
Okay? Then we'll take one.

28
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,664
Look straight at the camera...

29
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,572
One, two...

30
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,285
Hello? Chul-Ku?

31
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,724
Your father has died?

32
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,898
CREMATORIUM

33
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,075
Please try to regain your composure!

34
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,012
He has passed on, but we must carry on!

35
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:02,920
Please help yourselves to some food.

36
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:06,124
This way! Lunch is served.

37
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:45,470
CHOWON PHOTO STUDIO

38
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:57,350
"CLOSED"

39
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:17,607
I've been waiting for ages!

40
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:21,312
Can you print this for me urgently?

41
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,848
How long will it take?

42
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,888
I'm sorry, can you come back later?

43
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,662
No, it's very urgent! I need an

44
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,832
enlargement of the bit I've circled

45
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:11,607
Did I upset you?

46
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:19,850
Sorry, I've had a very hard morning.

47
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:24,822
Is the enlargement ready?

48
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,760
Give me must a few moments more.

49
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,073
Dad, the potatoes are ready.

50
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,374
Put them in the pot.

51
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:16,549
- Jung-won... - What?

52
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:17,751
Bring me the green onions, will you?

53
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:18,952
- The green onions? - Yes!

54
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:49,287
How much do you want, sir?

55
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,022
Fill it up, please.

56
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,123
Right you are, sir.

57
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,863
Welcome!

58
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:03,337
Hi! Good morning!

59
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:05,473
It's full, sir.

60
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,376
- How much? - That'll be $2.

61
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,481
Here you are.

62
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:13,316
Thank you, sir.

63
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,685
How much miss?

64
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:16,720
Fill it up, please.

65
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,895
Mister, isn't she the cutest one?

66
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:26,030
- Who? - Her? She's short and fat!

67
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:28,266
Mine's prettier!

68
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,769
Get real! Look at mine!

69
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:33,105
Boys! Calm down!

70
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,476
Chan-Kun, which is your favorite?

71
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,512
I have several.

72
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:39,713
Really? Which ones?

73
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,149
This one, this one and this one.

74
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,852
- Three? - She's the best one.

75
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,154
This one? -What's her name?

76
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:48,390
Seo Eun-Ji! She's the best!

77
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,827
She's mine! Hands off!

78
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:56,466
Boys... have you spoken to these girls?

79
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,468
- Not yet. - Never?

80
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:02,072
If I enlarge this, it won't come out very sharp.

81
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,240
That's all right

82
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:06,110
Sure? Okay, then come back tomorrow...

83
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,679
say around six.

84
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:09,047
They'll be ready then.

85
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,749
Please take special care, mister!

86
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,318
Don't worry about it!

87
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,154
Bye for now, mister.

88
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,156
Bye.

89
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,160
Men and boys, you're are all the same,

90
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:21,528
always chasing girls...

91
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:25,333
What's wrong with that? It's natural!

92
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,905
Anyway, better than bringing in pin-ups.

93
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,541
You enlarge those too?

94
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,044
Yours is a porker.

95
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,014
Well, yours is ugly.

96
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:43,688
Boys, stop fighting!

97
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,658
It's been a really long time...

98
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:18,395
Yes, it has.

99
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,664
You're back now?

100
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,500
Yes.

101
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,207
You haven't changed at all.

102
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:33,613
- Neither have you. - Who? Me?

103
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,084
Well... bye for now.

104
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:39,686
OK.

105
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:44,325
Bye...

106
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:09,688
Hi, Brother!

107
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,826
When did you get back?

108
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,062
Just now... What's that?

109
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,931
I bought some radishes.

110
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,838
The red one is radish kimchi,

111
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,874
it goes in the fridge.

112
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,243
The white one is cabbage kimchi,

113
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:29,945
it's not fermented yet.

114
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,319
I ran into Ji-Won this afternoon.

115
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,889
She told me she met you.

116
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,061
I feel very sorry for her.

117
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:48,567
Her husband started gambling again.

118
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,736
He's even violent sometimes.

119
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,509
How are things at work?

120
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,612
Busy... but it's still hard

121
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,514
to pay all the salaries.

122
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:05,320
You still haven't got over Ji-won?

123
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:15,031
Remember our days in primary school?

124
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:16,766
You kept her picture

125
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:19,036
in your exercise book.

126
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:55,912
I only just stopped here!

127
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,480
You want to fine me again?!

128
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:58,682
Yes, if you keep parking here!

129
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:00,117
Please move your car!

130
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,920
This is a no-parking zone!

131
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,307
Can I help you?

132
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,010
Can you fix my camera?

133
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:24,345
Sure

134
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,054
How much is the camera you use?

135
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,490
Why do you ask?

136
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,593
Just curious...

137
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:39,162
People would take me more seriously

138
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,198
if I had a big one like that.

139
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:46,805
Mind if I take a rest here?

140
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,274
No problem.

141
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm fed up with this heat!

142
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:04,091
Exhausting, isn't it?

143
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:15,738
You're a Leo, right?

144
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,676
Born in August?

145
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,047
Leos are supposed to be

146
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,816
compatible with me.

147
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,189
By the way, how old are you?

148
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,759
Me? I'm... late twenties.

149
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,697
That means thirty-something!

150
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,168
Middle-aged!

151
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,006
You're still single, right?

152
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:49,444
Wrong! I have two kids.

153
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,881
You're lying!

154
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:54,450
I can tell from your clothes!

155
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,421
I'll take a short nap...

156
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:00,557
Please don't talk to me.

157
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:24,886
- By the way... - What?

158
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:27,822
How come you're so fresh with me today?

159
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:17,914
Dad, how come your stew

160
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,716
always tastes so good?

161
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,521
Mine is never this good.

162
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:24,756
Me neither.

163
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:28,527
It takes time and effort.

164
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:32,965
She's a good wife but a terrible cook...

165
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:34,801
Just like her mother!

166
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:36,236
You mean my daughter won't

167
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:37,570
be a good cook either?

168
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:39,106
Right!

169
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:43,377
Brother, call me after you've

170
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:44,946
seen the doctor tomorrow.

171
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:48,950
I'll be all right, don't worry.

172
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,558
Take care of Chong-Rae,

173
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:57,427
she should eat less sugar.

174
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,398
Dad, shall I take it?

175
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,769
I was a professional too, don't forget.

176
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:07,973
One, two...

177
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:36,773
Hi, where are you off to?

178
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:38,975
The district office.

179
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,679
What's that?

180
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,782
Going to give me a hand?

181
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,621
Since you're my best customer...

182
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,091
It's quite heavy!

183
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,759
Get on.

184
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,149
No boyfriend?

185
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:17,187
No, not interested. They are all boring.

186
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,225
You'll change your mind when

187
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,827
you meet a nice one.

188
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:25,563
Maybe...

189
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,103
Okay, hold tight!

190
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,726
Hello...

191
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,528
Ji-Won!

192
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:54,764
Cleaning up?

193
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:56,199
Yes...

194
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:03,674
Wait for me inside.

195
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:32,775
Ji-Won...

196
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:38,448
You remember our school days?

197
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,024
I used to copy your diary...

198
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:48,493
And we had a big fight when I found out.

199
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:54,300
You've been here for

200
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:56,870
more than twenty years!

201
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:58,905
Not bored with it yet?

202
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:04,111
Well, I don't know...

203
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,250
Why didn't you marry?

204
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:13,823
I was waiting for you!

205
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,236
You have two kids?

206
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,174
Yes...

207
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:36,082
I didn't expect to come back.

208
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,563
I heard you're very ill.

209
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,870
No, no, not at all.

210
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:58,842
It's really serious?

211
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:00,778
I'm all right! I'll be fine!

212
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,073
Time changes us so much.

213
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:30,145
After some more awkward small talk...

214
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,316
Ji-Won asked me to remove

215
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,485
her picture from the display.

216
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,023
I suppose all things must pass,

217
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,458
including 'love'...

218
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,111
Mr. Yoo Jung-Won,

219
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,980
please come to the MRI Room.

220
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:57,150
Where are you going?

221
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,486
I have to take some pictures.

222
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:01,956
So what can I do?

223
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:04,726
This is terribly urgent!

224
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,453
Tastes good?

225
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,357
No, no... I've had enough.

226
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,259
- Go on! Have some more! - No, no...

227
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,504
You're the only son, right?

228
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:45,974
What makes you think so?

229
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,176
I can tell from the way you eat.

230
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:53,416
When we had ice-cream at home,

231
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:55,118
there was always a riot.

232
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,025
Go ahead, you first.

233
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,428
Many brothers and sisters?

234
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:06,998
How many?

235
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:12,104
I don't know why Mom had so many.

236
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,140
Look...

237
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:18,712
Drawing a line like this would

238
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:22,283
always start a fight.

239
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,389
It was a real drag.

240
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,516
Damn traffic cops!

241
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:53,786
Get lost!

242
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,923
You're killing my business!

243
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,358
We want some lunch!

244
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,362
No way. You're not eating here!

245
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,838
Looks like no restaurant will have us.

246
00:28:13,743 --> 00:28:15,645
Hi, what are you doing there?

247
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,416
Just enjoying the shade...

248
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,801
Where have you been?

249
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,102
At the market.

250
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:37,671
You?

251
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:40,374
Yes, I like cooking.

252
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:46,915
Let's see... noodles... and spinach?

253
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:49,151
You can cook all this?

254
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:50,452
Why not?

255
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,090
I must go.

256
00:28:54,223 --> 00:28:56,326
- Back home? - Yes.

257
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,261
Take care!

258
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:24,258
Excuse me!

259
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:26,194
What are you doing?

260
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,031
- Finished work? - Yes.

261
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:33,903
Could you have these ready by tomorrow?

262
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,038
Sure.

263
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:40,110
She's shattered... we had a lousy day.

264
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:42,813
- See you! - See you!

265
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:31,003
It's been ages since we drank together.

266
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,371
Really!

267
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:41,482
Remember that girl you chased?

268
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:43,250
The butcher's daughter?

269
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,323
Yeah, the one who dragged you

270
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,894
onto presidential campaign rallies!

271
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,639
Hard to believe that was only

272
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,108
ten years ago...

273
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:10,983
One more bottle, please!

274
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,853
There's no mistake in the check!

275
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:21,362
Chul-Ku, buy me one more drink!

276
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:24,932
No way. I'm a reformed character!

277
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:28,270
A quick one in that little bar!

278
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,672
Hey, you're already drunk.

279
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,747
Remember what you said

280
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,983
just before we turned thirty?

281
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:41,619
Who, me?

282
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,554
Don't remember.

283
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:45,323
No?

284
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:51,363
What's with you tonight?

285
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:53,466
"Drink till we die!"

286
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,873
Jung-won, where are you going?

287
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:03,411
Hey, man!

288
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:08,917
Man, what's wrong with you?

289
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:12,922
Something's bugging you, right?

290
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:17,193
That's why you want to get drunk?

291
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,497
Lay off!

292
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,434
Tell me what's wrong.

293
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,538
shooot, why can't I pee?

294
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,076
I was really bursting just now...

295
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,682
What's the matter?

296
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:44,158
I'm going to die soon.

297
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,661
What? That's crap!

298
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:48,930
You just want another drink!

299
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,436
Okay, okay.

300
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,105
- Really? - Come on!

301
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,217
"Drink till we die!"

302
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,358
Finally, I joked about the truth.

303
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,595
But I wondered how many days.

304
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,364
I had left...

305
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:19,499
...to hang out with him, drinking

306
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,702
and laughing like we always used to.

307
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,147
Where did this happen?

308
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:32,948
In front of the phone booth.

309
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:33,716
Why?

310
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:34,584
He started it because

311
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:35,551
I was using the phone...

312
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:36,886
So you didn't do anything to him?

313
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:37,754
No

314
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:40,257
Please wait over there.

315
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,325
I'm the chauffeur

316
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:43,527
for the Democratic Party.

317
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:45,930
That party's over! Wait over there!

318
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:48,033
He kicked me...

319
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:51,637
What happened was...

320
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:53,973
All right, all of you wait over there!

321
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:00,681
- You look like shooot! - flap you!

322
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:09,992
Shut up!

323
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:14,197
All of you, shut up!

324
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,335
Why the bloody hell should I shut up?

325
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:21,405
Why the flap should I shut up?

326
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,108
Jung-Won! Calm down!

327
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:26,478
Calm down! Jung-Won, calm down!

328
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,246
Quiet!

329
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:33,886
Why should I shut up?

330
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:11,196
Hello?

331
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:14,400
Chul-Ku?

332
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:29,985
Police box? I don't remember...

333
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:33,589
yes, that little bar...

334
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:39,563
Did I really?

335
00:35:40,898 --> 00:35:43,301
And the girl traffic cop?

336
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:49,875
No, I'll be fine. I'll call you later.

337
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,136
Concord, license number 2587,

338
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:16,806
please remove your vehicle!

339
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:22,613
Excel, license number 8731,

340
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,081
remove your vehicle.

341
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,986
This is a no-parking zone!

342
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:51,213
What are you doing?

343
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:56,786
What... are... you... doing?

344
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,562
May I come in?

345
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:10,302
May... l... come... in?

346
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,714
OK.

347
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:37,334
Why are you smiling at me?

348
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:43,107
What did you do before you

349
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:44,442
became a traffic cop?

350
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,781
I just hung around at home.

351
00:37:55,722 --> 00:37:57,557
How come you never married?

352
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:01,595
Marry? I guess I was too busy.

353
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:04,732
It's hot.

354
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,068
I see

355
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,143
You like your job? Isn't it hard?

356
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,316
So so.

357
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:27,425
How is your life?

358
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:37,604
You know, nothing special.

359
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:46,848
I got paid today!

360
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:49,484
So you're going to treat me?

361
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:53,789
Maybe... depends on you

362
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:16,783
Darim, let's see now...

363
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,686
Why don't you moisten our lips?

364
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,789
Just a bit more...

365
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,100
Good!

366
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,669
Just a moment

367
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:40,681
Madam, you prefer to keep

368
00:40:40,781 --> 00:40:42,616
your glasses on or to take them off?

369
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,091
Yes, your glasses... which do you prefer?

370
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,126
My glasses? Take them off?

371
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:58,568
Let me see... as you prefer.

372
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:00,037
My son bought them for me,

373
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,972
so I'd rather keep them on.

374
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,511
Everybody ready?

375
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:10,783
Big smiles, please

376
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:13,452
Smile when I count...

377
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,490
One, two...

378
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:19,860
Yes!

379
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,629
Perfect!

380
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,531
Thank you!

381
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,438
Mother, since we're here,

382
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:31,240
why not have your portrait taken?

383
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:34,076
Maybe later...

384
00:41:35,812 --> 00:41:39,016
No, please let's do it now.

385
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,253
Go ahead.

386
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:53,666
Just a moment.

387
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,134
So you've bought a new house!

388
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,336
Wasn't it expensive?

389
00:41:56,402 --> 00:41:57,904
We want to move too,

390
00:41:58,004 --> 00:42:00,140
But it's hard to find a nice flat...

391
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,611
How much was it, honey?

392
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:39,953
What a surprise!

393
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:41,689
Darim!

394
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:42,923
What are you doing here?

395
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,793
Getting my scooter repaired

396
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:50,232
Great, can I share your umbrella?

397
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:52,468
For free?

398
00:42:53,302 --> 00:42:55,038
How can I repay you?

399
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:57,774
I could come by later and

400
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,610
you could buy me a drink.

401
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,748
- It's a deal! - Promise?

402
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,422
What time?

403
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,925
7 or 7:30, okay?

404
00:44:01,615 --> 00:44:04,151
"...the street-lamps are lit

405
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,758
as darkness falls..."

406
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,318
Madam!

407
00:45:02,186 --> 00:45:04,388
The photo isn't ready yet...

408
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:08,527
The one we took this afternoon...

409
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:12,498
You want to take another?

410
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:15,268
Can I?

411
00:45:15,535 --> 00:45:17,537
Of course you can

412
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:20,107
And you won't charge me?

413
00:45:20,507 --> 00:45:23,010
Absolutely not, ma'am!

414
00:45:23,177 --> 00:45:25,780
Thank you, young man.

415
00:45:25,947 --> 00:45:28,083
- This way please. - Over there?

416
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:43,401
I'm ready, Madam.

417
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:44,902
If you'll come this way...

418
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:50,909
This has to look good.

419
00:45:51,243 --> 00:45:52,178
May I ask why?

420
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:54,614
It'll be my memorial portrait.

421
00:45:55,982 --> 00:45:58,051
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll do my best.

422
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:09,064
You must have been very

423
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:10,799
charming when you were young.

424
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:13,002
You really think so?

425
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,179
I think we're ready now.

426
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,485
Would you mind taking off your glasses?

427
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:33,559
You look much better without them!

428
00:46:34,694 --> 00:46:36,563
So... look at me

429
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,533
A little to the right.

430
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:45,106
Now, would you smile a bit?

431
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:47,842
Good.

432
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:51,580
A little to the right, and smile...

433
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:54,083
One, two...

434
00:46:59,256 --> 00:47:00,524
Just a moment...

435
00:47:01,825 --> 00:47:03,127
I'll do one more.

436
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,499
Were you upset that I didn't come?

437
00:51:29,404 --> 00:51:31,106
Why didn't you?

438
00:51:32,274 --> 00:51:34,076
Just didn't feel like it.

439
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:44,288
I have to go to work... Bye!

440
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:19,262
Did Chul-Ku call you?

441
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:21,966
He said he'd never see me again

442
00:52:22,032 --> 00:52:23,567
If I didn't come!

443
00:52:23,668 --> 00:52:25,336
I was going to call you too...

444
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,077
Yeah, it's been too long.

445
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:37,217
Is the food ready yet? Coming!

446
00:52:38,685 --> 00:52:41,956
Fussy, as ever... Coming up!

447
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,333
I win!

448
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:53,235
(It's void!) Have some first...

449
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:54,837
What the flap!

450
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:59,743
Screw You! I'm on a winning streak!

451
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,180
- Try them! - Not now!

452
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:08,220
Such an ass since primary school!

453
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:11,290
Try the potatoes!

454
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:12,725
flap the potatoes!

455
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:19,466
Messed up again?

456
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:22,002
Such a jerk...

457
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,892
Let's take one more, okay?

458
00:54:47,168 --> 00:54:48,103
Jung-Won!

459
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:49,504
Yes, Father...

460
00:54:55,244 --> 00:54:57,414
Can you put this tape on for me?

461
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:00,584
Did you rent it?

462
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:03,554
It's From Here to Eternity.

463
00:55:04,622 --> 00:55:06,858
I saw this with your mother.

464
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:25,947
Dad, try to do it yourself this time.

465
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:28,850
I'll show you.

466
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,455
Put the tape in,

467
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:35,491
it starts running automatically.

468
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:37,661
Turn on the TV...

469
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:40,164
Press this 'TV' button, and then

470
00:55:40,264 --> 00:55:44,068
select Channel 4...

471
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:47,072
Please try it for yourself.

472
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,581
No, Father!

473
00:55:56,316 --> 00:56:00,954
First turn the power on, then press

474
00:56:01,221 --> 00:56:04,892
'TV', then select Channel 4...

475
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,963
Switch it on...

476
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:15,905
No, Father!

477
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,376
Power on, press 'TV',

478
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:23,047
then select Channel 4!

479
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,986
Isn't this video?

480
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:33,593
No! Power on, press 'TV'.

481
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:36,029
And then set it to '4'!

482
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:37,464
Try again.

483
00:56:45,473 --> 00:56:46,875
Press!

484
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:50,949
"1: Put the tape in the machine,

485
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,418
turn the power on."

486
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:00,127
"2: Press..."

487
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,121
Hello!

488
00:58:24,589 --> 00:58:26,057
All right?

489
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:28,026
You have a bout coming up?

490
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:30,896
What pose would you like?

491
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:38,705
I don't think you should smile...

492
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:43,010
One, two...

493
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,025
Good evening...

494
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:31,734
You're wearing make-up!

495
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:34,704
Yes.

496
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,912
You look nice, really pretty!

497
00:59:47,986 --> 00:59:49,354
Can I get you some coffee?

498
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:52,525
Ah! Ice cream!

499
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:03,671
Where are you going?

500
01:00:08,844 --> 01:00:10,679
Darim, how do you spend your weekends?

501
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:17,621
Reading... lounging around...

502
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:23,527
How about you?

503
01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:26,097
Me?

504
01:00:27,899 --> 01:00:30,035
Mostly sleeping!

505
01:00:30,235 --> 01:00:31,971
All day?

506
01:00:36,409 --> 01:00:42,450
No. I do some laundry, and ironing,

507
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:48,924
then have another nap...

508
01:01:01,405 --> 01:01:03,541
My friend works every Sunday.

509
01:01:05,076 --> 01:01:06,678
What does she do?

510
01:01:08,346 --> 01:01:10,115
Didn't I tell you?

511
01:01:10,282 --> 01:01:12,418
She works in Seoul Land Amusement Park.

512
01:01:13,285 --> 01:01:15,421
She's promised me free tickets...

513
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,462
And?

514
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,135
That's all.

515
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:32,107
I want to go there sometime,

516
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:35,178
but I always seem to be too busy...

517
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,363
Feeling better? Got over the dizziness?

518
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,306
Drink...

519
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:18,165
Call that running?

520
01:03:26,674 --> 01:03:30,612
Darim! Let me catch up!

521
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:41,992
PUBLIC BATH

522
01:03:55,408 --> 01:03:56,643
Out already!

523
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:59,379
Men are so quick in the bath!

524
01:04:05,019 --> 01:04:06,955
Want one?

525
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:08,323
Mandarin oranges?

526
01:04:10,259 --> 01:04:12,461
You bought only one? Or two?

527
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:14,564
Two

528
01:04:22,006 --> 01:04:23,240
Where are you going?

529
01:04:23,507 --> 01:04:24,909
To buy some more!

530
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:33,386
This is the true story from the

531
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:35,822
time I did military service.

532
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:39,126
I was on duty here with my junior

533
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:42,797
and there was this terrible smell.

534
01:04:43,397 --> 01:04:45,133
I asked him if he'd farted,

535
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:47,402
and he denied it.

536
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:50,272
He even suggested that I farted

537
01:04:50,372 --> 01:04:53,809
and tried to blame me!

538
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,678
We squabbled about it

539
01:04:55,778 --> 01:04:59,883
until we got back to barracks.

540
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:06,157
I was about to go to sleep, and...

541
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:11,163
And what?

542
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:15,802
I was about to drop off, and...

543
01:05:15,902 --> 01:05:19,506
He swore it wasn't him,

544
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:22,076
and I knew it wasn't me...

545
01:05:22,176 --> 01:05:24,979
Later we found out that a boy

546
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:29,952
killed himself on that very spot...

547
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:32,688
...because his girlfriend died.

548
01:05:32,755 --> 01:05:36,392
And that boy was always farting!

549
01:05:37,394 --> 01:05:39,396
- Funny! - Funny?

550
01:05:39,496 --> 01:05:40,831
A bit scary, though.

551
01:05:41,432 --> 01:05:44,469
I won't dare to walk alone here again!

552
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:47,806
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

553
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:50,075
You smelled a ghost fart!

554
01:05:50,976 --> 01:05:55,848
Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.

555
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,685
People die and become ghosts,

556
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:01,956
It's natural! Maybe you and I...

557
01:06:02,056 --> 01:06:07,095
I suppose it makes sense

558
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:09,998
Are you sure that ghost fart?

559
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:14,437
Maybe, maybe not...

560
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,206
Strange...

561
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:29,788
GENERAL HOSPITAL

562
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,998
"How to operate the DP machine?"

563
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:48,720
Is the rent very high here?

564
01:09:49,454 --> 01:09:52,525
Not that high.

565
01:09:54,427 --> 01:09:55,995
Planning to move out?

566
01:09:56,796 --> 01:10:00,701
I can't afford to!

567
01:10:01,168 --> 01:10:04,172
I'm tired... let's go to sleep.

568
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:15,418
I'll tell you a ghost story.

569
01:10:16,019 --> 01:10:19,556
No way! I hate scary stories!

570
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:22,059
It isn't scary...

571
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,430
At least, I don't have to tell it

572
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,599
in a scary way. Listen...

573
01:10:32,037 --> 01:10:35,208
There was this guy in the army,

574
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:38,311
standing guard with his junior...

575
01:10:38,378 --> 01:10:43,250
And they suddenly smelt something bad.

576
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:48,356
So he turned to his junior and asked...

577
01:10:49,224 --> 01:10:51,860
"You let out a fart, didn't you?"

578
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:55,798
And the junior said "No, sir. I didn't".

579
01:11:03,074 --> 01:11:04,742
So this guy...

580
01:11:07,879 --> 01:11:09,081
His shoes...

581
01:11:10,949 --> 01:11:11,984
Careful...

582
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:14,554
Wait...

583
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,389
Be careful!

584
01:11:17,057 --> 01:11:18,825
Dad, I'll call you from the hospital!

585
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:37,847
They're moving you to

586
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:39,116
another district next week?

587
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:40,184
Yes.

588
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:41,485
Whereabouts?

589
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,120
No idea.

590
01:11:50,028 --> 01:11:51,330
May I join you?

591
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:52,531
Sure.

592
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:56,236
Are you transferring with Darim?

593
01:11:56,369 --> 01:11:58,939
Not this time.

594
01:12:01,976 --> 01:12:04,011
Then we should all have a farewell drink!

595
01:12:04,212 --> 01:12:05,313
Sounds good to me.

596
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,886
I wonder where we'll end up this time...

597
01:13:50,836 --> 01:13:52,772
Can you wait here for just a moment?

598
01:14:55,044 --> 01:14:56,112
Finished?

599
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:10,996
Pass me some water.

600
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:58,088
Awake?

601
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,025
Are you in pain?

602
01:17:11,837 --> 01:17:13,372
You've been dreaming?

603
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,545
Had a sweet dream?

604
01:17:25,153 --> 01:17:27,622
How come you have no women visitors?

605
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:32,595
Isn't there someone you want to see?

606
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:34,964
No. I'm fine.

607
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:37,534
There's no one I miss.

608
01:26:36,296 --> 01:26:38,698
"To: Miss Kim Darim.

609
01:26:41,402 --> 01:26:43,070
From: Yoo Jung-Won."

610
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:21,368
I always knew that

611
01:33:21,535 --> 01:33:25,773
feelings of love would fade...

612
01:33:25,907 --> 01:33:28,376
just like old photographs.

613
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:31,547
But for you,

614
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,116
you will always remain in my heart.

615
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:38,522
As you are in my last moment.

616
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:41,959
Thank you and goodbye...
