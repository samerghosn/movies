Good soft wind.

- My lady.
- My ladies.

5
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,292
You happen to know
the name of the hawk today?

6
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,000
I believe it's Gwenfolt.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,207
- So not Cedric or Hodgins?
- No, I don't think so. Why?

[man laughs]

9
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:03,332

Brother. Geoffrey.

30
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,500
Come here. I have a plan.

31
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:36,134
I'm afraid the only way to be the victor
is to divide and conquer.

32
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:37,674
I'll flank west to capture the hawk.

33
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:39,582

You've always been an A student, Paige.

38
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:15,500
Which is why your midterm results
have me a bit perplexed.

39
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,540

I thought he was my one true love,
my prince.

43

But instead,
he turned out just to be a frog?

00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,391

You know,

50
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:51,457
we all grow up fantasizing
about being a princess, and...

51
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,199
finding true love
with a knight in shining armor,

52
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,040
and living happily ever after.

53
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,415
But the thing is...

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,832
that's all it is.

55
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,290
A fantasy.

56
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:10,457
Now, I know it hurts and sucks right
now,

57
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:16,040
and I'm so sorry,
but just know it will pass.

58
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,290
I promise.

59
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:22,750
In the meantime, let's not let this guy
mess up your near-perfect GPA.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,250
Okay?

61
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,625

Hey, Mads, what's up?

Brooke, I need a favor. Happy holidays.

68

My store is swamped and Evan
is out of town working on a trial.

69
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,855
And I promised Claire that I'd take her
to
the opening night of the Christmas
Castle.

70
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,992
Don't worry,
I'll pick her up and we'll head over.

71
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:56,408
Oh. You're the best. Thank you, sis.

72
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:57,507
We'll see you soon.

73
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,125
Hello.

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,457
This is no time
to be outside without shelter.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,375
You are a handsome young knight.

76
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,500
Pray you help one as beauteous as
myself?

77
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,707
Sir Cole Christopher Frederick Lyons,
at your service.

78

Where are you headed?

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,790
Back to the castle, as it seems
time for me to give up the hunt.

80
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,375
I can take you as far if you like.

81
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:55,790
Your younger brother, Geoffrey,
is to be knighted this Christmas Day.

82
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,290
Isn't that so?

83
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:59,082
He is.

We must get you out of the cold.
You can
ride my horse. I'll lead the way.

86
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:10,790
Because of your kindness,
I'll tell you this.

87
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,875
The quest you have searched
for long and hard, these many years,

88
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,040
begins this day.

89
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,908
You shall travel to faraway lands,

90
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,375
see things undreamed of.

91
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:28,625
Flying steel dragons and horses,
magic boxes that make merry.

[Old Crone laughs in excitement]

93
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:34,250
Is that so? Where exactly
would this quest lead me?

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,415
Your destiny. To fulfill your dream.

95
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,582
And become a true knight.

96
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:47,625
Me thinks you've spent too long
in the cold. Better get you to shelter.

97
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,625
Heed this warning.

98
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:55,415
If you fail to fulfill your quest
before midnight on Christmas Eve,

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,707
you shall never become a true knight.

- Okay.

invented.

[both chuckle]

117
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,165
So, what are you
asking Santa for this year?

118
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:53,582
A puppy.

119
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,040
- A puppy?
- Yup.

120
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,125

Oh, hey, David.

126
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,823
The kids look pretty excited to see
Santa.

127
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,365
Yeah. They sure are.

128
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,466
Come on.

00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:27,408
Hey. Happy Christmas.

What would like
for Christmas this year, young man?

131

- A new bike.
- A new bike.

132
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:36,158
We'll see what we can do.
Won't we, Mrs. Claus?

133
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,653
- Well, you have a very merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

What's wrong?

139
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,990
Just someone I wish
would've moved to the North Pole,

140
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:57,610
so I never have to see his face again.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,948
Your ex-boyfriend? James?

142
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,375
Yep, that's the one.

143
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,707
Maybe I should remind Santa
to fill his
stocking with coal this year.

144
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,875
That'd show him.

145
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,457
Okay, look, it's your turn. Go ahead.

146
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:09,832
Come on.

00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,033
Hey. Oh, aren't you precious?

What would you like
for Christmas this year, young lady?

149
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,698
A real puppy.
Not a stuffed animal this time.

150
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,875
Oh. Mrs. Claus and I
will take it under advisement.

151

Oh, and one more thing.

152
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,865
Can you bring my Aunt Brooke
a new boyfriend?

153
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,500
Someone really nice,
who won't cheat on her.

- Oh, no.

155

Well, it's Christmas, my dear.

00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,082
If you believe, anything's possible.

157

- There you go, sweet.
- Merry Christmas.

158
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Well,

159
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,615
now that we got that checked off our
list,
what do you say

160
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,375
- we get some hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,165
Crone.

162
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,000
Begging your pardon, my lady.

163
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,582
That's so strange.

I'm so sorry. I...

168
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,139
- What is this delicious mead?
- It's hot chocolate. Let me help.

169
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,416
I'm really so sorry.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,865
It's... No harm done.

171
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:27,582
That's a very impressive armor.

172
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,332
Very authentic.

173
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,290

174
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,415
Oh. Hum.

Well, Merry Christmas.

176
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,790
Indeed.

177
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,290
Glad you finally made it.

178
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,323
Claire tell you she saw Santa?

179
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,908
Yeah. I told them I want a puppy.

180
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:56,073
Yeah, well, good luck with that.
Dogs are a lot of work.

Yeah. Hi. You're supposed
to be on my side, remember?

So, where are you taking him now?

260
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,448
Well, he doesn't have any ID
and he's not in the system,

261
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:12,125
so I thought I'd let him crash down

00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,833
He ruled in the 1300s.

532
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,458
A most formidable and admired king.

533
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,833
Do you know what year it is?

534
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:13,125
The picture box said it's 2019.

535
00:33:14,915 --> 00:33:17,540
The sun rises every morn,

536
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,240
and the moon dies
only to be reborn each month,

537
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,500
and it does so
whether I understand them or not.

538
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,915
I have traveled here,
and it matters not if I understand how.

539
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,665
But you know time travel
isn't a real thing, right?

540
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,040
In the 1300s or now in 2019.

541
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:41,165
Well, by that logic, only things
that you comprehend are possible.

542
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,208
Well, I suppose you're right.

543
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,125
I'm sorry, Sir Cole.

544
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:53,915
You know...

545
00:33:56,665 --> 00:34:00,040
you really don't need
to call me Sir Cole anymore.

546
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,375
But I thought it was a term of respect.

547
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,208
Oh, it is.

548
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,083
Formalities can cease now that we're...

549
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,583
more familiar.

550
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,750
Well, okay then, Cole.

551
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,250
What might this mutilated mess be?

552
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,000
It's my Christmas tree.

553
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,958
We just have to set it up.

554
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,157
It's as contrived as the creatures
that adorn your cottage.

555
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:33,625
Take me to the forest.
I will show you a real tree.

556
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,458
Fine.

557
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,791
[Christmas song playing]

558
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,666
Where I come from,
we adorn the tree
with candles and fruit.

559
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,250
Then come Christmas morn,

560
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,824
my brother and I would awake to find
an
orange and a halfpenny on our
bedclothes.

561
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,449
Orange and a halfpenny?
Guess no need for a gift receipt.

562
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:57,875
When I turned seven,
I apprenticed as a page boy.

563
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,237
I was fortunate Lord Ganley
was kind enough to allow me

564
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:01,855
to return home at Christmas each year.

565
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,500
- It must have been hard.
- It was all I knew.

566
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,824
Then at the age of 14, I became a squire

567
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:10,333
and was sent to Lord Townsend's castle
until the age of 21 when I was knighted.

568
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,958
Ah, this one looks hearty.

569
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,199
Yeah, it does.
I'll get one of the employees to help.

570
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:17,298
Nonsense.

571
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,518
What fun is fetching a Christmas tree

572
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,735
if you allow someone else
to do all of the fetching?

573
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,166
Oh.

574
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,541
[Brooke chuckles]

575
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,375
- [soft hit]
- Oh!

576
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,166
[Cole laughs]

577
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,916
If he can do it, I can do it.

578
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
Nice.

579
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,166
- Oh!
- [woman laughs]

580
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,750
You see that?

581
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,583
Brooke...

582
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,791
Might I ask you a personal question

583
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,916
regarding your dalliance with the
douche?

584
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,708
James?

585
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,416
Well, just how serious was it?

586
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,786
Because if he broke your
betrothal and ruined you,

587
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,842
I believe it is my quest
to see him run through.

588
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,458
No. He is not worth it.

589
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,157
Truth is I kind of knew he wasn't the
one.

590
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,407
I just kept hanging around, hoping

591
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,541
he would grow
into the man I wanted him to be.

592
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,574
But he caused you great distress.

593
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:23,750
Two years.
I tried everything but it wasn't enough.

594
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,657
Well, might I say he was a
boiled-brained
cod piece to choose any
other over you.

595
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:30,083
I... haven't heard that one before,

596
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,750
but... thanks.

597
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,833
A knight speaks the truth at all times.

598
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,541
Brooke, I was wondering if you might
be so gallant as to lend me your steed.

599
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,333
My car?

600
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,041
Hum...

601
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,041
So, you remember how to drive?

602
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,583
Certainly.

603
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,208
I've tamed all sorts of beasts in my
day.

604
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,333
[Cole grunts]

605
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,500
Yours is no different.

606
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,958
Well, okay, I guess.

607
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,166
Do you know where you're going?

608
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:05,041
Not exactly,
but I'm determined to find out.

609
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,666
[Brooke exhales]

610
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,291
Yeah, you... I don't think
you need the windshield wipers.

611
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,708
Got it.

612
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,041
[Cole cleans throat]

613
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,041
[honks]

614
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,583
Are you sure you remember how to drive?

615
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,458
Yes, just warming up.

616
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,916
He'll be fine. It's fine.

617
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,416
Old Crone.

618
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:40,916
Begging your pardon, my lady.

619
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:46,291
Hey, buddy. Can you maybe
stop calling my wife an "Old Crone?"

620
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,250
You look at little lost.

621
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,824
Indeed. I fear I'm no close
to becoming a true knight

622
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,625
than I was before the Crone sent me
here.

623
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,291
Crone?

624
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,824
A wise woman that presents herself
in various disguises

625
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,157
to test the heart of knights.

626
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:02,097
You must be one of those method actors.
You really get into our roles.

627
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,208
Well, a knight is always pure of heart.

628
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:09,750
Alas, I fear I am no close to
achieving
my quest than I was the moment
I got here.

629
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,740
I'd like to say
that it's the joy of Christmas

630
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,375
that reminds us of the faith we need
to sustain us throughout the year.

631
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,500
You know? Failure only happens
when you give up.

632
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:26,291
With hope and determination,
well, they fuel champions.

633
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,875
Verily.

634
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,115
Thank you for your wise counsel,
Father Christmas.

635
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:37,291
My pleasure.

636
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,750
Damn, I'm good.

637
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,333
- [kids shouting in excitement]
- Merry
Christmas! Let's see those lists!

638
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,958
- What? Oh, my gosh, there's so many.
- Yay! He's here!

639
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,041
Oh, good Lord.

640
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Cole.

641
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:21,365
Cole. Officer Stevens said he found my
car
abandoned on Main Street. What
happened?

642
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:22,465
Are you okay?

643
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,083
Alas, I...

644
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,125
fear I'm yet to discover my true quest.

645
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:33,625
What, as in fighting dragons
or pulling
magic swords out of the stone?

646
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,824
I fear you've watched
far too many pictures

647
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:37,541
on your magic box that makes merry.

648
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,875
A knight's true quest
challenges his innermost weakness.

649
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,500
Well, then what is your weakness?

650
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:54,282
I say this with you,
my lady, I do not know.

651
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:57,083
And I have only until
midnight Christmas Eve.

652
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,032
You know, growing up,
my father used to say,

653
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:04,625
you can achieve anything in life
if you want it badly enough.

654
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,916
Brooke, it is my sincerest vow.

655
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,666
I want this more than anything in life.

656
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,541
Then you have
nothing to worry about, Cole.

657
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,949
Christmas is still five days away

658
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:23,625
and I have no doubt
you will achieve your goal.

659
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,125
Your faith is much appreciated.

660
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Come on, let's go home.

661
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,166
Well, in that case, I...

662
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,490
best give you the reins to your steed.

663
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,208
I fear she's the loyal type
who answers only to you.

664
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Good thinking.

665
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,333
That cannot be my England.

666
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,791
It's a live-stream view
of the Tower of London.

667
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,916
That's an extraordinarily
large number of prisoners.

668
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,458
No, they're not prisoners.
They're tourists.

669
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,875
It's an attraction now.
People pay money to have a look around.

670
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,375
Honestly, what next?

671
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,583
[Brooke laughs]

672
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,833
Just hold that thought.

673
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,541
- Hello.
- Hello. Are these for me?

674
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:22,074
- Yeah.
- They're beautiful. Thank you.

675
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,240
Yeah, so we would have
brought you some cookies,

676
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,958
but someone decided
to share them with
half the neighborhood.

677
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,458
Well, that is what Christmas is all
about.

678
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,541
Are you really a knight?

679
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,157
Aye. I am.

680
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:35,699
Can girls be knights?

681
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:36,798
- No.
- Yes.

682
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,500
Girls can be whatever they wanna be.

683
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,250
Cool. Will you teach me
how to swordfight with a real sword?

684
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:47,958
I don't think so. You're too young
and it's too dangerous.

685
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,541
Well, fear not.

686
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,782
When I was her age,
we used to learn to fight

687
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:54,958
with sticks of wood
to avoid serious injury to life or limb.

688
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:59,907
Well, who is ready to get
this tree-trimming party in order?

689
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,007
- Yes.
- Me.

690
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,106
Let's go.

691
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:03,206
[both laughing]

692
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:07,500
Your grandma and grandpa
picked this up on their trip to Aldovia.

693
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,083
- Okay.
- [Cole cleans throat]

694
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,041
How is this?

695
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,333
She's leaning a little far to the right.

696
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,291
No.

697
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,166
That's perfect.

698
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:26,791
Aside from the fact that he
believes
that he's a knight from the
14th century,

699
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,250
I'd say Cole's the whole package.

700
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:30,833
Yeah.

701
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,041
No, but he... He is pretty convincing.

702
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,490
I'm sure once he gets his memory back,

703
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,699
we'll figure out that
he's just a medieval enthusiast.

704
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:41,798
[Brooke chuckles]

705
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,083
I don't know, Mads.

706
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:55,083
What if Cole really is who he says he
is?

707
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,708
Like what if there are things
beyond our comprehension?

708
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,166
What do you mean, like time travel?

709
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,449
Then I would say you both
need to get your heads examined.

710
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:07,548
[Brooke sighs]

711
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,708
I will say this about the guy...

712
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,791
he is very sweet and charming.

713
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,208
Yeah, I'd say.

714
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,458
We sure could use a whole lot
more Coles in this world.

715
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,365
I will drink to that.

716
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:24,625
- Cheers.
- [both chuckle]

717
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:27,625
Now remember,

718
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,125
always defend and protect your weak
side.

719
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:38,416
Okay, kiddo.
Time to say good night to
the good knight.

720
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,541
- Thank you.
- No.

721
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,708
Good night.

722
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,125
That's called a fist bump.

723
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:53,875
Yes, but we knights shake hands
to prove we're weapon-free.

724
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,125
- Good night. I love you.
- Love you, too.

725
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,125
- Good night.
- Good night.

726
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,666
- Good night.
- Good night.

727
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,875
[blade cutting air]

728
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,625
[soft thud]

729
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,500
Excuse me. Who started this fight?

730
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:37,449
Apologies, my lady Brooke.
I came out to get a little sparring in

731
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:39,467
and it appears I got
a little bit carried away.

732
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:40,567
Yeah, you think?

733
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,666
Looks like we've
got some cleaning up to do.

734
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,166
I wouldn't mind helping.

735
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,574
Of course not. Hi.

736
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:52,208
Hi. What do we have here?

737
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,666
Oh. Hum...

738
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:56,949
Well, Cole is one of the cosplay knights
at the Christmas Castle

739
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:59,291
and was just practicing his routine.

740
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,541
Good morn.

741
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,083
- Cole, this is my neighbor, Allyson.
- Charmed.

742
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:05,625
A pleasure.

743
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:08,001
Actually, I just popped by
to see if you're free tonight

744
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,858
to do some
Christmas caroling with friends.

745
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,324
While the... It is an honor,

746
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:18,907
I must respectfully decline,
as I'm previously committed.

747
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:20,166
Ah. Well,

748
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,291
another time, perhaps?

749
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,208
Perhaps.

750
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,583
Okay.

751
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,125
- Bye.
- Bye.

752
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,833
- See you.
- Toodle-pip.

753
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,291
[Brooke steps heavily]

754
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,166
Lady Allyson seems
to have you green with envy.

755
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,000
Okay. First off, she ain't no lady.

756
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,333
In high school,
she was voted Biggest Flirt.

757
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,833
Trust me, she's no damsel in distress.

758
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:50,125
And yet, she distresses
the damsel before me,

759
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,875
which is why I declined her invitation.

760
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,416
Since when are you previously committed?

761
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:59,041
Well, the moment a kind and fair maiden
opened her doors to me.

762
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,750
The scoundrel James did...

763
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,708
How would you put it?

764
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,000
Really did a number
on your self-esteem, babe.

765
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
[Brooke chuckles]

766
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:14,833
I don't know about that, but...

767
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,365
I mean, I guess I did walk away

768
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:20,666
with a few trust issues,
but how could I not?

769
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,541
A knight always keeps faith.

770
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,583
It's part of our code.

771
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,807
What else is part of your knight's code?

772
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,500
A knight is sworn to valor and virtue.

773
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,500
His blade defends the good,
and his might upholds the weak.

774
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,458
His temper shall be led by patience

775
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,208
and his kindness
will give aid to those who seek it.

776
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,990
I have a favor to ask.

777
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,074
I'm going to need
as much help as I can get

778
00:47:44,173 --> 00:47:45,972
to pull off this year's
Christmas Eve feast.

779
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,072
You in?

780
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,250
Indeed.

781
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,458
I'm at your service day or night.

782
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,240
Thanks for watching the little ones.

783
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,365
Oh, anytime. Excited to see
how the feast comes together.

784
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:58,465
Same here.

785
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,916
Will, Lily, behavior yourselves.

786
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:05,458
Hey kids, come on in soon
for some hot chocolate.

787
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,833
Where are your gloves?

788
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,541
They don't keep my hands warm.

789
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,916
Can't you ask your dad
to buy you new ones?

790
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,375
He gets really sad
when we ask for new things.

791
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,375
Here. You can have these. I have others.

792
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,791
I can?

793
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:24,875
Thanks.

794
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,536
<i>[Cole] So, how did this
charity event get started?</i>

795
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:34,166
<i>[Brooke] </i>As a kid, my mom and dad
hosted a Christmas Eve dinner each year

796
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,750
for friends and family
with nowhere else to go.

797
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,708
After they passed away,
I wanted to keep the tradition alive.

798
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,500
How altruistic.

799
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,574
Well, Christmas
is about giving back, right?

800
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,990
So, as the event continued to grow,

801
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,166
we started selling tickets
to donate profits to those in need.

802
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,282
- Hello.
- Oh, Eileen.

803
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:56,324
Please tell me that's what I think it
is.

804
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:58,115
Yes, my homemade peppermint bark.

805
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:02,083
And I made so much this year,
Fred suggested I rent a cement mixer.

806
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,208
[both laugh]

807
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,449
Where is Fred?
He's normally a staple at these events.

808
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:08,125
Yeah, he pulled his back,

809
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,282
and nothing seems
to be relieving the pain.

810
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,949
I swear we've tried everything.

811
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:14,833
Try wrapping his haunch bone
against a hot cloth.

812
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,333
Hot as he can bear it.

813
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:20,958
Then add a healthy dose
of boiled red ox
gall, pork fat and cumin.

814
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,949
Except that.

815
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:25,365
Eileen, this is Cole. He's not a doctor,

816
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,333
but comes from
the land of the holistic approach.

817
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,458
[Eileen gasps]

818
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:31,750
I assure you,
this remedy will allay the pain.

819
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,858
Knights have used it for centuries.

820
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,250
Well, I suppose I could give that a try.

821
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,000
Shouldn't hurt anything.

822
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:41,875
- Well, it looks good on my side.
- Okay. Hold it there.

823
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:45,750
All right.

824
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:50,333
- I can take that for you, Brooke.
- Oh, thank you, David.

825
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,625
You know, I'm so grateful
that you're here. I just...

826
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:56,875
I think it's so amazing
you find the time to volunteer.

827
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,666
I know you have your hands full.

828
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,958
I want my kids to know
it's important to give back.

829
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,750
You're a really good father.

830
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,833
His daughter is best friends with
Claire.

831
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,208
He's a good man.

832
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
[door closes]

833
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,699
Hey. I need to run to the market to
grab
a few things for the Christmas Eve
feast.

834
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:28,625
- Care to join me?
- Indeed.

835
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,125
Perfect.

836
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,333
Oh, no sword.

837
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,166
Just leave it.

838
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,875
This is truly a bounty
unlike anything I've ever seen.

839
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:49,750
Yeah. I suppose even I take for granted
how lucky we are.

840
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:56,041
Where I come from, markets
consist of game, vegetables and bread.

841
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:07,324
This must be that delicious mead
I've grown so fond of.

842
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:08,708
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

843
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,000
[Brooke chuckles]

844
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:13,375
But, Cole, we only need one.

845
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,375
I'm not hunkering down for the winter.

846
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,240
What else? Where is bread?

847
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,340
Oh... I...

848
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,458
We're just...

849
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,125
Well...

850
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,074
You really love that hot chocolate.

851
00:51:38,173 --> 00:51:39,625
Here it is.

852
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:44,375
Why don't you grab eight bags
of dinner rolls? Right there.

853
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,744
You can never have too many.

854
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,000
Miss Winters.

855
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,458
Well, hello, Paige.

856
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,740
Getting ready
for the Christmas feast, I see.

857
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
I'm trying to.

858
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,958
Are you feeling any better
since last time we talked?

859
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,166
Much.

860
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:01,032
I've been thinking a lot
about our conversation,

861
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,833
and I'm really gonna try hard
to focus on my goals.

862
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,532
And I was thinking maybe,

863
00:52:07,632 --> 00:52:11,583
you can give me an extra credit
assignment
to help bring up my midterm.

864
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,583
I'm sure we can figure out something.

865
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,583
- Thank you.
- Of course.

866
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,074
- Okay. Good luck with the feast.
- Thanks.

867
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,416
- Bye.
- Bye.

868
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,791
Cole? Cole,

869
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,333
I said eight bags and nothing
about sampling them first.

870
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,355
You can't serve that to your guests.
It tastes like cockhead.

871
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,125
Okay. Well, then what do you suggest?

872
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:43,375
Guide me down the path
containing flour, yeast and butter.

873
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,699
You know, I'm really not the best cook,

874
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:47,838
so why don't we just
stick to the next best thing?

875
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:52,625
That would be me. I am a butcher,
baker, a candlestick maker.

876
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,750
Of course you are.

877
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,949
Mom, can Lily and I
go play outside in the snow?

878
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:03,875
Oh, I don't know you guys.
It's snowing pretty hard.

879
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,166
Please? Just for a while.

880
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,208
Claire's gonna teach me
how to fight like a knight.

881
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,074
Okay, fine.

882
00:53:12,173 --> 00:53:15,541
What's a little play date
without a little sword play, right?

883
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,958
Hey. Hey, you, come back.

884
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,074
Where are your red gloves?

885
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:22,583
I gave them to Lily,
because she didn't have any.

886
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,375
That was very sweet of you, Claire.

887
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,500
Any mismatches? Yes.

888
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,416
Here you go.

889
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,041
<i>Voilà.</i>

890
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:37,791
Okay.

891
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,125
- Bye.
- Stay close, please.

892
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,250
[door closes]

893
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,041
Where did you learn how to bake?

894
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,708
As a squire,
I was assigned for a time
to the kitchens.

895
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,824
Griselda, the baker,
was a harsh taskmaster,

896
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:53,541
but I learned much at her side.

897
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:55,333
How long did you work in the kitchens?

898
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,375
A couple of years.

899
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,708
It was there I honed
my fencing and fighting skills,

900
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,791
and learned to play the lute.

901
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,541
You really are a Renaissance man,
aren't you?

902
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:11,541
Jeez. It's turning out to be
a real blizzard out there.

903
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,458
Now comes the magic ingredient.

904
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,916
Can't have yuletide bean bread

905
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:19,875
without the bean.

906
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,500
But does it add flavor?

907
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:23,958
Not at all.

908
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:27,250
Legend has it the one who finds the bean

909
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:30,585
is crowned king or queen of the feast
and gets to make a Christmas wish.

910
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,865
But the dough will fail to rise

911
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:39,375
if you continue to wrest it
like a dragon slayer.

912
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,125
See?

913
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,291
Not so difficult.

914
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:55,458
No. Not so difficult at all.

915
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,000
[phone ringing]

916
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,458
Oh, it's my sister.

917
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,083
Hey, Mads, what's up?

918
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,708
Okay, calm down.

919
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:08,646
- We'll be there in a minute.
- What's wrong?

920
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,125
Claire is missing.

921
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,532
David and Officer Stevens
are out looking for them,

922
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:28,188
and they told me to stay close
in case they come back, but I...

923
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:29,958
It's okay. They couldn't have gone far.

924
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:31,875
It's okay.

925
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,750
It appears they went this way.

926
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:40,791
Don't worry, I pledge
to bring them back safe and sound.

927
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Claire!

928
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,458
- Lily!
- They went this way.

929
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:53,791
Are you sure?

930
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,978
I spent much of my life
riding and tracking through the woods.

931
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,577
The signs are always there
if you look close enough.

932
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,333
That's a fresh mark from a glove.

933
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:03,458
Claire!

934
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,708
Claire knows not to come
to Blue Limestone unsupervised.

935
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,333
Claire!

936
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:10,431
Lily!

937
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,583
Oh, no.

938
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:15,166
Not the lake.

939
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
- There.
- Help!

940
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,449
- Help!
- Lily, we're coming!

941
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:24,548
Help!

942
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:31,208
- There you go, lassie.
- Lily, what happened?

943
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,240
Claire and I got lost,

944
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,875
and Claire slipped on the ice,
and it cracked.

945
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:37,291
Claire!

946
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:38,389
I'm scared.

947
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,666
[ice cracks]

948
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,750
No.

949
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,916
Listen to me very carefully.

950
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,833
I need you to stay where you are.

951
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,416
Cole, be careful.

952
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,490
- Do not fear.
- The ice.

953
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,833
Claire, have you ever seen a snail?

954
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,583
Yes.

955
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,157
Now, I need you
to pretend you're a snail right now

956
00:57:00,257 --> 00:57:02,500
and crawl slowly on your belly to me.

957
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,083
Slower, little snail.

958
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,666
I need you to be the slowest snail
that ever crawled the earth.

959
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:26,666
That's it.

960
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,583
That's it. Almost there.

961
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,375
That's it.

962
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:36,541
I've got you.

963
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,458
Be careful now.

964
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,375
[Brooke pants in relief]

965
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,240
Claire, your mother is frantic.

966
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,199
Aunt Brooke, I'm so sorry.
We got lost in the snow.

967
00:57:59,298 --> 00:58:00,750
It's okay. We found you.

968
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:04,541
It's okay.

969
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,583
Let's get the young'uns home.

970
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,740
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

971
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,708
I'd like to say this about you, Sir
Cole.

972
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:16,541
What you did today
was pretty valiant and heroic.

973
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:20,333
So, now you see my duty is similar
to yours, as I now understand.

974
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,291
To protect and serve.

975
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,416
Right.

976
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:25,875
Yes.

977
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,875
Lily's dad wanted to thank you
for coming to our rescue.

978
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh, it would be my honor.

979
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,041
Well, it certainly looks like
his memory's not coming back.

980
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,750
No, I guess not.

981
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:47,291
But who are we to tell him
he's not who he says he is?

982
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,625
Maybe.

983
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,365
But do you really think going along
with this little delusion

984
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:52,583
is helping the situation?

985
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,708
It certainly did today.

986
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,916
Congratulations.

987
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,041
For finally fulfilling your quest.

988
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:05,166
I guess now you can return home for
you brother's ceremony as a true knight.

989
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,458
I think not.

990
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,291
But if it wasn't for you, then...

991
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,583
Today may have been a small act of
valor,

992
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,541
but I fear not enough to fulfill my
quest.

993
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:20,250
I don't get it. What is it going to
take?

994
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,416
The Crone spoke in riddles.

995
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,865
It had something to do with my heart.

996
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:27,208
Unless I can find
meaning in that, well, I...

997
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:29,791
could be stuck here forever.

998
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:32,375
Would that be so bad?

999
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, I might have thought so before...

1000
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,125
[door opens]

1001
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,532
Evan, you're home.

1002
00:59:46,632 --> 00:59:48,166
Yes, we settled the case.

1003
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:51,458
and when I got off the plane,
I had dozens of voicemails from Madison.

1004
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,666
This is Cole, a new family friend.

1005
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:55,833
Nice to meet you, Cole.

1006
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:57,458
And you.

1007
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:58,990
We were just on our way out.

1008
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,851
Madison's upstairs
putting Claire to sleep.

1009
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,291
She'll fill you in.

1010
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,074
Perfect. Any chance
that you can hide these at your house?

1011
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:07,699
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1012
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:08,798
[Brooke chuckles]

1013
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,625
- Claire's a snoop, huh?
- No, your sister is.

1014
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,666
Can you believe it?
Christmas Eve is tomorrow.

1015
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,375
[Evan laughs]

1016
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,500
I don't understand. Why are we here?

1017
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,318
I've been here twice already
and both times come up empty.

1018
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,875
Maybe you just need a fresh set of eyes.

1019
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,157
Look, the Crone
sent you here for a reason,

1020
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:33,583
so there must be
something quest worthy.

1021
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,750
I don't understand.
Then how is a prospective suitor

1022
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,083
supposed to prove
his worthiness to a lady?

1023
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,250
I don't know.

1024
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,833
But I will let you know
the minute I find out.

1025
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:47,916
I'll say this.

1026
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,958
Romance in the future
is much more complex than days of yore.

1027
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:56,750
Well, if it means anything,
I prefer yore over mine.

1028
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:02,490
Two hours, two hot cocoas,
and yet nary a quest in sight.

1029
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,208
My bad. I figured it was worth a shot.

1030
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,907
Hello. I was just on my way
to get one of those.

1031
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:09,750
Oh, you should. They're delicious.

1032
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,541
He loves them.

1033
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,041
Pickpocket!

1034
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,833
Stop, thief! Quick! Lend me your sword.

1035
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,416
It's only rubber!

1036
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,949
Return the lady's purse
or suffer the consequences.

1037
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:28,125
Take it.

1038
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,458
Where I come from, thieves
are strung up by their thumbs and hung,

1039
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,987
or we save the hangman the rope

1040
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:35,128
and cut off his hands
so he can never steal again.

1041
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,704
I believe this is for you.

1042
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:39,125
Oh, thank you.

1043
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:40,782
Wait, Bruce Douglas?

1044
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:42,083
Well, what do you think?

1045
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,740
- Should we let him keep his hands?
- Yeah.

1046
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,791
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1047
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,817
Do you understand your rights
as they've been read to you?

1048
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,791
Yeah, just keep
that crazy sword guy away from me.

1049
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:00,541
Well, you're turning into quite
the natural at this game, Cole.

1050
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,250
[Officer laughs]

1051
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:08,541
You know, you should
consider joining the force.

1052
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:12,375
It would be an honor
to ride and serve alongside you.

1053
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,375
Of course you'd have to pass
the psych exam first.

1054
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,875
Well, I shall study for it night and day
until I'm well prepared.

1055
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,208
Right.

1056
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,250
Right.

1057
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,083
Good job.

1058
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,333
Thank you, Brooke.

1059
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,916
I don't know. I'm just
beginning to wonder what I'm doing here.

1060
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:44,208
I just... I don't get it, Cole.

1061
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:47,782
You mean to tell me
that single-handedly capturing a thief

1062
01:02:47,882 --> 01:02:49,166
still isn't quest worthy?

1063
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,909
I'm beginning to wonder whether being
a true knight is my destiny after all.

1064
01:02:53,009 --> 01:02:54,009
Wow!

1065
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:57,875
Okay, hold on. I'm calling
a big timeout on that negativity.

1066
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,416
Look.

1067
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:03,416
You promised me
you wouldn't give up faith.

1068
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,625
And it ain't over
until the Old Crone sings.

1069
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,958
I believe in you, Cole.

1070
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,291
Never were there
four little words that managed

1071
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:19,833
to wrap my weary heart
into a warm blanket.

1072
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,083
Thank you, Brooke.

1073
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

1074
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:39,875
[Brooke exhales]

1075
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:52,449
Lady Alexa Play, play "Deck the Halls".

1076
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:53,958
<i>[Alexa] Here's "Deck the Halls".</i>

1077
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,282
["Deck the Halls" by Nat King Cole
playing]

1078
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:58,375
[Cole vocalizes together]

1079
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,833
You know, this place is lucky
to see me microwave ramen.

1080
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:09,416
Thank you.

1081
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,791
I can't remember
the last time it smelt so homey.

1082
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:15,449
This all brings me right back to my
youth.

1083
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:16,548
Really?

1084
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,324
That's an amazing youth.

1085
01:04:18,423 --> 01:04:21,083
Oh, wow. Look at you two.

1086
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,583
Well, I don't want to interrupt.

1087
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:27,291
I just wanted to bring you this
to show our appreciation.

1088
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,708
And here is your suit for tonight.

1089
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:32,958
It's mead.

1090
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,500
- Madison, that's so thoughtful.
- Thank you.

1091
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,125
I'm learning from my little one.

1092
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,409
Hey, do you know that the other day
she gave her mittens to David's daughter

1093
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:43,625
- 'cause the poor thing didn't have any?
- What?

1094
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,416
Claire has a kind heart.

1095
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,750
Like her aunt, like her mother.

1096
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:52,333
You know, David's wife passed away
last year after a long illness.

1097
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,365
He has four young kids
and holds down two jobs

1098
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:57,208
just to keep a roof over their heads.

1099
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,907
That's truly a tale of woe.

1100
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,532
Yeah, and still after all that
he makes time to volunteer

1101
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:04,958
because he wants his kids to know
how important it is to give back.

1102
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,625
He sounds like a man of pure heart.

1103
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,625
Perhaps that's what the Old Crone
meant by her riddle.

1104
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,083
What?

1105
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,333
Maybe I found my quest after all.

1106
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,041
This fancy neck ribbon
seems more like a torture device.

1107
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:35,833
[Brooke chuckles]

1108
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:37,291
Perhaps I can help.

1109
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,625
What's wrong?

1110
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,291
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1111
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,500
It's just you look...

1112
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,083
positively radiant.

1113
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,625
Why, thank you.

1114
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:58,291
And you, my knight
in shining cashmere wool blend...

1115
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,333
Well, the costume fits okay.

1116
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,250
I'm having a little trouble
with the neck ribbon.

1117
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:05,875
[Brooke giggles]

1118
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,791
It's called a tie. Here.

1119
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,934
I actually have no idea what I'm doing.

1120
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:24,791
[Both chuckle]

1121
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,708
I have something for you. Stay here.

1122
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,541
Okay. Close your eyes
and hold out your hand.

1123
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,208
I've played this game once with my
brother
and I got slimed by a toad.

1124
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:41,916
It's not a toad. I promise.
Just... Come on.

1125
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,458
Okay. Open them.

1126
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,250
[Cole chuckles softly]

1127
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,208
It's an orange.

1128
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:55,958
You remembered.

1129
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:01,708
And we don't use halfpennies anymore,
but that's an American half dollar.

1130
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:11,333
This means more to me
than words can express.

1131
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:16,250
Thank you, Brooke.

1132
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,583
[phone chimes]

1133
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,875
Wow. A text in all caps!

1134
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,500
- We should go.
- Okay.

1135
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,666
["Jingle Bells" by The Miracles playing]

1136
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,532
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

1137
01:07:43,632 --> 01:07:45,657
And I just wanted to tell you

1138
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:48,324
that your yuletide bread
is the hit of the feast.

1139
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:51,125
Well, thank you.
It's an old family recipe.

1140
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:54,782
Legend has it, the one
who finds the bean gets to make a wish.

1141
01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:57,041
Oh. Well, I'll be on the lookout.

1142
01:07:57,333 --> 01:08:00,949
And how is your husband's aching back?
I trust my ointment did the trick.

1143
01:08:01,048 --> 01:08:04,291
I'll say. Yeah... Here he comes. Just...

1144
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,458
Just tell me how to hit the off button.

1145
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,833
Okay, Fred. All right.

1146
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,916
- Merry Christmas Eve.
- Merry Christmas Eve.

1147
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,283
You look beautiful.

1148
01:08:17,382 --> 01:08:19,739
- Oh, thank you. So do you.
- Come here, you son of a gun.

1149
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,840
[Cole grunts]

1150
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:24,323
Is this some kind of
Christmas wrestling tradition?

1151
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:27,115
I'm guessing Evan found out
how you saved his daughter yesterday

1152
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:29,082
and just wants to thank you.

1153
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,500
You're very welcome, sir.

1154
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,332
- I think we should get things started.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1155
01:08:38,957 --> 01:08:42,707
Welcome everyone
to this year's Christmas Eve feast.

1156
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,448
My mom and dad used to say that

1157
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:49,625
Christmas spirit is about
kindness and compassion towards others.

1158
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,783
And never has that sentiment

1159
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:55,707
been more true than
at this year's Christmas Eve feast.

1160
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:56,916
Enjoy, everyone!

1161
01:08:57,015 --> 01:08:59,000
[people clapping]

1162
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,457
I wish we had a Christmas tree like
this.

1163
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:11,166
Yeah, but what's the best thing
under any Christmas tree?

1164
01:09:11,332 --> 01:09:13,291
- Love.
- That's right.

1165
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,198
David, if you'd all come with me.

1166
01:09:16,298 --> 01:09:17,625
Come on, guys. Come on.

1167
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,250
What's going on?

1168
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,957
Will, Lily, Taylor, Reed,

1169
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,291
I understand you've
all been quite good this year.

1170
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,541
Yes, it appears this year
Father Christmas,

1171
01:09:37,082 --> 01:09:38,875
Santa made a slight miscalculation.

1172
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:43,832
Well, he accidentally
brought all of your presents here

1173
01:09:44,082 --> 01:09:45,291
rather than your home.

1174
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,707
That's... That's for us?

1175
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:50,750
Yes, they are.
Get in there. Open them up.

1176
01:09:53,582 --> 01:09:54,582
Cool.

1177
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,416
Dad. Santa brought me a new bike.

1178
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,125
Daddy, look, a new coat and new boots.

1179
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:04,166
And... this is for you.

1180
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,073
Oh, no. I can't accept. This is too
much.

1181
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,283
No, this is what the feast is all about.

1182
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:16,041
That's why the whole town pitched in
with presents, so that your kids and you

1183
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,291
can have an extra
special Christmas this year.

1184
01:10:19,957 --> 01:10:21,041
I don't know what to say.

1185
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,457
I know times are hard right now.
And we're here for you.

1186
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Thank you.

1187
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,957
I promise to pay it forward when I can.

1188
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:31,957
Well, from my eyes,

1189
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,666
you already have.

1190
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:43,250
We did good, Cole.

1191
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:45,791
Surely your quest is completed now.

1192
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,332
Well, I have one more promise to keep.

1193
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:51,000
It appears we have
a nonbeliever in our midst.

1194
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,332
A problem I plan on remedying posthaste.

1195
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,500
Well, alrighty then.

1196
01:10:58,582 --> 01:11:00,582
[kids laughing]

1197
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,832
See? I told you he was a real knight.

1198
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:08,082
Wow!

1199
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,332
Look over here, kids.

1200
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:16,541
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1201
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:20,365
Okay. Boys, come on.
Let's give somebody else a turn.

1202
01:11:20,466 --> 01:11:21,466
Come on.

1203
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:22,916
Come on.

1204
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,250
Face that way.

1205
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,000
- Okay, squeeze in.
- Crowd in.

1206
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,791
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1207
01:11:32,832 --> 01:11:34,332
There we are.

1208
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,698
Perhaps someone else
should care for a selfie?

1209
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:40,000
I certainly wouldn't
turn down an invitation.

1210
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:43,082
Look, Cole, mistletoe.

1211
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,666
You know what that means?

1212
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:47,457
The dung plant
that wards off evil spirits?

1213
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:51,457
No, silly. It's tradition to kiss
if you're caught under the mistletoe.

1214
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:53,250
Bad luck if you don't.

1215
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:05,291
Something tells me you should save this
for someone you really care about.

1216
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:09,041
Merry Christmas.

1217
01:12:10,332 --> 01:12:11,332
And to you.

1218
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:42,323
Hey. Hon, we'd love to help you clean
up,
but we got to get this little one to
bed.

1219
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:43,490
- Of course.
- Yes.

1220
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,323
And I've gotta practice my surprise face

1221
01:12:45,423 --> 01:12:48,323
when I open up the box of slippers
Madison got me for Christmas.

1222
01:12:48,423 --> 01:12:50,250
- They're not slippers.
- Yeah, I figured.

1223
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,375
[both laugh]

1224
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:52,625
Sleep tight, kiddo.

1225
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,908
Oh, Brooke, we've got this handled.
You enjoy the rest of your evening.

1226
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,408
Oh, Eileen, you're the best.

1227
01:13:00,507 --> 01:13:02,387
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, sweetie.

1228
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,291
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1229
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,041
I'll see you guys.

1230
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,140
I'll see you guys.

1231
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:10,375
[Brooke laughs]

1232
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,291
You summoned me, sire?

1233
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:20,698
Indeed. I was hoping
you might enlighten me

1234
01:13:20,798 --> 01:13:22,783
on the fact of a certain
Christmas tradition.

1235
01:13:22,882 --> 01:13:24,250
Oh. Okay.

1236
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:30,448
From what I gather,
it's bad luck if a couple don't kiss

1237
01:13:30,548 --> 01:13:32,291
whence they find themselves underneath
it.

1238
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,332
Oh, well, it's probably
just some silly old wives' tale.

1239
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,582
But why risk it?

1240
01:13:58,582 --> 01:13:59,666
Cole, your medallion.

1241
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:01,875
The Old Crone.

1242
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,457
Well, what does it mean?

1243
01:14:03,957 --> 01:14:07,041
Well, it means we must go.
Come. Quick.
Take me to your trusty steed.

1244
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:13,115
This is where I arrived,
so it must be my way back.

1245
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:14,250
Back where?

1246
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,707
Well, back to my home.

1247
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,332
Oh, well,
then you've fulfilled your quest.

1248
01:14:24,207 --> 01:14:25,582
You're a true knight?

1249
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:30,000
Well, I should be forever grateful to
you.

1250
01:14:31,457 --> 01:14:34,291
While my heart
is heavy saying goodbye, I...

1251
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,408
I have no choice.

1252
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,625
I must return home for my brother's
knighting ceremony. It's...

1253
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:43,791
It's my duty.

1254
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,791
No, I understand.
It's the knight's code. You have to go.

1255
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,541
No matter what...

1256
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,541
no matter where I am...

1257
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:58,166
I hereby pledge my service to thee.

1258
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,457
You're not making this easy, Cole.

1259
01:15:06,332 --> 01:15:07,957
You helped me believe in myself.

1260
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:11,332
For that,

1261
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:13,832
you'll forever be in my heart.

1262
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:25,291
Fare thee well, my Lady Brooke.

1263
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,832
Goodbye, Sir Cole.

1264
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:49,207
Cole?

1265
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:52,240
What? Cole?

1266
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,041
Miss Winters.

1267
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:19,000
You will never believe what happened.

1268
01:16:19,582 --> 01:16:21,948
Grayson is begging me to take him back.

1269
01:16:22,048 --> 01:16:23,457
- Oh?
- Right?

1270
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,291
I told him to forget it,

1271
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,541
because true love
only exists in fairy tales.

1272
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:33,082
And from now on,
I'm only focusing on my goals.

1273
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,166
Paige, I was wrong.

1274
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,158
But you said...

1275
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:41,207
No, not about your goals. That's good.

1276
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,916
But about true love.

1277
01:16:44,957 --> 01:16:46,125
It does exist.

1278
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:48,666
Really?

1279
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:52,000
You know, it may not
come around that often, but...

1280
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,750
when it does, you'll recognize it.

1281
01:16:57,125 --> 01:17:00,698
When someone loves you
completely for who you are,

1282
01:17:00,798 --> 01:17:03,791
and you want what's best
for them, too, even...

1283
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:07,957
Even if it means it's not with you.

1284
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,082
Oh, sorry.

1285
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,375
That's okay.

1286
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,500
Okay.

1287
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,750
- Merry Christmas, Miss Winters.
- Merry Christmas to you, too, Paige.

1288
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:22,707
Bye.

1289
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,875
[song playing]

1290
01:18:06,207 --> 01:18:08,207
[Brooke sighs and gasps]

1291
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,875
The magic bean.

1292
01:18:15,332 --> 01:18:17,166
I wish Cole was still here.

1293
01:18:42,207 --> 01:18:43,408
[sobs]

1294
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,750
- My lord.
- Yes?

1295
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:02,875
Sherwyn!

1296
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,457
[horse galloping]

1297
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,390
Sherwyn!

1298
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:20,125
[horse neighing]

1299
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,125
[horse neighs]

1300
01:19:26,707 --> 01:19:27,707
Brother?

1301
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,750
Geoffrey.

1302
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:35,908
Your horse returned without you days
ago.

1303
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:38,568
We searched and searched
but feared you were lost in the storm.

1304
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:39,916
I was, yes.

1305
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:41,916
Lost.

1306
01:19:42,015 --> 01:19:44,414
The ceremony should begin soon,
then I shall seek my quest.

1307
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,125
I made it back in time.

1308
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:50,033
If I may offer you some advice.

1309
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:51,132
By all means.

1310
01:19:51,457 --> 01:19:52,707
Be kind to all you meet.

1311
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,615
It was a crone who urged me

1312
01:19:54,716 --> 01:19:58,666
to seek my quest with my heart,
that a true knight could emerge.

1313
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,457
And are you a true knight?

1314
01:20:01,582 --> 01:20:02,582
I am.

1315
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,582
Huzzah! Then let us celebrate
over a tankard of ale.

1316
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Alas...

1317
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:11,332
my heart also led me to my lady Brooke.

1318
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:15,125
You're in love.

1319
01:20:15,957 --> 01:20:17,166
I can see it on your face.

1320
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,957
I believe so, yes.

1321
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,375
I was a fool to have left her.

1322
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:26,791
What is this?

1323
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,375
My weakness was not realizing sooner.

1324
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,291
You must go to her.

1325
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:34,948
But your knighting ceremony.

1326
01:20:35,048 --> 01:20:38,666
Is of no importance
in comparison to matters of the heart.

1327
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:42,740
I wish you well, always.

1328
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:43,875
I carry you with me.

1329
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,291
I carry you with me.

1330
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:55,875
Away with you.

1331
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,750
Go, find your fair lady Brooke.

1332
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:02,957
If you're sure.

1333
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:04,875
I am.

1334
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,541
Good luck with the ceremony.

1335
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,207
It's Christmas! Santa came.

1336
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,041
[Mads chuckles]

1337
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:26,082
Where's my stocking?

1338
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,908
- It was there last night.
- Yeah, that's strange.

1339
01:21:30,007 --> 01:21:31,007
Where is it?

1340
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,375
It's a puppy!

1341
01:21:35,332 --> 01:21:36,332
[dog cries]

1342
01:21:36,431 --> 01:21:38,033
What... Did you...

1343
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:39,957
No. Did you?

1344
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,666
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

1345
01:21:46,207 --> 01:21:47,457
Merry Christmas!

1346
01:21:47,707 --> 01:21:50,250
Aunt Brooke, you'll never believe
what Santa brought me.

1347
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,500
A puppy.

1348
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:54,291
Wow. Really?

1349
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:58,323
Yeah, you don't happen to know
anything about this, do you?

1350
01:21:58,423 --> 01:21:59,573
No, why?

1351
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:02,541
Because neither do we.
Which means there's no explanation.

1352
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yes, there is.

1353
01:22:04,582 --> 01:22:05,791
Christmas magic.

1354
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:08,865
You swear you had nothing to do

1355
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:09,966
- with this puppy?
- No.

1356
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:13,125
So, Claire is right
and it's Christmas magic?

1357
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:17,283
Well, just because you can't
explain something logically,

1358
01:22:17,382 --> 01:22:18,582
doesn't mean it can't happen.

1359
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:23,573
Like your time-traveling knight.
Where is he, by the way?

1360
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:25,707
He's... gone home.

1361
01:22:27,082 --> 01:22:30,291
I... I don't think
I'll ever see him again.

1362
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:32,582
Oh, honey,

1363
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm so sorry.

1364
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:37,875
I thought you two
had something really special.

1365
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah, so did I.

1366
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,740
Brooke, merry Christmas.

1367
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,041
Merry Christmas.

1368
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,832
- All right.
- Thanks.

1369
01:22:48,957 --> 01:22:50,166
- All right.
- Thanks.

1370
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:53,533
- You ready to open up some presents?
- And later,

1371
01:22:53,632 --> 01:22:56,865
Daddy's going to take us back
to the Christmas Castle. Wanna come?

1372
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:58,740
- I...
- I know you're not feeling it,

1373
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:02,533
but it's Christmas.

1374
01:23:02,632 --> 01:23:04,625
[both laughing]

1375
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:09,582
[Cole] Crone!

1376
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,750
Crone!

1377
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:21,875
Crone!

1378
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,250
Crone! Old Crone!

1379
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,750
I have need of you.

1380
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,875
Love is the first and foremost
of all knightly virtues.

1381
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:34,875
I understand that now.

1382
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,416
It's love.

1383
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:43,707
I beg thee, Crone.

1384
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:46,250
Whatever it is that you desire,

1385
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:47,875
I will do...

1386
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:50,707
if you help me return to my truest love.

1387
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:56,125
Please.

1388
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:58,832
Very well.

1389
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,457
You have proven yourself worthy.

1390
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:08,582
[people chattering]

1391
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:15,783
While I may never understand
our Christmas miracle pup,

1392
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:18,957
I have to admit, he's growing on me.

1393
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:21,832
Hey, that's not a half bad name for him.

1394
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,125
Miracle. What do you think
about that, Claire?

1395
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:27,291
I already named him. Knight.

1396
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:30,457
- What do you think, Aunt Brooke?
- It's perfect.

1397
01:24:31,582 --> 01:24:34,041
Where's Cole?
I thought he was going to join us.

1398
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,916
Oh, yeah, sweetie.
He had to leave last night.

1399
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:39,500
Why? I thought he liked it here.

1400
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:40,625
Oh, he did.

1401
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,666
He really did, but...

1402
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,416
his calling was far, far away.

1403
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,166
What's a calling?

1404
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,457
It's a job. Like the business trip
Daddy just went on.

1405
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:53,332
Oh. Then he's coming back then. Right?

1406
01:24:56,082 --> 01:24:57,332
I don't know, Claire Bear.

1407
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,698
Hey, but I do know
we sure had fun while he was here.

1408
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:03,798
Right?

1409
01:25:07,707 --> 01:25:08,707
It's Cole!

1410
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:10,916
And he brought his horse.

1411
01:25:11,457 --> 01:25:14,000
- Delighting in your company.
- Cole, I thought you were gone,

1412
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:15,707
like, for good.

1413
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,500
Brooke, I should have realized it
sooner,

1414
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:20,707
you are my quest.

1415
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,250
- I'm your quest?
- Yes.

1416
01:25:24,582 --> 01:25:26,082
And my heart is

1417
01:25:26,957 --> 01:25:28,666
eternally and devotedly yours.

1418
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:31,541
If you will have me.

1419
01:25:32,957 --> 01:25:35,041
Nothing would make me happier,

1420
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,332
my handsome knight.

1421
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:39,625
My fair maiden.

1422
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,750
You are going to miss being a knight.

1423
01:25:55,457 --> 01:25:56,750
What will you do here?

1424
01:25:57,291 --> 01:26:00,166
Perhaps I'll join Officer Stevens
and his order of present-day knights.

1425
01:26:00,832 --> 01:26:02,082
Or open my own bakery.

1426
01:26:04,082 --> 01:26:06,125
I can't believe you came back for me.

1427
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,250
Wherever you are,

1428
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:10,916
it's the only place I want to be.

1429
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,332
[horse neighs]

1430
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:28,416
I found Sherwyn.

1431
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:29,707
Hi, Sherwyn.

1432
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:38,750
- Wanna come for a ride?
- Sure.

1433
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,416
Huzzah! To the quest!

1434
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:37,791
Come.

1435
01:27:40,082 --> 01:27:42,082
Lord Seamus will get the door.

1436
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,166
You truly are a handsome young knight.

1437
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:54,541
Pray you help one as beauteous as
myself?

1438
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,375
One moment.

1439
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:03,791
Sir Geoffrey Alexander Edward Lyons
at your service.
