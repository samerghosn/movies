- My ladies.

5
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,292
You happen to know
the name of the hawk today?

6
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,000
I believe it's Gwenfolt.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,207
- So not Cedric or Hodgins?
- No, I don't think so. Why?

Come here. I have a plan.

31
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:36,134
I'm afraid the only way to be the victor
is to divide and conquer.

32
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:37,674
I'll flank west to capture the hawk.

You've always been an A student, Paige.

have me a bit perplexed.

he turned out just to be a frog?

You know,

50
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:51,457
we all grow up fantasizing
about being a princess, and...

51
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,199
finding true love
with a knight in shining armor,

52
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,040
and living happily ever after.

53
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,415
But the thing is...

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,832
that's all it is.

55
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,290

now,

mess up your near-perfect GPA.

And I promised Claire that I'd take her
to
the opening night of the Christmas
Castle.

70

Don't worry,
I'll pick her up and we'll head over.

This is no time
to be outside without shelter.

You are a handsome young knight.

Pray you help one as beauteous as
myself?

Back to the castle, as it seems
time for me to give up the hunt.

80

I can take you as far if you like.

81

Your younger brother, Geoffrey,
is to be knighted this Christmas Day.

Isn't that so?

You can

86

Because of your kindness,
I'll tell you this.

87
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,875
The quest you have searched
for long and hard, these many years,

88
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,040
begins this day.

89
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,908
You shall travel to faraway lands,

90

93
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:34,250
Is that so? Where exactly
would this quest lead me?

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,415
Your destiny. To fulfill your dream.

95
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,582
And become a true knight.

96
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:47,625
Me thinks you've spent too long
in the cold. Better get you to shelter.

97
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,625
Heed this warning.

98
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:55,415
If you fail to fulfill your quest
before midnight on Christmas Eve,

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,707
you shall never become a true knight.

So, what are you
asking Santa for this year?

118
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:53,582
A puppy.

119
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,040

- Yup.

would've moved to the North Pole,

Your ex-boyfriend? James?

142
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,375
Yep, that's the one.

143
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,707
Maybe I should remind Santa
to fill his
stocking with coal this year.

144
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,875
That'd show him.

145
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,457
Okay, look, it's your turn. Go ahead.

for Christmas this year, young lady?

A real puppy.
Not a stuffed animal this time.

will take it under advisement.

now that we got that checked off our
list,
what do you say

160
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,375
- we get some hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

- What is this delicious mead?
- It's hot chocolate. Let me help.

I'm really so sorry.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,865
It's... No harm done.

171
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:27,582
That's a very impressive armor.

00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,332
Very authentic.

Indeed.

Glad you finally made it.

Claire tell you she saw Santa?

179
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,908
Yeah. I told them I want a puppy.

180
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:56,073
Yeah, well, good luck with that.
Dogs are a lot of work.

Yeah. Hi. You're supposed
to be on my side, remember?

So, where are you taking him now?

260
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,448
Well, he doesn't have any ID
and he's not in the system,

261
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:12,125
so I thought I'd let him crash down

362
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,125
And yet these skunks are not okay to
eat.

363
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,875
No, it's not a dog. It's a pork sausage.

Apologies.

00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:38,165
- No offense intended, fair server.
- Sorry.

Well, years ago, I did.

384
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:01,040
I could not marry the Lady Matilda
until I've fulfilled my quest.

385
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, that sucks.

386
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:07,333
While I cared for her deeply,
I needed to do what was right.

387

Well, I should thank the douche
for the garments he provided.

You regard him still.

Regard him as a big mistake. Yeah.

398
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,708
He cheated on me with the wench
sitting across from him.

399
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,907
Then perhaps he deserves more
than a show of appreciation.

No!

401
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:54,625
No, sit down. You can't do that. Stop.

That's not the way
things are done nowadays.

405

There are literally laws against it.

406
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,990
The rules of gallantry are much changed
when a deserving scoundrel cannot

407
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,199
be put in his place.

408
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:13,298
Maybe.

409
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,199

00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,833
He ruled in the 1300s.

532
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,458
A most formidable and admired king.

533
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,833
Do you know what year it is?

534
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:13,125
The picture box said it's 2019.

535
00:33:14,915 --> 00:33:17,540
The sun rises every morn,

536
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,240
and the moon dies
only to be reborn each month,

537
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,500
and it does so
whether I understand them or not.

538
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,915
I have traveled here,
and it matters not if I understand how.

539
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,665
But you know time travel
isn't a real thing, right?

540
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,040
In the 1300s or now in 2019.

541
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:41,165
Well, by that logic, only things
that you comprehend are possible.

542
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,208
Well, I suppose you're right.

543
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,125
I'm sorry, Sir Cole.

544
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:53,915
You know...

545
00:33:56,665 --> 00:34:00,040
you really don't need
to call me Sir Cole anymore.

546
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,375
But I thought it was a term of respect.

547
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,208
Oh, it is.

548
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,083
Formalities can cease now that we're...

549
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,583
more familiar.

550
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,750
Well, okay then, Cole.

551
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,250
What might this mutilated mess be?

552
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,000
It's my Christmas tree.

553
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,958
We just have to set it up.

554
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,157
It's as contrived as the creatures
that adorn your cottage.

555
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:33,625
Take me to the forest.
I will show you a real tree.

556
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,458
Fine.

557
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,791
[Christmas song playing]

558
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,666
Where I come from,
we adorn the tree
with candles and fruit.

559
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,250
Then come Christmas morn,

560
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,824
my brother and I would awake to find
an
orange and a halfpenny on our
bedclothes.

561
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,449
Orange and a halfpenny?
Guess no need for a gift receipt.

562
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:57,875
When I turned seven,
I apprenticed as a page boy.

563
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,237
I was fortunate Lord Ganley
was kind enough to allow me

564
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:01,855
to return home at Christmas each year.

565
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,500
- It must have been hard.
- It was all I knew.

566
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,824
Then at the age of 14, I became a squire

567
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:10,333
and was sent to Lord Townsend's castle
until the age of 21 when I was knighted.

568
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,958
Ah, this one looks hearty.

569
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,199
Yeah, it does.
I'll get one of the employees to help.

570
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:17,298
Nonsense.

571
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,518
What fun is fetching a Christmas tree

572
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,735
if you allow someone else
to do all of the fetching?

573
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,166
Oh.

574
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,541
[Brooke chuckles]

575
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,375
- [soft hit]
- Oh!

576
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,166
[Cole laughs]

577
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,916
If he can do it, I can do it.

578
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
Nice.

579
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,166
- Oh!
- [woman laughs]

580
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,750
You see that?

581
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,583
Brooke...

582
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,791
Might I ask you a personal question

583
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,916
regarding your dalliance with the
douche?

584
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,708
James?

585
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,416
Well, just how serious was it?

586
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,786
Because if he broke your
betrothal and ruined you,

587
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,842
I believe it is my quest
to see him run through.

588
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,458
No. He is not worth it.

589
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,157
Truth is I kind of knew he wasn't the
one.

590
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,407
I just kept hanging around, hoping

591
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,541
he would grow
into the man I wanted him to be.

592
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,574
But he caused you great distress.

593
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:23,750
Two years.
I tried everything but it wasn't enough.

594
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,657
Well, might I say he was a
boiled-brained
cod piece to choose any
other over you.

595
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:30,083
I... haven't heard that one before,

596
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,750
but... thanks.

597
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,833
A knight speaks the truth at all times.

598
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,541
Brooke, I was wondering if you might
be so gallant as to lend me your steed.

599
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,333
My car?

600
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,041
Hum...

601
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,041
So, you remember how to drive?

602
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,583
Certainly.

603
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,208
I've tamed all sorts of beasts in my
day.

604
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,333
[Cole grunts]

605
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,500
Yours is no different.

606
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,958
Well, okay, I guess.

607
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,166
Do you know where you're going?

608
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:05,041
Not exactly,
but I'm determined to find out.

609
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,666
[Brooke exhales]

610
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,291
Yeah, you... I don't think
you need the windshield wipers.

611
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,708
Got it.

612
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,041
[Cole cleans throat]

613
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,041
[honks]

614
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,583
Are you sure you remember how to drive?

615
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,458
Yes, just warming up.

616
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,916
He'll be fine. It's fine.

617
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,416
Old Crone.

618
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:40,916
Begging your pardon, my lady.

619
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:46,291
Hey, buddy. Can you maybe
stop calling my wife an "Old Crone?"

620
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,250
You look at little lost.

621
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,824
Indeed. I fear I'm no close
to becoming a true knight

622
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,625
than I was before the Crone sent me
here.

623
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,291
Crone?

624
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,824
A wise woman that presents herself
in various disguises

625
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,157
to test the heart of knights.

626
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:02,097
You must be one of those method actors.
You really get into our roles.

627
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,208
Well, a knight is always pure of heart.

628
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:09,750
Alas, I fear I am no close to
achieving
my quest than I was the moment
I got here.

629
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,740
I'd like to say
that it's the joy of Christmas

630
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,375
that reminds us of the faith we need
to sustain us throughout the year.

631
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,500
You know? Failure only happens
when you give up.

632
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:26,291
With hope and determination,
well, they fuel champions.

633
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,875
Verily.

634
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,115
Thank you for your wise counsel,
Father Christmas.

635
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:37,291
My pleasure.

636
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,750
Damn, I'm good.

637
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,333
- [kids shouting in excitement]
- Merry
Christmas! Let's see those lists!

638
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,958
- What? Oh, my gosh, there's so many.
- Yay! He's here!

639
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,041
Oh, good Lord.

640
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Cole.

641
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:21,365
Cole. Officer Stevens said he found my
car
abandoned on Main Street. What
happened?

642
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:22,465
Are you okay?

643
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,083
Alas, I...

644
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,125
fear I'm yet to discover my true quest.

645
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:33,625
What, as in fighting dragons
or pulling
magic swords out of the stone?

646
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,824
I fear you've watched
far too many pictures

647
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:37,541
on your magic box that makes merry.

648
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,875
A knight's true quest
challenges his innermost weakness.

649
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,500
Well, then what is your weakness?

650
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:54,282
I say this with you,
my lady, I do not know.

651
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:57,083
And I have only until
midnight Christmas Eve.

652
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,032
You know, growing up,
my father used to say,

653
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:04,625
you can achieve anything in life
if you want it badly enough.

654
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,916
Brooke, it is my sincerest vow.

655
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,666
I want this more than anything in life.

656
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,541
Then you have
nothing to worry about, Cole.

657
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,949
Christmas is still five days away

658
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:23,625
and I have no doubt
you will achieve your goal.

659
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,125
Your faith is much appreciated.

660
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Come on, let's go home.

661
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,166
Well, in that case, I...

662
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,490
best give you the reins to your steed.

663
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,208
I fear she's the loyal type
who answers only to you.

664
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Good thinking.

665
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,333
That cannot be my England.

666
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,791
It's a live-stream view
of the Tower of London.

667
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,916
That's an extraordinarily
large number of prisoners.

668
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,458
No, they're not prisoners.
They're tourists.

669
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,875
It's an attraction now.
People pay money to have a look around.

670
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,375
Honestly, what next?

671
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,583
[Brooke laughs]

672
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,833
Just hold that thought.

673
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,541
- Hello.
- Hello. Are these for me?

674
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:22,074
- Yeah.
- They're beautiful. Thank you.

675
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,240
Yeah, so we would have
brought you some cookies,

676
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,958
but someone decided
to share them with
half the neighborhood.

677
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,458
Well, that is what Christmas is all
about.

678
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,541
Are you really a knight?

679
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,157
Aye. I am.

680
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:35,699
Can girls be knights?

681
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:36,798
- No.
- Yes.

682
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,500
Girls can be whatever they wanna be.

683
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,250
Cool. Will you teach me
how to swordfight with a real sword?

684
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:47,958
I don't think so. You're too young
and it's too dangerous.

685
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,541
Well, fear not.

686
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,782
When I was her age,
we used to learn to fight

687
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:54,958
with sticks of wood
to avoid serious injury to life or limb.

688
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:59,907
Well, who is ready to get
this tree-trimming party in order?

689
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,007
- Yes.
- Me.

690
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,106
Let's go.

691
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:03,206
[both laughing]

692
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:07,500
Your grandma and grandpa
picked this up on their trip to Aldovia.

693
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,083
- Okay.
- [Cole cleans throat]

694
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,041
How is this?

695
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,333
She's leaning a little far to the right.

696
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,291
No.

697
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,166
That's perfect.

698
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:26,791
Aside from the fact that he
believes
that he's a knight from the
14th century,

699
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,250
I'd say Cole's the whole package.

700
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:30,833
Yeah.

701
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,041
No, but he... He is pretty convincing.

702
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,490
I'm sure once he gets his memory back,

703
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,699
we'll figure out that
he's just a medieval enthusiast.

704
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:41,798
[Brooke chuckles]

705
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,083
I don't know, Mads.

706
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:55,083
What if Cole really is who he says he
is?

707
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,708
Like what if there are things
beyond our comprehension?

708
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,166
What do you mean, like time travel?

709
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,449
Then I would say you both
need to get your heads examined.

710
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:07,548
[Brooke sighs]

711
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,708
I will say this about the guy...

712
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,791
he is very sweet and charming.

713
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,208
Yeah, I'd say.

714
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,458
We sure could use a whole lot
more Coles in this world.

715
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,365
I will drink to that.

716
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:24,625
- Cheers.
- [both chuckle]

717
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:27,625
Now remember,

718
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,125
always defend and protect your weak
side.

719
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:38,416
Okay, kiddo.
Time to say good night to
the good knight.

720
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,541
- Thank you.
- No.

721
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,708
Good night.

722
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,125
That's called a fist bump.

723
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:53,875
Yes, but we knights shake hands
to prove we're weapon-free.

724
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,125
- Good night. I love you.
- Love you, too.

725
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,125
- Good night.
- Good night.

726
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,666
- Good night.
- Good night.

727
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,875
[blade cutting air]

728
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,625
[soft thud]

729
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,500
Excuse me. Who started this fight?

730
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:37,449
Apologies, my lady Brooke.
I came out to get a little sparring in

731
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:39,467
and it appears I got
a little bit carried away.

732
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:40,567
Yeah, you think?

733
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,666
Looks like we've
got some cleaning up to do.

734
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,166
I wouldn't mind helping.

735
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,574
Of course not. Hi.

736
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:52,208
Hi. What do we have here?

737
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,666
Oh. Hum...

738
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:56,949
Well, Cole is one of the cosplay knights
at the Christmas Castle

739
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:59,291
and was just practicing his routine.

740
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,541
Good morn.

741
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,083
- Cole, this is my neighbor, Allyson.
- Charmed.

742
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:05,625
A pleasure.

743
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:08,001
Actually, I just popped by
to see if you're free tonight

744
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,858
to do some
Christmas caroling with friends.

745
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,324
While the... It is an honor,

746
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:18,907
I must respectfully decline,
as I'm previously committed.

747
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:20,166
Ah. Well,

748
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,291
another time, perhaps?

749
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,208
Perhaps.

750
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,583
Okay.

751
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,125
- Bye.
- Bye.

752
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,833
- See you.
- Toodle-pip.

753
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,291
[Brooke steps heavily]

754
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,166
Lady Allyson seems
to have you green with envy.

755
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,000
Okay. First off, she ain't no lady.

756
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,333
In high school,
she was voted Biggest Flirt.

757
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,833
Trust me, she's no damsel in distress.

758
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:50,125
And yet, she distresses
the damsel before me,

759
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,875
which is why I declined her invitation.

760
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,416
Since when are you previously committed?

761
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:59,041
Well, the moment a kind and fair maiden
opened her doors to me.

762
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,750
The scoundrel James did...

763
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,708
How would you put it?

764
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,000
Really did a number
on your self-esteem, babe.

765
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
[Brooke chuckles]

766
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:14,833
I don't know about that, but...

767
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,365
I mean, I guess I did walk away

768
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:20,666
with a few trust issues,
but how could I not?

769
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,541
A knight always keeps faith.

770
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,583
It's part of our code.

771
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,807
What else is part of your knight's code?

772
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,500
A knight is sworn to valor and virtue.

773
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,500
His blade defends the good,
and his might upholds the weak.

774
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,458
His temper shall be led by patience

775
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,208
and his kindness
will give aid to those who seek it.

776
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,990
I have a favor to ask.

777
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,074
I'm going to need
as much help as I can get

778
00:47:44,173 --> 00:47:45,972
to pull off this year's
Christmas Eve feast.

779
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,072
You in?

780
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,250
Indeed.

781
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,458
I'm at your service day or night.

782
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,240
Thanks for watching the little ones.

783
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,365
Oh, anytime. Excited to see
how the feast comes together.

784
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:58,465
Same here.

785
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,916
Will, Lily, behavior yourselves.

786
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:05,458
Hey kids, come on in soon
for some hot chocolate.

787
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,833
Where are your gloves?

788
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,541
They don't keep my hands warm.

789
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,916
Can't you ask your dad
to buy you new ones?

790
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,375
He gets really sad
when we ask for new things.

791
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,375
Here. You can have these. I have others.

792
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,791
I can?

793
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:24,875
Thanks.

794
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,536
<i>[Cole] So, how did this
charity event get started?</i>

795
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:34,166
<i>[Brooke] </i>As a kid, my mom and dad
hosted a Christmas Eve dinner each year

796
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,750
for friends and family
with nowhere else to go.

797
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,708
After they passed away,
I wanted to keep the tradition alive.

798
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,500
How altruistic.

799
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,574
Well, Christmas
is about giving back, right?

800
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,990
So, as the event continued to grow,

801
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,166
we started selling tickets
to donate profits to those in need.

802
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,282
- Hello.
- Oh, Eileen.

803
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:56,324
Please tell me that's what I think it
is.

804
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:58,115
Yes, my homemade peppermint bark.

805
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:02,083
And I made so much this year,
Fred suggested I rent a cement mixer.

806
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,208
[both laugh]

807
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,449
Where is Fred?
He's normally a staple at these events.

808
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:08,125
Yeah, he pulled his back,

809
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,282
and nothing seems
to be relieving the pain.

810
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:11,949
I swear we've tried everything.

811
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:14,833
Try wrapping his haunch bone
against a hot cloth.

812
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,333
Hot as he can bear it.

813
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:20,958
Then add a healthy dose
of boiled red ox
gall, pork fat and cumin.

814
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,949
Except that.

815
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:25,365
Eileen, this is Cole. He's not a doctor,

816
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,333
but comes from
the land of the holistic approach.

817
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,458
[Eileen gasps]

818
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:31,750
I assure you,
this remedy will allay the pain.

819
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,858
Knights have used it for centuries.

820
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,250
Well, I suppose I could give that a try.

821
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,000
Shouldn't hurt anything.

822
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:41,875
- Well, it looks good on my side.
- Okay. Hold it there.

823
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:45,750
All right.

824
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:50,333
- I can take that for you, Brooke.
- Oh, thank you, David.

825
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,625
You know, I'm so grateful
that you're here. I just...

826
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:56,875
I think it's so amazing
you find the time to volunteer.

827
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,666
I know you have your hands full.

828
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,958
I want my kids to know
it's important to give back.

829
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,750
You're a really good father.

830
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,833
His daughter is best friends with
Claire.

831
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,208
He's a good man.

832
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
[door closes]

833
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,699
Hey. I need to run to the market to
grab
a few things for the Christmas Eve
feast.

834
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:28,625
- Care to join me?
- Indeed.

835
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,125
Perfect.

836
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,333
Oh, no sword.

837
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,166
Just leave it.

838
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,875
This is truly a bounty
unlike anything I've ever seen.

839
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:49,750
Yeah. I suppose even I take for granted
how lucky we are.

840
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:56,041
Where I come from, markets
consist of game, vegetables and bread.

841
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:07,324
This must be that delicious mead
I've grown so fond of.

842
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:08,708
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

843
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,000
[Brooke chuckles]

844
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:13,375
But, Cole, we only need one.

845
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,375
I'm not hunkering down for the winter.

846
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,240
What else? Where is bread?

847
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,340
Oh... I...

848
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,458
We're just...

849
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,125
Well...

850
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,074
You really love that hot chocolate.

851
00:51:38,173 --> 00:51:39,625
Here it is.

852
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:44,375
Why don't you grab eight bags
of dinner rolls? Right there.

853
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,744
You can never have too many.

854
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,000
Miss Winters.

855
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,458
Well, hello, Paige.

856
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,740
Getting ready
for the Christmas feast, I see.

857
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
I'm trying to.

858
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,958
Are you feeling any better
since last time we talked?

859
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,166
Much.

860
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:01,032
I've been thinking a lot
about our conversation,

861
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,833
and I'm really gonna try hard
to focus on my goals.

862
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,532
And I was thinking maybe,

863
00:52:07,632 --> 00:52:11,583
you can give me an extra credit
assignment
to help bring up my midterm.

864
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,583
I'm sure we can figure out something.

865
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,583
- Thank you.
- Of course.

866
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,074
- Okay. Good luck with the feast.
- Thanks.

867
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,416
- Bye.
- Bye.

868
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,791
Cole? Cole,

869
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,333
I said eight bags and nothing
about sampling them first.

870
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,355
You can't serve that to your guests.
It tastes like cockhead.

871
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,125
Okay. Well, then what do you suggest?

872
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:43,375
Guide me down the path
containing flour, yeast and butter.

873
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,699
You know, I'm really not the best cook,

874
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:47,838
so why don't we just
stick to the next best thing?

875
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:52,625
That would be me. I am a butcher,
baker, a candlestick maker.

876
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,750
Of course you are.

877
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,949
Mom, can Lily and I
go play outside in the snow?

878
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:03,875
Oh, I don't know you guys.
It's snowing pretty hard.

879
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,166
Please? Just for a while.

880
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,208
Claire's gonna teach me
how to fight like a knight.

881
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,074
Okay, fine.

882
00:53:12,173 --> 00:53:15,541
What's a little play date
without a little sword play, right?

883
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,958
Hey. Hey, you, come back.

884
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,074
Where are your red gloves?

885
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:22,583
I gave them to Lily,
because she didn't have any.

886
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,375
That was very sweet of you, Claire.

887
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,500
Any mismatches? Yes.

888
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,416
Here you go.

889
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,041
<i>VoilÃ .</i>

890
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:37,791
Okay.

891
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,125
- Bye.
- Stay close, please.

892
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,250
[door closes]

893
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,041
Where did you learn how to bake?

894
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,708
As a squire,
I was assigned for a time
to the kitchens.

895
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,824
Griselda, the baker,
was a harsh taskmaster,

896
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:53,541
but I learned much at her side.

897
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:55,333
How long did you work in the kitchens?

898
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,375
A couple of years.

899
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,708
It was there I honed
my fencing and fighting skills,

900
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,791
and learned to play the lute.

901
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,541
You really are a Renaissance man,
aren't you?

902
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:11,541
Jeez. It's turning out to be
a real blizzard out there.

903
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,458
Now comes the magic ingredient.

904
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,916
Can't have yuletide bean bread

905
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:19,875
without the bean.

906
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,500
But does it add flavor?

907
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:23,958
Not at all.

908
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:27,250
Legend has it the one who finds the bean

909
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:30,585
is crowned king or queen of the feast
and gets to make a Christmas wish.

910
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,865
But the dough will fail to rise

911
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:39,375
if you continue to wrest it
like a dragon slayer.

912
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,125
See?

913
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,291
Not so difficult.

914
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:55,458
No. Not so difficult at all.

915
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,000
[phone ringing]

916
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,458
Oh, it's my sister.

917
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,083
Hey, Mads, what's up?

918
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,708
Okay, calm down.

919
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:08,646
- We'll be there in a minute.
- What's wrong?

920
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,125
Claire is missing.

921
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,532
David and Officer Stevens
are out looking for them,

922
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:28,188
and they told me to stay close
in case they come back, but I...

923
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:29,958
It's okay. They couldn't have gone far.

924
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:31,875
It's okay.

925
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,750
It appears they went this way.

926
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:40,791
Don't worry, I pledge
to bring them back safe and sound.

927
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Claire!

928
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,458
- Lily!
- They went this way.

929
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:53,791
Are you sure?

930
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,978
I spent much of my life
riding and tracking through the woods.

931
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,577
The signs are always there
if you look close enough.

932
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,333
That's a fresh mark from a glove.

933
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:03,458
Claire!

934
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,708
Claire knows not to come
to Blue Limestone unsupervised.

935
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,333
Claire!

936
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:10,431
Lily!

937
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,583
Oh, no.

938
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:15,166
Not the lake.

939
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
- There.
- Help!

940
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,449
- Help!
- Lily, we're coming!

941
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:24,548
Help!

942
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:31,208
- There you go, lassie.
- Lily, what happened?

943
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,240
Claire and I got lost,

944
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,875
and Claire slipped on the ice,
and it cracked.

945
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:37,291
Claire!

946
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:38,389
I'm scared.

947
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,666
[ice cracks]

948
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,750
No.

949
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,916
Listen to me very carefully.

950
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,833
I need you to stay where you are.

951
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,416
Cole, be careful.

952
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,490
- Do not fear.
- The ice.

953
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,833
Claire, have you ever seen a snail?

954
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,583
Yes.

955
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,157
Now, I need you
to pretend you're a snail right now

956
00:57:00,257 --> 00:57:02,500
and crawl slowly on your belly to me.

957
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,083
Slower, little snail.

958
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,666
I need you to be the slowest snail
that ever crawled the earth.

959
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:26,666
That's it.

960
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,583
That's it. Almost there.

961
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,375
That's it.

962
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:36,541
I've got you.

963
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,458
Be careful now.

964
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,375
[Brooke pants in relief]

965
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,240
Claire, your mother is frantic.

966
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,199
Aunt Brooke, I'm so sorry.
We got lost in the snow.

967
00:57:59,298 --> 00:58:00,750
It's okay. We found you.

968
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:04,541
It's okay.

969
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,583
Let's get the young'uns home.

970
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,740
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

971
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,708
I'd like to say this about you, Sir
Cole.

972
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:16,541
What you did today
was pretty valiant and heroic.

973
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:20,333
So, now you see my duty is similar
to yours, as I now understand.

974
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,291
To protect and serve.

975
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,416
Right.

976
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:25,875
Yes.

977
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,875
Lily's dad wanted to thank you
for coming to our rescue.

978
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh, it would be my honor.

979
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,041
Well, it certainly looks like
his memory's not coming back.

980
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,750
No, I guess not.

981
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:47,291
But who are we to tell him
he's not who he says he is?

982
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,625
Maybe.

983
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,365
But do you really think going along
with this little delusion

984
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:52,583
is helping the situation?

985
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,708
It certainly did today.

986
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,916
Congratulations.

987
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,041
For finally fulfilling your quest.

988
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:05,166
I guess now you can return home for
you brother's ceremony as a true knight.

989
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,458
I think not.

990
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,291
But if it wasn't for you, then...

991
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,583
Today may have been a small act of
valor,

992
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,541
but I fear not enough to fulfill my
quest.

993
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:20,250
I don't get it. What is it going to
take?

994
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,416
The Crone spoke in riddles.

995
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,865
It had something to do with my heart.

996
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:27,208
Unless I can find
meaning in that, well, I...

997
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:29,791
could be stuck here forever.

998
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:32,375
Would that be so bad?

999
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, I might have thought so before...

1000
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,125
[door opens]

1001
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,532
Evan, you're home.

1002
00:59:46,632 --> 00:59:48,166
Yes, we settled the case.

1003
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:51,458
and when I got off the plane,
I had dozens of voicemails from Madison.

1004
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,666
This is Cole, a new family friend.

1005
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:55,833
Nice to meet you, Cole.

1006
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:57,458
And you.

1007
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:58,990
We were just on our way out.

1008
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,851
Madison's upstairs
putting Claire to sleep.

1009
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,291
She'll fill you in.

1010
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,074
Perfect. Any chance
that you can hide these at your house?

1011
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:07,699
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1012
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:08,798
[Brooke chuckles]

1013
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,625
- Claire's a snoop, huh?
- No, your sister is.

1014
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,666
Can you believe it?
Christmas Eve is tomorrow.

1015
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,375
[Evan laughs]

1016
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,500
I don't understand. Why are we here?

1017
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,318
I've been here twice already
and both times come up empty.

1018
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,875
Maybe you just need a fresh set of eyes.

1019
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,157
Look, the Crone
sent you here for a reason,

1020
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:33,583
so there must be
something quest worthy.

1021
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,750
I don't understand.
Then how is a prospective suitor

1022
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,083
supposed to prove
his worthiness to a lady?

1023
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,250
I don't know.

1024
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,833
But I will let you know
the minute I find out.

1025
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:47,916
I'll say this.

1026
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,958
Romance in the future
is much more complex than days of yore.

1027
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:56,750
Well, if it means anything,
I prefer yore over mine.

1028
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:02,490
Two hours, two hot cocoas,
and yet nary a quest in sight.

1029
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,208
My bad. I figured it was worth a shot.

1030
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,907
Hello. I was just on my way
to get one of those.

1031
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:09,750
Oh, you should. They're delicious.

1032
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,541
He loves them.

1033
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,041
Pickpocket!

1034
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,833
Stop, thief! Quick! Lend me your sword.

1035
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,416
It's only rubber!

1036
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,949
Return the lady's purse
or suffer the consequences.

1037
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:28,125
Take it.

1038
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,458
Where I come from, thieves
are strung up by their thumbs and hung,

1039
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,987
or we save the hangman the rope

1040
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:35,128
and cut off his hands
so he can never steal again.

1041
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,704
I believe this is for you.

1042
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:39,125
Oh, thank you.

1043
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:40,782
Wait, Bruce Douglas?

1044
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:42,083
Well, what do you think?

1045
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,740
- Should we let him keep his hands?
- Yeah.

1046
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,791
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1047
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,817
Do you understand your rights
as they've been read to you?

1048
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,791
Yeah, just keep
that crazy sword guy away from me.

1049
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:00,541
Well, you're turning into quite
the natural at this game, Cole.

1050
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,250
[Officer laughs]

1051
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:08,541
You know, you should
consider joining the force.

1052
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:12,375
It would be an honor
to ride and serve alongside you.

1053
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,375
Of course you'd have to pass
the psych exam first.

1054
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,875
Well, I shall study for it night and day
until I'm well prepared.

1055
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,208
Right.

1056
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,250
Right.

1057
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,083
Good job.

1058
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,333
Thank you, Brooke.

1059
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,916
I don't know. I'm just
beginning to wonder what I'm doing here.

1060
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:44,208
I just... I don't get it, Cole.

1061
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:47,782
You mean to tell me
that single-handedly capturing a thief

1062
01:02:47,882 --> 01:02:49,166
still isn't quest worthy?

1063
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,909
I'm beginning to wonder whether being
a true knight is my destiny after all.

1064
01:02:53,009 --> 01:02:54,009
Wow!

1065
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:57,875
Okay, hold on. I'm calling
a big timeout on that negativity.

1066
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,416
Look.

1067
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:03,416
You promised me
you wouldn't give up faith.

1068
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,625
And it ain't over
until the Old Crone sings.

1069
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,958
I believe in you, Cole.

1070
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,291
Never were there
four little words that managed

1071
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:19,833
to wrap my weary heart
into a warm blanket.

1072
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,083
Thank you, Brooke.

1073
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

1074
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:39,875
[Brooke exhales]

1075
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:52,449
Lady Alexa Play, play "Deck the Halls".

1076
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:53,958
<i>[Alexa] Here's "Deck the Halls".</i>

1077
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,282
["Deck the Halls" by Nat King Cole
playing]

1078
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:58,375
[Cole vocalizes together]

1079
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,833
You know, this place is lucky
to see me microwave ramen.

1080
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:09,416
Thank you.

1081
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,791
I can't remember
the last time it smelt so homey.

1082
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:15,449
This all brings me right back to my
youth.

1083
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:16,548
Really?

1084
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,324
That's an amazing youth.

1085
01:04:18,423 --> 01:04:21,083
Oh, wow. Look at you two.

1086
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,583
Well, I don't want to interrupt.

1087
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:27,291
I just wanted to bring you this
to show our appreciation.

1088
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,708
And here is your suit for tonight.

1089
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:32,958
It's mead.

1090
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,500
- Madison, that's so thoughtful.
- Thank you.

1091
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,125
I'm learning from my little one.

1092
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,409
Hey, do you know that the other day
she gave her mittens to David's daughter

1093
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:43,625
- 'cause the poor thing didn't have any?
- What?

1094
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,416
Claire has a kind heart.

1095
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,750
Like her aunt, like her mother.

1096
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:52,333
You know, David's wife passed away
last year after a long illness.

1097
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,365
He has four young kids
and holds down two jobs

1098
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:57,208
just to keep a roof over their heads.

1099
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,907
That's truly a tale of woe.

1100
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,532
Yeah, and still after all that
he makes time to volunteer

1101
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:04,958
because he wants his kids to know
how important it is to give back.

1102
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,625
He sounds like a man of pure heart.

1103
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,625
Perhaps that's what the Old Crone
meant by her riddle.

1104
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,083
What?

1105
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,333
Maybe I found my quest after all.

1106
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,041
This fancy neck ribbon
seems more like a torture device.

1107
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:35,833
[Brooke chuckles]

1108
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:37,291
Perhaps I can help.

1109
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,625
What's wrong?

1110
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,291
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1111
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,500
It's just you look...

1112
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,083
positively radiant.

1113
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,625
Why, thank you.

1114
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:58,291
And you, my knight
in shining cashmere wool blend...

1115
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,333
Well, the costume fits okay.

1116
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,250
I'm having a little trouble
with the neck ribbon.

1117
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:05,875
[Brooke giggles]

1118
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,791
It's called a tie. Here.

1119
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,934
I actually have no idea what I'm doing.

1120
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:24,791
[Both chuckle]

1121
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,708
I have something for you. Stay here.

1122
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,541
Okay. Close your eyes
and hold out your hand.

1123
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,208
I've played this game once with my
brother
and I got slimed by a toad.

1124
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:41,916
It's not a toad. I promise.
Just... Come on.

1125
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,458
Okay. Open them.

1126
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,250
[Cole chuckles softly]

1127
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,208
It's an orange.

1128
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:55,958
You remembered.

1129
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:01,708
And we don't use halfpennies anymore,
but that's an American half dollar.

1130
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:11,333
This means more to me
than words can express.

1131
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:16,250
Thank you, Brooke.

1132
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,583
[phone chimes]

1133
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,875
Wow. A text in all caps!

1134
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,500
- We should go.
- Okay.

1135
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,666
["Jingle Bells" by The Miracles playing]

1136
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,532
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

1137
01:07:43,632 --> 01:07:45,657
And I just wanted to tell you

1138
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:48,324
that your yuletide bread
is the hit of the feast.

1139
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:51,125
Well, thank you.
It's an old family recipe.

1140
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:54,782
Legend has it, the one
who finds the bean gets to make a wish.

1141
01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:57,041
Oh. Well, I'll be on the lookout.

1142
01:07:57,333 --> 01:08:00,949
And how is your husband's aching back?
I trust my ointment did the trick.

1143
01:08:01,048 --> 01:08:04,291
I'll say. Yeah... Here he comes. Just...

1144
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,458
Just tell me how to hit the off button.

1145
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,833
Okay, Fred. All right.

1146
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,916
- Merry Christmas Eve.
- Merry Christmas Eve.

1147
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,283
You look beautiful.

1148
01:08:17,382 --> 01:08:19,739
- Oh, thank you. So do you.
- Come here, you son of a gun.

1149
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,840
[Cole grunts]

1150
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:24,323
Is this some kind of
Christmas wrestling tradition?

1151
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:27,115
I'm guessing Evan found out
how you saved his daughter yesterday

1152
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:29,082
and just wants to thank you.

1153
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,500
You're very welcome, sir.

1154
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,332
- I think we should get things started.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1155
01:08:38,957 --> 01:08:42,707
Welcome everyone
to this year's Christmas Eve feast.

1156
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,448
My mom and dad used to say that

1157
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:49,625
Christmas spirit is about
kindness and compassion towards others.

1158
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,783
And never has that sentiment

1159
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:55,707
been more true than
at this year's Christmas Eve feast.

1160
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:56,916
Enjoy, everyone!

1161
01:08:57,015 --> 01:08:59,000
[people clapping]

1162
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,457
I wish we had a Christmas tree like
this.

1163
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:11,166
Yeah, but what's the best thing
under any Christmas tree?

1164
01:09:11,332 --> 01:09:13,291
- Love.
- That's right.

1165
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,198
David, if you'd all come with me.

1166
01:09:16,298 --> 01:09:17,625
Come on, guys. Come on.

1167
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,250
What's going on?

1168
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,957
Will, Lily, Taylor, Reed,

1169
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,291
I understand you've
all been quite good this year.

1170
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,541
Yes, it appears this year
Father Christmas,

1171
01:09:37,082 --> 01:09:38,875
Santa made a slight miscalculation.

1172
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:43,832
Well, he accidentally
brought all of your presents here

1173
01:09:44,082 --> 01:09:45,291
rather than your home.

1174
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,707
That's... That's for us?

1175
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:50,750
Yes, they are.
Get in there. Open them up.

1176
01:09:53,582 --> 01:09:54,582
Cool.

1177
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,416
Dad. Santa brought me a new bike.

1178
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,125
Daddy, look, a new coat and new boots.

1179
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:04,166
And... this is for you.

1180
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,073
Oh, no. I can't accept. This is too
much.

1181
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,283
No, this is what the feast is all about.

1182
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:16,041
That's why the whole town pitched in
with presents, so that your kids and you

1183
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,291
can have an extra
special Christmas this year.

1184
01:10:19,957 --> 01:10:21,041
I don't know what to say.

1185
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,457
I know times are hard right now.
And we're here for you.

1186
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Thank you.

1187
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,957
I promise to pay it forward when I can.

1188
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:31,957
Well, from my eyes,

1189
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,666
you already have.

1190
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:43,250
We did good, Cole.

1191
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:45,791
Surely your quest is completed now.

1192
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,332
Well, I have one more promise to keep.

1193
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:51,000
It appears we have
a nonbeliever in our midst.

1194
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,332
A problem I plan on remedying posthaste.

1195
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,500
Well, alrighty then.

1196
01:10:58,582 --> 01:11:00,582
[kids laughing]

1197
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,832
See? I told you he was a real knight.

1198
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:08,082
Wow!

1199
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,332
Look over here, kids.

1200
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:16,541
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1201
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:20,365
Okay. Boys, come on.
Let's give somebody else a turn.

1202
01:11:20,466 --> 01:11:21,466
Come on.

1203
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:22,916
Come on.

1204
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,250
Face that way.

1205
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:30,000
- Okay, squeeze in.
- Crowd in.

1206
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,791
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1207
01:11:32,832 --> 01:11:34,332
There we are.

1208
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,698
Perhaps someone else
should care for a selfie?

1209
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:40,000
I certainly wouldn't
turn down an invitation.

1210
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:43,082
Look, Cole, mistletoe.

1211
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,666
You know what that means?

1212
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:47,457
The dung plant
that wards off evil spirits?

1213
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:51,457
No, silly. It's tradition to kiss
if you're caught under the mistletoe.

1214
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:53,250
Bad luck if you don't.

1215
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:05,291
Something tells me you should save this
for someone you really care about.

1216
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:09,041
Merry Christmas.

1217
01:12:10,332 --> 01:12:11,332
And to you.

1218
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:42,323
Hey. Hon, we'd love to help you clean
up,
but we got to get this little one to
bed.

1219
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:43,490
- Of course.
- Yes.

1220
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,323
And I've gotta practice my surprise face

1221
01:12:45,423 --> 01:12:48,323
when I open up the box of slippers
Madison got me for Christmas.

1222
01:12:48,423 --> 01:12:50,250
- They're not slippers.
- Yeah, I figured.

1223
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,375
[both laugh]

1224
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:52,625
Sleep tight, kiddo.

1225
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,908
Oh, Brooke, we've got this handled.
You enjoy the rest of your evening.

1226
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,408
Oh, Eileen, you're the best.

1227
01:13:00,507 --> 01:13:02,387
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, sweetie.

1228
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,291
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1229
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,041
I'll see you guys.

1230
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,140
I'll see you guys.

1231
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:10,375
[Brooke laughs]

1232
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,291
You summoned me, sire?

1233
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:20,698
Indeed. I was hoping
you might enlighten me

1234
01:13:20,798 --> 01:13:22,783
on the fact of a certain
Christmas tradition.

1235
01:13:22,882 --> 01:13:24,250
Oh. Okay.

1236
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:30,448
From what I gather,
it's bad luck if a couple don't kiss

1237
01:13:30,548 --> 01:13:32,291
whence they find themselves underneath
it.

1238
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,332
Oh, well, it's probably
just some silly old wives' tale.

1239
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,582
But why risk it?

1240
01:13:58,582 --> 01:13:59,666
Cole, your medallion.

1241
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:01,875
The Old Crone.

1242
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,457
Well, what does it mean?

1243
01:14:03,957 --> 01:14:07,041
Well, it means we must go.
Come. Quick.
Take me to your trusty steed.

1244
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:13,115
This is where I arrived,
so it must be my way back.

1245
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:14,250
Back where?

1246
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,707
Well, back to my home.

1247
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,332
Oh, well,
then you've fulfilled your quest.

1248
01:14:24,207 --> 01:14:25,582
You're a true knight?

1249
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:30,000
Well, I should be forever grateful to
you.

1250
01:14:31,457 --> 01:14:34,291
While my heart
is heavy saying goodbye, I...

1251
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,408
I have no choice.

1252
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,625
I must return home for my brother's
knighting ceremony. It's...

1253
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:43,791
It's my duty.

1254
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,791
No, I understand.
It's the knight's code. You have to go.

1255
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,541
No matter what...

1256
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,541
no matter where I am...

1257
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:58,166
I hereby pledge my service to thee.

1258
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,457
You're not making this easy, Cole.

1259
01:15:06,332 --> 01:15:07,957
You helped me believe in myself.

1260
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:11,332
For that,

1261
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:13,832
you'll forever be in my heart.

1262
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:25,291
Fare thee well, my Lady Brooke.

1263
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,832
Goodbye, Sir Cole.

1264
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:49,207
Cole?

1265
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:52,240
What? Cole?

1266
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,041
Miss Winters.

1267
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:19,000
You will never believe what happened.

1268
01:16:19,582 --> 01:16:21,948
Grayson is begging me to take him back.

1269
01:16:22,048 --> 01:16:23,457
- Oh?
- Right?

1270
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,291
I told him to forget it,

1271
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,541
because true love
only exists in fairy tales.

1272
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:33,082
And from now on,
I'm only focusing on my goals.

1273
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,166
Paige, I was wrong.

1274
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,158
But you said...

1275
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:41,207
No, not about your goals. That's good.

1276
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,916
But about true love.

1277
01:16:44,957 --> 01:16:46,125
It does exist.

1278
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:48,666
Really?

1279
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:52,000
You know, it may not
come around that often, but...

1280
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,750
when it does, you'll recognize it.

1281
01:16:57,125 --> 01:17:00,698
When someone loves you
completely for who you are,

1282
01:17:00,798 --> 01:17:03,791
and you want what's best
for them, too, even...

1283
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:07,957
Even if it means it's not with you.

1284
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,082
Oh, sorry.

1285
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,375
That's okay.

1286
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,500
Okay.

1287
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,750
- Merry Christmas, Miss Winters.
- Merry Christmas to you, too, Paige.

1288
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:22,707
Bye.

1289
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,875
[song playing]

1290
01:18:06,207 --> 01:18:08,207
[Brooke sighs and gasps]

1291
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,875
The magic bean.

1292
01:18:15,332 --> 01:18:17,166
I wish Cole was still here.

1293
01:18:42,207 --> 01:18:43,408
[sobs]

1294
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,750
- My lord.
- Yes?

1295
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:02,875
Sherwyn!

1296
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,457
[horse galloping]

1297
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,390
Sherwyn!

1298
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:20,125
[horse neighing]

1299
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,125
[horse neighs]

1300
01:19:26,707 --> 01:19:27,707
Brother?

1301
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,750
Geoffrey.

1302
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:35,908
Your horse returned without you days
ago.

1303
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:38,568
We searched and searched
but feared you were lost in the storm.

1304
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:39,916
I was, yes.

1305
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:41,916
Lost.

1306
01:19:42,015 --> 01:19:44,414
The ceremony should begin soon,
then I shall seek my quest.

1307
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,125
I made it back in time.

1308
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:50,033
If I may offer you some advice.

1309
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:51,132
By all means.

1310
01:19:51,457 --> 01:19:52,707
Be kind to all you meet.

1311
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,615
It was a crone who urged me

1312
01:19:54,716 --> 01:19:58,666
to seek my quest with my heart,
that a true knight could emerge.

1313
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,457
And are you a true knight?

1314
01:20:01,582 --> 01:20:02,582
I am.

1315
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,582
Huzzah! Then let us celebrate
over a tankard of ale.

1316
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Alas...

1317
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:11,332
my heart also led me to my lady Brooke.

1318
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:15,125
You're in love.

1319
01:20:15,957 --> 01:20:17,166
I can see it on your face.

1320
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,957
I believe so, yes.

1321
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,375
I was a fool to have left her.

1322
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:26,791
What is this?

1323
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,375
My weakness was not realizing sooner.

1324
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,291
You must go to her.

1325
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:34,948
But your knighting ceremony.

1326
01:20:35,048 --> 01:20:38,666
Is of no importance
in comparison to matters of the heart.

1327
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:42,740
I wish you well, always.

1328
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:43,875
I carry you with me.

1329
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,291
I carry you with me.

1330
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:55,875
Away with you.

1331
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,750
Go, find your fair lady Brooke.

1332
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:02,957
If you're sure.

1333
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:04,875
I am.

1334
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,541
Good luck with the ceremony.

1335
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,207
It's Christmas! Santa came.

1336
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,041
[Mads chuckles]

1337
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:26,082
Where's my stocking?

1338
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,908
- It was there last night.
- Yeah, that's strange.

1339
01:21:30,007 --> 01:21:31,007
Where is it?

1340
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,375
It's a puppy!

1341
01:21:35,332 --> 01:21:36,332
[dog cries]

1342
01:21:36,431 --> 01:21:38,033
What... Did you...

1343
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:39,957
No. Did you?

1344
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,666
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

1345
01:21:46,207 --> 01:21:47,457
Merry Christmas!

1346
01:21:47,707 --> 01:21:50,250
Aunt Brooke, you'll never believe
what Santa brought me.

1347
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,500
A puppy.

1348
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:54,291
Wow. Really?

1349
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:58,323
Yeah, you don't happen to know
anything about this, do you?

1350
01:21:58,423 --> 01:21:59,573
No, why?

1351
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:02,541
Because neither do we.
Which means there's no explanation.

1352
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yes, there is.

1353
01:22:04,582 --> 01:22:05,791
Christmas magic.

1354
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:08,865
You swear you had nothing to do

1355
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:09,966
- with this puppy?
- No.

1356
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:13,125
So, Claire is right
and it's Christmas magic?

1357
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:17,283
Well, just because you can't
explain something logically,

1358
01:22:17,382 --> 01:22:18,582
doesn't mean it can't happen.

1359
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:23,573
Like your time-traveling knight.
Where is he, by the way?

1360
01:22:23,673 --> 01:22:25,707
He's... gone home.

1361
01:22:27,082 --> 01:22:30,291
I... I don't think
I'll ever see him again.

1362
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:32,582
Oh, honey,

1363
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm so sorry.

1364
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:37,875
I thought you two
had something really special.

1365
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah, so did I.

1366
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,740
Brooke, merry Christmas.

1367
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,041
Merry Christmas.

1368
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,832
- All right.
- Thanks.

1369
01:22:48,957 --> 01:22:50,166
- All right.
- Thanks.

1370
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:53,533
- You ready to open up some presents?
- And later,

1371
01:22:53,632 --> 01:22:56,865
Daddy's going to take us back
to the Christmas Castle. Wanna come?

1372
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:58,740
- I...
- I know you're not feeling it,

1373
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:02,533
but it's Christmas.

1374
01:23:02,632 --> 01:23:04,625
[both laughing]

1375
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:09,582
[Cole] Crone!

1376
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,750
Crone!

1377
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:21,875
Crone!

1378
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,250
Crone! Old Crone!

1379
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,750
I have need of you.

1380
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,875
Love is the first and foremost
of all knightly virtues.

1381
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:34,875
I understand that now.

1382
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,416
It's love.

1383
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:43,707
I beg thee, Crone.

1384
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:46,250
Whatever it is that you desire,

1385
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:47,875
I will do...

1386
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:50,707
if you help me return to my truest love.

1387
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:56,125
Please.

1388
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:58,832
Very well.

1389
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,457
You have proven yourself worthy.

1390
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:08,582
[people chattering]

1391
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:15,783
While I may never understand
our Christmas miracle pup,

1392
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:18,957
I have to admit, he's growing on me.

1393
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:21,832
Hey, that's not a half bad name for him.

1394
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,125
Miracle. What do you think
about that, Claire?

1395
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:27,291
I already named him. Knight.

1396
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:30,457
- What do you think, Aunt Brooke?
- It's perfect.

1397
01:24:31,582 --> 01:24:34,041
Where's Cole?
I thought he was going to join us.

1398
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,916
Oh, yeah, sweetie.
He had to leave last night.

1399
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:39,500
Why? I thought he liked it here.

1400
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:40,625
Oh, he did.

1401
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,666
He really did, but...

1402
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,416
his calling was far, far away.

1403
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,166
What's a calling?

1404
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,457
It's a job. Like the business trip
Daddy just went on.

1405
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:53,332
Oh. Then he's coming back then. Right?

1406
01:24:56,082 --> 01:24:57,332
I don't know, Claire Bear.

1407
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,698
Hey, but I do know
we sure had fun while he was here.

1408
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:03,798
Right?

1409
01:25:07,707 --> 01:25:08,707
It's Cole!

1410
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:10,916
And he brought his horse.

1411
01:25:11,457 --> 01:25:14,000
- Delighting in your company.
- Cole, I thought you were gone,

1412
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:15,707
like, for good.

1413
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,500
Brooke, I should have realized it
sooner,

1414
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:20,707
you are my quest.

1415
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,250
- I'm your quest?
- Yes.

1416
01:25:24,582 --> 01:25:26,082
And my heart is

1417
01:25:26,957 --> 01:25:28,666
eternally and devotedly yours.

1418
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:31,541
If you will have me.

1419
01:25:32,957 --> 01:25:35,041
Nothing would make me happier,

1420
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,332
my handsome knight.

1421
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:39,625
My fair maiden.

1422
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,750
You are going to miss being a knight.

1423
01:25:55,457 --> 01:25:56,750
What will you do here?

1424
01:25:57,291 --> 01:26:00,166
Perhaps I'll join Officer Stevens
and his order of present-day knights.

1425
01:26:00,832 --> 01:26:02,082
Or open my own bakery.

1426
01:26:04,082 --> 01:26:06,125
I can't believe you came back for me.

1427
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,250
Wherever you are,

1428
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:10,916
it's the only place I want to be.

1429
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,332
[horse neighs]

1430
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:28,416
I found Sherwyn.

1431
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:29,707
Hi, Sherwyn.

1432
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:38,750
- Wanna come for a ride?
- Sure.

1433
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,416
Huzzah! To the quest!

1434
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:37,791
Come.

1435
01:27:40,082 --> 01:27:42,082
Lord Seamus will get the door.

1436
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,166
You truly are a handsome young knight.

1437
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:54,541
Pray you help one as beauteous as
myself?

1438
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,375
One moment.

1439
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:03,791
Sir Geoffrey Alexander Edward Lyons
at your service.
