1
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,387
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,351
Josh! Sorry l'm late.

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,518
That's all right.

4
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,313
Office holiday breakfast.

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,231
You guys have parties
at 1 0:30 in the morning?

6
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,316
Less liability.

7
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,567
Apparently, people don't
get drunk before noon.

8
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,319
lt's boring as shooot.

9
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,448
-But the partners want us there, so...
-Sure.

10
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,159
Anyways, after a year of negotiation,
your divorce is finalized.

11
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,120
These are the terms we agreed to.

12
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,748
The alimony, the house. Sorry.

13
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,334
Don't worry about it. lt's only money.

14
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,503
lt is only

15
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,921
all of the money.

16
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,424
But it's the season for giving, right?

17
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,301
l know how you feel.

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,302
Yeah? l didn't know you were divorced.

19
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,097
God, no. That'd be crushing.

20
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,682
But l get it.

21
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,141
On one level, it must seem like,

22
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,727
"l'm signing away
a huge chunk of my life

23
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,271
"that l'm never getting back."

24
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,191
That's it? No other level?

25
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,527
No, that's it. lnitials.

26
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,780
Hey. There are good things
ahead for you, okay?

27
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,156
-Yeah.
-Come here.

28
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,366
-Thank you. Thanks, buddy.
-Merry Christmas.

29
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,661
-Hey, what's this?
-My final bill's in there.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,996
-ls it?
-Also my holiday card.

31
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,331
The wife had me and the kids dress up

32
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,332
like members of One Direction.
Pretty fun.

33
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,628
Dynamite.

34
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,731
Yes, Mom, it is all done. l am divorced.

35
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,235
Well, you should tell Dad

36
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,653
that she is not coming over
for Christmas.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,574
Why? Because we're divorced, Mom!

38
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,287
Well... Mom, don't worry about that.
l'm still gonna be fun.

39
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,872
l'm still gonna be
fun Uncle Josh, you know?

40
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,209
Yeah. Well, without doing that...

41
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,545
No, you can leave
the Santa suit in the attic.

42
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,173
Why? Because l'm an adult

43
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,341
and dressing up as Santa Claus
would be embarrassing.

44
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,138
Hi. Unless, you know,
you're doing it for charity.

45
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,432
Then it's... Then it's... Sorry.

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,144
Tell Dad that l love... That's lucky.

47
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,687
Just put me down for five bucks, okay?

48
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,022
Hanging up, Mom.

49
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,759
Hey, Carla, good morning.

50
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,385
You see something over there?
What do you got?

51
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,552
l think that Starbucks

52
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,222
-attracts a bad element, Josh.
-Yeah.

53
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,848
Listen. Give me the green light
and l'll shut it down.

54
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,060
l love that initiative. lt's awesome.

55
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,937
Could you sign me in
real quick, please?

56
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,687
l wish l could,
but they got us sending you

57
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,272
through these machines now.

58
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,817
Gonna replace my ass, matter of time.

59
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,901
That's never gonna happen.

60
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,236
These machines
don't have your smile, Carla.

61
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,239
Make that money!

62
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,828
Josh, we have a situation.

63
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,163
Mary! How do you always just appear?

64
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,705
You're like a human pop-up ad.

65
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,167
Did you read my latest memo
on appropriate work dress?

66
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,002
Almost done. Don't ruin the end.

67
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,420
Well, some people didn't.
And those people are Meghan.

68
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,339
Nobody listens to H.R.

69
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,925
Hey, Meghan?

70
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,261
l thought that l have been clear about

71
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,389
the number of buttons that
can be unbuttoned on a shirt.

72
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,557
-You were serious about that?
-lt's winter.

73
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,519
Can we put Dancer and Prancer
back in their stable?

74
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,312
Are you body-shaming her right now?

75
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,064
Some people here

76
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,608
might find your outfit offensive.

77
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,028
Well, some people might
find your outfit offensive.

78
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,654
And really confusing.

79
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:41,865
l thought it was clear.

80
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,449
This is a multi-denominational
holiday sweater.

81
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,869
lt has Christmas,

82
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,204
Hanukkah, kwanzaa,

83
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,831
the Buddhist day of enlightenment,

84
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,290
and Boxing Day on it.

85
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,667
Everyone's included!

86
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,627
ls everyone included?

87
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,379
What about... What about the...
The Mormons?

88
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,048
What about the Jews for Jesus?

89
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,718
-What about Scientologists?
-Yeah. Mysticism.

90
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,011
What about Shintoism?

91
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,303
Satanism.

92
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,430
Right.

93
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,182
What about
something for the Satanists?

94
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,975
Jeremy, come on. l...
l admire the stand that you're taking,

95
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,021
but let's schedule the protest rally
for after the workday, shall we?

96
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,646
And, Mary, let's let it slide.

97
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:15,773
Thank you.

98
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,317
Good morning, everybody.

99
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,153
You can't silence us all.

100
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,947
l know why you took a medical leave.

101
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,576
lt's hard for me to bring her out in public
because she's so beautiful.

102
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Hey, guys.

103
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,747
People put models
on this crazy pedestal...

104
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,581
-Yep.
-But l think that's why, you know,

105
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,665
Becca fell for me,

106
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,168
because l just treat her
like a normal person.

107
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,420
Good for you, man.
Hey, so, are you gonna be

108
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,965
inviting your fake girlfriend
to the holiday party later?

109
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,259
l mean, l just want to
make sure you have time to inflate her.

110
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,677
Okay, Becca's real.

111
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,846
And we're not gonna mix
business with pleasure.

112
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,764
Sounds like he didn't invite her, dude.

113
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,973
Oh, my God, did you not...

114
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,644
No! l mean, l hope
she's not imaginary pissed.

115
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,228
You won't get any more
imaginary blowjobs.

116
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,355
Right?

117
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,773
Tim. Drew.

118
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,524
Hey, it's a couple days
before Christmas.

119
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,442
Let's just try to keep it
positive till then, okay?

120
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,069
-We're totally positive.
-No, we're all about...

121
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,947
Totally positive that he is full of shooot.

122
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,865
Hey...

123
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,742
You bring it on yourself, Nate.

124
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,786
-You know, l do have a girlfriend.
-l know.

125
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,913
She's a human woman,
and we've done it.

126
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,622
Maybe just don't talk
about her so much at work.

127
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,999
lt's just gonna make those guys jealous.

128
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,293
You know, not only are you their boss,
but you also have a hot girlfriend.

129
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,379
-Yeah.
-You know?

130
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,548
-lt's too much. l hate you.
-Yeah.

131
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,384
-Have a good day.
-You, too!

132
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,095
Can you believe
corporate raised the price

133
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,596
in the vending machine again?

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,098
$2 for ginger ale?

135
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,266
They're trying to crush us like ants!

136
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,269
No, there's a lot of
bad energy in this office.

137
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,170
Yo, Josh, what the flap?

138
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,754
What the flap, Tracey?

139
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,257
You changed the security code
without telling me?

140
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,759
Yeah, l'm working on sensitive shooot,
and l don't want prying eyes.

141
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,678
l'm prying eyes? l'm your supervisor.

142
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,807
Chief technical officer,
lead systems engineer.

143
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,268
Yeah, well, l'm the only one who knows
how to hack the security panel,

144
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,187
so suck my dick.

145
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,355
Nice. Okay.

146
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,523
What are you working on?

147
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,274
lt's too complicated to explain.

148
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,985
What is that,
subroutine for duplex compression?

149
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,322
Don't tell me that's what l think it is.

150
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,781
This is the future of Zenotek.

151
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,574
Hey, we should pitch this to Data City!

152
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:31,951
That's a theory.

153
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,120
You want to peg
the company to a theory?

154
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,581
Man, you used to get excited
by big ideas.

155
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,250
Now you just bunt, and ask for
the same thing over and over.

156
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,543
l swing for the fences.

157
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,627
And l'm going to change
the flaping game.

158
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,963
Okay. l need the specs for
the Data City pitch, please.

159
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,466
Already done. Here.

160
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,009
Great. That was fast.

161
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,637
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

162
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,305
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

163
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,891
Really? Because you seem
a little off today.

164
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,932
You seem a little weird.

165
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,143
-Well...
-Oh, my gosh!

166
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,353
Today is the day, right? Hey!

167
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,105
Congratulations, you're free!

168
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,565
You gonna get a back tattoo
and some skinny jeans?

169
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,151
Funds are a little tight, but...

170
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,235
lt feels good to be free.

171
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,569
Yeah.

172
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,363
All right. Thank you for this.

173
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,865
-Hey, J.
-Yeah?

174
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,701
l got you for Secret Santa again.

175
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,288
l know. l got you, too.

176
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,713
Sweetie, that is so great!
Mommy's so proud of you.

177
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,509
Hey, could you put your daddy back
on the phone for a second?

178
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,052
-Hey, Allison. ls he ready?
-You flaping motherfucker!

179
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,721
lf l hear you let your stripper girlfriend

180
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,889
put my children on
her motorcycle one more time,

181
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,933
l will Gone Girl you so hard!

182
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,102
-You can go in.
-l'm just gonna go in. Thank you.

183
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,438
No, no, no. Don't try and sell this
as some win-win situation.

184
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,024
This is not my first rodeo, okay?

185
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,150
-ls that Data City?
-No.

186
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,403
No.

187
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,113
Rick, do you want this deal or not?

188
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,447
Because if you want him,
you're gonna have to pay for him.

189
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,533
lt's almost the playoffs,

190
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,201
not the second week
of the regular season.

191
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,995
Perfect. lt's the right choice.

192
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,041
l am running a train on this league.

193
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,376
l... l don't think that that means
what you want it to mean.

194
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,878
l'd love to talk to you
about the Data City pitch,

195
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,004
for later on this afternoon?

196
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,715
Yes, but first l want
your opinion on something.

197
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,966
Okay.

198
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,094
What do you think of this?

199
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,263
l just got it.

200
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,807
Look at that.

201
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,101
l like it 'cause it looks like
he's trying just a little too hard.

202
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,687
The artist?

203
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,897
l hadn't thought about the artist.

204
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,441
l think it sends a good message.

205
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,735
l think it says that you are strong
and you are willing to buy anything.

206
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,072
-No, l commissioned it.
-That's more expensive.

207
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah, but worth it.

208
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,075
l think it's a great new addition.

209
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,036
l'd love to talk about Data City,
the pitch this afternoon...

210
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,078
l think it's super important.

211
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,539
lt is really important,
but we've got kind of a crisis.

212
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,129
This is what corporate wants us to give
everyone for Christmas. Just this.

213
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,922
Yeah, can't hand that out.

214
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,923
And l'm already feeling kind of a

215
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,302
"flap you" vibe down there,
definitely not Christmas spirit.

216
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,888
l can't argue with you there.

217
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,515
Good. l want to Secret Santa the shooot
out of the staff meeting. Come on.

218
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,686
Can we work and walk?

219
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,938
Allison, hold most of my calls,
not all of them.

220
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,524
No, where are you going?

221
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,984
Christmas shopping.

222
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,110
What about that breakfast pizza
you ordered?

223
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,947
You're not cold without a big coat on?

224
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,075
No, l gain 1 5 pounds every winter
so l don't have to wear one.

225
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,702
-That's a healthy choice.
-Not really.

226
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,456
Hey, are you bringing anybody
to this wine and cheese thing?

227
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,789
No, l'll be there solo.

228
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,250
Good. Smart.
So you can focus on Tracey, right?

229
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,962
Tracey and l work together.
What are you talking about?

230
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,256
l'm just saying.
l can't be your work wife forever.

231
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,052
Hey, how fast do you think
you'd have to go to make that jump?

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,303
-Boy, l don't know. ln a car?
-Yeah.

233
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,971
l just never thought about that.

234
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,599
You know,
your mind's like a drunk baby.

235
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,142
What do you think, 80 or 90?

236
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,561
What would vin do? vin Diesel?
Or tyrese?

237
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,772
They'd never make it, right? lt's suicide.

238
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,316
Unless you were going 1 20,
you put a bunch of free weights

239
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,067
-in the trunk to even it out, you know...
-Okay.

240
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,903
Then you just catch air.

241
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,988
"flap you, gravity,
and you, Dom Toretto!"

242
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,072
-Yeah.
-Then...

243
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,866
Just a smooth landing,
like a baby's buttocks.

244
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,576
l'd love to pick this up indoors.

245
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,788
You know, l've only ever seen
the first film,

246
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,206
so l don't know if l'm much help to you
in this conversation. So...

247
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,332
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. Here we go.

248
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,417
Why am l just hearing about this?

249
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,543
We've worked together for eight years.

250
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,212
They only get more fast! More furious!

251
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,965
l love this place.

252
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,676
So, what would people want?
Would they like...

253
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,928
ls this Uv? ls Uv good or bad? l forget.

254
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,390
-No, not for the eyes, it's good.
-Does it do anything here?

255
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,350
Probably. ls this for teeth whitening?

256
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,436
Okay, what about this, right?

257
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,855
Everybody gets stressed at work
around this time of year.

258
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,150
That could get you
a sexual harassment suit.

259
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,193
What? Why?

260
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,946
Not everyone likes dildos for Christmas.

261
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,407
This isn't a dildo. lt's a body massager.

262
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,616
Yeah, well,
it's a circumcised purple penis.

263
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,119
lt could be considered sexual.

264
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,287
Why is it like that?

265
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,413
Everything here
could be considered sexual.

266
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,374
Hey, what about this
for Alan from legal?

267
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,209
Well, Alan's bald.

268
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,876
lt's so hard to shop for the bald.

269
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,254
Who are they? What do they want?

270
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,922
Hair.

271
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,133
You know, maybe we should just
go get some gift cards.

272
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,676
That's exactly what we should do!

273
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,094
"Here's a gift card
because l don't know you

274
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,304
"and l don't care
and l won't get in trouble for it."

275
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,639
You know,
when my dad ran this company,

276
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,515
Christmas was actually a big deal.

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,933
At the Christmas party every year,

278
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,769
he would dress up like Santa Claus,
get everybody fucked up.

279
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,895
Yeah, you could back then.

280
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,690
He would throw gifts into the crowd.

281
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,235
Derek Peterson shattered
his femur for a rotisserie set.

282
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,195
And that was before Boston Chicken
was, like, a thing.

283
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,447
-l've heard those stories.
-He took care of them.

284
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,200
That's what l want for my people.
You know?

285
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,452
And l want that drone.

286
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,038
Clay, let me ask you a question.

287
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:32,460
You think that my management
style is... ls too careful?

288
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:37,048
Do you think that l bunt
instead of swing for the fences?

289
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,383
l want to be completely honest
with you, Josh.

290
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,719
l wasn't paying attention,
so l didn't hear your question.

291
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,636
-l can repeat it.
-l'd rather you didn't.

292
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,014
Because l can tell by
your face that it's serious.

293
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,767
And l want to tell you seriously,

294
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,519
it's almost Christmas. Relax.

295
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,854
-You want some of this?
-l think so.

296
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,272
-l don't think you do.
-You sure?

297
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,648
l think you better get moving.

298
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,899
Here he goes!

299
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,736
Eat that! Eat it, Clay!

300
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,489
Careful, careful, careful!

301
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,868
We're good.

302
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,702
No!

303
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,554
Hey!

304
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,578
Somebody is getting fired.

305
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,418
Hey, Allison? Right?

306
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,086
-Yeah.
-l'm Fred.

307
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,169
l just joined accounting.

308
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,754
Hi.

309
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,758
So, l saw that photo on your desk.

310
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,842
Are those your kids?

311
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,970
Yep. They're two and four.

312
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,763
l'm a single mom.

313
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,347
That's great.

314
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,267
-l was raised by a single mom.
-Really?

315
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,436
Yeah. lf you ask me, Tupac was right.

316
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,854
Ain't a woman alive

317
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,480
That couId take my mama's pIace

318
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,984
l don't know that song.

319
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,693
shooot.

320
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,736
Allison.

321
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,490
-Where's Clay?
-He's unreachable.

322
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,534
He's participating in a conference...
Summit...

323
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,202
Elon Musk,

324
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,746
tech participation relay.

325
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,582
Let's try that again.

326
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,209
Allison, where's Clay?

327
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,378
-He's Christmas shopping.
-Okay.

328
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,090
l would like all department heads
in the conference room in five minutes.

329
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:44,884
Tell him to stop looking at me.

330
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,967
Look away.

331
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,639
No, he's cute.

332
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,764
Actually...

333
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,893
lt's like the calling never stops.

334
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,811
l know. lt's so annoying.

335
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,485
You have got to be shitting me.

336
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,529
So the bartender says,

337
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,198
"We don't see many gorillas."
And the gorilla says,

338
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,783
"Well, at $1 2 for a martini,
l can see why not."

339
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,327
You know a lot of gorilla jokes.

340
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,078
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

341
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,707
What's going on? Something's off.

342
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,293
Yeah, everyone's working.

343
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,504
Shitster.

344
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,047
lt's my sister.

345
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,383
There she is!
My sister from another mister!

346
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,717
l'm kidding, our mother

347
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,010
didn't start having affairs
until the mid-90s.

348
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,136
What are you doing here?

349
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,972
Well, we were just going over
your fourth quarter earnings.

350
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,975
And l wondered
if l was missing something.

351
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,059
Probably.

352
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,894
Clay, why don't you have a seat?

353
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,607
No. lt's my branch, so l prefer to stand.

354
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,150
Fine.

355
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,278
Allison, would you please
remove Clay's chair?

356
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,240
-Sure.
-Thank you.

357
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,325
Sorry.

358
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,201
Thank you, Allison.

359
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,625
So we were all a little bit disappointed
not to hit 7% growth in this last quarter.

360
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,254
But 6.5% is right on
industry standard for the fall.

361
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,297
You need to hit 1 2%.

362
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,841
-"Twelve"?
-Twelve is the new seven.

363
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,009
-What?
-Since when?

364
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,178
Since Dad died
and the board made me CEO.

365
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,557
You mean interim CEO.

366
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,644
Shut up.
Listen, essentially, this branch is failing.

367
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,437
6.5% is not failing.

368
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,355
-Yes, it is.
-We're doing better than Orlando.

369
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,234
l mean, half those jack-offs
had mono last year, right?

370
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,238
Well, l closed the Orlando branch.
This morning.

371
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,573
What?

372
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,786
l am sorry.

373
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,998
Damn it. l hate tension, and l...

374
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,790
l farted.

375
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,418
You are not selling enough servers.

376
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,255
You have no new ideas
and there is no new revenue.

377
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,674
-l have something new.
-Really?

378
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,384
-No, you don't.
-Yeah, l do.

379
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,679
-lt's not ready.
-lt is ready.

380
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,307
-We can hear you.
-Yeah, sorry.

381
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,517
We can. lt's a completely silent room.

382
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,768
-Go ahead.
-Yeah...

383
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,062
What's the most annoying thing
about the lnternet?

384
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,191
-Pictures of people's kids.
-Linkedln invites.

385
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,527
My girlfriend's always on it.
l have a girlfriend.

386
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,363
The lack ofAsian
male representation in porn.

387
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,656
Grumpy Cat. lt's like... lt's Garfield.

388
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,909
You know that orange
with the human dick?

389
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,452
Oh, my God, what is this, Shark Tank?

390
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,787
Can you just get to the point, please?

391
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,830
lt's getting on the lnternet.

392
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,960
So we can already
connect to the lnternet

393
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,502
through standard electrical lines

394
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,297
and obviously we can do it
through the air.

395
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,467
But what if we could combine
those technologies?

396
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,635
With Zenotek AnywAir,

397
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:34,927
you can pull the lnternet wirelessly

398
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,263
from anything that's connected
to a power grid.

399
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,726
Your appliances.
Street lights. A light bulb.

400
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,270
You're never out of range,
and you're never low on signal.

401
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,814
lt's AnywAir.

402
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,901
We're in the future.

403
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,069
And you can deliver that?

404
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,780
l'm still figuring out
some coding issues, but yes.

405
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,450
Well, how long have you been figuring?

406
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,451
-Four years.
-Four years?

407
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,953
All right, well, that doesn't
sound very real to me.

408
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,164
Well, if it was real,
l wouldn't have to invent it.

409
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,334
l'm sorry, what's your name again?

410
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,501
Tracey Hughes.

411
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,586
And if you forget again,

412
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,755
it's on all of the
recent patents for Zenotek.

413
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,799
You know what? l'm gonna sit.

414
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:17,721
Not because you told me to,
but because l prefer it.

415
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,807
So...

416
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,230
-ls there anything else?
-Actually, yes.

417
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:30,651
This is a sample cheeseboard
for our holiday mixer tonight.

418
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,903
l know it's a little heavy on the Gouda...
That was the MvP last year.

419
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,573
l do have a feisty Cheddar on the bench.

420
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,782
l think that pairs better with

421
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,493
the mulled non-alcoholic wine
myself, but what do l know?

422
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,078
Wait, wait. l'm sorry. Excuse me.

423
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,663
You're having
a Christmas party tonight?

424
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,039
lt's not a Christmas party.

425
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,917
lt's a non-denominational holiday mixer.

426
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,044
More inclusive.

427
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,838
Well, whatever the flap it is,
it's not happening.

428
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,798
Yeah, it's definitely...
Well, it's not "happenin"'

429
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,884
because it happens
at 5:30 in the afternoon.

430
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,261
lt's just a small thing
that's really important to all of us,

431
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,346
but trust me, it's gonna suck.

432
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,726
No, it's not gonna suck,
because it's canceled.

433
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,059
What?

434
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,061
All branch Christmas parties
are canceled.

435
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,188
lt's a waste of money!

436
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,356
Come on.
What are you guys not getting?

437
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,358
All right, it's canceled.

438
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,693
lt's not.

439
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,988
Clay! l mean it.

440
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,365
Me, too, Carol.
Guys, the holiday mixer is canceled.

441
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,451
-Yes.
-lt won't be.

442
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,162
Hey! lt's canceled, Clay!

443
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,454
The thing is not happening at all.

444
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,497
l'm not messing with you.

445
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,124
Hey! Stop doing that!

446
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,084
Hey, idiot, l'm looking right at you.

447
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,546
l saw that!
You whispered to the farty cheese lady.

448
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,713
Well...

449
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,673
Don't make me pull rank, Clay.

450
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,843
lt is canceled.

451
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,846
Fine! Then this meeting is canceled!

452
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,810
Damn it!

453
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,355
l was keeping it light in there.

454
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,691
That was light?

455
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:53,858
You have to give her a break, Josh.

456
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,487
She's hated parties ever since
she started not getting invited to them.

457
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,614
Please. That party's the least
of your problems.

458
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,866
ls that Dad?

459
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,412
No, Carol, l just have
some random guy's ashes in my office.

460
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,497
Got it online.

461
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,665
Yes. He wanted them here,
with me, at his branch.

462
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,960
l thought they were gonna
divide him equally.

463
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,421
lt's not my fault that he always liked
hanging out with me more.

464
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,464
l don't care. l got this company.

465
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,133
Moving on.

466
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,384
We have a lot of
big cuts to make. Okay?

467
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,805
Obviously, bonuses are canceled.

468
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,058
You know, there's a lot of people that
are relying on those bonuses.

469
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,144
l suppose you're still
getting your bonus, though.

470
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,563
Secondly, l'm laying off
40% of your staff.

471
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,231
"Forty"?

472
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,567
Forty... That... We have 200 employees.
That's like, 60...

473
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,112
-Some...
-That's 80. lt's 80.

474
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,155
Eighty. That's, like, 80 employees.

475
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,659
You got to give us
a little bit of time to turn this around.

476
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,243
Fine, then you have
until the end of the quarter.

477
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,413
-That's two days.
-ls it? Oh, well.

478
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,165
-This is unfair.
-You wanna talk unfair?

479
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,417
How about Dad skipping
my Harvard graduation

480
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,711
to go with you to the X Games?

481
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,255
And you weren't even competing.

482
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,423
You just sponsored
some guy's wakeboard.

483
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,343
He got the bronze. Which is brown gold.

484
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,471
All right, so l've made a list
of my first round of layoffs.

485
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,556
So you might wanna get a pen

486
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,223
-and start writing these down.
-No. Let me see that.

487
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,683
-No. No.
-Give me that.

488
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,560
-No!
-These are my employees!

489
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,729
Guys, are we sure about this?

490
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,146
Say you won't make budget cuts.

491
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,273
l swear to God, Clay!

492
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,357
Here comes the loogie express!

493
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,442
-Don't you dare!
-Say, "Everybody's

494
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,486
-"gonna get a bonus," or else.
-You motherfucker.

495
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,405
Suck that back in.
You suck that back in! You mother...

496
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,115
Clay.

497
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,910
Oh, my God!

498
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,537
Why do you do this to yourself?

499
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,204
You know l took
nine years of Krav Maga.

500
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,374
Carol, you know, he's turning blue.

501
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,917
Yeah. Our family, you got to tap out.

502
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,961
Tap out. Tap out.

503
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,173
Okay.

504
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,425
All right. You okay?

505
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,888
Dad gave you a free pass
your entire life,

506
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,973
and you're not getting one from me.

507
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:53,060
The only way you're gonna hit
your targets this year is by cutting jobs.

508
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,231
Hey, what if we landed
the Data City account?

509
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,153
-Data City? Walter Davis?
-That's right.

510
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,448
You do know that he's already
met with HP, Cisco and Oracle.

511
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,282
Yeah, but he hasn't heard our pitch.

512
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,534
No.

513
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,869
Josh and l have been
drilling into it for weeks.

514
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,747
Yeah. Months. Whole team.

515
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,582
And we have a meeting with him

516
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,708
-this afternoon.
-Yeah.

517
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,126
All right.

518
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,087
Well, l'm on a flight to London tonight.

519
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,674
So if by some miracle
you guys can close Walter Davis

520
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,930
and his $14 million contract
by the time l land at Heathrow,

521
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,347
the jobs are safe.

522
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,682
Done!

523
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,018
And you'll see,
you're gonna look so stupid.

524
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,311
Then we'll finally
have something in common.

525
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,358
God damn it! She's so mean!

526
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,694
People are saying "cuts."
What kind of cuts?

527
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,447
Nothing's official.

528
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:46,656
Guys, l can barely afford my rent.

529
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,032
l'm sleeping in a closet.

530
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,117
-Don't panic.
-You can't replace the new guy, right?

531
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,702
You're probably gonna go
with people that are older,

532
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,954
-more expensive?
-l don't want you to overreact.

533
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,958
l just bought that used Lexus, Josh.
l can't give it back.

534
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,541
l put rims on it, man!

535
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,128
l have six parrots with very expensive
medical issues. You know this.

536
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,547
l'm gonna have to put one down.

537
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,548
-Nobody is losing theirjobs!
-Yeah.

538
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,301
That is a Josh and Clay
Christmas promise.

539
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,637
Your promises are dog shooot!

540
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,224
-Boy, they turned quick.
-Yeah, they sure did.

541
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,313
Jesus. lncest and rape?

542
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,356
l mean, that is dark.

543
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,483
That could be a different Clay.

544
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,945
-And Carol.
-We got to land this pitch.

545
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,865
Okay, everybody knows
what we're doing?

546
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,326
Sure. We're just pitching to
save our company. No biggie.

547
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,036
And we're proving that
my sister doesn't flap me.

548
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,871
-lf anything, l flap her!
-All right.

549
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,457
Yeah, listen, l get the spirit of that, but...

550
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,042
We at Zenotek put the "client"

551
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,797
in client-server
model service distribution.

552
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,715
And this is a leave-behind.

553
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,177
And we have some new innovation
that we can talk to you about later.

554
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,430
Later.

555
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,182
You got to... You got to go with us.

556
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,434
Okay.

557
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,396
Thank you for the pitch.

558
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,067
Just give me a beat,
and l'll let you know my decision.

559
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,154
Okay. When you say "beat,"
you're talking about an hour

560
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,240
or a day? A full day?

561
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,366
Certainly before the holidays,
l'd imagine, right?

562
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,371
Listen, it's Christmas, so, l'll be honest.

563
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,707
Your servers are good.

564
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,044
Dell's servers are good.

565
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,211
-So...
-You're gonna go with us.

566
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,798
-l'm gonna go with Dell.
-flap!

567
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,965
-Why?
-Don't.

568
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,468
l... l know your product.

569
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,720
My problem is with your culture.

570
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,431
Our culture is great.

571
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,807
That's not what l hear.

572
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,184
Word is you're closing branches
and making layoffs.

573
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,311
-That's not true.
-No, that's barely true.

574
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,896
A mixture of fabrication and rumor.

575
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,398
Look, l get it. You got to make money.

576
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,817
And every quarter
you got to make more money.

577
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,319
And if you got to fire some people

578
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,447
and cut back on some benefits
to make it happen,

579
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,531
that's what business is now, right?

580
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,910
And as long as the board
has gotten its bonus

581
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,244
and the stock is ticking up? Come on.

582
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,413
Sir, that's not who we are.

583
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,248
And if you came to our offices,
you would see that.

584
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,791
You should come meet our people.

585
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,501
Yeah, we're a family business.

586
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,795
Everyone loves everyone.

587
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,212
l mean, Clay and his sister,

588
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,423
they're so close
it's almost inappropriate.

589
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,176
We would love the opportunity
to prove you wrong.

590
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,012
l'm sure you have wonderful
cubicles and great carpeting,

591
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,057
but l've done those tours before.

592
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,724
l'm gonna pass.

593
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,936
-Thank you so much.
-We got that.

594
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,439
-No, they've already put it on my room.
-lt's the least we can do.

595
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,942
And in addition to the breakfast
my company won't pay for anymore.

596
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,069
Good luck, guys.

597
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,198
Great. That was uplifting.

598
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,365
He's saying we suck.

599
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,866
Our big closer was a thumb drive.

600
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,286
Yeah, but we don't suck.
We just need a way to show him that.

601
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,412
How are we gonna do that?

602
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,539
We're gonna invite him to our canceled
wine and cheese night?

603
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,125
No, we should take him out for real.

604
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,209
l mean, you heard him.

605
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,585
His company won't even
buy him breakfast.

606
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,046
He's an old school guy
who drinks scotch at lunch.

607
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,382
We should take him out
and show him a great time.

608
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,633
So we'll hook him up with Don Draper,

609
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,676
then go out and get
a couple of steaks and an STD.

610
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,761
No, no, no. You're both right.

611
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,973
We show him a great time
at our office Christmas party tonight.

612
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,349
What? l didn't say that.

613
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,934
-lt's not the worst idea.
-Right?

614
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,229
Of course it is. We don't even have
an office Christmas party.

615
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,980
Carol said no
to all discretionary spending.

616
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,898
She wants to lay off 40%.
You want to double that?

617
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,651
My sister doesn't do anything at 40%.

618
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,528
She's just cutting off our legs
so we can't run away

619
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,320
when she wants to flaping
curb-stomp our face.

620
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,156
This is the way we close Walter.

621
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,366
We throw the best Christmas
party he's ever been to.

622
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,743
He loves it, he loves us,
he sees we care about people,

623
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,122
he falls in love with our culture,
he wants to work with us.

624
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,455
This is how we save everybody's job!

625
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,209
l like it, Josh. Say yes.

626
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,753
He's walking away,
unless you have a better idea.

627
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,213
That's your approval sigh.

628
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,048
Walter?

629
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,468
We have one more pitch for you.

630
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,595
Do you party?

631
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,182
l used to.

632
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:06,249
Okay, so we have to throw a massive
party from scratch in five hours.

633
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,292
Yeah. And we got an office full of
pissed-off employees.

634
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,461
You guys, l got this.
l have a black belt in partying.

635
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,880
That's why l got kicked out
of boarding school

636
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,088
and two intensive care units.

637
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,884
Listen. Did you see this?
"lt's F-ing Christmas, B's.

638
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,344
"Let's get mother-F-ing drunk.

639
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,929
-"Attendance mandatory."
-Yeah.

640
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,180
Lawsuit!

641
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,597
Mary, it's for the greater good, okay?

642
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,307
Joel, would you do me a favor?

643
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,517
Would you get Fred up to Clay's office?

644
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,602
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

645
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,144
-Wait!
-Yup.

646
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,396
l don't know if it's helpful,
but regarding the music tonight,

647
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,316
l happen to have a friend
who's a pretty good DJ.

648
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,192
Great. Bring him.

649
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,069
-See, we already got a DJ.
-Yep.

650
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,113
So let me get this straight.

651
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:41,492
Now we're having this great party
and we're getting our bonuses at it.

652
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,078
Yes, Jeremy, because you deserve it!

653
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,330
Maybe you shouldn't have
promised them bonuses.

654
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,457
No, first rule of business,

655
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,210
shoot for the moon
and you'll land on the sun.

656
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,752
l'd love to know where you read that.

657
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,337
And let's just focus on closing Walter.

658
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,048
-You know?
-Carol burned this place to the ground.

659
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,174
We are planting
the seeds of a new dawn.

660
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,386
Smitty? Clay vanstone.

661
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,555
No, l'm not dead. That was
just a rumor, although well-founded.

662
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,266
How much alcohol
can l legally buy from you?

663
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,815
Move out of my way.

664
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,317
l swear to God,
l will drop this on your back. Move!

665
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,859
You know what?

666
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,279
Merry Christmas,
you sweet motherfucker.

667
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,405
-You're coming, yeah, Smitty?
-Yes.

668
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,531
-Yes! Okay. You want this?
-No.

669
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,615
All right.

670
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,580
l'm keeping this lamb.

671
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,127
We need something else,
something that will make us look cool.

672
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,005
Does anybody know anybody
who knows the Kanye West?

673
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,088
-No.
-No.

674
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,757
But my girlfriend does PR for the Bulls.

675
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,342
Okay, does your girlfriend
have a friend who knows

676
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,051
the man that makes us call him Yeezy?

677
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,430
Nate, what's up, man? Did you see?

678
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,932
Significant others are welcome
at the party. Look at that.

679
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,349
Looks like we're finally
gonna meet Becca.

680
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,434
Yeah!

681
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,894
Shoot.

682
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:53,064
Except she's working late tonight.
Modeling.

683
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,942
ls she shooting the cover
of full ofShit magazine?

684
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,569
You know what? She's gonna be there.

685
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,030
You guys! Nate's girlfriend's coming!

686
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,701
shooot! Match, match, match.
Match! Come on.

687
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,832
Okay. What are we gonna do
with these after the party?

688
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Raffle.

689
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,636
Hey, dicks.

690
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,183
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

691
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:30,852
Finish him!

692
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,439
For a failing branch,
we're surprisingly productive.

693
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,691
Yeah, l just wish Carol could see this.

694
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,109
No, Clay, that would be very bad.

695
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,569
Yeah, you're right.

696
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,945
All right, go put on your party suits.

697
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,698
-Yeah.
-Tonight's gonna be a great night.

698
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,933
Clay, l told you,
l don't need to do any pre-game for...

699
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,435
-Carol.
-Pre-game for what?

700
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,064
For the work session we got tonight.

701
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,148
And to complete the process of...

702
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,526
We're closing Walter Davis, you know?

703
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,777
lt's going really, really well.

704
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,153
Phase one's complete.

705
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,779
Why don't you come on in?

706
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,155
l thought you were going to London.

707
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,741
l was on my way to the airport,

708
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,576
but l thought l would stop by and

709
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,122
have a tour of your bachelor pad.

710
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,959
Well, that didn't take long.

711
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,794
How did you know about my divorce?

712
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,838
You changed your
emergency contact to "self."

713
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,465
And nobody single by choice
would live this close to the freeway.

714
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,218
ls that robe why your wife left you?

715
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,719
What do you want, Carol?

716
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,430
l want you to work for me in New York.

717
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,557
You basically run this branch
without the credit.

718
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,933
l will double your salary,
you'll get job security,

719
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,144
and a boss who doesn't
end every memo

720
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,479
with a quote from Aerosmith.

721
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,442
l could never do that to Clay,
and l'm very happy where l am.

722
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:01,608
-Really?
-Yeah.

723
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,236
l don't see happy.

724
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,779
l see crappy.

725
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,991
And a rug that makes me sad.

726
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,243
Anyway...

727
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,913
l don't know, just think about it.
When the branch closes,

728
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,375
and Clay has a trust fund to fall back on,

729
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,336
what are you gonna have?

730
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,463
Not much.

731
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,465
Merry Christmas!

732
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,393
-Thank you.
-You got it.

733
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,191
Hey, man. Good to see you. Hi.

734
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,484
-Eight years l've been working here.
-Turn around.

735
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,278
What are you hoping to find
anyway, Carla?

736
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,905
What's your dream contraband?

737
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,324
l just like making you my bitch.

738
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,409
-You can go.
-Thank you.

739
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,788
You look like Cinderella
if she joined the TSA.

740
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,459
very, very nice.
Okay, take a look at this, please.

741
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,626
Who's Mr. December?

742
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:01,877
This is Walter Davis, he's a vlP.

743
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,130
l want you to do me a favor and
let me know the second he comes in.

744
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,214
Can you do that?

745
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,548
You will hear the sound of heavy flirting.

746
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,718
-Orjust a text. That'd be great.
-Okay.

747
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,260
-And are you gonna join us later?
-No, l doubt it.

748
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,138
l have to protect the front lines,
make sure no crazy stuff happens.

749
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,474
But if it does... l'm ready.

750
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,310
-And you went with the yellow. Smart.
-Right?

751
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,063
Hey.

752
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,317
-How's everyone doing tonight?
-Great.

753
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,068
lt's my birthday.

754
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,738
Really committing. That's nice.

755
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,701
Hey, look at that!

756
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,744
-Hi.
-Hey, there, Susan.

757
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,663
-Nice reindeer, right?
-How you doin'?

758
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,082
Throw that in coat check for me, please.

759
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,333
Thank you. You look great.

760
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,585
-Hey, Josh.
-Hey, Dean.

761
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,170
You... You thought you'd bring the kid?

762
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,881
Yeah. We couldn't get anyone
to watch him.

763
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,423
But don't worry, he has an iPad.

764
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,676
We could ax murder each other
and he wouldn't even notice.

765
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,971
He'll just sit there with
that dumb look on his face.

766
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,681
Yeah, that's the one.

767
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,268
Okay. Well, can you stick him
in my office for me?

768
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,104
-lf you're cool with that.
-Sure. Well, not cool, but...

769
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,814
-Have a good time.
-Thank you.

770
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,692
All right. Let's drop him quick,

771
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,902
because these edibles
are gonna kick in any second.

772
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,921
-Hey, Mr. Parker.
-Hey, Rodney.

773
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,506
-Want a Zeno Punch?
-No.

774
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,299
-Foam finger?
-Neither.

775
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,010
And, you know, we can skip this, too.

776
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,137
-Good spirit, though. Yep.
-Okay.

777
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,061
Could l have a beer, please?
Pretty great, huh, Jeremy?

778
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,897
Yeah, it's so weird,
l feel like l'm still at the office.

779
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,401
Yeah. Thank you.

780
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,405
lt's so nice not to have to
talk about work.

781
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,781
Yeah, so nice.

782
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,538
Hey, hey, fellas. All looks good, huh?

783
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,749
-Good, Josh. Great party.
-Thank you. So far.

784
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,710
-The bar free all night?
-lt is, yeah.

785
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,545
So is all this yummy food. Give it a try.

786
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,380
How about that salmon station
down there, huh?

787
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,882
Sales has already given it a whack.

788
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,384
l hate those guys.

789
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,677
-Hairy-shouldered donkey fuckers.
-Hey...

790
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,222
The only reason Legal hates Sales
is because of yourjob.

791
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,891
They wanna do shooot, and you guys
gotta tell them why they can't. That's all.

792
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,351
Yeah, but we're flaping right.

793
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,728
lt's not about being right.

794
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,106
This is a party. lt's about embracing
a little wrong. Come on, eat up.

795
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,389
God,

796
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,599
l know l haven't asked you
for much in this life.

797
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,061
Granted, l was born rich.

798
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:08,563
And white. And male. And straight.

799
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,025
Except for that one time.
But that's Las vegas.

800
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:16,072
But tonight l need you
to bless this party.

801
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,449
This party has to rock.

802
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,409
So we can get Walter's contract,

803
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:23,121
so that everyone can keep theirjobs,
especially Allison.

804
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,871
l mean, she is losing it!

805
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,041
And she has
all my personal information.

806
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,626
And so that we can prove
my sister wrong.

807
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,336
Show her that l am a good boss.

808
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,009
And will you say hi to our dad?

809
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,637
And tell him we really miss him.

810
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,016
And that l'm rocking his Santa suit.

811
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,978
And tell Prince and David Bowie
how much they meant to everybody.

812
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,896
I mean, Labyrinth, purpIe Rain...

813
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,648
They know.

814
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,193
All right,

815
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,112
let's light this flaping candle.

816
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,342
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, Zenotek!

817
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,094
lt's me, Santa Claus!

818
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,637
l'ma comin' to town for an epic night.

819
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,432
Santa!

820
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,478
That's okay, we'll get there.

821
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,983
Watch this, Greg.

822
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,987
Dean! Clear. l'm coming around.

823
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,532
shooot.

824
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,954
God.

825
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,414
lt's okay!

826
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,791
lt's okay! That was part of it.

827
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,376
Okay, Santa, what an entrance!

828
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,047
Right down the chimney, folks!

829
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,134
Merry Christmas, bitches!
Santa can't be hurt.

830
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,427
You doing okay? You all right?

831
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:02,802
-That really did hurt, yeah...
-Are you sure?

832
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,931
But you know what,
l had this for padding.

833
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,806
Holy shooot. What the flap is that?

834
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,226
Tell me that's not for something illegal.

835
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,976
No, no, no. Don't worry, this is all mine.

836
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,646
l rented one of those Money Tornados.

837
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,021
So for the bonuses later,

838
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,773
l'm gonna make it rain like a hurricane.

839
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,025
Are you sure you're not
getting carried away?

840
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,693
This seems like a lot of money
you're spending.

841
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,820
Josh, this is Christmas, okay?

842
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,030
And if anybody knows how to
work within a budget, it's me.

843
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,657
All right? And speaking of.

844
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,202
There you go. Hi.

845
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,452
-Cool.
-Little Jesus.

846
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,206
-Did you rent a live baby?
-Yeah, for the nativity scene.

847
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,625
What? lt's cheaper than you think, okay?

848
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,043
ls it?

849
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,132
shooot! DJ Calvis in the house tonight!

850
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,510
God, no.

851
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:46,639
Add my Snapchat, DJ Calvis.

852
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,184
Joel's friend looks just like Joel.

853
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,771
Looks like some babies
getting made tonight!

854
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,690
l'm not looking to get pregnant tonight.

855
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,442
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

856
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,695
JoeI, that's a red card for you.

857
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:04,657
Babies are not getting made tonight,
not here on company property.

858
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,117
If you're going to have intercourse,

859
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:09,452
pIease go beyond the flood Iamps
at the perimeter of the pIaza

860
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,539
and into the Rite Aid parking Iot.

861
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,208
That's right. 'Cause we flaping tonight!

862
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,126
JoeI. Language.

863
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,838
This is still an office, and

864
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,340
even though it's dark outside,
the rules don't turn off.

865
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,302
The ruIes may not turn off,
but your inhibitions can!

866
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,472
I'm taIking about take your pee-pees out
and put 'em in some booties!

867
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,809
And remember that tonight
the decisions you make

868
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,896
wiII have consequences
that wiII haunt you

869
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,815
for the rest of your professionaI Iives.

870
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:39,483
And...

871
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,527
And so have fun.

872
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,570
Yeah, Mary,
way to psyche everybody up!

873
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,282
main takeaway, if you're gonna flap,
do it in the parking Iot.

874
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,367
Turn it up!

875
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,288
l hate office parties.

876
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,914
How are you supposed to have fun
at the place that bores you the most?

877
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,460
l know. l just keep thinking about
all the work l don't care about.

878
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,420
And l wouldn't flap anyone in this party
even on a dare.

879
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,215
The only guy l would maybe consider
is Rob from Logistics.

880
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,009
He looks pretty good
since he got his stomach stapled.

881
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,135
-Well, Fred's cute.
-Who?

882
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,887
The new guy from Accounting.

883
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,514
Yeah, l normally wouldn't wanna
date someone from Accounting.

884
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,684
You know, or, like, from work at all,

885
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,311
but it's just that thing of like...

886
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:20,858
l don't have any friends outside of work
anymore, so...

887
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,777
What were you guys
talking about though?

888
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,195
l'm talking about these.

889
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,155
Oh, my God. What are those?

890
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,114
l don't know. But they're prescription.

891
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,576
Which means that some doctor gave it
to someone,

892
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:31,786
which means that
it's good enough for me.

893
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,371
That's some bad logic.

894
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,373
No. You know, 'cause l'm a mom.

895
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,125
l try not to get high on any drugs.

896
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,460
You know? Except Zoloft.

897
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,268
-Hey.
-Hey! Someone cleans up nice.

898
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,731
Yeah, l... l'm wearing
the same clothes, from earlier.

899
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,400
Yeah. l was just making a party joke.

900
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,193
l didn't want to go all the way home

901
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,030
and then come back, so l just
sat in my car and worked.

902
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,990
Also l was waiting for
my phone to charge.

903
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,036
So you're all charged up!

904
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,039
What?

905
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,251
l said you're all charged up.

906
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,001
Yeah, my phone.

907
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,088
Hey, the music is really loud.

908
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,755
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

909
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,509
-Yeah.
-Okay.

910
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,221
-Dude, check it out.
-What?

911
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,056
Jenna in Shipping just bought
To KiII a mockingbird.

912
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,309
Maybe we can talk to her about
whatever the hell that is.

913
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,853
-Yeah.
-Dude, did you hack her email?

914
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,440
Yeah. l kind of hacked everyone's.

915
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,983
flaping awesome, man.

916
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,278
That's my boy. Nice, nice. Hey, hey.
What about Nikki?

917
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,697
Yeah. Nikki, Nikki. Okay, bam. Nikki.

918
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,576
-French bulldog got murdered...
-Nice.

919
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,619
-Her brother is in rehab.
-That's fantastic.

920
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,121
And she loves The Big Bang Theory.

921
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,373
All right. Big Bang, bulldog, rehab.
Got it.

922
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,168
Watch and learn, little man.
Here comes Dr. Orgasm.

923
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,132
Hey. How are you? l heard...

924
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,260
shooot.

925
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,222
Definitely should have opened with
The Big Bang Theory.

926
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,396
-Butler.
-lt is... That's Jimmy Butler.

927
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,356
-He plays for the Bulls.
-This is Zenotek.

928
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,940
shooot!

929
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,068
That's Jimmy Butler right there!

930
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:29,778
Who's Jimmy Butler?

931
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,739
Two-time All-Star.
Best player on my fantasy team.

932
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:33,990
flap you, Butler!

933
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,409
l don't know why l said that. flap.

934
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,577
These are great. You know what?

935
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,246
Why don't you give me your number
and l'll text these to you.

936
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,916
Excuse me. Hey. Hi.

937
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,083
-Jimmy, hey, this is Josh.
-Hey. How you doing?

938
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,503
So you the big man around here?

939
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,047
l'm not that big, no.
l'm feeling small right now.

940
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,757
Look at this. Good for you.

941
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,257
Here's the big man!

942
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,717
Jimmy Buckets. Clay vanstone.

943
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,344
Thanks for coming
to our Christmas party, man.

944
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,389
Of course. l've been trying to expand
the Jimmy Butler empire

945
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,556
into the tech space.

946
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,934
l'm thinking Jimmy Butler dating app.

947
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,061
-Maybe Butlerbook?
-l like it.

948
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,103
-Jimmyface?
-These are all good ideas.

949
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,231
Do you want to see the first
processor that we ever made?

950
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,358
lt's as big as a mini-fridge
and it used to set fires.

951
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,152
lt's upstairs with the good tequila.

952
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,320
-Of course.
-Casamigos.

953
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,445
l'll save some for you.

954
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,907
Geek yourself out!
He's really into technology.

955
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,994
Will you remind me, how do you know
Jimmy Butler again?

956
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,246
Remember, l told you my friend
does PR for the Bulls?

957
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,998
-Yes! Yeah.
-Right.

958
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,751
l thought that bringing
a famous basketball player

959
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,918
would help with Walter.

960
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,461
You're cool with that, right?

961
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,382
Why wouldn't l be cool?
lt's the greatest idea in the world.

962
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,550
Of course l'm cool.

963
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,134
-Very cool. Please.
-Okay.

964
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,135
Yeah. Mr. Cool.
l graduated valedictorian

965
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,929
from Cool University!

966
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,139
Good old CU.

967
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:43,686
Okay.

968
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,103
"CU" later!

969
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,648
Josh.

970
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Savannah?

971
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,172
l think you mean Becca, right?

972
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,302
l'm gonna be honest,
l've never done this before.

973
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,471
Although my mom and l have watched
Pretty Woman, like, a million times.

974
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,766
l love that movie! lt's why l'm doing this.

975
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,143
Yeah.

976
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,563
lt feels kind of dirty.

977
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,981
You feel dirty?

978
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,275
You're my third client tonight.
lt's only 9:00 p.m.

979
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:32,693
Really?

980
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:37,072
So, you just have to pay my manager,
and then we're, like, good.

981
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:38,282
Yeah...

982
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,409
Got it right here.

983
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,994
Hi. Nate.

984
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,423
-Nate?
-Yeah.

985
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,800
Hi, l'm Trina.

986
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,346
l don't do handshakes, l do hugs.
Get in here. Yeah.

987
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:04,516
Oh, my gosh, you guys are gonna have
so much fun tonight. l can feel it.

988
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,101
-You're already a couple.
-Hope so.

989
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,186
Already.

990
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,603
-ls this for me?
-Yes, ma'am.

991
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,065
Oh, my gosh. Look at him.
Prepared. l love that.

992
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,318
l'm not even gonna count it.
You know why?

993
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,362
-'Cause we're friends, right?
-Yeah.

994
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,489
Yeah, we're not flaping friends.

995
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,572
Oh, my God.

996
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,867
So if you're thinking of flaping with me,

997
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,202
or with my girl, don't.

998
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,954
Because l'm hella
stressed out right now.

999
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,375
This week has been
a scheduling nightmare!

1000
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,043
My iCal crashed,

1001
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,753
and now all my appointments
are set in 201 9.

1002
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,005
And in Hebrew.

1003
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,423
lt's a flawed program.
l've been saying this for years.

1004
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,134
-Shut up.
-shooot.

1005
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,885
My point is,

1006
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,222
if one more person pisses me off...
One more...

1007
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,182
l don't know what's gonna happen.

1008
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,018
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

1009
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,771
We're clear?

1010
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,108
Okay, so now, just have a good time.

1011
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,610
lf you use handcuffs,
have a spare key, okay?

1012
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,614
Jesus, we do not want to go
through Thanksgiving again.

1013
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,867
Hey, if you need me in the next hour,
l'll be at Whole Foods.

1014
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:04,952
Okay.

1015
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,371
Alexei, open my flaping door!

1016
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,248
Come on.
Let's go meet your friends. Yeah?

1017
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,916
l can close it myself!

1018
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,045
l'm a woman in 201 6. Jesus.

1019
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,465
Yeah! Zenotek! We up in this bitch.

1020
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,592
Hey, play some Huey Lewis.

1021
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:21,760
The solo stuff.

1022
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,262
l'm not playing Huey Lewis.
Man, look, this party is dying.

1023
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,014
That's why you play Huey Lewis.

1024
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,056
-lt's not...
-The solo stuff.

1025
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,851
They're going to sleep. Huey Lewis!
The solo stuff!

1026
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,394
Giving presents.

1027
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,938
Okay, Clay, incoming.
l just got a text from Carla.

1028
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,315
Walter's on his way up. This is it.

1029
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,985
Okay, okay. So we need an employee
to sit on my lap right when he comes up.

1030
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,193
A cheerful one. Definitely not Jeremy.

1031
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,445
Sure, great plan.

1032
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,489
Great. Good, good. Here.
You try and get this on, Triffany.

1033
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,574
Okay, so you're clear
on our backstory, right?

1034
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:48,244
We met in New York, you had a seizure,
you fell onto the train tracks,

1035
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,331
l jumped on top of you,
then l pressed my body onto yours

1036
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,125
so that the train passed over us.

1037
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,001
Yeah, okay.

1038
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,628
Ma'am, we're not zoned for livestock.

1039
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,715
Please put the horse in
Conference Room C and lock the door.

1040
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,467
l love your dress.

1041
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,885
Thank you. l... l knitted it myself.

1042
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,346
lt was a sweater vest that just
didn't know when to quit.

1043
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,516
Mary, this is my girlfriend.

1044
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,686
Okay. Well, have a good time

1045
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,731
and maybe the skirt and the shirt
can meet each other.

1046
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,856
Okay.

1047
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,360
Oh, my God, you look great.

1048
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,780
Hey, Walter!

1049
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,364
-Welcome to Zenotek.
-How are you?

1050
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,617
l'm so glad you came.

1051
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,951
Good to see you. Can l take your coat?

1052
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,536
-No, no, l'm good, actually.
-You sure? Okay.

1053
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,538
All right. Walt, what would
you like to get started with?

1054
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,789
You know, we got a photo booth.

1055
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,000
lt's like getting your
picture taken in a tiny house.

1056
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,083
We love it.

1057
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,128
Jimmy Butler is here!

1058
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,215
-Jimmy Butler from the Bulls is here.
-What? Come on! Where is he?

1059
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,175
Do you want to take a selfie with him?
Everyone's doin' it.

1060
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,469
You know, l'm a Cavs fan, actually.

1061
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,637
There's a good team.

1062
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,054
-This was a mistake.
-Hang on. Hang on.

1063
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,389
No, no, no. Come on.

1064
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,891
Now, a mistake would be
to miss the salmon station.

1065
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:52,976
Do you like salmon?

1066
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,313
You want to swim upstream with me
and go try some salmon?

1067
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,273
What does that even mean?

1068
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,233
You know what?
Let's start with a drink. Come on.

1069
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,985
Yeah. Are you thirsty?
Clay, you want a drink with Walter?

1070
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,197
One vibrator, please.

1071
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,074
Okay. Here you go.

1072
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,244
-lt's really a body massager.
-No, it's a vibrator.

1073
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,329
Hey, Josh!

1074
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:15,998
Hey, Jeremy. This is Jeremy,
our customer service manager.

1075
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,460
Hi, nice to meet you.
Mary just flaping cited me!

1076
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:19,920
Okay? l thought this was a party.

1077
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,588
lf l want to dick tap Alan,
l'm gonna dick tap Alan.

1078
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,840
That's a timeless gag!

1079
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,717
-Never not funny!
-Okay, off you go.

1080
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:29,804
She is like a poisonous
flaping cloud of shooot gas,

1081
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,057
like, just seeping into
everybody's good time.

1082
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:37,061
Every word she says makes
my flaping hemorrhoids throb!

1083
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,815
-l want that on the record.
-lt is.

1084
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,440
He's in customer service?

1085
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,775
Yeah, he's much better on the phone.

1086
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,360
That's really where he shines.
Here we go.

1087
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,822
Hey, can we get a scotch?
Macallan, right?

1088
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,867
No, dude. lt's the eggnog luge. Sorry.

1089
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,411
Just the eggnog. Okay. Great. Well...

1090
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,204
Looks like fun. Ladies first.

1091
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,331
-Josh, l insist. After you.
-Well, l'm not much on eggnog.

1092
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,791
Don't listen to this guy. He's Mr. Fun.

1093
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,168
He'll do anything for the party.
So, come on!

1094
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,005
Hey, everybody!
Josh is gonna do the luge!

1095
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,009
No, no. l don't think so. lt's not for me.

1096
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,012
Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh!

1097
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
lt looks like they want you to do it.

1098
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,224
Should l do it? l'll do it.

1099
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,643
l'll do it, l'll do it. Okay, let's do it.

1100
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,186
This the luge right here? Here we go.

1101
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,898
Here we go... Oh, boy.

1102
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:35,746
God.

1103
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,958
Okay, Walter, your turn.

1104
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,001
Where'd Walter go?

1105
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,335
l totally got you deep throating him.

1106
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,961
Well, look at that. That's beautiful.

1107
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,505
Where'd Walter go?
Clay, did you see Walter?

1108
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,175
l don't know about
that whole throne thing.

1109
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,425
l mean, nobody liked the gifts,

1110
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,802
everybody was complaining
and the lap-sitting got weird.

1111
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,012
No.

1112
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,097
What's happening?

1113
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,431
Well, it's just not working.

1114
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,643
lf you took away everybody's drinks
and turned up the lights,

1115
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,518
it just looks like we're at work.
You know what l mean?

1116
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,771
We need to get amped up.

1117
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,521
We need to get them interacting.

1118
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,231
You guys should do what
you did at the party last year.

1119
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,900
No. Not doing that. Come on.

1120
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,152
No, that was lame.

1121
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,070
No, no, it was flaping awesome!
People loved it!

1122
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,322
lt wasn't. And they didn't.

1123
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,989
Do it for the company. All right?

1124
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,326
l'm gonna go give Walter
party mouth-to-mouth.

1125
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,577
ls he crying?

1126
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,913
l wanted to give you this pamphlet

1127
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,331
which has a lot of good information

1128
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,833
about the signs and symptoms
of sadness.

1129
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,376
When l'm sad,

1130
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,128
l like to remember something
my grandma used to sing.

1131
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,010
lt's about ducklings.

1132
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,101
Mary, you wore a blue coat, right?

1133
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,936
-No, l wore my beige poof.
-That's it.

1134
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,103
lt's probably not a big deal,

1135
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,188
but l saw Meghan rifling
through all the pockets.

1136
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,108
No, no, no, no.
My Bath & Body Works coupons!

1137
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,360
Walter. Clay vanstone, remember?

1138
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,528
-Hey.
-How are you?

1139
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,572
-l want to show you Zenotek.
-Yes.

1140
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,385
You're a very expressive dancer.

1141
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,137
Thanks. Let me know if you want me

1142
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,639
to dance, like,
sexy or something, you know?

1143
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,056
-Yeah. No, we're good.
-Okay.

1144
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,141
What the flap?

1145
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,103
Hey, there's actually some
guys l want you to meet.

1146
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,188
Okay, great.

1147
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,273
Let's just work out the money
thing first, though, yeah?

1148
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,400
l already gave Trina $200.

1149
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,027
Yeah, that's just for the first hour.

1150
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,989
lf you want me for the rest of the night,
it's gonna be another $2,000.

1151
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,824
-Two grand? No. No way.
-Yeah.

1152
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,244
The website clearly said
it was $200 for the whole night.

1153
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,581
Do l look like l'm $200 a night?

1154
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,375
Okay, fine. l'll go to an ATM, okay?

1155
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,003
-Okay. Give me your watch as collateral.
-lt's my grandmother's.

1156
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,211
l don't care.

1157
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:50,380
shooot.

1158
00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:59,306
Holy shooot.

1159
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,351
That was just how daddy likes it.

1160
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,728
Check it out.

1161
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,688
You're a fireman.

1162
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,943
Must be really nice to have
a daycare center at work.

1163
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,237
Yeah, yeah.
Clay set this up when l was pregnant.

1164
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,907
l think he just wanted an excuse
to have Play-Doh in the office.

1165
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,534
Shall we?

1166
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,289
You are such a good mom.

1167
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,666
Thanks.

1168
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,463
l bet you'd make me
finish all my homework

1169
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,255
before l could go outside and play.

1170
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,342
Yeah, especially
if you were being naughty.

1171
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,344
Do l need to be punished?

1172
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,931
Well, l guess that depends
on your homework.

1173
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,313
l bet you'd make me

1174
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,690
brush my teeth
so l don't get any cavities.

1175
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,985
We're still doing this. Okay.

1176
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,365
l've been a bad boy, Mommy.

1177
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,952
Okay, do you have
some kind of weird fetish?

1178
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,994
What? No!

1179
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,831
No, l'm so sorry,
l didn't mean to give you

1180
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,500
that impression. l just got carried away.

1181
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,751
l just really like you.

1182
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,753
Yeah. l really like you, too.

1183
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,684
Something's happening in my diaper.

1184
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,518
Okay. flap this. l got to go.

1185
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,769
-This is my nightmare.
-What?

1186
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,856
-So, yes, l'm in hell.
-No...

1187
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,440
-So l'm gonna go.
-Mommy!

1188
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,775
l mean, Allison. Don't leave.

1189
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,945
Save that shooot for the
fourth date like a normal person!

1190
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:42,826
Sorry.

1191
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,416
All right, Nate, this is what
you've been saving for.

1192
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,751
Who designed this?

1193
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,836
Come on!

1194
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,882
shooot! flap me!

1195
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,842
shooot.

1196
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,012
Yes.

1197
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,313
l'm okay! Merry Christmas!

1198
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,275
Okay. You ready?

1199
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,237
Okay, you look ridiculous.

1200
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,740
ls it the hat?

1201
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,079
Hey. Merry Christmas, everybody!

1202
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,708
Who's happy about the holidays?

1203
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,382
Okay. Okay.

1204
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,373
Hey, so, you dickheads
want to buy some cocaine?

1205
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,916
Yeah! We'll do that.

1206
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,876
One cocaine. Want to do it with us?

1207
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,590
Yeah! Yeah!

1208
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,639
l believe in taking risks, Walter.

1209
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,141
Zenotek, my company,
believes in taking risks.

1210
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,309
You know what we should do tonight?

1211
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,393
We should do something that scares us.

1212
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,561
Makes us feel alive!

1213
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,063
Do you think you could

1214
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,898
swing across the dance floor
with those lights?

1215
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,358
What's that?

1216
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,527
Like, if you grabbed every single strand,

1217
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,653
do you think that you could swing

1218
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,697
and then time it just right
and grab all of those strands,

1219
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,157
then, like Tarzan,
make it all the way to my office?

1220
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,702
Merry flaping Christmas.

1221
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,413
You know what?

1222
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,164
This has been really great,
and l thank you, but,

1223
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,833
it's time to hit the road.

1224
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,336
You can't leave yet,
'cause we're just getting started!

1225
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,030
Hey! You got snow machined.
That's meant to be lucky.

1226
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,197
lt tastes bitter.

1227
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,574
lt's just paper products.
Let's get you cleaned up.

1228
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,617
Great, great.
So l guess we'll just take two

1229
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,786
and call you in the morning, then?

1230
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:34,039
-ls that...
-Yeah, don't call me.

1231
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:35,998
You on Snapchat?

1232
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:40,795
We'll be up here
if you want to come back up here.

1233
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,797
-l need some air.
-Yeah?

1234
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,965
Also l have your Secret Santa.

1235
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,509
Okay.

1236
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,304
What are you doing?

1237
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,722
Pissing off Mary.

1238
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:55,768
#GreatestPartyEver. #OpenBar.

1239
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:56,978
How do you spell "Hanukkah"?

1240
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:58,980
Wait, who are you sending that to?

1241
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:01,231
You know, everyone in Chicago.

1242
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,362
-You've never been up here?
-No.

1243
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,990
This is where l am during
the sexual harassment seminars.

1244
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,992
lt's beautiful.

1245
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,996
lt's colder up here for sure.

1246
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,166
And it's...

1247
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,501
Man, it's higher.

1248
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,503
That's...

1249
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,422
Maybe let's go... Let's go lower.

1250
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,215
And warmer. Come on.

1251
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,846
No. No, it never locks.

1252
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,474
Wait, no. lt never locks!

1253
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,601
l bet you're also never up here
at night, right?

1254
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,851
No.

1255
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,146
lt's all right, l came prepared.

1256
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,358
So did l.

1257
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,900
Your Secret Santa.

1258
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,277
That's a lot better than
where l'm keeping mine.

1259
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,449
Excuse me. Mr. vanstone?

1260
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,534
-Have you seen this?
-Hi. l'm Rodney.

1261
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,371
We haven't met yet. l'm an intern here.

1262
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,789
l just wanted to say Merry Christmas.

1263
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,583
Yes, you can have a job.

1264
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,085
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, party hire.

1265
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,420
Junior associate. Congrats.

1266
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,380
Oh, my God. Mr. vanstone, thank you!

1267
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,297
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1268
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,925
-Oh, my God. Yes?
-Hey, Rodney!

1269
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,927
We're gonna get you a new name.

1270
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,302
Done! l'll call my parents.

1271
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,972
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1272
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,141
Hey. You okay?

1273
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,976
l was down. l was having a bad day.

1274
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,478
But now l'm lifting.
l'm seeing things. My mind.

1275
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,563
The ideas are flying through my mind!

1276
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,440
-l'm feeling strong.
-Okay, good.

1277
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,985
-High five.
-Sure.

1278
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,737
You can't keep Walter Davis
down forever, baby!

1279
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,119
-Let's go get fucked up.
-Okay, but not too much.

1280
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,619
When l drink a lot, bad things happen.

1281
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,414
You know,
my sister's horse goes missing.

1282
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,373
My car is covered
in horse hair and blood.

1283
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,666
Fingers get pointed.

1284
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,295
Smoke PCP as a favor.
Beach burns down.

1285
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,795
That ain't never been my problem.

1286
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,173
Come on! Let's go get a drink! Yeah!

1287
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:51,050
shooot!

1288
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,759
We're expecting bIizzard conditions
for 12 to 24 hours...

1289
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,885
Just get me on a plane.

1290
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,219
Get me on any god damn plane,
all right?

1291
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,429
l have enough miles to orbit the sun.

1292
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,931
l'm sorry, ma'am.
All flights are grounded

1293
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,016
until the snow clears.

1294
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,309
There's nothing more l can do.

1295
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,561
Well, refer me to someone
who can do something.

1296
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,271
That would be God, ma'am.

1297
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,148
Her.

1298
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,108
Have a great holiday.

1299
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,193
shooot.

1300
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,286
Did you eat my Cinnabon?

1301
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,081
No.

1302
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,708
Where's your mother?

1303
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:07,335
Bathroom.

1304
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:12,257
-What's your name, sweetie?
-Darcy.

1305
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,221
Hi, Santa.

1306
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:22,182
Yes, Carol vanstone.
l'm here with Darcy.

1307
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,601
l know. Terrible name.

1308
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,606
And she's being a little shooot here
in the first class lounge.

1309
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,693
So l think we should cancel
all of her Christmas presents this year.

1310
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,947
Yeah. And while she's asleep,
why don't you take that doll, too.

1311
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,365
Great. Bye.

1312
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:39,992
may I have your attention, pIease.

1313
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,536
Due to inclement weather,
aII flights have been canceIed.

1314
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:43,913

1315

00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,014
Yeah!

1319
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,347
Hit me with the horns, Calvis!

1320
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,726
Old school.

1321
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,188
Make some noise!

1322
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,358
Yeah!

1323
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,155

01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,798

Mary, everybody, yeah!

1335
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,224
You got to stop.

1336
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,351
When I say H, you say R

1337
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,478
-H! H!
-R! R!

1338
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,023
When I say H, you say R

1339
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,233
-H! H!
-R! R!

1340
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,568
And when she says H, you say R

1341
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,987
-H! H!
-R! R!

1342
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,282

Okay, that's part of it. Yeah!

01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,684
She's what makes this company great,

1351
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,478
just like every motherfucker in here!

1352
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,940
When I say freeze, y'aII freeze one time

1353
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,358

Going out to all the ladies

And all the brothers in here!

1357
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,661
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1358
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,260
This is fun, right?

1359
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:07,014
This has turned from charming
into life-threatening.

1360
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,393
l cannot believe that
they are still not responding.

1361
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,896
At least my death will give my parents

1362
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,898
something to talk about
at the meal l'm gonna miss.

1363
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,817
-Going to your parents' place?
-Every year.

1364
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,695
This is where not having any family
actually pays off.

1365
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,572
l get the whole city to myself.

1366
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:25,782
lt's like some kind of
awesome plague came in

1367
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,994
and spared only me
and the Chinese restaurants.

1368
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,746
This is useless.

1369
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,748
You gonna be solo?

1370
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,291
There's not gonna be
a stocking on your mantel

1371
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,126
for Jimmy Butler at your place?

1372
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,130
-What are you doing?
-Nothing?

1373
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,382
Just asking. You know?

1374
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,467
You could have dated me, Josh.

1375
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,927
But you freaked out and ran away.

1376
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:49,014
l still had PTSD
from my marriage just ending, so...

1377
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,726
You'd been separated for a year.

1378
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,981
-l fucked up.
-Yeah.

1379
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,150
Because you're an idiot.

1380
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,068
l'm sorry.

1381
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,447
l have been feeling shitty about it.

1382
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,581
We should've done this
a long time ago.

1383
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,751
-Yeah.
-Right?

1384
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,512
Hey, Jeremy.

1385
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,304
-Hey!
-Hey, man.

1386
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,431
What's up, guys?

1387
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:34,476
Good thing l wasn't
going number two, huh?

1388
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,144
Yeah. Leave you to it.

1389
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:38,898
-This is my territory!
-Got it. That's clear.

1390
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,735
They can't shut us down!

1391
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,237
We're never gonna get shut down!

1392
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,864
When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1393
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,117
-Zeno! Zeno!
-Tek! Tek!

1394
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,369
When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1395
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,746
-Zeno! Zeno!
-Tek! Tek!

1396
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,706
When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1397
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,001
lt's a Christmas miracle.

1398
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:01,711
When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1399
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:04,130
-Zeno! Zeno!
-Tek! Tek!

1400
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,300
When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1401
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,969
-Zeno! Zeno!
-Tek! Tek!

1402
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,764
I Iove this party!

1403
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,934
I Iove this company!

1404
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:18,271
And I want to work with you peopIe!

1405
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:22,858
What did he just say?
Did Clay just close Walter?

1406
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:25,570
He really is Santa Claus.

1407
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,702
Yeah!

1408
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,686
So, Carol.

1409
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,646
You know,
that's my grandmother's name.

1410
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,275
-No, l did not know that.
-Yeah.

1411
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,235
lt's kind of an old-timey name.

1412
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,822
Don't really hear Carol much anymore.

1413
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,117
lt's like, "Hi, l'm Carol.

1414
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:17,204
"l gotta get home
before l miss my stories."

1415
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:18,664
"Hi, l'm Carol.

1416
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,708
"l heard about Pearl Harbor
on the radio."

1417
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,795
"Hi, l'm Carol.
l died in the beginning of Up. "

1418
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,965
That movie?

1419
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,467
Sorry, l'm just nervous.

1420
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:34,639
My first night on the job.
On the ol' J-O-B.

1421
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,806
-lt's your first night?
-Yeah.

1422
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,434
-Driving?
-First night driving the ol' Ubes.

1423
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,771
lt's a pretty sweet gig, though.
Make my own hours.

1424
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,231
You know, l could hook you up
if you want to be an Uber driver.

1425
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,485
l'm good. l already have a job.
Thank you very much.

1426
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,820
Yeah, but you could be CEO
of your own car!

1427
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,739
l am a CEO.

1428
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:53,990
Of Uber?

1429
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:57,244
Oh, my God. ls this UndercoverBoss?

1430
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,496
ls that a camera?

1431
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,164
Am l on... Are you wearing a disguise?

1432
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:02,916
No. This is not UndercoverBoss.

1433
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,710
l am not the CEO of Uber.

1434
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:07,128
l am the CEO of Zenotek.
Please just drive.

1435
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:12,717
No shooot. l just dropped off, like,
four people there at that party tonight.

1436
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:14,844
l'm sorry?

1437
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,347
They gave me three stars
like a bunch of bitches.

1438
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,932
Excuse me. What did you just say?

1439
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,393
-l said they were bitches.
-No, no. What party?

1440
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,438
The party at your office.
Everybody's like...

1441
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:28,108
-You son of a bitch, Clay.
-Yeah, bunch of bitches!

1442
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,860
Can you just...

1443
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:32,112
Can you move? Move!

1444
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,831
The English band, the Optic Monkeys?

1445
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,373
You were supposed to see them
with your friend Lindsey,

1446
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,543
you were like, "l can't go,"
because you couldn't get a babysitter?

1447
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:46,918
Did you hack into my emails?

1448
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:49,547
Get the flap out of here.

1449
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,715
And never use that British accent again.

1450
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,592
Allison, are you okay?

1451
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,721
No! l'm not okay.

1452
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,056
My ex-husband is dating a stripper,

1453
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,141
Drew is cyberstalking me,

1454
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:04,853
and Fred from accounting
is like a human flaping AMBER Alert.

1455
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:09,233
Don't l deserve to date
someone who is nice?

1456
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:10,735
Of course you do.

1457
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,237
Allison, you're an amazing person.

1458
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,739
You basically take care
of this whole office.

1459
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:16,865
And you do it every day,

1460
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,867
even though most people
don't seem to notice.

1461
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,746
So, yeah, you deserve someone nice.

1462
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,248
Baby, l got your text.

1463
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,083
l missed you.

1464
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,918
Come on, let's dance.

1465
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,005
Just hang in there.

1466
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,809
Go, Rodney! Go, Rodney!

1467
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,445
Nate!

1468
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:58,449
Hey, man. Larry from shipping here
actually has a really great story

1469
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,574
that he wants to tell you.

1470
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,911
-l was in the bathroom washing my face.
-Yeah.

1471
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,244
And this girl came in, like,

1472
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,623
-"l'll give you a handy for $40."
-Right?

1473
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:06,998
And the next thing l knew,

1474
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,878
my penis was in her hand
and then she starts...

1475
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:13,672
Okay, Larry,
l know how a hand job works.

1476
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,382
l had no idea you guys were together.

1477
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:16,966
Wait, what are you talking about?

1478
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,470
So Becca gave Larry a hand job
in the men's room.

1479
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,096
God damn it!

1480
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,976
-l'm going next.
-Hey, girl!

1481
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,188
l'm inspired! l'm going next.

1482
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,274
-No, l called it. l called it.
-No, no, wait.

1483
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:35,402
-l'm so happy for you!
-shooot.

1484
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,154
l was about to do my balls!

1485
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,989
Hey! What about the 3D printer?

1486
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:41,742
-Yes. Yes!
-Yeah?

1487
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,327
l'm going first, l'm going first!

1488
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,282
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1489
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:22,783
Excuse me.

1490
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,793
Raise your hands
if you're keeping yourjobs!

1491
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,796
Raise your hands
if you're gonna get a bonus!

1492
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:38,882
Excuse me.

1493
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,259
Clay?

1494
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,801
Clay!

1495
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,636
flap.

1496
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,305
Hey, sis.

1497
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,556
Hey, hey, hey.

1498
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,018
Carol, before you get mad,
listen to what l did.

1499
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,101
l said no party!

1500
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,061
That's all l said.
All you had to do was nothing,

1501
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,398
and you couldn't even do that!
Couldn't even do that!

1502
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,983
Carol, Carol, Carol!

1503
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:57,484
This is not what you think, okay?

1504
01:09:57,569 --> 01:09:58,610
This is all for a reason.

1505
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,070
-Please!
-No, no, no.

1506
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,407
Listen. We threw this party
for Walter Davis,

1507
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,701
and we closed him,
he wants to give us his business.

1508
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:06,827
-We did it.
-See?

1509
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,246
l'm not a failure. l'm a good boss.
The party worked!

1510
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,748
-Walter Davis?
-Yeah.

1511
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,583
-ls at this party?
-That's right.

1512
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:14,667
Where is he?

1513
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,421
l don't know. Where was he?
He was just on the stage.

1514
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:19,006
Guys? Guys!

1515
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,341
That's not good.

1516
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,386
Here we go!

1517
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,930
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1518
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,805
No, no, no.

1519
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,768
-What are you doing?
-Hey, that was my idea.

1520
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,061
-Not relevant.
-Walter? Hey, buddy!

1521
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,021
Why don't you come down
using the stairs?

1522
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,315
No. Clay, it's like you said!

1523
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,443
l want to do something that scares me.

1524
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,612
To feel alive!

1525
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:43,113
Maybe not right now.

1526
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:44,782
What did you guys do to him?

1527
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,367
Let go of those lines, buddy!

1528
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:50,203
l'm the king of lT buyers!

1529
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:57,877
shooot!

1530
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,172
Oh, God.

1531
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,301
So close.

1532
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,974
Hey, Walter.
You were like an eagle up there.

1533
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,059
You were free. You did it.

1534
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,310
Did we win?

1535
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,853
Yeah, we won.

1536
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,730
Zenotek! Zenotek!

1537
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,899
That poor guy. What a day he's had.

1538
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,110
First he gets fired and now this.

1539
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,904
-Wait, what?
-Did you say fired?

1540
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,279
Yeah.

1541
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,157
He got fired
at the close of business today.

1542
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:28,324
He told me, like, two hours ago.

1543
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,077
They shipped
his whole branch overseas.

1544
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,161
What?

1545
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,912
l confirmed it with
my HR Facebook group.

1546
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,288
And they know everything.

1547
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:37,417
Excuse me. Just to clarify,
because l'm detail-oriented.

1548
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,878
So you didn't get a contract
with Walter Davis

1549
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,881
because he didn't have
a contract to give.

1550
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,675
Carol, before you get mad,
here's the thing...

1551
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:45,759
He wanted to work with us.

1552
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,176
-So...
-Clay. Clay!

1553
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,386
Yeah?

1554
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,846
l'm not mad.

1555
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,097
You're not?

1556
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,975
l mean, l was mad
when Dad gave you this branch

1557
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,271
just as a reward for taking
six years to graduate with a degree in...

1558
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,648
What is it?

1559
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,568
Canadian television theory
with concentration in Drake.

1560
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:04,528
But this doesn't make me mad.

1561
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,738
-l feel relieved.
-All right.

1562
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,239
Because it's over.

1563
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,452
-l'm shutting you down.
-Yeah, no, because it's late.

1564
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,787
Allison got a clean-up crew
for tomorrow.

1565
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,041
No, Clay. l'm terminating this branch.

1566
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,585
l'm such a dickhead.
l started to like this place,

1567
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,587
and then l get fucked. l get fucked!

1568
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,881
No, no, no. Stop it, stop it.
Carol, let's take one beat.

1569
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,006
Look, look, Carol. Carol.

1570
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,507
l fucked up, okay, so blame me.

1571
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,926
But these are good people.

1572
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,011
You can't close this branch.
This is Dad's branch.

1573
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,220
Well, you know what? He shouldn't have

1574
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,472
given it to you to flap up.

1575
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,728
And good luck trying to be Mr. Fun Guy

1576
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,729
when you have to fire all these people.

1577
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,565
l'll see you in New York.

1578
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:43,609
Wait, what?

1579
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,109
Did your little friend not tell you?

1580
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,194
He's coming to work for me.

1581
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,404
Yeah, right.

1582
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,654
l never said yes to that job.

1583
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,657
l don't recall you ever saying no.

1584
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:58,332
Clay.

1585
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,833
Clay, l never... Hey.

1586
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,252
Clay.

1587
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,673
Hey, Clay...
You told me you had a two-drink limit.

1588
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,761
Yeah. You're right.

1589
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,014
Now, y'all didn't forget about DJ Calvis!

1590
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,567
l want to go back to the party!

1591
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:30,029
Hey! What the hell?

1592
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,782
l hired you to pretend
to be my girlfriend,

1593
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,992
then you go and give
all my co-workers hand jobs?

1594
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,161
You hired me
to impress your co-workers,

1595
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:37,578
and he was pretty impressed.

1596
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,789
-Listen, l want my money back.
-Well...

1597
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,792
l'm sorry, what was that?

1598
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,961
l couldn't hear you over my gun.

1599
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,171
l... l want my money back.

1600
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,842
l'm sorry. Customer services
are not available right now,

1601
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,136
but perhaps
l can address your grievance.

1602
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,680
Everything's fine.

1603
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,306
Would you say like a five on Yelp,

1604
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,350
or like positive three?

1605
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,854
-Five.
-Five? Alexei!

1606
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,108
This is so funny.

1607
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,944
Do that thing where you pull
his asshole through his face.

1608
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,362
Don't please. shooot!

1609
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:12,655
Santa's gonna get fucked up tonight!

1610
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,033
Who wants to party with Santa?

1611
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,662
-Who the flap is that?
-You know what, that guy is really rich.

1612
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:19,997
And he's really stupid.

1613
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,998
Well, then what are we doing
with Spelling Bee here?

1614
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,708
Get outta here. Go!

1615
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:27,296
Hey, Santa! Wanna party?

1616
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:36,721
Yeah.

1617
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:39,725
No, no, no. This is not... That's not me.

1618
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,475
That's not me. This is the machine.

1619
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,145
The machine's...
The machine's broken.

1620
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,605
lt must've run out of ink. Or...

1621
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,359
Tracey. Tracey. Hey. Excuse me.

1622
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,528
Josh!

1623
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:53,988
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-You saved our marriage.

1624
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,073
Tracey.

1625
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,242
-lt was really shitty before.
-Okay. You're a father, all right?

1626
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,369
Tracey?

1627
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,039
Tracey, are you in here?

1628
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,500
Pardon me.

1629
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:06,752
Hello?

1630
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:09,712
Josh, it's happening.

1631
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:12,757
Good for you.

1632
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,595
Hey, Tracey, which one are you in?

1633
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,181
Hi. Carol offered me a job,
but in no way did l say...

1634
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:21,600
Josh. l get it.

1635
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:23,518
She offered me a job, too.

1636
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,895
-What? She offered you a job?
-Yeah.

1637
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,774
Triple the salary.
An apartment overlooking Central Park.

1638
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,234
l got double and moving costs.

1639
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,654
The real difference is l said no.

1640
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,154
Listen, l'm not fighting
with you about this.

1641
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,489
lt's silly. l didn't take the job.

1642
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,783
Yeah. But you didn't not take it, either.

1643
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:41,328
Because you need a safety net.
Hey, that's who you are.

1644
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,956
l'm happy for you.
You should go to New York.

1645
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,708
ls that what you want?
You want me to go to New York?

1646
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,128
There's a real Human Centipede
situation happening in the men's room.

1647
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,465
Tracey, please. Don't go. l...

1648
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:59,304
Lamb shawarma? Yes, please.
Spit roast!

1649
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,725
-Can l get a drink? Can l please...
-Josh.

1650
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:04,810
Josh, where's Clay?

1651
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,645
Asswipe loses everybody
theirjobs and runs.

1652
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,230
How much did he spend on this party?

1653
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:10,649
He could have just given
that money to us.

1654
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:11,733
Clay sucks.

1655
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:12,900
We should just kill him,
like on that podcast.

1656
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,569
-Hey! Hey...
-Put the Red Bull down.

1657
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,363
Respectfully, flap you guys!

1658
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:18,198
Sorry, that was too much, but...

1659
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,868
Clay cares more about people
than anyone l've ever met.

1660
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,787
He was gonna pay your bonuses tonight

1661
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:24,997
with the last of his money.

1662
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,163
What?

1663
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,748
Yeah, he's broke. Clay is broke.

1664
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,793
Who do you think paid
for that bouncy house in accounting?

1665
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:33,087
Training that dog to deliver the mail?

1666
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,716
The zip-line? Doughnut Fridays?

1667
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,134
lt was all Clay!

1668
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:40,052
He spent all of his money
trying to keep this branch afloat.

1669
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,764
And whenever l would question him
about it, he would say,

1670
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:45,100
"Treat your employees
like they're your family

1671
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,310
"and they'll do great things for you."

1672
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,854
You guys, Clay just left to get drugs
with Becca and her pimp.

1673
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,023
Wait... Who's Becca?

1674
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,190
-Nate's whore.
-Hey, that's his girlfriend!

1675
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,859
Nope, she's right.

1676
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,819
Becca's a prostitute.

1677
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,320
Nice.

1678
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,530
Nope.

1679
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:01,240
Clay left to go get drugs with a pimp?

1680
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:03,577
Yes. She has a gun
and a serious mood imbalance.

1681
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,119
-flap. Carol!
-Yes.

1682
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,203
We have a problem.

1683
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,997
Yeah, you have lots of problems.
Good luck.

1684
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,916
Carol, excuse me.

1685
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,461
Carol! Listen.

1686
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,628
Clay has gone to get wasted
with a psychopath,

1687
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,965
and he's got $300,000
strapped to his chest.

1688
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,885
That really does sound
like a big problem...

1689
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:20,969
For Clay.

1690
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:22,220
You already lost your dad.

1691
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,055
lf you lose Clay, you'll have no one.

1692
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,432
Trust me, that's not a place
you want to be.

1693
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,020
-l don't care.
-What?

1694
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,773
-Oh, boy. This woman...
-What is wrong with her?

1695
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,524
Really?

1696
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,735
Guys! l don't know what to do.

1697
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,029
Clay's not picking up his phone.

1698
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,323
l think l can locate him.

1699
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,074
This is so amazing to meet guys

1700
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,826
we can actually connect with, you know.

1701
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,536
Yeah. Yeah. There we go.

1702
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:47,703
-Amazing.
-Absolutely.

1703
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,831
They're full of shooot, okay?
They're not your soulmates.

1704
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,166
They just hacked your Facebook.

1705
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,835
-That's horseshit!
-Unbelievable. So uncool.

1706
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,420
-Hey, wait!
-No, no, no, girls!

1707
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:57,338
l knew you didn't like the Gilmore Girls.

1708
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,591
Okay, l'm gonna need
both of you assclowns

1709
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,926
to hack into Clay's phone
so we can find him.

1710
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,595
Come on, why would we
help you, dude, seriously?

1711
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,180
Yeah, why would we help you?

1712
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:08,182
Because l'm your flaping boss,
and l'm telling you to.

1713
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:11,185
-He can't touch him!
-l'll allow it.

1714
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,073
There's a car on fire.
Did the Bears win?

1715
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,284
What are you looking at?

1716
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,832
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus.

1717
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,293
Hey, if everybody's fired,

1718
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,171
let's burn this place to the ground, baby!

1719
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,634
Hey! Hey, what department are you in?

1720
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:44,261
l don't work here.

1721
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,429
Let's do this, baby! Who's with me?

1722
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,889
Excuse me.

1723
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,682
flap.

1724
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,277
lf l tell y'all one more time to back up,
it's gonna be a problem.

1725
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,528
l'm not playing with y'all!

1726
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:03,613
Carla! Carla! l need you to go upstairs
and lock this shooot down.

1727
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:04,823
We gotta go help Clay.

1728
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:05,907
flap that!

1729
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:08,201
The security guard
was the first one to go in Die Hard.

1730
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:11,912
Carla, this is the one
you knew would come.

1731
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,164
Be our John McClane.

1732
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:14,832
l'm on it.

1733
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,335
Hey.

1734
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,587
ln case it gets dark.

1735
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,756
Who wants to get Tased?

1736
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,511
Okay, where's your car?

1737
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,430
l took a cab.
l thought we were gonna take your car.

1738
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,555
No, l took the El.

1739
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:33,185
Let's go get our Santa.

1740
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,269
Great!

1741
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:37,354
Come on! No, don't. lt's a lift and pull.

1742
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,149
You're jerking it!
Jesus Christ, let me do it.

1743
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,233
l'm pulling out.

1744
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:42,152
All right. Yeah, it's... lt's locked.

1745
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:43,612
Thanks.

1746
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:46,280
Get in. Come on.

1747
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,242
What'd you get all over your seats?

1748
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:50,534
No, it's from the parrots.

1749
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,287
Relax, it's not poop. lt's some...

1750
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,497
lt's genital secretions.
lt's mating season.

1751
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,541
Should be dry.

1752
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:58,877
Okay. Nate says
Clay's on the South Side.

1753
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:03,465
He is not gonna flap this up for me.

1754
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,176
The board will vote me CEO.

1755
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,054
That is happening.
So let's just do this, okay?

1756
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,974
-Can this thing handle snow?
-Please. lt's a Kia.

1757
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:14,350
lt's what God would drive.

1758
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:32,743
Guys, you know, the thing is,
l told everybody

1759
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,453
they were gonna be okay,
but then they weren't.

1760
01:20:34,537 --> 01:20:37,373
And so, l broke
a Christmas promise, which...

1761
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,167
ls basically the worst thing you can do.

1762
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,253
What? What is this?

1763
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:47,884
"Ten red carpet moments that prove
Jennifer Lawrence is a real sweetheart."

1764
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:49,386
Why?

1765
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,262
Why in this moment is this important?

1766
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,430
Go, go. Go.

1767
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,766
-lt's from vataly.
-What is this for?

1768
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,851
You can't just walk up
and give me money

1769
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,604
and l don't have a sense of
what it's from.

1770
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:02,606
l can't do it.

1771
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,443
l mean, it is so stressful being the boss.

1772
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,903
Nobody ever talks about that.

1773
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:08,154
No. No, not at all.

1774
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,280
And if you want to complain about it,

1775
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,533
everybody's like,
"Boo-hoo you, rich Santa."

1776
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,951
Yeah, no one gives a shooot!

1777
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,287
l can't call people up and be like,
"l'm having a bad pimp day."

1778
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:17,372
See, you understand.

1779
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:20,625
l get clients calling me 24/7.
Middle of the night, 3:00 a.m.

1780
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,045
"Hey, l need anal, like yesterday."

1781
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,212
Yeah, the same with me!

1782
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,922
Except instead of anal, it's data storage.

1783
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,009
Or, "l'm, like, chairing a PTA meeting.

1784
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,760
"Can you have someone blow me
in the gymnasium?"

1785
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:32,429
Yeah, absolutely. lt never ends.

1786
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:35,140
Or, like, "Hey, your girl
just stabbed me in the leg

1787
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,515
"and now l'm bleeding out
in the alleyway."

1788
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,060
l don't relate to that as much.

1789
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,438
lt's mental, right?
How much people lean on you?

1790
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:44,064
And my sister wanted me to be a failure,

1791
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,150
and l was,
so she's not gonna let that go.

1792
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,944
That's the problem of
working with family, though.

1793
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:51,448
-Yeah.
-You can never escape them.

1794
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,824
You can never escape them.

1795
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,534
But you know what,
you're gonna be fine, man.

1796
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:56,661
You know why?

1797
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,662
'Cause you've got all that money, honey.

1798
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:01,416
Yeah, that's the thing. l don't, actually.

1799
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,083
l spent it all trying
to keep the branch open.

1800
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,837
All l have left is $300,000 cash.

1801
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,588
You have 300 grand.

1802
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:08,922
Oh, my gosh.
Whenever l'm that low in my account,

1803
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,675
l'm just like, "Kill me."

1804
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,510
So where is the money?

1805
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,930
-lt's on my person. lt's safe.
-lt's in your personal safe?

1806
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,891
Okay, we're close.
No, no, this is it! This is...

1807
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,144
There's a spot! Right there.
You passed it!

1808
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,773
Careful. Easy.

1809
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,319
That's how you park a minivan.

1810
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:31,945
very impressive.

1811
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,823
Okay, hey, Nate, are you sure
about this address here?

1812
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,618
Yes. 92765 Union Street.

1813
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,372
That's where the pin is.
Red Square Club.

1814
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:44,042
Brian, l can see you flaping on my desk!

1815
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:51,006
-l'll go see what's going on.
-Okay.

1816
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,051
This is it.

1817
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:56,720
Oh, my God.

1818
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,559
Well, maybe he deserved it.
Who knows?

1819
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,976
Here we go, guys. Come on.

1820
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,270
Quickly? Because l don't know
what's gonna happen in there.

1821
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,233
Last year l filed
a sexual harassment complaint

1822
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,400
against myself.

1823
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:11,069
Against yourself.

1824
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:16,032
Andrew, in the copy room,
he was changing the toner.

1825
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,534
And l pretended to drop
something on the ground

1826
01:23:18,993 --> 01:23:20,494
so that l could bend over

1827
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,247
and graze his butt with my nose.

1828
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,332
And l did.

1829
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,756
-That doesn't seem that bad.
-And then l said,

1830
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:35,676
"lf you don't flap me, buster,
l will ruin you."

1831
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,595
That's harassment.

1832
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,514
That's why he quit.

1833
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,266
You seem like you feel better.
Here we go.

1834
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,560
Wait! No, guys,

1835
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,603
we can't go in there looking like this.

1836
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,440
Hey, Carol?

1837
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:51,609
Why don't you give me your coat?

1838
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:09,042
-How we doing tonight?
-Private party. Members only.

1839
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,753
Well, l'm a businessman.

1840
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,340
These are my business ladies
of the night.

1841
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:15,800
You hear what l'm saying to you?

1842
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,010
They only come out at night.

1843
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,470
-Okay. Okay.
-Mostly for parties.

1844
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:27,145
lt's a beautiful language.

1845
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:31,483
Nice, Carol.

1846
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,949
Seems like an appropriate setting
for an emotional rock bottom.

1847
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,412
There's a back room.

1848
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:56,591
Hi. How you doing?

1849
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,592
Have you seen a guy in a Santa suit?

1850
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,761
flap you. l don't tell you anything.

1851
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,346
All right, now listen here.

1852
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,770
Hi. Me again. Where's Santa?

1853
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:11,271
flap you.

1854
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,567
You do not want to die
at the hands of Lululemon here.

1855
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:16,485
lt'd be real embarrassing for you.
You're a large guy,

1856
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:18,988
and she's made of nothing
but salad and Smartwater.

1857
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:21,365
Nope, no tap outs.

1858
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,077
Back door? Thank you.

1859
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,744
-Bitch.
-What?

1860
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:28,706
Was that too much?

1861
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,750
-Just a little.
-l loved it.

1862
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:31,833
Let's go.

1863
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,087
-Hey!
-Oh, God.

1864
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:35,837
Go. l got this. Go, go.

1865
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,422
Okay. Enjoy.

1866
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,885
Come on, let's party.

1867
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:45,180
vin Diesel ain't got shooot on me!

1868
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,890
Clay!

1869
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,018
Wait, what did he say?

1870
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:50,144
l think l know where they're going.

1871
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,311
Let's get the car. Come on!

1872
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,734
Let's go!

1873
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,404
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1874
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,739
Hey, Mary? Mary, get in the car!

1875
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,784
Damn it.

1876
01:26:18,881 --> 01:26:23,011
God rest ye merry gentlemen

1877
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:26,597
Let nothing you dismay

1878
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:31,060
Remember Christ the Savior

1879
01:26:31,145 --> 01:26:34,229
was born on Christmas Day

1880
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:39,152
To save us all from Satan's power

1881
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:42,779
When we were gone astray

1882
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:48,493
Tidings of comfort and joy

1883
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,371
Comfort and joy

1884
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:54,375
Oh, tidings of comfort

1885
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:57,795
Comfort and joy!

1886
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,109
-Oh, God.
-Yeah, l fucked up. l did.

1887
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:21,402
l lost a lot of people's jobs.

1888
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,320
l hurt a lot of good people tonight.

1889
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:24,863
Yeah, totally. Cool story.

1890
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,157
Are we coming up
to your apartment building

1891
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,742
on the left, or the right, or...

1892
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:28,951
We're not going to my apartment.

1893
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:30,243
Yes, we are.

1894
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,037
We are going to your apartment
to go to the safe.

1895
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:34,247
There's nothing safe
about what we're gonna do.

1896
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,083
-What?
-Yeah, it's like you said, you know.

1897
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,293
We need to escape them,
so that's what we're gonna do.

1898
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:40,253
-Red light.
-What the flap are you talking about?

1899
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,421
There's a red light!

1900
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,590
That's a red light!

1901
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:46,761
Yeah!

1902
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,930
We go right through 'em.
They're just suggestions.

1903
01:27:52,975 --> 01:27:54,726
-Can you look at that flap?
-This flaping windshield.

1904
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:55,936
Are you kidding? Not now!

1905
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,105
That's the AC, Josh.
We don't need that right now.

1906
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,148
What about that?

1907
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:00,524
No, that's the recirculating mode.

1908
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,444
How am l gonna run Zenotek
without this Genius Bar?

1909
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:04,779
Carol, you can get up here
and help if you'd like.

1910
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,279
Okay, my seat's getting hotter.

1911
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,282
Mary, why do you even have a minivan?
You don't have kids.

1912
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:09,701
l buy in bulk!

1913
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:11,202
-lt's them!
-Yeah.

1914
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,619
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, good eyes.

1915
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,497
God! What's that smell?

1916
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:17,082
l'm gonna be honest with you,
l have been farting this entire time.

1917
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:22,713
Oh, my gosh.

1918
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,632
Okay, you know what,
take me to your personal safe right now.

1919
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,135
We don't need money
where we're going.

1920
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,469
-Where are we going?
-For glory.

1921
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:29,804
The Clark Street Bridge.

1922
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:31,139
This time of night it'll be up.

1923
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,599
We're gonna jump the bridge
and never look back.

1924
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,024
Okay, new game. Pull over.
Just pull over or l'll tuck and roll.

1925
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,402
-No, no, no. Trina, Trina.
-Just slow down.

1926
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:46,237
Trina, l've been thinking
about this for a while.

1927
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,404
We can make this jump.

1928
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,073
l let a lot of people down,
but l'm not gonna let you guys down.

1929
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,659
We're gonna escape our families
and become anew!

1930
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,994
Pull over right now.

1931
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,872
Or l shoot you in the flaping brain.

1932
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,916
Well, you can't shoot him,
because then he's gonna crash the car.

1933
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,252
Really, Savannah? Really?

1934
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,712
Why don't you put it in an email
and CC everyone, all right?

1935
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,547
Make double sure everyone got it.

1936
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:08,341
You know what, you should
start a podcast, Savannah,

1937
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,802
called "Savannah Says flaping
Stupid Things Out Loud."

1938
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,188
-Clay!
-Clay! Hey, listen, l'm sorry!

1939
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:21,814
l was never gonna take that job.

1940
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:23,190
Not good enough!

1941
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:24,859
Do not jump that bridge.

1942
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,612
l have to do this.
Carol's right, l'm a fuckup!

1943
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,072
shooot!

1944
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,913
Pull over, you flaping idiot!

1945
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,292
Or, the nice supportive version?

1946
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,877
Pull over, flaping idiot!

1947
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:45,128
No.

1948
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,006
Hey, tell him to pull over, lady!

1949
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:51,092
Look. Pull over! Pull over!
Pull over! lt doesn't work!

1950
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,221
-lt's not working.
-None of it works!

1951
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:55,472
Hey, Clay,

1952
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,475
you jump that bridge, l'm going with you.

1953
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,894
What? No!

1954
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,145
-Yes, l am.
-No, no, no.

1955
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,773
Did you say hit it at 80 or 90,
vin Diesel?

1956
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:06,149
-Put it into sport.
-Here we go.

1957
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,238
Josh, l'm sorry that
l said you were safe.

1958
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,573
-You don't have to do this.
-Yes, l do.

1959
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,576
Josh, what are you doing, man?

1960
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:17,578
You go, we all go!

1961
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:19,831
flap.

1962
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,542
l love America!

1963
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:30,550
l am not gonna die in a minivan.

1964
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,469
Hey, hey, hey! Get off the wheel!

1965
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,390
We could've made
that bridge, pantyhose.

1966
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:23,435
Where's Clay?

1967
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:33,738
lt was on your person.

1968
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,078
What did we hit?

1969
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:43,788
The collision severed
the primary fiber line,

1970
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,498
as well as its backup,

1971
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:49,795
paralyzing lnternet, DSL,
and ceIIuIar communications citywide.

1972
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,256
So if you haven't ordered
your hoIiday gifts early,

1973
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:54,466
you may not be abIe to order them at aII.

1974
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,761
l quit, by the way!

1975
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,011
You quit what?

1976
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,387
What, Savannah? What'd you quit?

1977
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,140
Just a couple of normal girls here.

1978
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,850
Move it, move it! Clear!

1979
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:04,100
The lnternet's down.

1980
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,103
My brother needs a doctor!

1981
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:07,771
Ma'am, you're gonna
need to wait your turn.

1982
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:09,314
Can you find someone
that will help my brother?

1983
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:11,900
All of you, just back up!

1984
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:15,363
Back up.
Make a single file line against that wall

1985
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,032
and she will be with you
when she has a flaping minute!

1986
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:30,543
You know, you trying to jump
that bridge was really...

1987
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,880
Brave? That what you were going for?

1988
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,548
No, stupid. l was gonna say stupid.

1989
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:37,592
No, l... l would say brave.

1990
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,595
-A little brave.
-Yeah. Hi.

1991
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:41,930
-Hey, how is he?
-He's fine.

1992
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:46,351
ln fact, the doctor said that the crash
actually fixed a previous fracture.

1993
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,645
He's got... He's got this gift.

1994
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,146
l don't... l don't get it.

1995
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:52,733
-Thank God he's okay.
-Well...

1996
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:55,277
So, maybe you'll reconsider
firing everyone?

1997
01:32:55,362 --> 01:32:57,654
Once it gets out there
that we caused this crash,

1998
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:00,240
the board finds out, my ass is fired.

1999
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:01,324
No one has a job.

2000
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,743
-So...
-Carol?

2001
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:07,622
ls now a good time to exchange
insurance information for the car stuff?

2002
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,626
lt's not. You know,
we would've made it, by the way.

2003
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:12,461
-At the speed you were going?
-Comfortably.

2004
01:33:12,546 --> 01:33:15,131
Please. To make that jump,
with that incline,

2005
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:17,048
you would have had to
at least been going...

2006
01:33:17,134 --> 01:33:18,634
-1 1 0.
-95.

2007
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,012
No, 95.

2008
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:25,224
-lt's simple math.
-Well, okay.

2009
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,268
lt might be simple on paper,

2010
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:30,813
but you're forgetting the wind,
the weight of the Kia,

2011
01:33:30,896 --> 01:33:32,189
the four of us,

2012
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:34,358
bird cages...

2013
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,694
l prefer to call them bird condos,
and so do the birds.

2014
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:40,655
Point being,
you have to adjust your numbers

2015
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,199
to account for real world conditions.

2016
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:46,953
Simple. Or did they not teach
that to you in hacker college?

2017
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:48,329
You're right.

2018
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,457
Thank you.

2019
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:51,332
No, not about that.

2020
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:53,252
Although hacker college
does sound awesome.

2021
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,212
lt's AnywAir. l've been doing it wrong.

2022
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,760
l... l've been treating the power grid

2023
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:02,677
as if it was
a seamless source of lnternet.

2024
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:05,346
lt's not seamless, it's messy. lt...

2025
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,059
But if there was an opportunity

2026
01:34:09,019 --> 01:34:11,061
where the conditions were just right.

2027
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,731
lf we were inside of a vacuum.
lf it was still.

2028
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,900
Oh, my God.

2029
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,153
-An lnternet blackout.
-An lnternet blackout!

2030
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:20,237
Let's get you back to the office.

2031
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:21,363
-Yes!
-Come on.

2032
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:24,199
l'm gonna text you
that claims form, yeah?

2033
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:36,087
-l'm sorry, Mary.
-Go save the company!

2034
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:03,447
Mom?

2035
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,283
Dad?

2036
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:30,932
Oh, my...

2037
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,313
-Hey.
-Hey.

2038
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:41,152
Carla!

2039
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:42,485
-Wassup?
-Morning.

2040
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:45,155
l Tased as many as l could, but...

2041
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,658
Yeah. Well, l actually thought
it was gonna be worse, so...

2042
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:51,787
l see you, bitch! Bitch, l see you!

2043
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:53,581
Your office was locked, right?

2044
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:54,832
Yeah, of course.

2045
01:35:55,167 --> 01:35:57,751
-What... What's happening?
-Did you guys find Clay?

2046
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:08,679
-Sorry. Old habit.
-Sure.

2047
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,724
Okay. So, what...
You're writing an algorithm

2048
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:13,934
that can respond to the grid
in real time?

2049
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:15,685
-That's gonna take...
-Done.

2050
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:17,813
Forever.

2051
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,565
Nate! How's that server bank?

2052
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:22,902
Still covered in beer! Five minutes!

2053
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,737
l hope it's beer.

2054
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:27,405
Hey.

2055
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:28,740
About what happened...

2056
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:30,283
All good. Everyone has their thing.

2057
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,453
l know it seems weird,
but l just crave discipline.

2058
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,078
My family had no set meal times.

2059
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:36,372
Yeah, it's cool.
l don't need your origin story.

2060
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:38,375
Promise me you won't tell anyone?

2061
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:40,711
-l'll do your taxes!
-Deal.

2062
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:41,962
Great.

2063
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:45,341
Oh, my God, the office.
Hey, guys, l got doughnuts!

2064
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:48,344
l got jelly and glazed and...

2065
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:51,680
Some other stuff.
But no Cronuts, that's a bastard pastry.

2066
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:56,810
l still hate your rules.

2067
01:36:57,811 --> 01:37:01,731
But your dancing is wild and free.

2068
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:04,025
Like an unmanned fire hose.

2069
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,988
Put your pants on.

2070
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:12,451
For now.

2071
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,331
Now, we can't fix the lnternet
if we can't get on the lnternet.

2072
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:18,707
Everything is down.

2073
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:20,000
Okay, well, all the phones are working.

2074
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:21,292
What about a dial-up modem?

2075
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:22,711
Great. Now all you need
is a RadioShack

2076
01:37:22,796 --> 01:37:23,878
and a time machine.

2077
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,506
-The G1 had it, right?
-There's one in Clay's office.

2078
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,341
-Great.
-Hey, Josh.

2079
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:29,760
-Yeah?
-Great news.

2080
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:32,054
Jimmy Butler asked me to DJ
his parties, his after-parties,

2081
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:33,805
and his hungover
next-morning brunches.

2082
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,557
Well, that is great news, Joel.

2083
01:37:36,643 --> 01:37:39,103
Actually, it's Calvis now. And forever.

2084
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:40,938
Joel is dead.

2085
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:42,355
Get the desk.

2086
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:44,942
Okay, give me the wires.
Plug it in here. Give me that.

2087
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:47,235
Hey, l could use some of
that giddy-up in HR

2088
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:48,737
if you two ponies
are looking for a new stable.

2089
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:49,947
l am looking for a new stable, Mary.

2090
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,155
Thank you so much. We'll talk later.

2091
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,323
Mary, you're showing a lot of neck.

2092
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:53,449
Breaking your own rules.

2093
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,411
lt's a little skanky, isn't it?

2094
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:57,121
-Plug it in.
-Plugged in.

2095
01:37:57,579 --> 01:37:59,998
l got this DJ equipment,
if you want to use that for something.

2096
01:38:00,082 --> 01:38:01,542
Okay, that's not gonna help,
but thank you.

2097
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:03,210
All right, guys.

2098
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:04,962
What now?

2099
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:07,463
l press "Enter,"
it launches the protocol, and then...

2100
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:08,923
And then everybody gets
back on the lnternet.

2101
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,050
Hopefully.

2102
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:11,885
Or l blow up the power grid.

2103
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,970
-So be ready for that.
-Okay?

2104
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,390
Don't worry about that. Just hit "Enter."

2105
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:17,807
Okay, guys.

2106
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:19,643
Here we go.

2107
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:30,319
Power's still on.

2108
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,072
Yeah, l'm honestly shocked by that.

2109
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,532
No lnternet yet, though.

2110
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:34,615
lt could take a few seconds.

2111
01:38:34,743 --> 01:38:36,493
lf it works,
you'll have a connection alert.

2112
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,619
-No.
-No, nothing.

2113
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:39,954
Nothing yet.

2114
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,833
-No? Anybody?
-No.

2115
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,043
No, nothing.

2116
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:46,127
Josh?

2117
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:47,503
No. Just give it a little more time,
all right?

2118
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,051
Maybe it wasn't ready.

2119
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:53,886
Tracey, hey.

2120
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:55,595
lt's ready.

2121
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:58,306
Still dead. Waiting for it. Still dead.

2122
01:39:04,646 --> 01:39:06,189
-ls that you?
-Got it. Got it!

2123
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:07,231
Oh, my God.

2124
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:09,150
-Yep, l got it.
-Oh, my God!

2125
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,735
-Was that you?
-l got it!

2126
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:11,904
Yeah, l got it, too!

2127
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:15,282
l got mine! Yeah.
Yeah, there's mine. Holy shooot!

2128
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:16,992
-Tracey!
-You did it!

2129
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,266
Work never stops. You see that?

2130
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:44,310
Excuse me. Excuse me.

2131
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,104
Hello, yes. l am happy for you,

2132
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:49,315
but l do need you to sign
a personal relationship disclosure form

2133
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:50,525
before this rounds first.

2134
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,277
No. No, l don't think so.

2135
01:39:52,362 --> 01:39:54,863
Hey, Mary, sign this.

2136
01:39:55,532 --> 01:39:58,283
You know what? l really like you,

2137
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:01,537
but maybe we could get, like,
a cup of coffee first, or something?

2138
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:03,622
Yeah! Totally.

2139
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:06,041
That's what l meant by, "Sign this."

2140
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,042
-You know what? Forget it.
-Okay.

2141
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:21,305
Glass of wine in a family photo?

2142
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,559
Look at him in that suit. What a stud.

2143
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,560
He wore that better than you.

2144
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,979
Yeah, he did a lot of things
better than me.

2145
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:30,439
You're right to be pissed at me.

2146
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:32,109
You know, l always got to do
whatever l wanted

2147
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:34,319
and you always ended up
with the shooot end of the stick.

2148
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,195
lt wasn't fair.

2149
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:39,032
l'm sorry, sis.

2150
01:40:39,576 --> 01:40:41,743
Thank you for that.

2151
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,704
You never got to be the fun one, huh?

2152
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:46,497
-l mean, l could have. Right?
-Yeah.

2153
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,000
-Sure.
-l have... l have a fun side.

2154
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:50,418
l've seen it many a time.

2155
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:51,670
l mean...

2156
01:40:51,753 --> 01:40:53,713
Off the top of my head, l...

2157
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:55,506
Remember that Thanksgiving
that you taught everybody

2158
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:57,341
the real rules of Monopoly?

2159
01:40:57,926 --> 01:40:59,927
With the bidding wars
and the strict time limit and...

2160
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:02,264
-Yeah, that wasn't fun.
-l know.

2161
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:05,600
Hi! My pain is at a 9 or a 1 0 or 1 1 .

2162
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:07,728
Whatever on the chart, the...

2163
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:09,061
That face?

2164
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,354
So can l get some Dilaudid

2165
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:12,524
in another one of those
little gelatin cups?

2166
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:14,943
You can't buy those. l looked it up.

2167
01:41:18,113 --> 01:41:19,614
The lnternet's back up.

2168
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:22,576
What the hell is a Zenotek?

2169
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:24,286
-What?
-What?

2170
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:29,791
Oh, my God! She did it. She did it!

2171
01:41:29,876 --> 01:41:31,542
Shut the flap door!

2172
01:41:31,793 --> 01:41:33,045
l gotta tell you, l was always like,

2173
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,546
"Tracey, this doesn't make any sense,"

2174
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:37,216
and she was like, "Words, words, words
and some numbers."

2175
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,550
But she did it.

2176
01:41:38,635 --> 01:41:39,842
Oh, my God.

2177
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:41,470
Wait. So, this means everybody
gets to keep theirjobs?

2178
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:43,805
-Everybody gets to keep theirjobs.
-Yes!

2179
01:41:44,097 --> 01:41:46,140
God, l am gonna be CEO.

2180
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:48,143
Because you deserve it.

2181
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:50,895
And you throw a great flaping party.

2182
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:53,314
Yeah. l did, didn't l?

2183
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:56,318
-Walter.
-Walter.

2184
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:58,362
-Hello.
-Hi.

2185
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:00,279
-Carol.
-Carol, nice to meet you.

2186
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,573
There's my eagle. Hey.

2187
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:06,328
l just want to thank you
for the best night of my life!

2188
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:08,079
Yeah? Yeah?

2189
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:09,957
l'll see you on Monday.

2190
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:15,087
Well, it looks like
we just hired Walter Davis.

2191
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:18,673
Well, he'll fit right in.

2192
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:23,220
Did you see that?

2193
01:42:25,847 --> 01:42:27,682
-What are you doing?
-Winner!

2194
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:30,143
-We weren't even racing.
-Well, you weren't.

2195
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:32,520
Why do you think
they always make you leave a hospital

2196
01:42:32,604 --> 01:42:33,854
in a wheelchair?

2197
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,194
What are you guys doing here?

2198
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,029
Well, we can't go to breakfast
without you.

2199
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,283
-Come on, we're celebrating.
-Come on, let's go.

2200
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:45,951
l'm in.

2201
01:42:46,034 --> 01:42:48,453
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the morning.

2202
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:51,872
We good?

2203
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:54,792
Yeah. We're good.

2204
01:42:55,295 --> 01:42:57,546
-l'm gonna go back down.
-Your ankle is broken, Clay.

2205
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:59,672
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Yes.

2206
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:01,132
You left this in your room.

2207
01:43:01,216 --> 01:43:02,967
l did. Thank you. l'm sorry.

2208
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:04,636
And also this.

2209
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:07,471
Thank you, Doctor. Here.

2210
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:09,557
No.

2211
01:43:09,641 --> 01:43:10,975
-You guys wanna get out of here?
-Let's go.

2212
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,478
No. l'm not getting in that.
l ordered us an Uber.

2213
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:14,563
Carol?

2214
01:43:14,646 --> 01:43:17,733
l don't mean this in a creepy way,
but get in the van.

No! You cannot have alcohol
on your medication.

2218
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:25,323

Doctor, this is a...
This is a work breakfast.

Doctor, l would never disobey
medical advice.

2230
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,100
Just go, just go.

-Merry Christmas.
-Let's go.

2233

Are you sure? You look like a Carol.

2243
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:26,009
Can you not hear me? Carol!

2244
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:28,095
Carol!

2245
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:33,641

Bunch of bitches!

2247
01:44:36,813 --> 01:44:39,064
You know red lights

2248
01:44:39,148 --> 01:44:41,190
Are you smoking
a marijuana cigarette right now?

2249

Yeah! See, we made it through.
Let's do another.

01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:04,506
Not again.

learn to lie better.

2257
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,274
Your mother's never coming back.

Merry Christmas!

2259
01:45:28,905 --> 01:45:29,948
Okay, l'm gonna suck my dick.

She's gonna suck it on this one, guys.

2261
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:33,909
Guys, can we go back to one
for sucking my dick?

2262
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:41,792
l like it 'cause it looks like
he's trying just a little too hard.

2263
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:42,877
The artist?

2264
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:44,796
l hadn't thought about the artist.

2265
01:45:44,881 --> 01:45:47,340
Was this not where you had the key

2266
01:45:47,425 --> 01:45:49,050

01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:52,720

He used all of his...

2274
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:27,130
He used all of his inheritance.

2275
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:28,881
lt's a hard word to say.

2276
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:33,136
To keep this branch afloat
with his in-her-i-tance.

2277
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:45,689
"Hi, l'm Carol.

Andrew from the copy room
told me that he had mono.

And l said that l wanted to get mono

2283
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:09,838
because l wanted to take
a month off from work.

2284
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,800
And l kissed him deeply.

2285
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,719
And l didn't get mono!

2286
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,640
Okay, reset.
