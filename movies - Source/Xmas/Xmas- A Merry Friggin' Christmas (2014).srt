1
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,597
Santa?

2
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,132
Ahh!

3
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,000
Holy crap, Boyd.

4
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,235
What the hell you doing
back there, buddy?

5
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,804
Waiting on Santa Claus?

6
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,240
Aren't you getting
a little old for Santa Claus?

7
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,575
I'm five.

8
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,343
It's all a sham, Boyd.
The whole Goddamn deal.

9
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,912
I'm the only Santa
you're ever gonna know.

10
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,182
If you know the truth,
it's easy to get through it all.

11
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,852
In fact, let's see
what he brought you.

12
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:04,055
<i>Meet my father,
- Mitch Mitchler.</i>

13
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,891
All we need is
a couple of Chinese workers.

14
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,260
<i>He was a little
bit complicated.</i>

15
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,974
<i>Maybe I was destined to become
an overcompensator as a dad,</i>

16
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,978
<i>Christmas being the most
obvious manifestation of that.</i>

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,140
Alright, here we go.
Okay, lean in, everyone.

18
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>I'm also a realist.</i>

19
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,353
<i>I can't control everything...
the weather, for instance.</i>

20
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,155
Look Dad, it's snowing!

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,356
Well, Bug,
that's actually fake snow.

22
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,091
Because of global warming.

23
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,060
<i>The warmest winter
on record in the Midwest</i>

24
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,962
<i>assured a non-white Christmas.</i>

25
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,800
<i>The bigger issue by far,
was the Santa conundrum.</i>

26
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,836
<i>Vera was very much on
the fence, Santa-wise.</i>

27
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,673
<i>But Douglas still believed.</i>

28
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,973
Dad, why are there two Santas?

29
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,376
<i>But for how much longer?</i>

30
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,911
That guy's not Santa, Bug.

31
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,512
He probably smells
like pee and burnt hair

32
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,913
because he's a welfare person.

33
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:02,948
Vera!

34
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,415
Santa's not real anyway.

35
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,286
Santa's not real, Dad?

36
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,621
Of course Santa's real.

37
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,823
No one's not real.

38
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,926
Everyone's real,
including Santa.

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,264
Vera, a word please.

40
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,100
Whatever you think you know,
Vera, you don't.

41
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,370
Most kids in my class
don't believe in Santa anymore.

42
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,673
But Madison and me...
I mean Madison and I,

43
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,276
we kinda still did,
except that Madison's sister,

44
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,979
the one who did
the BJ to this kid...

45
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,281
Uh, Vera, you don't
actually know what the B...

46
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,252
what that expression
means, do you?

47
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,954
It stands for butt jam,
and I think it has to do

48
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,055
with jamming stuff
up your butt for money,

49
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,424
but anyway,
Madison's sister,

50
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,692
she showed us this website,
nosanta.org.

51
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,062
Well, Madison's sister is
a deceitful little strumpet.

52
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,896
What Dad means
is that it's okay

53
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,633
for you to decide
about Santa, but Douglas...

54
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,968
He absolutely believes.

55
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,135
And we won't want to
do anything

56
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,104
to spoil Christmas
for him, right?

57
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,140
Oh, right,
I won't spoil it for Bug, Dad.

58
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,475
Sorry.

59
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,478
Thank you.

60
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:13,384
You are a very kind
and generous young man.

61
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,687
And you are going
to have a very merry

62
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,658
and special Christmas.

63
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
Oh ho ho ho!

64
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,269
Hey, you wanna...

65
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,408
I wasn't gonna ask
if you wanna smoke meth

66
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,209
or kill a drifter.

67
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,778
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

68
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,447
I just... I'm exhausted.

69
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,483
I'm with you.

70
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,084
I just thought I should ask.

71
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,220
One day we're
gonna have to, right?

72
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,822
Or, we could just enjoy
the slow descent into celibacy.

73
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,298
How many years
do you think Bug has left

74
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,901
where he walks into the
living room Christmas morning,

75
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,704
he sees the tree,

76
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,106
and presents,
his stomach just drops,

77
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,278
because holy crap, Santa came?

78
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:20,451
Can you imagine still having
that kind of belief in magic?

79
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,122
Yeah, it's really cool.

80
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,093
Do you think
you're overcompensating

81
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,096
on the Christmas
thing, just a tad?

82
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,197
Overcompens...
on the Christmas thing?

83
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,132
No! I don't think that
at all.

84
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,401
He's six years old.

85
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,336
Okay, this is
your brother, again.

86
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,805
Pass.

87
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,007
You can't keep pretending
your family doesn't exist.

88
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,242
I'm pretty sure I can.

89
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,944
Come on babe, take the call,
before it wakes the kids up.

90
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,483
Hi, Nelson.

91
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,651
Whoa, that is spooky.
- How'd you know it was me?

92
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,887
<i>We have caller ID,
so your number comes up.</i>

93
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,290
Just right there on the phone?

94
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,291
Boy, that is something.
I gotta look into that.

95
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,892
You know, that's
a miracle of science.

96
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,894
<i>Yeah, you bet.</i>

97
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,363
Hold on one sec, Boyd.

98
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,768
Sorry to call you
so late by the way.

99
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,502
Is it night time
where you are, too?

100
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,805
No, it's 10 here too,
because Chicago and Wisconsin-

101
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,141
What is in the same time zone!

102
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,444
Yeah, we're in
the same time zone.

103
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:23,281
I don't know if you caught
that, I said it like Jeopardy.

104
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,582
<i>So anyway.</i>

105
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,052
Oh, oh, right. So anyway,
I'm calling to tell you:

106
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,355
I scored myself a kid,
a little boy. I'm a dad.

107
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,757
Really?

108
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,923
He seems to have procreated.

109
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,192
Eeww.

110
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,728
I was calling to say,

111
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,262
I want you to be the godfather.

112
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,899
Really?
We would be honoured.

113
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,600
That is just the best, Boyd.

114
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,336
Jeez, that is so...
I know it's short notice

115
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,471
but the baptism's on the 24th.

116
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,774
<i>Oh, absolutely. We wouldn't
miss it for the world.</i>

117
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,841
Sweet.

118
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,343
Uh, January or February?

119
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,312
No Boyd, December.
December 24th.

120
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh, you can't wait for it.

121
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,281
December? What?

122
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:01,853
Nelson, you can't have a baptism
on Christmas Eve.

123
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,721
It doesn't...

124
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,223
Wait that would mean

125
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,262
that I'd have to spend
Christmas with Dad.

126
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,630
I'll smoke in my Goddamn
house if I want to.

127
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,834
It's my house. Name's right
there on the mortgage.

128
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,701
Right there on the mailbox.

129
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,237
His name on the mortgage, Donna?

130
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,038
His name
on the friggin' mailbox?

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,574
No sir, it is not,
didn't think so.

132
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,711
Ipso facto ergo,
not his Goddamn house.

133
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,913
Jeezo!

134
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,848
Man you exhaust me, Mitch.

135
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,615
You know it is
a dream come true for me

136
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,185
to have my family
home on Christmas.

137
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,454
There's no way they were
gonna get a motel room now

138
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,723
at this late date,
and with Boyd's asthma...

139
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,858
Asthma?
Any other restrictions

140
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,427
Captain Wheezy
wants to put on me?

141
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,396
Well, there is one more thing.

142
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,033
I was planning on doing venison
for Christmas Eve supper,

143
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,670
but apparently, Boyd's
family doesn't eat red meat

144
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,737
and I was...

145
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,340
Christ's sake!

146
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,725
Is that all of Douglas' stuff?

147
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,093
Si. What about Vera's?

148
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,761
I hid it
in the car this morning.

149
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,862
Oh, you're aces!

150
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,764
Tu tambien!

151
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,766
So, you ready to see your dad?

152
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,536
Yeah, can't wait. I'm
actually looking forward to it.

153
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:25,836
Really?

154
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,339
No, I'd rather be
sodomized by an angry clown!

155
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,475
I just want the kids
to have a good Christmas.

156
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,576
Me, too.

157
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,912
Dad?

158
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,647
Hey, hi, what are you doing?

159
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,815
Hi, Dougie doodle.

160
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,750
Who's gonna feed
Dale while we're gone?

161
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,784
Oh, that would be...
Farhad.

162
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,787
Who's Farhad?

163
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,888
Mom's ESL student.

164
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,255
What's ESL?

165
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,290
Remember, English
as a second language?

166
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,493
Why don't you tell him, Dad?
I'll race you upstairs.

167
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,573
¶ Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way ¶

168
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:07,111
¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ¶

169
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,914
¶ Dashing through the snow ¶

170
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,317
¶ In a one-horse open sleigh ¶

171
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,619
¶ O'er the fields we go ¶

172
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,955
¶ Laughing all the way ¶

173
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,256
¶ Bells on Bobtail ring ¶

174
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,225
¶ Making spirits bright ¶

175
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,230
Son of a bitch.

176
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,831
Mom, Dad said "bitch."

177
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,568
Bitch is a bad word, Bug.
You can use bastard or ass.

178
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,602
Hey, you guys, come on.

179
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,278
Hey, we're twins!

180
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,447
Ha ha ha, merry Christmas!

181
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,584
Licence and proof
of insurance, please.

182
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,519
Awesome.

183
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,591
So, I did clock you doing
67 in a 45, Mr. Mitchler.

184
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,491
Yeah, the bum deal
about that is,

185
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,495
it's a 450-dollar infraction,
but there is some good news.

186
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,566
You can pay online now,
in the state of Wisconsin.

187
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,902
Yeah, it's a real sweet
website, takes Discover,

188
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,807
so you get the cash back
which, you know, helps out.

189
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,942
Alright, kids,
hope Santa treats you good!

190
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,443
Take care! Merry Christmas!

191
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,080
Merry Christmas.

192
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,749
You bet.

193
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,822
Oh, where the heck
can they be?

194
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,889
Oh, don't get
your knickers in a knot.

195
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,158
You having a good time, Dad?

196
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,927
Oh yeah, I'm delirious.

197
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,928
I want some milk.

198
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,030
You have to wait 'til supper
like the rest of us, Cale.

199
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,365
Where is the sex offender?

200
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,567
He's not a sex offender!

201
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,571
What should I call him
then, Willy Wanker?

202
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,572
With the help of
our marriage counsellor,

203
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,542
me and Dave have worked
through his transgressions.

204
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,679
So my husband, Dad,
is outside smoking a heater.

205
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,327
Dad, Rance is being a gomer!

206
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,296
Hey you guys, cut it out!

207
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,931
Where the hell did you
get that thing from?

208
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,500
I took it.

209
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,861
Well, put it the hell back
from where you took it from!

210
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,408
Thank you.

211
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,577
Aw, crud,
I can't find my camera.

212
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,212
Mitch, go look for it,
will you?

213
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,115
For cripe's sake,
we're not National Geographic.

214
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,616
They're not some
bunch of bonobos.

215
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,352
Mitch, they have never
been here for Christmas.

216
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,087
Well, whose fault
is that? Not mine.

217
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,655
Boyd's the one who thinks
he's too good for us.

218
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,359
Having my family here
means everything to me.

219
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,028
So quit being such an a-hole,

220
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,397
and go look for my G-D camera!

221
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,501
They're here!

222
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,705
Shut up, tramp stamp!

223
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,076
Mitch, hurry up, Boyd's here.

224
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,844
Boyd!

225
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,144
Hey!
Oh, honey!

226
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,679
Mom!

227
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,282
I love you.

228
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,517
I love you.
It's great to be home.

229
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,653
You are looking fine as wine.

230
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,456
Can you believe it, Boyd,
all of us together at Christmas!

231
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,524
I know, it's great.
Well, where's the Nel?

232
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,793
Nelson and the baby
are meeting us at church.

233
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,028
Gotcha.

234
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,097
Isn't this perfect,
Boyd? This is perfect.

235
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,139
Stop! Don't hurt me!

236
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,606
Don't... don't...

237
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,948
Dad, you okay?

238
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,517
I'm fine.

239
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,586
You're welcome,
anytime. You're family.

240
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:43,260
You okay?

241
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,662
Puba!

242
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,865
Dougie Doodle!
How are you, little bugger?

243
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,801
Everybody get together
for a quick photo,

244
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,269
and then we gotta
get ready for church.

245
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,274
¶ That glorious song of old ¶

246
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:02,614
¶ From angels bending
near the earth ¶

247
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:08,318
¶ To touch their harps of gold ¶

248
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,793
¶...goodwill to men from
heavens all gracious king ¶

249
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:21,166
¶ I really don't
know the words to say ¶

250
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:26,370
¶ So now I don't have to sing ¶

251
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,445
Uh, well, of course most of
you remember my wife, Cindy,

252
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,947
and might have known
that when I was in basic,

253
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,918
over by Fort Digs, she ran
off with this Mexican guy,

254
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,822
who played a little minor
league ball for the Wombats.

255
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,024
Uh, pretty halfway
decent shortstop.

256
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,195
Anyhow, he got her pregnant,
this Mexican guy did,

257
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,530
so Cindy comes by
the house one day, and goes,

258
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,265
"Hey Nelson,
would you mind

259
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,568
"looking after the baby
for a while?"

260
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,638
And I said,
"Yeah, yeah sure, no sweat."

261
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
And anyhow, that was
six months ago

262
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,642
and I still got
this kid of hers, so.

263
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,578
He don't have
a name that I know of,

264
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,514
so I've just been
calling him Baby.

265
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,517
But you know, he is
a real, real good boy.

266
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,986
And uh, that's why
I want to name him Boyd,

267
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,455
after my own big brother,

268
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,758
who is just
a heck of a good guy himself.

269
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,595
So, I am presenting
Boyd Jr.

270
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,798
as a candidate
for holy baptism.

271
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,371
Except I figure
I'm gonna call him BJ.

272
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,576
Welcome to the family, BJ.

273
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,279
Dear God,
I look around this table,

274
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,115
and I see a family.

275
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,515
I know we're not perfect,
Lord God,

276
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,318
even though some people
think they are.

277
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:53,191
We've all got foibles,
peccadilloes if you will.

278
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,326
I'm not gonna name names, Dave;
it's not the time or the place.

279
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,830
Anyhow I just want to
say, thank you, Lord Jesus,

280
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,732
Lamb of God, for bringing
us together here.

281
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,433
And now each one of us
is gonna say something

282
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,903
they're thankful for.
Donna, do it.

283
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,772
Oh, uh,

284
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,475
I'm thankful little
BJ's christening went okay.

285
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:16,114
But mostly I'm thankful
we're all here together.

286
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,849
That's a dream for me.

287
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,950
Skol.

288
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,884
Skol!

289
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,519
It's a prayer Donna,
not a toast, come on.

290
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,489
Shauna, you're up.

291
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,256
Oh. Uh, I'm grateful

292
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,528
that through the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

293
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,996
I'm able to forgive all of you

294
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,099
for all the pain
you've caused me,

295
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,536
and, thanks to me and
Dave's marriage counsellor,

296
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,272
uh, we are back
on the marriage train,

297
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,143
and we are gonna ride it all
the way into the station.

298
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,510
Right?

299
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,614
Well, I got one.

300
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,914
I thank God that
he gave me the ability

301
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,783
to give 110 percent,
and take first

302
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,351
for the WISEA
under-fourteen regionals.

303
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:58,623
WISEA stands for Wisconsin
Competitive Eating Association.

304
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,427
Rancer ate 27 Johnsonville
brats in five minutes.

305
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,063
That's a lot of brats.
- Way to go, Rance.

306
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,902
That is... uh,
that is really neat.

307
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,270
Let's give it the devil, Rancer.
Come on, pound these back.

308
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,706
Go, Rancer!

309
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,506
Go, go, go, Rancer!

310
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,278
Get it. Go-o-o, Rancer.
Go, go, go, Rancer.

311
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,390
That's what I'm talking about!
Come on!

312
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,960
Wow, that is
really, really neat.

313
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,894
How many hot dogs
can you eat, Dougie doodle?

314
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,797
We're not allowed
to eat hot dogs.

315
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,732
We're a macrobiotic household.

316
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,801
For crying out loud,
Boyd, what's this crap?

317
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,403
You're gonna turn your kids
into a couple of beatniks.

318
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,071
Our kids are fine!

319
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,139
I know they're fine.
- I'm just saying,

320
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,674
you don't want your boy
to turn into a Sally, do ya?

321
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,110
Don't tell me
how to raise my kids.

322
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,211
Don't tell me
what to do in my house!

323
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,115
Is your name on the mailbox?!
I didn't think so!

324
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,950
Oh really,
the mailbox line again, Dad?

325
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,785
Great, you sparked
Nelson's PTSD.

326
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,155
Post-traumatic
stress disorder.

327
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,726
When things get tense,
Nelly gets a little squirrely.

328
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,296
He has to go into
a dark, quiet space.

329
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,298
It's from the war.

330
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,000
What war, Mom?

331
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,568
He fell out of
the back of a Humvee

332
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,936
during basic training
and was discharged.

333
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,140
A head injury!

334
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,777
He got a head injury
serving his country!

335
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,916
Okay.

336
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,391
Mmm! What...

337
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,994
Why are there shotgun
pellets in my chicken?

338
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,663
Dad.

339
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,000
Because it's squirrel.

340
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,877
Honey, no, we're not leaving.

341
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,582
He fed me a rodent
for Christmas dinner.

342
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,884
Well, you're the only
one who ate squirrel.

343
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,854
Ours was really chicken.

344
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,355
You did say that
you could handle anything

345
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,257
as long as the kids
were having a good Christmas,

346
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,826
and the kids are having
a great Christmas.

347
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:22,365
Think you can just flex
those emotional muscles,

348
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,303
just a little bit,
and think of Douglas?

349
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,710
I want some more dessert!

350
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,654
And that's how
you make 50 dollars an hour.

351
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,089
Puba?

352
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,092
Yeah, Dougie?

353
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,726
I want us to leave Santa
a snack,

354
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,261
but Rance ate all the cookies
in like, 10 seconds,

355
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,263
and then he drank
a whole gallon of milk.

356
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,798
Whoa.

357
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,434
So, I was wondering
if you had anything else

358
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,403
that I could give to Santa?

359
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,607
Of course I do, Bug.

360
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,741
I know something
that Santa loves

361
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,943
a lot more
than milk and cookies.

362
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,817
Dear Santa, Puba said you
would enjoy this bourbon

363
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,753
and asparagus.
I hope you like it a lot.

364
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,523
Love, your very good
friend, Douglas Mitchler.

365
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:23,227
¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ¶

366
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,864
¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ¶

367
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,066
¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ¶

368
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,002
Whoa, that's pretty neat, Pam.

369
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,137
I know, I've got
over 75 hits so far.

370
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,840
Your average is zero stars
'cause you suck, turdbait.

371
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,976
Shut up, jackwipe!

372
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,713
Hey, that's not very
Christmassy behaviour.

373
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,182
Gather up.

374
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:51,255
So, we have a tradition
in our family

375
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,791
where we read
<i>The Night Before Christmas</i>

376
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,328
the night before Christmas.
Get it?

377
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,964
This is mentally challenged.

378
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,767
Do you think
this is a joke, Rance?

379
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,868
This isn't a joke.
This is Christmas.

380
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,871
We're not two, Uncle Boyd!

381
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,539
I mean, all this
Santa crap is for babies!

382
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,509
Every dumbass knows
there's no such thing!

383
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,843
Shut up!

384
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,445
Shut your mouth!
Shut your big, eating mouth!

385
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,913
Right now, shut it!

386
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:23,421
Santa will find
me here, right Dad?

387
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,355
Of course he will, Bug.

388
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,224
In fact, Santa
just texted me to say

389
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,728
that he made you
an amazing present!

390
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,798
But you're gonna have to wait
until morning to see it.

391
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,903
Okay.

392
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,572
Look at this pile of crap.
- This country's so damn excessive

393
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,074
it makes me wanna puke.

394
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,742
Oh put a sock in it,
Mitchler.

395
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,011
Well, they're all down.

396
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,279
Oh that's super, honey.

397
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,281
Good job.

398
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,618
Where's Douglas' stuff?

399
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,020
Oh gosh, buried
in there somewhere.

400
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,730
Everything's out of the car?

401
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,530
I got the last
of it out of there.

402
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,165
Well, none of it's here.

403
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:14,137
None of Douglas'
presents are here.

404
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:21,811
No, that's impossible.

405
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,647
You put them in the car
this morning.

406
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,115
I didn't, you did.

407
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,651
No, you gave me the thumbs up!

408
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,551
Meaning you do it,
and you nodded!

409
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,621
Wait, what are you two saying?

410
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,922
Boyd...

411
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,457
Not Boyd, Luann!

412
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,559
Boyd and I left all of
Douglas' stuff in Chicago.

413
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,362
Oh, jeez.

414
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,298
It's gonna be fine!
- We'll think of something!

415
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,067
Right?

416
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,569
Uh, oh I have an idea.
Uh, what's it called, Toys "R"...

417
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,138
Us.

418
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,574
Babe, the mall closes at six,
all right?

419
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,108
Just sit there and look pretty.

420
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,311
Okay, listen, Randy Sickle
over there in Commercial,

421
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,945
they're open 24 hours,
we'll go over there,

422
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,315
pick him up maybe one of
those singing bass plaques

423
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,816
and a mesh hat.

424
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,218
Hey, come on, he's seven. Throw
in a pack of grape hike shoes

425
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,887
boom,
it's done. What do you say?

426
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,490
The kid's never gonna know the
difference. "Christmas, hey!"

427
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,559
That's exactly
what you would do!

428
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,194
Nice parenting, really nice!

429
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,263
Last time I checked, it
ain't exactly great parenting

430
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,200
ruining your kid's
Christmas, Prime Time!

431
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,169
I should knock
you on your ass.

432
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,337
Oh really? Bring it Sally!
I'd love to see you try!

433
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,538
Come on!

434
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

435
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,013
Now if we're gonna do this,

436
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,682
we're gonna need
some ground rules.

437
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,218
I'm going. I'm driving back.
It's not even 11.

438
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,920
That gives me eight hours
until he's up. I'm going.

439
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,421
Boyd, don't go!

440
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,490
You can't do it,
it's too far!

441
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,292
He's not going anywhere,
Donna, he's all show and no go.

442
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,766
Boyd. Boyd, stop.

443
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,736
You've had four hours of sleep.
You're gonna kill yourself!

444
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:54,637
Any day now,
Douglas is gonna wake up

445
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,107
and realize the world
is a mean, nasty place

446
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,675
where your hopes and dreams

447
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,912
eventually get smashed to bits.
Until then, he needs this.

448
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,713
I'm sorry, who needs this?

449
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:08,251
If I can just make him
believe for one more Christmas.

450
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,887
Having Christmas
is not about stuff, Boyd.

451
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,655
Look, just wait.
Okay, go tomorrow,

452
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,424
when you've had some sleep.

453
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,826
We'll say that
we delayed Christmas a day.

454
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,096
We'll make it fun.

455
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,400
I understand. Mitch
ruined Christmas for you,

456
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,903
but you have proven
a million times over,

457
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,705
you're not him.
You're such a great dad.

458
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,107
This is just crazy!

459
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,611
Hey, hey.

460
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,012
Look, you're running away
from your father again!

461
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,914
You can't keep doing this!

462
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,550
Boyd, wait, I'm coming with you!
- Let me just put up some coffee!

463
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,119
It's about
an eight-hour round trip,

464
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,222
which gets me back
here at what, sevenish,

465
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:50,094
so just make sure the kids
stay downstairs until 7:30.

466
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,561
This is doable,
but I gotta go now.

467
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,564
Be careful, honey!

468
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,842
Merry Christmas.

469
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:34,104
I made this ornament
when I was a kid once,

470
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,540
out of a pine cone.

471
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,777
It had the googly eyes on it
and the white cotton deals,

472
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,010
you know
what I'm talking about?

473
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,480
Shut the hell
up, you degenerate.

474
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,279
Pervert.

475
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,949
He's not a pervert!

476
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,750
A guy who exposes himself
to a busload of old folks

477
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,153
on their way to Oneida bingo,

478
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,653
what the hell should I call him
if not pervert?

479
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,323
Friggin' pillar
of the community?

480
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,557
I have explained this situation
to you a hundred times.

481
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,527
In Dave's defence,
he was drunk!

482
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,327
Very!

483
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,828
And in his second defence,

484
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,765
someone double-dog dared him
to do it, so that...

485
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:05,169
Okay. Who wants to look at
some slides? Or, I know,

486
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,971
how about a game of cribbage?

487
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,106
Oh, I've got that.

488
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,410
Hello?

489
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,179
Is it him?
- Is he okay? What happened?

490
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,147
He's fine, but...
Aw crud.

491
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:23,086
Dammit.

492
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,104
Looky here. BMW.

493
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,574
Short for
Bavarian Money Waster.

494
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,375
Looks like the sheisse
hit the fan here.

495
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,809
I'm gonna hitchhike.
Really?

496
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,679
Christmas Eve,
no one's gonna pick you up.

497
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,813
Come on, let's go.

498
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,382
I'm not giving up.

499
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,182
You go ahead and go
home. I don't need you.

500
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,318
Yeah, but Douglas does.

501
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,155
So come on.
Get in the truck, Gladys.

502
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:03,160
We got Christmas to save.

503
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,979
¶ Silent night ¶

504
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,713
¶ Holy night ¶

505
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,089
¶ All is calm ¶

506
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,292
¶ All is bright ¶

507
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:43,267
¶ Round yon virgin ¶

508
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,337
¶ Mother and child ¶

509
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,743
¶ Holy infant ¶

510
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:57,714
¶ So tender and mild ¶

511
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:05,388
¶ Sleep in heavenly peace ¶

512
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,028
It don't add up, boy.
- You got a guy tootin' around

513
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,196
the whole Goddamn planet
in one night.

514
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,799
That sleigh'd have to be going
25, 30.000 miles per hour,

515
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,068
minimum. Now, if we had
that type of technology, shooot,

516
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,039
we'd be blowing the tits
off the friggin' Viet Kong.

517
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,340
It's all a sham.

518
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,541
Sham.

519
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,478
Sham.

520
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,446
What the heck's
up with that son of a B?

521
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,914
You know what he is, right?

522
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,717
Sham.
Damn right.

523
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,853
What kind of creep goes
sneaking into a kid's room

524
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,055
and putting chump
change under a pillow?

525
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,490
What the hell's he need
all those teeth for? Pervert.

526
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,294
The whole world
is full of lies, Boyd.

527
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,729
The only road to happiness

528
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,965
is realizing there's no road
to happiness.

529
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,367
Alright, I'm going to bed.
You finish it up on your own.

530
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,905
Oh yeah, eat me!

531
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,682
First off...

532
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:09,219
And second,
I have asthma, Dad, asthma.

533
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,623
And it is not
all in my head,

534
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,791
as you have so astutely
hypothesized in the past.

535
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:17,094
It is an actual
medical condition

536
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:18,695
that could actually kill me.

537
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:23,299
So please,
put out the damn cigar.

538
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,170
What the hell's that all
about? You on the friggin' rag?

539
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,738
Come on.

540
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,586
Come on, lighten up, Boyd.

541
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,055
We got all night ahead of us.

542
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,925
Let's have a little fun here.

543
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,000
I bet they're having a ball.

544
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,569
Yeah, yippee!

545
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,306
It does make me feel better
that Mitch went with him.

546
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,108
Them two hate each
other's guts, I thought.

547
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,178
Okay, cut it out,
you guys, we're a family.

548
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,513
And it's Christmas, jeez.

549
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:13,250
You know, Mom, I, uh,
don't want to make you feel bad

550
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,019
with what I'm about to say,
being that it's Christmas

551
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,222
and all but, a lot
of this is your fault.

552
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,923
Dave and I's marriage counsellor

553
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,960
says that a lot of
my self-esteem problems

554
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,128
come from the fact that
you never confronted Dad

555
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,698
about his drinking.

556
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,467
So it's why I seek approval

557
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:33,202
from people who treat me
like wet dog crap.

558
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,805
Who needs anything?

559
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,808
We've got leftovers,
we've got hot dish. Beer?

560
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,977
Reeb me!

561
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,512
That's beer spelled
backwards, honey.

562
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,721
Vera.

563
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,924
Yeah, Bug?

564
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,460
Was Rance about to say

565
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,422
that there's
no such thing as Santa?

566
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:02,732
Rance is a certified
moron, Douglas.

567
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,535
So whatever he was about to say

568
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,203
would have been
certified moronic.

569
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,272
Of course there's a Santa.

570
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,606
Promise?

571
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,308
I promise.

572
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,112
When you see your presents
under the tree in the morning,

573
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:18,080
you'll believe again, you will.

574
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,384
Now lie down.

575
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,490
Okay.

576
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,910
Wow, 53 degrees.
So much for a white Christmas.

577
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,578
Who needs one?
Yesterday I was golfing.

578
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
You would have caught
me in my shirtsleeves.

579
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,982
Kicked Bill Gorsky's
ass, the fat pollack.

580
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,952
I said "if this is global
warming, I'll take it."

581
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,453
Pollack. Nice, Dad.

582
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,689
Technically he's a bohunk.

583
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,624
I got more if you need 'em.

584
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,961
Hi, uh, where's the...

585
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,797
Just past the cheese.

586
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,409
I can guess your nationality
without even seeing you.

587
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,510
European.

588
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,579
You get it?

589
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,147
You're a-peein'.

590
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,884
Ha, yeah, got it.

591
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,852
Ho ho ho.

592
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,154
Hey, you got any bourbon?
Just a...

593
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:34,892
I wish I did, sorry.

594
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,094
That's okay, that's okay.

595
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:44,468
So, you having yourself
a merry little Christmas?

596
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,837
I wouldn't say that exactly.

597
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,307
Well, nobody said it
was easy now, did they?

598
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,009
I mean, take my journey
here tonight.

599
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,576
I mean, logic-wise,

600
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,144
that whole deal doesn't really
add up, does it?

601
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,913
I mean my sleigh'd have to be
doing what,

602
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,183
25, 30.000 miles an hour?
Minimum?

603
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,525
But I always make it.
Somehow I always do, you know.

604
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,093
I mean, it's not always
easy, like I say,

605
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,194
but miracles never are.
They're tricky little things,

606
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,263
miracles. Sometimes they look
at you right in the face.

607
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,999
They're right in front of you,

608
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,667
staring at you in the mirror,
and you didn't even see them.

609
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,803
It's crazy.

610
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,571
Um...

611
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,508
Have a merry
Christmas, Santa.

612
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,410
I always do, buddy.

613
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,612
I always do.

614
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:32,982
Have fun in there.

615
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,483
I'll name it after you.

616
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,019
Hi, can I get
a couple of coffees?

617
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,056
That's your old man?
Virgil Mitch. Ole Mitch, huh?

618
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,423
Yeah, I'm Boyd.

619
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,625
You're Boyd!

620
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,527
Yeah, you're the smart one.

621
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,896
You got a full ride
at the UW.

622
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,398
And now
you're a stockbroker, is it?

623
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,067
Down in Chi-town?

624
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,336
I manage a hedge fund.

625
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,070
Oh yeah, that's right.

626
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:56,906
But your dad tells me
you make a truckload of money.

627
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:59,209
I don't know about that.
I work too much.

628
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,547
Well, anyhow, nice
to have a face with the name.

629
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,482
Your pop, that crazy old
son of a,

630
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,118
he's in here pretty near
once a week,

631
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,122
and I get an earful
about your family.

632
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,256
Uh-oh.

633
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,857
No! Mitch talks a blue streak

634
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,594
about how good you're doing.

635
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:22,865
Must be nice for y'all to have
Christmas together, ain't it?

636
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,867
Uh, it is.

637
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,671
What do I owe you?

638
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,405
No, come on.

639
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,009
Merry Christmas now, Boyd.

640
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,010
Merry Christmas.

641
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:55,932
You know how to
drive a manual, tranny?

642
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,035
You don't remember

643
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,137
the day you taught me
how to drive a stick?

644
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,806
Should I?

645
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,042
October 26, 1983, you may
recall, was my 12th birthday.

646
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,844
You may also recall
that you were too hammered

647
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,715
to drive home from my party,

648
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,884
so I drove home.

649
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:16,085
Is that right?

650
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,887
Well, I must have been
doing something right,

651
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,755
'cause you still remember how.

652
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,391
Yes, it is one of
life's greatest indignities

653
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,327
that you never won
the Father of the Year award.

654
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,731
Hey, careful!

655
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,500
Can't you take a joke, Sally?

656
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,235
Now you're pissing me off.
- Let's just get this done.

657
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,905
Maybe you need to
piss on the radiator.

658
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,106
Whoa, what was that?

659
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,144
Tit.

660
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,248
Want me to go peek in on BJ?

661
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,516
No, I'll do it, Shauna.

662
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,351
Wait a second, where's Nelson?

663
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,021
Last time I saw him
he was going ape-crap

664
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,621
because Mitch
and Boyd were scrapping.

665
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,157
Well, that was two hours ago.

666
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,092
Oh shoot, Nelson!

667
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,195
Nelson!

668
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,797
Nelson.

669
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,101
Nelson, baby, come on.

670
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,170
Nelson.

671
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,842
Nelson.

672
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,612
Where are you?

673
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:19,349
Oh, he's not where
he usually goes.

674
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,751
Whenever he gets panicked
he just falls asleep

675
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,887
in the craziest places.

676
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,023
I found him all balled up in
the middle of the road a coup...

677
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,061
Oh my God.

678
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,963
Nelson!

679
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,931
Where are you, baby?
Wake up!

680
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:36,766
Nelson!

681
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,235
Nelson!

682
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,369
Nelson! Where are you,
Nelson? Wake up!

683
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,038
Donna, be careful!

684
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,273
Nelson!

685
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,976
Nelson!

686
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,445
Oh... oh, dear Lord Jesus.

687
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,646
¶ Jingle all the way ¶

688
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,449
No, you can't sing low.
I know, high.

689
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:54,951
¶ Wayyyy ¶

690
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,019
Oh no, stop, stop, stop!

691
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,824
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride ¶

692
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,826
Dude, you just hit something.

693
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,394
¶...open sleigh ¶

694
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,001
Good night.

695
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,204
Put your hands down
and let's do this.

696
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:17,873
Ahem, I love you ve...
I love you very much.

697
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,242
Let's go, come on.
See?

698
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,311
Mom, has Santa come yet?

699
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,914
No honey, not yet,
it's still early.

700
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,048
Santa's got a long
night ahead of him.

701
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,518
Can Dad tuck me in?

702
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,119
Who? Dad?

703
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,757
No, because, uh,
Dad and Puba...

704
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
are getting massages.

705
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,731
Oh, okay.

706
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:42,965
Good night, Mom.

707
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,501
Okay, good night.

708
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:56,846
So who else isn't tired?

709
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,518
Oh, I forgot to ask you.

710
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,753
Did Santa Claus
accost you in the bathroom?

711
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,188
Excuse me?

712
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,456
You know, the grubby
old guy in the Santa suit

713
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,291
in the truck stop bathroom.

714
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,195
I didn't see anybody
in the bathroom.

715
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,534
Santa's coming home soon.

716
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,771
Gonna bring
you lots of gifts.

717
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,181
Oh, son of a bitch!

718
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,315
Oh!

719
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,018
I forgot to tell you,
the speedometer's off

720
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,318
by about 10 miles an hour.

721
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,521
Oh it's good to know that.

722
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,365
Well I'll be!

723
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,635
Merry Christmas, Mr. Mitchler!

724
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,168
Again.

725
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,438
What brings you gents
out so late?

726
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,806
Well, numbnuts here forgot
his kid's presents in Chi-town.

727
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,010
Numbnuts, that's funny.

728
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:04,481
Haven't heard that one
in quite some time!

729
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,248
My foster mom, she, uh...

730
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,219
Oh, I see you guys are in the
portable john business, huh?

731
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:11,153
Indeed we are, sir.
Mitch Mitchler,

732
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,822
North Central Wisconsin
king of the crappers.

733
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,490
For 25 years,

734
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,092
Mitchler's Handi-crappers have
been supplying luxury johns

735
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,760
for all your business needs.

736
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,429
I always say,
if you gotta go, go in style!

737
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,697
I like that a lot.

738
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,733
Do you guys do family reunions?

739
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,402
My cousin actu...

740
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:29,572
We're actually in a really
big hurry, Trooper Zblocki, so.

741
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,940
I could tell, Mr. Mitchler.

742
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,422
Caught old numbnuts
here doing 91.

743
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:37,579
I'll be back
with your citation, STAT.

744
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,115
Numbnuts.

745
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,987
Funny little elf.

746
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,961
Well, Mr. Mitchler, I did
clock you doing 91, yikes!

747
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,565
It's like, "Arriba,
arriba, andele, andele!"

748
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,467
Bart Simpson.

749
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:04,273
But, it's Christmas,
so you know what?

750
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,943
I got candy canes
for you three guys.

751
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,610
Three?

752
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,487
Nelson?

753
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,889
Jeez, I must've
fell asleep in here.

754
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,994
Who's that guy?

755
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,567
A child is the most important
thing a mother has, Nelson.

756
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,304
Jeez, I'm sorry
I had you worried, Mom.

757
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,572
If anything
had happened to you...

758
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,108
Aw, jeez.

759
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,242
Mom, could you put
little BJ on the phone?

760
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,510
I want to tell him I'm okay.

761
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,913
He's sleeping
in his crib, hon.

762
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,583
Plus he's not even a year.

763
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,853
Well, maybe just go in
there and tell him I love him?

764
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:54,523
And, uh, could you sing him that
pretty little song he likes?

765
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,195
¶ Hot tortillas,
crisp tostadas ¶

766
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,331
¶ Best in Me-hi-co ¶

767
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:06,635
¶ Enchiladas, empanadas ¶

768
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:11,074
¶ How I love them so ¶

769
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,545
It is a miracle
that you got pulled over,

770
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,349
because I could have froze
to death in there, or worse.

771
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,217
Not cold enough
to freeze to death.

772
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,186
Okay, real quick,
what could possibly be worse

773
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,355
than freezing to death
in a portable toilet, Nelson?

774
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,692
HIV, AIDS, Lou Gehrig
disease, cancer, spina bifida...

775
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,061
Okay, all good ones.

776
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,097
I could think of one worse.

777
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,632
A guy getting his gonads
lobbed off by his wife

778
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,835
because he forgot his
kid's Christmas presents.

779
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,315
Get 'im!

780
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,682
I'm not supposed to
play video games,

781
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,585
but you're really
awesome at them, Rance.

782
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,952
Yeah, I know.

783
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,054
We should totally put your
picture on Craigslist, Vera.

784
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,958
Your judgement
is really questionable, Pam.

785
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,101
You gonna stay up
with us, Dave?

786
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,269
Oh no, I, uh...
I get hungry at night

787
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,206
so I like to make myself a meal
so I have something to eat

788
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,407
between sleep and breakfast.

789
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,742
I call it breep.

790
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,311
Okay.

791
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,811
It's an anagram I came
up with, much like brunch

792
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,682
or NASA. It's a way for me
to remember what I like.

793
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,688
Hon, let's go hit the sack.

794
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,356
Good night.
Night.

795
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,492
Night.

796
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh, Daver.

797
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,661
Oooh!

798
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,764
You are too good for me.

799
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:54,177
You know, maybe I will try

800
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,777
one of those
beer-tomato-juice thingies.

801
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,481
Well now you're talking.
One red beer coming right up.

802
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,523
Holy cripes, it's a castle.

803
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,393
You really
are doing alright, Boyd.

804
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,969
You've never seen
this house before?

805
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,237
No, your mom has.
Last time I was here,

806
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,740
you had that apartment
by the lake.

807
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,143
It's going on seven years.

808
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,079
What's this you got
on the walls here?

809
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,547
Is that brick?

810
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,750
Yeah, it's...
uh, it's a brick house.

811
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:39,389
Boy, that is something.

812
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,590
Yeah.

813
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,971
Son of a bitch!

814
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,039
I left my damn keys
in my damn car!

815
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,449
Hey Hamburglar,
will this help?

816
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,427
The presents
are in the mudroom, so...

817
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,329
Hey Boyd, I gotta
take a squirt.

818
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,099
You guys have a bathroom, or...

819
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,134
Yeah, it's upstairs.

820
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,869
Make yourself at home, Dad.

821
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,871
Yeah.

822
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,871
Dad?

823
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,873
Nelson?

824
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:28,664
What's going on?

825
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,800
What are you doing in my house?

826
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,735
I am Farhad.

827
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:37,239
Who are these people?

828
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:40,476
Ms. Mitchler is say,

829
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:44,780
my family to sit in the house,

830
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:48,251
to feed dog...

831
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,552
there, the dog.

832
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,889
To sit in the house.

833
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:58,460
House-sitting is different
than sitting in my house!

834
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,931
Ah, it's Boyd.

835
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,900
Hi, is everything okay?

836
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,235
<i>Fine, okay.
- Farhad is here.</i>

837
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,905
Yeah, I gave him the key
so he could feed Dale.

838
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:10,972
You knew that.

839
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,708
No, but his whole family
is here.

840
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,911
It's like Goldilocks
and the 30 Iranians.

841
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,648
Boyd, they're from Afghanistan.

842
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,916
I don't care
where they're from,

843
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,050
I care why they're here,
in my house!

844
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,318
Ooo, maybe there was confusion

845
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,820
over the translation
of house-sit.

846
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,889
<i>You know,
they're an amazing family.</i>

847
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,291
They've only been
in the country two months,

848
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,061
so, whatever, let them
have a nice Christmas.

849
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,695
<i>You're not saving the world!</i>

850
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,199
What do you think, you're, uh...
you think you're Bono?

851
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:37,733
I have a law degree!
I'm a teacher!

852
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,036
You're supposed to be
teaching refugees English,

853
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,637
and based upon
my conversation with this guy,

854
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,706
it's not exactly
working out, is it?!

855
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,675
If anyone's
to blame, it's you!

856
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:47,976
You for being an ass sponge!

857
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,311
I'm the ass sponge?

858
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,581
Yes, you are
the ass sponge, ass sponge.

859
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,782
I'm not having
this conversation.

860
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,317
I am not having
this conversation.

861
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,585
Fine.

862
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,987
Oh my God!
He acts like the sweetest,

863
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,391
nothing-bothers-me guy, but
the slightest little pressure

864
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,693
turns him into a total...

865
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:05,976
Ass sponge?

866
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,097
He sounds
just like his father.

867
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,666
You know, in case those
guys don't make it back

868
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,469
in time somehow,

869
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,639
maybe we oughtta have
something else for Douglas.

870
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:17,672
Like what?

871
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,742
Maybe we oughtta
go up to the attic

872
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,778
and wrap some old toys
and that, just in case.

873
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,181
Yeah, okay fine.

874
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:28,150
Donna, do you have
something else

875
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,686
that maybe
doesn't taste like... this?

876
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,155
Vodka?

877
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,891
Hey Doug-lass, you wanna
do something really cool?

878
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,693
Yes!

879
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,128
Sweet.

880
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,130
You know, I wasn't
a competitive eater

881
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,498
'til I was like, nine.

882
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,000
If I would have started
at seven,

883
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,802
who knows how much more
friggin' awesome I'd be?

884
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,572
Ah, let's see how fast you
can take these bad boys down.

885
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,306
A whole jar of pickles?

886
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,509
Do it.

887
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,579
Please don't,
Douglas, it's stupid.

888
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,047
You'll be sick for Santa!

889
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,983
You want to be cool
or retarded?

890
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,152
Man or mouse, Douglas?

891
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,023
Yes! Oh my God! Look at him go!

892
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,231
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug!

893
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,798
Douglas, stop!

894
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,302
These pickles were canned
during the Nixon Administration!

895
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:22,137
You're gonna die!

896
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,340
I can't feel my legs.

897
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:40,021
What the hell?

898
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,905
He erased me.

899
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,643
Ain't that a kick
in the pants?

900
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:06,014
Presents. Gifts.

901
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,048
Ho ho ho?

902
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,085
Gift?

903
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,320
Gift, yes, yes.

904
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,322
Thank you.

905
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,224
No, Farhad.

906
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,927
Those are Douglas' gifts!

907
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,429
My son! Douglas.

908
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,164
No Farhad son!

909
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,400
No! My son's gifts!

910
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,003
Girls, those are
my power tools!

911
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,538
That's Boyd's power drill
and that is very...

912
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,007
Ahhh! Jesus!

913
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:34,876
Hey, Boyd.
These your roommates?

914
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,646
Hey Boyd, you got a nail
sticking out of your hand there.

915
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,356
Oh, we've been learning Nari,
which is kind of like Farsi,

916
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,157
over at basic
because my reserve unit

917
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,260
was going to be going over
by Afghanistan...

918
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,762
Oh!

919
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:53,996
And I fell off
of that Humvee,

920
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,532
and I got just a touch
of brain damage.

921
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:59,635
But the part that remembers
Nari is just fine.

922
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:04,273
So, can you tell him
that his family can stay?

923
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,541
I just need Douglas' gifts.

924
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,744
Well, I can sure as shoot try.

925
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,547
Let's see, uh...

926
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,989
Please, no, no.
- No, no, no, please!

927
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,925
Hey, hey.

928
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:26,262
Hey, hey, it's okay.
You can keep everything.

929
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,230
The only thing I want

930
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,032
is that.

931
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,092
Hey, it's, uh, 3:45,
so we have less than four hours

932
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,427
if we're gonna get back
before the kids get up.

933
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,628
So I need you to motivate.

934
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,266
You don't need me;
you never did.

935
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,447
It's all gonna be okay, Bug.

936
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,983
Boing!

937
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:24,619
It's okay, Bug.

938
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,454
Boing, hello Rance!

939
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,858
They told me there'd
always be people like you.

940
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,293
I don't know,
I've never seen anybody

941
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,695
this way from pickles!

942
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,297
Rotten food can cause
hallucination, Rance.

943
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,965
Everybody knows that, you dummy.

944
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,235
It's gonna be okay,
Bug, just lie down.

945
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,809
Mmmm, cheese.

946
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,947
How about this for Douglas?

947
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:57,552
Bridge, like the card game?

948
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,021
For kids?

949
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,056
I don't know,
it seems like a horrible idea.

950
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:04,460
Boyd loved bridge for juniors,
it was his favourite game!

951
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,327
He did?

952
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,630
Okay, bag it and tag it,
I guess.

953
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,768
That was Mitch's
drink of choice.

954
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,438
Vodka and cranberry juice.

955
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,773
It must have been so hard.

956
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,175
I don't know.

957
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,512
I left a couple times
when it got too hard.

958
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,146
Took the kids
to my folks,

959
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,650
then when his bender
was finished,

960
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,485
he'd call bellyaching,

961
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:34,489
"Come back, come back.
I'll change, I'll change",

962
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,192
blah, blah, you know.

963
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:41,597
He was always...

964
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,266
a very attentive lover,
though.

965
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,668
If you know what I mean?

966
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,003
I do. Yes, wow.

967
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,309
Boyd and I haven't had sex
for six months.

968
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,744
Oh, wow.

969
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,246
That is bad for you.

970
00:51:57,248 --> 00:52:00,248
It's so bad.
It's just, you know,

971
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,751
he works all the time,
and... or we're tired,

972
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,853
or the kids are around
and you know, it just...

973
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,588
But then he has
this whole thing

974
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,858
about how everything has to be
so perfect, and it can't be.

975
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,192
It's not. It's not perfect.

976
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,094
Do you want me
to talk to him for you?

977
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,697
No, that's okay, thank you.

978
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,699
That would feel
a little inappropriate.

979
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,505
Yep.

980
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,706
What?

981
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:42,157
<i>¶ Two days later,
Papa passed away ¶</i>

982
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,126
<i>¶ And I became a man that day ¶</i>

983
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,463
<i>¶ So I told Mama
I'm gonna quit school ¶</i>

984
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,344
I packed
my grandmother's trunk,

985
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,746
and in it I put an apple.

986
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,148
Nice.

987
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,284
God, we used to play
that when we'd drive

988
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:10,385
to Nana's cottage
up north, you remember?

989
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,887
Mm-hm.

990
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,856
Okay, I packed
my grandmother's trunk

991
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,360
and in it I put
an apple and a bagpipe.

992
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,762
Nice one.
Okay Dad, you're up.

993
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:24,365
Dad, it's your turn.

994
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:27,570
Come on Dad,
it's been a crap day.

995
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:30,405
Everything that possibly could
go wrong already has.

996
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,844
What, you on the rag, Sally?

997
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,516
I packed my grandma's trunk,
and in it I put an apple,

998
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,353
bagpipe,

999
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,922
and a kid
who's so ashamed of his old man,

1000
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,123
he cut him
out of a family photo.

1001
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:52,894
Okay, so you're spelling
kid with a C then.

1002
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,530
Uh, fair enough.

1003
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:56,731
I don't know what to say, Dad.

1004
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:02,271
Fine, as long as we're being
honest with each other,

1005
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:06,175
yes, I was embarrassed
of you in that photograph.

1006
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:08,943
You were wearing that filthy
Handi-crapper T-shirt

1007
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,981
for a family portrait.
I mean come on!

1008
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:14,396
What, you're suddenly sensitive?

1009
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,789
Besides, it's not like
you were ever proud of me.

1010
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,257
I always supported you,

1011
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,860
whatever it was
you wanted to do, always!

1012
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:27,396
Are you high?

1013
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,465
What is that?

1014
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,436
Oh my gosh!

1015
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,438
Hoho!

1016
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,780
Is that...

1017
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,449
Bea Arthur? It sure is.

1018
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,784
Why?

1019
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,119
Boyd went through a phase

1020
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,721
where he really
got into Bea Arthur.

1021
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,722
Like is... like sexually? Or...

1022
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:57,458
No!
It started with<i> Golden Girls.</i>

1023
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,963
Wait, he liked bridge
and<i> Golden Girls?</i>

1024
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,931
What did you raise,
a 75-year-old woman?

1025
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,034
Look, there's a whole series.

1026
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:09,271
You know how what's-his-futz
just painted blue stuff?

1027
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,907
Well, Boyd only
painted Bea Arthur.

1028
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,143
This is so silly.

1029
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,445
My Boyd who played
football and basketball,

1030
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:19,148
who's a type-A
hedge fund manager?

1031
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,449
No, no!

1032
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,052
He was real arty-farty
when he was a little shaver.

1033
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:25,820
Well Mitch
must have loved that.

1034
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,856
Mitch, he used to
tease Boyd all the time.

1035
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,190
I felt terrible about it.

1036
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:31,994
He drilled legs
into the frame of this one.

1037
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,362
He turned it into a card table.

1038
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:37,298
He used to play euchre on it
with his drinking buddies.

1039
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,702
Look, there's the rings
from the glasses

1040
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,438
on the canvas, there.

1041
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,840
And I think Bill Gorsky
puked on it here.

1042
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,141
That is so mean.

1043
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,043
Isn't that so mean?

1044
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,713
Lookit, that is so mean!

1045
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:53,648
He was just a little
artist, creating his art,

1046
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,184
and that's... I mean,
it just makes me very sad,

1047
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,485
isn't that so sad?

1048
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,956
Boyd never really
painted much after that.

1049
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,523
Mitch is a bastard!

1050
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,226
And I have been trying to
get those guys to reconcile,

1051
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,628
but do you understand
how much Boyd hates his job?

1052
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,931
He hates it so much,
and all he wanted to do

1053
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,599
was be a sweet little
Bea Arthur painter!

1054
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,936
Or something.

1055
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,338
I just feel like I could puke.

1056
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,340
It blows my mind.

1057
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:22,077
You have the capacity to
feel sorry for yourself!

1058
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,644
Oh, what a jackass.

1059
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,181
If I loused up so bad, how
come you have such a nice life?

1060
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,717
Nice house,
nice wife, nice job.

1061
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,219
I hate my job!

1062
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,487
And I haven't had sex
with my wife in six months!

1063
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,757
And you blame that on me?
Jiminy crickets!

1064
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,391
Jeez, come on, guys!

1065
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,693
I'm sorry I didn't snuggle
or cuddle you enough!

1066
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,795
I'm sorry I'm not perfect!

1067
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:41,996
Perfect?

1068
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,266
My entire approach
to parenting

1069
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:48,804
is based on what I call
the WWMD principle.

1070
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:51,239
What Would Mitch Do?
I ask myself that question,

1071
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:54,175
and then I do
the exact opposite.

1072
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,677
Come on Boyd, you know I
get jittery 'cause of the war!

1073
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,146
You didn't go to war!

1074
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,047
He's still a hero!
He's still a hero!

1075
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,586
Son of a bitch!

1076
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,190
No, no, no, no, no!

1077
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,793
No, Boyd, slow down!

1078
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,262
We can do it.

1079
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,545
Not sure if you can see
me back here, Mr. Mitchler...

1080
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,934
See that?
See it!

1081
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,702
Come on, Boyd,
you're gonna get us killed!

1082
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,137
Pull over, Boyd!

1083
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,907
My whole life I've never
been your kind of man,

1084
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,775
a man's man, a real man.

1085
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,380
Well, let's see who the real man
is now! Hold on!

1086
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:45,360
Shut up, Sally.
You sound like a little bitch.

1087
00:57:56,672 --> 00:58:01,143
Yeah, suck on that, Zblocki!
Suck on that! Eat it, bitch!

1088
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,512
Yes, yes!

1089
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:04,980
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1090
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,248
Uh, yeah.

1091
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:09,985
Umm, I'm out at uh...

1092
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,688
Mr. Mitchler, he...

1093
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,056
<i>, everything okay?</i>

1094
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,494
Eff this.

1095
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,862
Just wanted to wish you
a merry Christmas, Don!

1096
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,931
I'm calling her a night.
Gonna head home to the fam.

1097
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:26,134
<i>Roger that.</i>

1098
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,342
Oh God, that felt good!

1099
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:37,545
You're not this guy, Boyd.

1100
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,081
You're not some idiot who'd
run away from a cop like that.

1101
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,018
Hell, that's the kind of
asshole stunt that I'd pull.

1102
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,219
You got
the asshole part right.

1103
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,527
Maybe you're right about that.

1104
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:01,769
This has been a weird night.

1105
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:05,574
I'm sorry.

1106
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,311
I'm sorry to both of you.

1107
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,179
Mainly you, Boyd.

1108
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:15,250
I'm sorry.

1109
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:17,952
Suppose I might
have said it sooner

1110
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,255
if I hadn't been so hammered
for most of the last 30 years

1111
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:22,224
but you know?

1112
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,626
There it is, I said it.

1113
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,567
You're a good man

1114
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,003
and uh,

1115
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:37,739
I'm so sorry.

1116
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,550
I'm sorry, oh!

1117
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,818
What the hell was that?!

1118
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,621
Did we hit somebody?

1119
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,724
I'm telling you, Boyd,
that was a person!

1120
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:58,492
Nelson, it wasn't a person.

1121
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,094
It can't have been a person.

1122
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,630
What would a person be doing
in the middle of the road...

1123
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:05,067
Maybe it was a deer.
Yeah, it was a deer!

1124
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,367
It wasn't a deer.

1125
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,570
Yes, of course it was a d...

1126
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:12,773
Oh no.

1127
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,425
Oh God, oh my God, oh my God!

1128
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,996
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

1129
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:35,664
Okay, Boyd, just calm down.

1130
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:39,800
Calm?! Calm?
I just killed a man!

1131
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,737
This is not the time to be calm!

1132
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,605
We just gotta...
we just gotta call the cops.

1133
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,539
No, we're not gonna call the
cops! I just outran the cops!

1134
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,541
The last thing
we need are the cops!

1135
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,811
Boyd's right, no cops.
My life is over!

1136
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,278
No it isn't!

1137
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,315
I'm gonna go to prison.
I'm going to prison.

1138
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,083
Boyd, just glass-half-full
it for a sec here, okay?

1139
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,320
Prison these days
is not half bad.

1140
01:00:58,322 --> 01:00:59,987
I'll take the heat!

1141
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,856
I mean, come on now,
it's the least I can do,

1142
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,824
you know, being shitfaced
and emotionally abusive

1143
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,126
most of your childhood.

1144
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,394
No, Dad, no.

1145
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,097
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1146
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,900
Boyd, Boyd, Boyd!

1147
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:13,869
There's other ways out of this.

1148
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,103
How?

1149
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,072
This guy, uh...

1150
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:18,606
We're not exactly
talking doctor,

1151
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,489
lawyer,
Indian chief here, right?

1152
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,844
He's off the grid.

1153
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,347
So if he umm, disappeared.

1154
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,518
I got this friend, Mike Marcort.

1155
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,086
You know, we play cribbage,
and he owes me

1156
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,989
and uh, he's got a warehouse
down by Campbell Sport

1157
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,159
full of HCl.

1158
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,559
HC what, Dad?

1159
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,262
Hydrochloric acid.
And so?

1160
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,764
Well, you know, I'm saying...

1161
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,498
not that he doesn't have
value in God's eyes;

1162
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,768
I'm just saying that we soak
this guy in a vat of HCl

1163
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:47,936
for a couple of hours?

1164
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,304
This son of a bitch
will just fizzle away.

1165
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,672
Wait a minute.

1166
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,809
We're not really
thinking about this?

1167
01:01:54,876 --> 01:01:56,344
He's right, Dad.

1168
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,547
Nelson's right.

1169
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,552
We don't have time
to go to Campbell Sport.

1170
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,755
You're right, it's too far.
What was I thinking?

1171
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,425
Dad, do you have a shovel?

1172
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,626
Does Flipper pee in the sea?
I got that!

1173
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,161
No, no, guys...

1174
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,764
Well, do you have
a better idea?

1175
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:17,465
Do you? Because
I'd love to hear it.

1176
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,333
No, but have you ever
dug a foxhole before, Boyd?

1177
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,204
Because I have and it
takes a super long time!

1178
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,237
Oh, he's right!

1179
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,440
Nelson's right.

1180
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,146
We could... we can burn him.

1181
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:33,481
You know, like a fire.

1182
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,550
Burning could work,
burning's good!

1183
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,219
That's good, Nel...

1184
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,255
What's going on, Dad?

1185
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,590
If we're gonna burn him,
it's a hell of a lot easier

1186
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,791
if you parcel him out.

1187
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:01,675
You got any bourbon?

1188
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:08,349
Hey, Doug!

1189
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,085
Dougie doodle.

1190
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,253
Who said that?

1191
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:15,856
Bingo.

1192
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,025
You can talk?

1193
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,793
You're seeing
my lips move, ain't ya?

1194
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,362
Well then, that would constitute
talking, wouldn't it?

1195
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,864
Is this a dream?

1196
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:26,300
"Is this a dream?" Maybe,
maybe it's a dream,

1197
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,036
or maybe I'm your subconscious,

1198
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,304
secretly trying to
unearth truth for you

1199
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,641
in the form
of a waking hallucination.

1200
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,643
Listen Doug, let me
get to the gristle

1201
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,878
of why I woke you up
here. It breaks my heart

1202
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,949
to tell you this, but
Santa ain't gonna find you,

1203
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,751
not here, not anywhere.

1204
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,652
Why not?

1205
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:47,856
Because he doesn't exist.

1206
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,126
Yeah, don't take
it so hard, buddy.

1207
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:55,096
As you get older, you'll learn
there are much worse things

1208
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,597
you could be told

1209
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,668
than some fat guy
in a red suit doesn't exist.

1210
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,503
Alright then,
sleep tight, kid.

1211
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,974
And oh uh, Merry Christmas.

1212
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,414
Radiator's shot.

1213
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:17,385
Who ya calling there, Boyd?

1214
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:18,686
Luann.

1215
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,521
Let her know
we're not gonna make it.

1216
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,190
Not gonna make it?

1217
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,092
Hold on a sec, Boyd.

1218
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:27,695
Hey look, I know that
we have been through a lot,

1219
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,599
well, me getting stuck
in the john

1220
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:32,967
and you getting pegged with
a nail gun by some kid,

1221
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,268
and running from that cop,

1222
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,469
and trying to figure out
different ways

1223
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:38,072
to dismember a transient,

1224
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,909
but it's Christmas,
and if we quit now,

1225
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,846
it's like the baby Jesus died
up on that cross for nothing.

1226
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,981
I think
that's Easter, actually.

1227
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,684
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're right, you're right.

1228
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:52,786
My point is, you know,
I suppose I don't know much

1229
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,923
about being a father yet,
since BJ's only been around

1230
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,025
a couple of months
and he's technically

1231
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:01,396
some Mexican's, on top
of that but, you know,

1232
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:05,000
what I seen you do today, Boyd...
go to the ends of the earth

1233
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,601
for your son like that...

1234
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:09,871
jeez, that's what being
a father's all about.

1235
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:13,074
And I just don't think
you should quit now.

1236
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,844
There's still time.

1237
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:34,695
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry we
almost killed you back there.

1238
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,733
I don't suppose you have
a vehicle we could borrow?

1239
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:41,635
'Cause we're about
10 miles from where

1240
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:44,539
we're supposed to
be here, and um...

1241
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:49,077
I don't know how else
to put this, except...

1242
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:52,012
we're hoping for
a friggin' Christmas miracle.

1243
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:03,425
¶ Fall on your knees ¶

1244
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:06,494
¶ Oh, hear the radiant
voices calling ¶

1245
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:09,530
¶ Oh God, oh God ¶
¶ Boom, boom, boom ¶

1246
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:15,670
Oh, shoot!
Luann, are you okay?

1247
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,871
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1248
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:27,916
Yeah!

1249
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,985
Come on you guys, wake up!

1250
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,987
Let's go up
and see if Santa came.

1251
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,945
They're breathing. Come on!

1252
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:13,193
Come on, whoa, whoa!

1253
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,599
See, I told you Santa's real!
Now we can find our stuff.

1254
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,706
Pull up there, there!

1255
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,907
What do you
think you got, Bug?

1256
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,811
I don't think I got anything.

1257
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,152
We can't thank you enough.

1258
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:40,387
Merry Christmas,
it's been a flight!

1259
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:52,833
Where you goin', they're up?

1260
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,835
Yeah. He's up. All the kids
have their presents.

1261
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:56,237
So what, go on in there
and give him the thing!

1262
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,639
He'll know
there's no Santa, Dad!

1263
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:13,153
Maybe Santa took your presents
to the wrong house, or...

1264
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,621
No.

1265
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,123
There is no Santa.

1266
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:19,159
Look.
Puba said he loved bourbon.

1267
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,279
Merry Christmas.

1268
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,203
Good luck.

1269
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:05,439
Oh!

1270
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:06,740
No Douglas, don't!

1271
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:22,689
You must be Douglas.

1272
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,292
Are you Santa?

1273
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,793
Oh, yes indeed. Yes, I am.

1274
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:28,997
Why'd you drink
all that bourbon, Santa?

1275
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,398
Won't it make you drunk?

1276
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,402
Well, Douglas,
bourbon gives Santa the energy

1277
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:38,139
that he needs to keep
his appointed rounds.

1278
01:09:39,307 --> 01:09:41,609
And asparagus.
Puba told me that.

1279
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,779
Yep, asparagus, too.

1280
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,814
Smart fella.

1281
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,882
Oh my goodness,

1282
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,818
I almost forgot your present.

1283
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:54,521
Merry Christmas, Douglas.

1284
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,057
Thank you, Santa.

1285
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,393
I believe.

1286
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,162
And I hope you always do.

1287
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,001
Santa, don't you
want your asparagus?

1288
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,604
That's okay,
Douglas, you keep it.

1289
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,805
Asparagus makes
my urine smell funny.

1290
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,042
Merry Christmas.

1291
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:23,451
I think it was a big success.

1292
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:27,654
On second thought

1293
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,856
this may have not been
such a hot idea.

1294
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:36,597
No matter how this pans
out, you tried your best.

1295
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,766
Bottom line, you're one
hell of a good dad, Boyd.

1296
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,805
Thanks, Dad.

1297
01:10:52,914 --> 01:10:54,414
Merry Christmas, Bug.

1298
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,019
Dad, why did your
massage take so long?

1299
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:01,421
Let me help you.

1300
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:06,560
Nice wrap job there.
- What is it?

1301
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:07,996
What do you say?

1302
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,363
I built it, the whole thing.

1303
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,198
I even sanded
the runners myself.

1304
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:13,667
It's really something.

1305
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,869
Really something.

1306
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:19,774
Wow, it's pretty cool, huh?

1307
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,975
Hmm, neat, but no snow.

1308
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,645
Let's see what else there is.

1309
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,412
Uh, hej Bug!

1310
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,814
Uh, look,
I found this outside for you.

1311
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,783
Santa must have dropped it.

1312
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,128
Bridge for juniors!

1313
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:44,298
I've always wanted to
learn how to play bridge!

1314
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:46,199
Woo-hoo, alright!

1315
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:47,935
Neato, look at what I got!

1316
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:53,707
I'm sorry.

1317
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,810
I'm drunk.

1318
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,712
I remain sorry.

1319
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:00,914
And I accept your apology.

1320
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,621
Oh for cripe's sake,
Boyd, get a Goddamn room

1321
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,155
if you're gonna be doing that.

1322
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,791
Dave's the designated
pervert in this family.

1323
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,993
He's not a pervert!

1324
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,380
Hey, hey!

1325
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:34,381
Rancer!

1326
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:39,753
You think I would
have known better.

1327
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,456
Oh, I suppose.

1328
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,323
But if we always learned
from our mistakes,

1329
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,525
nobody'd ever spend
Christmas with their family.

1330
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:49,363
What the hell good is getting
a sled in this day and age

1331
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,065
of global warming? You should
have got the kid a boat.

1332
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:55,269
Shut up, Dad.

1333
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,537
Dad, can we go inside
and play some bridge now?

1334
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:25,099
Look Dad, it's snowing!

1335
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,635
You're right, Bug.

1336
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,636
Probably ash.

1337
01:13:48,856 --> 01:13:51,324
¶ More, more, more, more ¶

1338
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:54,328

¶ You're like the sun ¶

1343

01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:28,462
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

1350
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:31,231

¶ Ring, ring ¶

1354
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,712
¶ I hear the birds ¶

1355

¶ Sing, sing ¶

1356
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,716
¶ Sweet Noel ¶

1357
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:54,721
¶ Peace for everyone,
be all good cheer ¶

1358
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:59,327

01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:37,257
¶ And he's drivin' a
big green bass boat ¶

1389
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:41,395
¶ Circling around
your castle's moat ¶

1390
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:45,600
¶ He's the new favourite
late night talk-show host ¶

1391
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:52,773
¶ That's why we try ¶

1392
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,774
¶ To love ¶

1393
01:16:57,878 --> 01:17:02,248
¶ Now that you're here,
come gather round ¶

1394
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:06,453
¶ Check out these treasures
that I found ¶

1395
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:10,358
¶ One makes a flash,
the other makes a sound ¶

1396
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:14,828
¶ But none will catch you
from crashing down ¶

1397
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,769
¶ That's why we try ¶

1398
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,771
¶ To love ¶

1399
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:59,573
¶ Life just kicks you, 1-2-3 ¶

1400
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:03,644
¶ Keeps us guessing him or me ¶

1401
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:07,180
¶ There's always more to see,
always more want ¶

1402
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:16,122
¶ That's why we try ¶

1403
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,125
¶ To love ¶

1404
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:22,229
¶ That's why we try ¶

1405
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:26,434
¶ To love ¶

1406
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:57,264
¶ The weather outside
is frightful ¶

1407
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:01,769
¶ And the fire is so inviting ¶

1408
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,609
¶ The sound of sleigh bells
ringing ¶

1409
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,811
¶ Is all the more delightful ¶

1410
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:22,622
¶ The sight of snow falling
lightly on her cheek ¶

1411
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:34,667
¶ The things around this little
town aren't so bleak ¶

1412
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:44,377
¶ And the lights are up
on the door ¶

1413
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:50,050
¶ They say it's Christmas time ¶

1414
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,722
¶ And I felt this once before ¶

1415
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:01,862
¶ And I can't get it
out of my mind ¶

1416
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:15,309
¶ We can go out walking till
the snow starts to gleam ¶

1417
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,649
¶ Do you remember the stories
I told you? ¶

1418
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:25,853
¶ Or was it all a dream? ¶

1419
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:34,761
¶ I still can't believe that you
are with me once again ¶

1420
01:20:35,896 --> 01:20:39,899
¶ My dear ¶

1421
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:53,713
¶ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ¶

1422
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:57,283
¶ Fa la la, la la la, la la la ¶

1423
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:00,220
¶ Tis the season to be jolly ¶

1424
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:03,122
¶ Fa la la, la la la, la la la ¶

1425
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,792
¶ Don we now our gay apparel ¶

1426
01:21:05,795 --> 01:21:08,395
¶ Fa la la, la la la, la la la ¶

1427
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:11,631
¶ Troll the ancient
Yule tide carol ¶

1428
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:14,534
¶ Fa la la la la ¶

1429
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:17,503
¶ La la la... ¶

1430
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:20,373
¶ La... ¶
¶ La! ¶

1431
01:21:21,842 --> 01:21:25,479
¶ Ah... ¶

1432
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,948
¶...la! ¶

1433
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:29,582
That's what you gotta commit to a song. Okay.

1434
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,784
That's why we don't get
first place.
