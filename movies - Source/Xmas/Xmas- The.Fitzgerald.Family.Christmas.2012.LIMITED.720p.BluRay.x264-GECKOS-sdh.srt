- Hello?

00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,801
Jesus, Dad. What are you doing
calling the house line?

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,200
Mom could have picked up.

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,844
No, I do not have any news yet.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,490
- ROSIE: Gerald, is that for me?
- No, Mom.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,529
Mom, don't worry about it,
it's for me.

12
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,847
Look, I'm having everybody
come over the house tonight

13
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,121
to celebrate Mom's birthday,
all right?

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,884
And then we're gonna discuss it then.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,081
Oh, you got her a birthday gift.

17
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,924
Well, that's a first.
What was it?

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,201
Oh, that. No, no, no,
actually she did tell me about that.

19
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,724
Your wedding video.

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,088
Yeah, and what, you thought that was
somehow gonna help your cause?

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,769
Look, why don't you come by
the restaurant tomorrow and...

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,210
I'll let you know what
everyone decides tonight.

23
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,525
But, Dad... Yeah. No, I know.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,081
But please,
don't get your hopes up, okay?

25
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,848
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

[Phone beeps]

27
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,200
And how many times do I have to
tell you, I don't want a party.

28
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,010
Would you please stop fighting this,
you crazy old woman.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,849
All right?
It's already done, it's organized.

30
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,485
Everyone is going to be here
except Cyril.

31
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,325
But he'll be home for Christmas,

32
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,447
- right?
- Yes.

33
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,408
I already told you
he's coming in tomorrow.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,049
And he's better?

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,406
I don't know.
He says he is.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,323
So we shall see.

37
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,801
And you're picking him up
at Port Authority, right?

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,530
Because he will need
someone there for him.

39
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,882
Yes, Mom.
For the 10th time.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,405
- I will pick him up.
- All right, all right.

41
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,567
Don't get yourself all worked up.

42
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,450
I'm just double checking.
He is my baby after all.

43
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,365
Look, Mom, I don't want you
to worry about this. All right?

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,681
I already spoke to all of them

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,490
and they're all very excited
to get out here.

46
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,086
Don't try to bullshit me, Gerry.
They're my kids.

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,725
Yeah, well, look, whether they like it
or not, they're coming out.

48
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,802
I told you I don't want you
to make a big deal out of this.

49
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,247
Would you just stop
complaining about this?

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,163
All right? Look.

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,730
Dottie's gonna cook
you a nice dinner.

52
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,165
Connie's gonna bake you a cake.

53
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,085
And Quinn said he's gonna come out
this afternoon to take you shopping.

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,082
So why can't you just enjoy yourself?

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,129
Okay. Okay, what's really
going on here?

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,170
Nothing is going on.
It's your 70th birthday.

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,890
I just thought you might like
to have all your kids around

58
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,200
to celebrate with you.

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,723
Enjoy your French toast.

What?

62

What are you not telling me?

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,487
Look, there's something I just want
to discuss with the whole family and...

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,085
I thought it would be good
if we're all together

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,770
so we could all weigh in on it.

66
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,921
And it has to be done
before Christmas.

the reservations for tonight?

WOMAN: Mmm.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,971
Did we get the same room
at the lodge?

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,246
Quinn, she's too young for you.

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,045
What do you care how old she is?

74
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,123
Well, because it kinda makes you
like a creepy old man.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,645
You know, I'm not old enough
to be creepy yet.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,211
[Chuckles]
Oh, yeah, you are.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,884
- Did you get the same room?
- Yes.

- [Phone rings]
- Where's the ring?

79
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,200

Yeah. Hold on.

It's your brother.

83
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,603
Um, gonna have to say I'm not here.

84
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,682
Yeah, but I'm not gonna lie for you.

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,205
Take the call.

GERRY: Hey, Fitzy, where are you?

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,007
You just called me at the office,

90
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,365
and I'm trying to get out of here.

91
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,211
Oh, okay, good. Then you should
be out here soon, right?

QUINN:
Change of plan, my man.

93
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,930
I'm taking Abbie up to the Adirondacks
for the weekend.

94
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,004
Got some serious plans in place.

95
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,129
You don't think you can
just stop by for an hour?

96
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,045
All right, then we can show all this off
to your latest flame.

97
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,045
Hey, Gerry.
This is more than a flame.

98
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,487
Well, even more of a reason
to stop by then, right?

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,411
All right. I'll see what I can do,
but no promises.

100
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,408
Look, you don't have to
promise me shooot, all right.

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,408
It's not my birthday.

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,170
Just the woman that brought you
into this world.

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,170
See what you can do.

Oh, shooot, it's my brother.

116

- Stay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,088
What is this, Gerry?

118
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,605
What the hell are you doing here?

119
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,886
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,769
I got the supplies
for Mom's party tonight.

121
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,125
Oh, shooot.

122
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,247
Oh.

123
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,168
Gerry, I can't host
the party tonight.

124
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,930
What do you mean you can't
host the party? Why not?

125
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,081
I'm having all this trouble
with the boys.

126
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,610
They're in trouble up at school,

127
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,204
and they're not even coming home
for Christmas.

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,567
So, I...
I gotta deal with them.

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,927
All right. So what does that have
to do with Mom's party?

130
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,088
Okay, um, there's something else.

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,084
I... I was waiting
to tell the family, but...

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,004
Skippy and I split up.
Like, three weeks ago.

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,367
I know, because Skippy
was in the bar a couple of nights ago

134
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,124
telling me all about it,
crying on my shoulder.

135
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,762
He also told me that you've been
having an affair for six months.

136
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,610
Yes, I...

137
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,968
I've been seeing someone
and, um...

138
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,646
You know, Skippy and I
tried to work it out, but it's just...

139
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,687
It's not gonna happen.

140
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,968
Who are you having
an affair with?

141
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,249
Do you remember, um,
Jimmy Esposito's little brother Johnny?

142
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,761
Johnny Esposito, the gardener's kid?
How old is he?

143
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,207
Uh, I don't know. 20s...
maybe 30s.

144
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,011
How did you end up hooking up
with Johnny Esposito?

145
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,362
- He cuts my grass.
- He cuts your grass.

146
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,564
That's fantastic.

147
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,245
MAN: Hey, Sharon.
How about I just pop out

148
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,322
and drop you at your mom's
on my way to East Hampton?

149
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,004
No, you don't have to do that.

150
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,161
MAN: Not a big deal.

151
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,526
I'm just gonna take the train
or I'll call my brother or something.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,646
Not the brother that I met?

153
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,411
No, that's Gerry. He's an asshole.
I'll call Quinn.

154
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,850
I wouldn't mind just, like, taking you.
I could see the house.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,843
I could meet your mom,
say "Happy birthday."

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,127
[chuckles] No, that's definitely
not happening.

157
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,283
I haven't brought a boy home
since my junior prom date.

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,369
- I learned my lesson then.
- Wow, luckily I'm not a boy, honey.

159

[Chuckles]

160
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,521
Promise you I'll do better
than your junior prom date.

161
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,362
All right.

162
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,209
So...why don't we do that?

163
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,440
Do what?

164
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,410
I'll drop you off.
Meet some of the brood.

165
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,848
No, you're not seriously asking
to come meet my family today.

166
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,011
Are you?

167
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,644
Is that such a bad thing?

168
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,247
[Stutters]

169
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,290
No, I just... I didn't think
we were, you know...

170
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,886
at the meet-the-family place yet.

171
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,689
I mean, I'm having fun
and you're having fun right now...

172
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,365
Yeah, I'm having fun.
I didn't mean to make it so complicated.

173
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
- Good.
- It's fun, it's good.

174
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,245
- Okay, good.
- Yeah, that's fine.

175
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,965
- Great.
- Call your bro.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,923
Hey, Erin, the house
looks real festive.

177
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,923
Perfect place for a party tonight.

178
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,685
We can't have everybody over here.

179
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,284
I have to put the baby down at 7:30.

180
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,922
Mom said that she wanted to celebrate
at one of her girls' houses.

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,725
Now I've explained to you
why we can't do it at Dot's.

182
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,040
Connie's place is too small,

183
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,406
Sharon's apartment in the city
is obviously not an option.

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,641
So that leaves you.

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,245
Well, we can't do it here.

186
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,606
[whispers] And could you keep
your voice down? The baby's sleeping.

187
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,807
[whispers] I don't understand
why no one seems to think

188
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,088
that their mother's birthday
is a big deal.

189
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,766
Because she deals with you one way
and the rest of us another way.

190
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,365
You're the golden boy,
you can do no wrong.

191
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,805
She treats the rest of us like shooot.

192
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,961
- I hope you know that that is total bullshit.
- Is it?

193
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,406
Do you know
she actually suggested

194
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,966
that I let her sneak the baby out
one day and get him baptized.

195
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,928
Yeah, she told me
and I think it's genius.

196
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,605
We're not baptizing the baby.

197
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,646
Why not?

198
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,370
Because Corey's Jewish.

199
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,328
I thought Corey's an atheist.

200
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,369
- He's still Jewish.
- Look,

201
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,841
just let Mom take the kid
up to church and have her do it.

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,209
You don't need to participate,
Corey doesn't need to know about it,

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,327
and that way the kid
is not stuck in Limbo

204
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,721
in case you two heathens
are wrong.

205
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,683
You're all crazy.

206
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,008
We're crazy? You're telling me
you're an atheist.

207
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,524
How do you explain
the Christmas tree?

208
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,763
We have a kid now. Where else
am I gonna put the presents?

209
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,211
Why don't you
just blow this thing off?

210
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,963
You know what?
That is not a bad idea.

211
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,405
Sharon,
it's your mom's birthday.

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,806
You gotta stop in for a drink
at least.

213
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,929
Oh, no. There is no just stopping in
for one drink with my family.

214
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,047
QUINN: Yeah, that's true.

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,964
And let's all be made aware
if we go there at all,

216
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,167
we're gonna be there all night.

217
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,804
So let's not go.

218
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,769
The less I have to deal with Gerry,
the better.

219
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,409
What is this beef with Gerry?

220
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,961
I'm just... I'm tired of him pretending
he's the patriarch of our family.

221
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,605
First of all,
he's not my freakin' father.

222
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,489
And second of all,
he's hardly qualified for the job.

223
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,482
He's a grown man
and he still lives at home.

224
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,370
You know with fairness to him,
he's got his reasons for that.

225
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,205
Whatever. The point is,

226
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,929
if I don't have to go to
Mom's house tonight,

227
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,649
I am more than okay with that.

228
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,400
I have an idea.
Why don't Sharon and, um...

229
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,721
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

230
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,690
Francis Xavier,
but my friends call me FX.

231
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,240
- Oh, okay. I like that. It's a good name.
- Thank you.

232
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,721
So why don't Sharon and FX

233
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,167
come upstate with us,
get a room at the same hotel.

234
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,970
We'll get dinner,
hang out for the weekend,

235
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,769
and we'll drive back
Christmas morning.

236
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,648
Honey, you know,
it's really not a great idea.

237
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,846
It's not considerate.

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,001
Sharon doesn't ski.
It's a ski resort.

239
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,042
Neither do I.

240
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,167
You don't ski?

241
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,527
You know I got an idea.

242
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,364
I'm headed out to East Hampton
this weekend.

243
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,201
You guys want to come with me,
you're more than welcome.

244
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,211
I've never been to the Hamptons.
That sounds awesome.

245
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,361
Does it sound awesome?

246
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah. Big time.

247
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,523
Oh, well, you gotta come then.
You're gonna love it.

248
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,210
What do you think, babe?
I got plenty of room.

249
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,363
Ah, as long as we're all agreed
that we don't have to go to Mom's,

250
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,884
I mean, I'm up for whatever.

251
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,602
- Babe, that sounds like so much fun.
-Mmm.

252
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,443
Please?
I don't wanna go skiing.

253
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,250
[Quinn sighs]

254
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,804
But I want to be with you.

255
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,481
Okay, fine.
[kiss]

256
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,405
But you're calling Mom.

257
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,009
[Phone rings]

258
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,086
Hey!

259
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,363
SHARON:
Hey, Mom. Happy birthday.

260
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,931
Hey, Sharon!

261
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,764
Oh, am I gonna see you tonight?

262
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,927
Yeah, you know,
that's what I was calling about.

263
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,081
You know, there must have been
some sort of misunderstanding

264
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,081
with Gerry or something.

265
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,129
I didn't know he wanted us
to come out tonight for a party

266
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,725
and then also again
at Christmas.

267
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,802
That's what I thought.

268
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,121
But you know Gerry wants to
make a big deal out of it.

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,601
Yeah, but it's not a big deal
to you, though, right?

270
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,003
Well, I mean,
it is my 70th but...

271
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,765
Well, you know how I feel
about birthdays, right?

272
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,126
Yeah, yeah. See that's what I thought,
that's what I told Quinn.

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,926
I mean, he had these plans
and then he invited me, so...

274
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,400
- So Quinn's not coming either?
- No. But...

275
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,767
we'll both be out at Christmas.
Like we always do, you know.

276
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,206
And we'll celebrate
your birthday then.

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,364
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
We'll--We'll do it then.

278
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,442
Okay, great.
I'm so glad you're cool with it.

279
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,206
- Look, I gotta go, Mom. I love you.
- I love you, Mom.

280
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,407
QUINN: Happy birthday.

281
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,403
I love you both.
Love you, too.

282
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,640
Bye.

283
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,921
Okay, bye.

284
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,240
- We're good?
- We are so good.

285
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,322
Let's go.

286
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,880
Hmm.

287
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,724
Hey, Mom. You home?

288
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,927
Oh, I'm upstairs, Gerry.

289
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,003
Little change in plans.

290
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,645
We're gonna do the party here
tonight instead.

291
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,164
Okay? I already called
the restaurant,

292
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,600
and they're gonna bring over
a bunch of food.

293
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,524
The food is terrible.

294
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,408
And the takeout is even worse.

295
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,769
Oh, really? Is it? Then why do you
insist on eating there every night?

296
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,331
Because it's free.

297
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,686
And otherwise,
I'd have to eat alone.

298
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,160
But what is Dottie's problem?
I mean, why...

299
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,446
Why isn't she cooking?

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,331
Dottie has more drama
going on like always.

301
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,083
- But she's coming over?
- No. No.

302
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,322
And neither is Erin. I guess she has
her hands full with the baby.

303
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,201
Well, uh, Sharon and Quinn
have blown us off as well.

304
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,850
Apparently,
they made other plans.

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,125
Are you kidding me?

306
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,523
I spoke to Quinn earlier today
and he said he was coming.

307
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,682
Ah, you know what? I'm gonna call
that son of a bitch right now

308
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,568
and make sure they
get their <i>asses</i> out here.

309
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,960
No, no, no, don't do that.

310
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,326
No, it's--it's...
Hon, I'm fine.

311
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,926
Listen, when you have a birthday
two days before Christmas,

312
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,844
you get used to
eating your cake alone.

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,206
Mom, you're not eating
your cake alone.

314
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,326
I will, uh...
I'll be right back, all right?

315
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,966
Hey! Can I help you?

316
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,043
Yeah, I'm Gerry Fitzgerald.

317
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,363
I'm an old friend
of Mrs. McGowan's.

318
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,966
Just wanted to stop by,
wish her a happy holiday.

319
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,201
Oh, yeah, yeah.

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,091
Um, I'm Nora, I'm one of her nurses.
Come on in.

321
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,484
NORA: Nancy?

322
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,644
Oh, Gerry.
It's so good to see you.

323
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,086
GERRY: Oh, yeah.
[kiss]

324
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,806
Oh, you want a drink?
Nora, get this boy a drink.

325
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
Oh, yeah.
What do you want?

326
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,806
No, actually I'm all right.
Thank you.

327
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,245
Okay.

328
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,088
So how are you?

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,005
Well...you know.
The holidays are hard.

330
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,571
Well, look,
that's why I'm here today.

331
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,768
I'm gonna invite you over the house
tonight for Rosie's birthday.

332
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,883
I know she would
love to see you.

333
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,042
Oh, no. I don't think so.

334
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,761
I don't have the strength these days
to leave the house.

335
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,321
But I'll call her,
I'll wish her a happy birthday.

336
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,565
Yeah, she would love
to hear from you.

337
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,040
And I'm gonna make sure
that she gets over here on Christmas Day

338
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,725
to at least stop by and say hello.

339
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,609
Oh, I don't know about that.

340
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,285
I got a phone call from your father.

341
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,682
Really?

342
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,888
- Mm-hmm.
- This guy is unbelievable.

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,246
- What did you say?
- I told him

344
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,605
there's not a shot in hell

345
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,240
that she is gonna let him
into that house again.

346
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,163
Especially, at Christmas?

347
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,607
I know. I told him the same thing
but he is insisting,

348
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,081
so tonight
we'll see what she decides.

349
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,605
What do you think
that she should do?

350
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,443
What do you think
in your heart?

351
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,090
- It's Christmas.
- Yeah.

352
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,322
If ever there was a time
for some forgiveness...

353
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,720
And mercy.

354
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,880
You're not gonna believe this.

355
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,610
I got this card from my sister,

356
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,807
and it just made me think
of this whole situation.

357
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,086
Just listen to this.

358
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,801
"Lost friend, lost child,
lost parent, sister, brother,

359
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,404
"husband, wife,

360
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,528
"in the season of immortal hope

361
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,126
"and on the birthday
of immortal mercy

362
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,721
we will shut out nothing."

363
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,322
Mr. Charles Dickens.

364
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,970
Great sentiment.

365
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,845
But I think you know how my mother
feels about the English, right?

366
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,451
[Both chuckle]

367
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,365
Now go.

368
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,725
Let me know
how it all turns out.

369
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,888
- Will do. Great to see you.
- [kisses]

370
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,326
All right.

371
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,125
GERRY:
Try to have a good holiday.

372
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm trying.

373
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,005
[whispers]
Well, look, how is she doing?

374
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,365
[whispers]
She's good, she's good.

375
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,291
I think the holidays get her
a little down sometimes.

376
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,206
You know, I used to come by
and visit all the time but...

377
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,481
I guess I gotta
make more of an effort.

378
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,369
- Yeah, that would mean a lot to her.
- Yeah.

379
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,806
You should definitely visit.

380
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,370
All right, and, um...

381
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,763
What's your deal?
You're here with her all the time or...?

382
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,763
Yeah, yeah. Definitely.

383
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,605
So, so if you come visit,
I'll see you.

384
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,885
All right, great.

385
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,485
- I will definitely do that then.
- All right. Okay.

386
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,290
Uh, Mrs. G, happy holidays.

387
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,885
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

388
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,850
I might come by again,
maybe, uh, tomorrow.

389
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,161
Just check in on you.

390
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,288
All right,
see you tomorrow.

391
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,926
- All right.
- Okay.

392
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,649
- Good to meet you.
- You, too.

393
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,880
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

394
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,562
Hey, baby.
How did it go?

395
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,370
It didn't.

396
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,283
What happened?

397
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,566
I thought it was a done deal.

398
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,005
So did I.

399
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,280
What did they say?

400
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,566
They didn't say shooot.

401
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,245
They just don't have any spots
open, that's it.

402
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,730
I don't understand,
I thought your brothers...

403
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,921
Oh, what does it matter
what happened?

404
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,923
The point is that they have no work,
end of story.

405
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,764
Let's go inside, have a beer
and get ready to go to my mom's, huh?

406
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,445
Yeah, I'm not going
to your mom's tonight.

407
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,559
What are you talking about?
It's her birthday, you have to go.

408
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,880
It's bad enough I got to
spend the day

409
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,803
with your asshole brothers
on Christmas.

410
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,084
JJ, why are you being like this?

411
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,766
[exhales deeply]

412
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,449
FX: This is it. This is us.

413
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,603
- FX: Right here's good.
- ABBIE: Oh, my God.

414
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,565
- ABBIE: This house is insane.
- FX: Oh, thank you.

415
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,441
- ABBIE: This is bigger than my college.
- FX: Oh, thanks. Yeah, it's not bad.

416
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,205
SHARON: No, it's not bad at all.

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,810
Oh, no, no. I got it.

418
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,450
FX: Yeah, okay. Is this yours?

419
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,364
ABBIE: I can't believe
how big this house is.

420
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,727
- Ah. Well, let me give you the grand tour.
- Oh, thank you.

421
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,244
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

422
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,924
QUINN:
So, what's this guy do for a living?

423
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,167
SHARON: I don't know. Nothing.
It's just, uh, family money.

424
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,605
- Family money?
- Yeah.

425
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,523
I'm not familiar with that concept.

426
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,730
ABBIE: So do you have a pool?

427
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,523
Uh, we got a pool and a pond.

428
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,603
Pond's good for you.

429
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,039
- You didn't think I'd know that, did you?
- That's good.

430
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,042
Now come this way, come here.

431
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,724
[Indistinct]

432
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,122
So, what do you think?

433
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,361
What?

434
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,606
My girl. The girl.

435
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,727
Oh, I think she's great.

436
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,009
Well, I'm glad you approve, 'cause
I'm gonna propose this weekend.

437
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,401
Pr-Propose what?

438
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,799
Propose marriage.

439
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,246
[Gasps] What?

440
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,210
Really?
You just met her, didn't you?

441
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,760
Yeah, but I'm gonna propose
tomorrow night, Christmas Eve.

442
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,887
What is she,
like, 12 years old?

443
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,605
You should talk, you and
Money Bags Methuselah over here.

444
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,684
Yeah, true, but I'm not looking
to get married, far from it.

445
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,487
You know, when baby's all growsed up,
you're gonna realize.

446
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,130
When you know, you know.

447
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,611
FX: Hey, guys. Come on up.

448
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,326
- [Phone rings]
- [Sharon sighs]

449
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,410
[ring]

450
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,166
- Hello?
- CONNIE: Hey, Mom.

451
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,846
So I have some bad news.

452
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,808
I'm not gonna be able
to come over tonight.

453
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,246
What's wrong?

454
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,601
Are you crying?

455
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,761
No, no. No, I just, uh...

456
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,287
I bought you a cake and I'm not
gonna be able to bring it over,

457
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,884
so I feel bad.

458
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,929
I don't care about the cake.

459
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,405
Why are you crying?

460
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,006
It's nothing. It's just, uh...

461
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,288
Uh, JJ didn't get that job so...

462
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,489
Look, look, baby.
Why don't you come over and--

463
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,769
and stay with me tonight.
Okay?

464
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,727
No, I should stay here.
I'll, uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

465
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,369
Have a happy birthday.

466
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,041
- [Phone beeps]
- [sniffles]

467
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,803
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, kid.

468
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,644
So I heard.

469
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,484
Look, Mom, the reason that I wanted
everybody out here tonight--

470
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,881
and for the record,
I am furious with all of them--

471
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,726
was, there is something the family
needs to make a joint decision about.

472
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,961
Then we'll discuss it at Christmas.

473
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,130
Nah, it can't wait till then.
It's...

474
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,611
It's about Dad.

475
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,489
What about Dad?

476
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,282
Well, he wants to spend Christmas
with us here at the house.

477
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,448
Gerry, as I told him

478
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,650
when he walked out on me,
on us, 20 years ago,

479
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,847
the man will never set foot
in this house again.

480
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,888
I know, I know.

481
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,964
But in his defense, all right,
he has had a pretty tough year.

482
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,690
Yeah, and I've had a tough life.

483
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,807
Mom, his company went belly-up.

484
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,371
I mean, he lost almost everything.

485
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,840
Good, good. I'm glad.
He deserves it.

486
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,968
Yeah. Well, then you'll love to hear

487
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,800
that his divorce with Carol
got real nasty and...

488
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,486
Now that is a birthday gift.

489
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,689
I'm gonna celebrate with a beer.
[laughs]

490
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,410
So, you're not even gonna
consider it,

491
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,527
- are you?
- Nah.

492
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,489
What about the Christmas spirit?

493
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,326
Why don't you just give it
a little bit of time,

494
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,324
think about it
and then make a decision.

495
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,685
- Okay.
- All right.

496
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,729
- I'll think about it.
- Good.

497
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,884
Okay,
I've thought about it.

498
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,167
And the answer is still no.

499
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,963
Now that that's settled,

500
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,320
I think you should go down
to the restaurant and check on things.

501
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,324
The restaurant can wait.
Come on, it's your birthday.

502
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,246
I appreciate everything
you're doing, Gerry.

503
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,210
But I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

504
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,529
Okay.

505
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
I got it.

506
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,288
Happy birthday, gorgeous.

507
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,326
- GERRY: Hey, Brian.
- Hey. What's up, Gerr?

508
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,602
KK, how we doing tonight?

509
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,603
Eh, pretty quiet,
given it's the holidays.

510
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,329
But that's to be expected.

511
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,528
All right. Well, look, maybe we'll, uh,
close up early tonight, all right?

512
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,567
Sounds good.

513
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,449
I'll be in the office if you need me.

514
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,685
Oh, yeah, and, KK,

515
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,451
if my mom calls make sure
you put the call through, all right?

516
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,203
No problem, Gerr.

517
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,809
- Hey!
- Hey!

518
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,609
- I know you.
- Yeah, yeah.

519
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,761
- How are you?
- I'm good. Thank you for asking.

520
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,125
Good. Gerry.
We have met.

521
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,248
Right. Nora.
I'm Mrs. McGowan's nurse.

522
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,487
- Of course.
- She, uh...

523
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,805
said I should just stop by
while I'm waiting for my train.

524
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
- Speaks highly of the joint.
- Oh.

525
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,049
Well, what time is your train?

526
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,083
- Oh, in 10 minutes from now. So, yeah...
- Oh, shooot.

527
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,805
I know, I've been here for a while.

528
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,008
Well, you know they run every hour.

529
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,326
They do.

530
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,481
So if you wanted
to catch the next one

531
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,440
maybe you could stay
and you could have a drink?

532
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,125
Thought you'd never ask.

533
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,449
It was complete insanity.

534
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,839
Because you gotta remember

535
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,287
we had nine people living
in a three-bedroom house.

536
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,282
Good Lord.
Bloody Irish.

537
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,010
[chuckles] So actually it was
a good thing that our father left.

538
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,809
We really needed the extra space.

539
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,884
Whoa, back up. You shared a room
with three of your sisters?

540
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,723
Yeah. Four sisters in a room

541
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,359
about the size of this coffee table
right here.

542
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,726
And our oldest sister Dottie,

543
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,008
she used to bring her boyfriends
back from college

544
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,048
[whispers] and have sex
with them in the room,

545
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,765
while we were all there sleeping.

546
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,125
- Did she really?
- Yeah.

547
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,009
- I never heard that.
- Yeah, she did.

548
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,530
And I've got the emotional scars
to prove it.

549
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,170
You know I'd like to meet
this sister of yours.

550
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,799
No, I don't think you would.
She's over 30.

551
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,763
[Both chuckle]

552
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,007
Stop it.

553
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,684
Anyway, meanwhile,
this whole time

554
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,882
the boys have the big room
all to themselves.

555
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,167
You sound particularly resentful
when you say that.

556
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,480
We deserved it.

557
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,170
What did you do to deserve it?

558
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,730
- They were boys, lass.
- That's right.

559
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,565
It's exactly correct.
Thank you, Francis Xavier.

560
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,050
Man who understands.

561
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,441
And for a while it was just
me and Gerry in the room.

562
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,967
Then Gerry moved to the basement
when the baby came along.

563
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,359
The baby became Cyril,

564
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,363
who became my indentured
servant till I went to college.

565
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,727
Yeah, and maybe that's
why C turned out the way he did.

566
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,529
I have to admit.
I was not very kind to the little guy.

567
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,047
- You were terrible to him.
- He was my little brother.

568
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,249
It was my duty to abuse him
at all times.

569
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,685
Yeah, I beat the crap out
of my little brother

570
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,682
- every day of his life.
- QUINN: Of course you did.

571
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,682
So just all older brothers are assholes.

572
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,086
- No, little brothers are punks.
- QUINN: You know I'd take offense at that.

573
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,526
I was never an asshole to you.

574
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,489
Oh, my God. I'm not even
talking about you, Quinn.

575
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,085
Well, it's clear
who you are talking about.

576
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,890
So would you give me
a little more detail

577
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,201
as to what Gerry did
to piss you off so much?

578
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,406
I don't even wanna talk about it.

579
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,891
- He told her he didn't approve...
- It's not even worth going into.

580
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,644
- Of her dating a...
- It's not.

581
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,961
...dashingly handsome,

582
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,566
- materialistically wealthy...
- No, that's not what he said.

583
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,521
- Slightly older gentleman.
- He said something more to the effect of,

584
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,365
"Why are you dating
that old flaping creep anyhow?"

585
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,645
Oh, that would piss me off.

586
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,961
Wait a second.
He called me a flaping creep?

587
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,884
Yeah, I didn't want to go into it.

588
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,723
That doesn't sound like Gerry.

589
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,404
I've always dated much younger women.

590
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,085
He never said anything like that to me.

591
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:20,123
Yeah, that's called
a double standard.

592
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,166
Too much information.

593
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,970
Don't want to know about
all the women you've dated.

594
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,001
- [Stammers]
- Just don't...

595
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,446
- FX: You've only dated younger women?
- Yeah.

596
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,404
How old are you, Abbie?

597
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,086
- 22.
- Really?

598
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,128
Wow. Sweet.

599
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,969
[chuckles]
You are a flaping creep.

600
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,202
Stay over there, my friend.
[laughing]

601
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,846
ERIN: Okay. Here's Mr. Whale.

602
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,084
[Door closes quietly]

603
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,560
[Erin sighs]

604
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,646
[Corey exhales] Took forever.

605
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,643
- Is he down?
- Finally.

606
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,763
How come you don't want
to go to your mother's tonight?

607
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,040
We could have called a babysitter.

608
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,611
'Cause she drives me crazy.

609
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,965
In fact they all drive me crazy.

610
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,690
Besides we're gonna see them
on Christmas.

611
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,768
Speaking of Christmas,
I was wondering...

612
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,842
[baby crying]

613
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,365
Oh! Oh, God!

614
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,442
Can... I can't deal with it.
Can you...

615
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,210
- I got it, I got it.
- try?

616
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,644
[sighs]

617
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,325
[Baby continues crying]

618
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,080
[door opens and closes]

619
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,250
[Heavy footsteps]

620
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,131
JJ?

621
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,851
[water running]

622
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,044
- JJ?
- Hey-.

623
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,405
Hey.

624
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,564
JJ: Baby, I'm sorry.

625
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,204
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,201
Where did you come from?

627
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,282
- Boston.
- Boston?

628
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,442
Boston. So that means you're a...

629
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,409
- Red Sox fan.
- Mm-hmm.

630
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,607
Red Sox, Pats, Celts, yes.

631
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,921
Now, why did you go and do that

632
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,044
and ruin what I thought was
a pretty good thing we got going on here?

633
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,611
What makes you think
this was a good thing?

634
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,326
I'm a little out of practice,

635
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,528
but, yeah, it seems like
it's going pretty well.

636
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,204
You're smiling,
I'm laughing.

637
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,244
Yeah.

638
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,606
Something tells me
you don't laugh very much.

639
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,401
Oh.

640
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,648
Probably not as much
as I used to, I guess.

641
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,769
I take it Mrs. McGowan
told you about me and her daughter.

642
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,250
Yeah.

643
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,964
I'm sorry about that.

644
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,567
Well, that was a pretty shitty day
for a lot of people, right?

645
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,882
I lost my dad on that day, too.

646
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,442
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

647
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,246
Yeah.

648
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,801
And she said that you guys were supposed
to get married that October.

649
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,289
[sighs] Look, I don't love talking
about this. If you can...

650
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,442
I get it.
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,644
So, anyhow, what, uh,
what brings you here?

652
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,844
Uh, nursing school and then I just
fell in love with the city.

653
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,125
No, not New York.

654
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,684
What brought you here tonight,

655
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,126
more specifically
to this fine establishment?

656
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,765
Um...

657
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,366
I was waiting for my train.

658
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,329
Well, I got bad news.
You, uh, you missed it.

659
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,163
No, I missed my train?

660
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,890
- It's gone.
- Oh, no.

661
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,286
There's got to be another train.

662
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,611
Not tonight.

663
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,451
Hmm.

664
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,806
Where do you live?

665
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,411
Whitestone.

666
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,365
It's a long cab ride.

667
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,487
Thank you so much for the lift
and walking me to the door.

668
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,928
- You're such a gentleman.
- Yeah, of course. Anytime.

669
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,208
Do you really mean that?
'Cause I work five nights a week

670
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,448
and I hate that train ride.

671
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,250
Yes, I do mean it.

672
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
Hmm, that's good.

673
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,881
Look, I had a great time tonight.

674
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,404
I did, too.

675
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,881
You know I could, um...
stick around tonight if you want.

676
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,246
Mmm.

677
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,288
I don't think so.

678
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,204
Did I just totally blow this?

679
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,009
No. No, no, no, no.
I just, you know.

680
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,923
You sure? Yeah.

681
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,765
Just not tonight, I think,
you know.

682
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,523
All right, yeah. Um...

683
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,885
Still I'd, you know...

684
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,565
I meant that I would love
to see you again.

685
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,244
I would love that, too.

686
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,242
- All right, good, good.
- Yeah.

687
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,163
- All right, then.
- Thanks for the drink.

688
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,367
Thanks for the ride and...

689
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,645
- [chuckles] Okay.
- All right.

690
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,403
Okay. Bye.

691
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,325
[car engine starts]

692
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,200
[sea birds calling]

693
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,605
- Hey!
- Hey!

694
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,125
What are you doing up so early?

695
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,244
I'm always up this early.

696
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,685
- Really?
- What's your excuse?

697
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,410
Yeah, I mean, me, too.

698
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,130
I'm lucky if I get five hours.

699
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,164
You know, that's funny.

700
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,320
[Chuckles]

701
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,560
I mean,
we're brother and sister

702
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,125
and we don't even
know each other that well.

703
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,727
What?

704
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,119
We know each other fine.

705
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,088
Oh, yeah? Where did I
go to high school?

706
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,125
Sacred Heart.

707
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,520
No, that was Connie and Erin,
the smart ones.

708
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,010
I went to Hewlett.

709
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,684
Where did I go to college?

710
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,842
I know you went upstate.

711
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oswego?

712
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,402
Oneonta?

713
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,682
You played soccer.

714
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,888
Jesus, that was Cyril.

715
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,122
I went to Purchase.
I was a theater major.

716
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,044
I know all of this.

717
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,565
I'm flaping around with you.

718
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,528
You are so full of shooot.

719
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,603
I bet you don't even know
how old I am.

720
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,530
You're 20...

721
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,041
I know you're not 30.

722
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,929
[Chuckles]

723
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,080
See.

724
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,003
Okay. How old am I?

725
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,480
You just turned 38.
You went to Xavier High School.

726
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,125
You went to Fordham for college.

727
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,963
And of the six books
you have read,

728
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,122
The Old Man and the Sea
is your favorite.

729
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,931
Okay. So you know some things
about me. Congratulations.

730
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,240
I don't know you from Adam.

731
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,407
But you're my baby sister
and I love you to death.

732
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,726
And by the way,

733
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,964
don't pay attention to that bullshit
Gerry gave you about FX.

734
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,451
You don't think
he's too old for me?

735
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,839
Who's to say who's too old?

736
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,646
Is he good to you?

737
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,009
Then he's good with me.

738
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,931
[sighs] I don't know.

739
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,971
Gerry just...
He made me feel like such a cliché.

740
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,599
You know, like,
girl grows up without a dad

741
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,604
so she dates old guys
just to replace him.

742
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,761
Sharon, give yourself a break.

743
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,685
You're not the only one in this family
with daddy issues.

744
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:39,566
[PA announcements, indistinct]

745
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,361
Yo! C!

746
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,284
Hey, Gerry,
what are you doing here?

747
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,407
How you doin'?
Good to see you.

748
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,926
Figured you could use a friendly face
when you got off the bus.

749
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,763
Thanks. Did you drive in?

750
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,371
I did. I did, you know.

751
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,931
And since we're in the city,

752
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,923
there's a little something
I wanna show you.

753
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,684
Okay? All right?

754
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,886
GERRY: You're looking good, man.

755
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,451
CYRIL: Yeah, threw in
a couple of pounds.

756
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,961
GERRY: I think it's good for you.
It's good for you.

757
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,086
CYRIL: Thanks.

758
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,842
GERRY: So, you recognize
this building?

759
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,331
No. Should I?

760
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,920
Yeah. You know the picture
in the living room of Dad with Grandma

761
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,208
on his First Holy Communion
sitting on a stoop?

762
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,442
- Right there.
- Oh? This is where they used to live.

763
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,806
Yeah. Third floor.

764
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,610
Well, if the stoop could talk
it'd probably tell us

765
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,762
what an asshole Dad was
as a kid.

766
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,561
How do you know
which building it was?

767
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,121
You know, he used to take me
into the city all the time

768
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,121
when I was little.

769
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,088
He wanted to show me
where he grew up,

770
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,081
how he grew up.

771
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,811
Said, "it's important that you know
where the Fitzgeralds are from."

772
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,563
Never did that shooot with me.

773
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,041
Well, why do you think
I'm doing it now?

774
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,009
You know, he didn't call me once
when I was up there.

775
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,126
I don't know why
that surprises you.

776
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,487
I mean, I keep trying to tell you guys
he is who he is.

777
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,451
All right? And he's certainly
not gonna change

778
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,646
now that he's in his 70s.

779
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,961
Once a selfish cocksucker,
always a selfish cocksucker, huh?

780
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,166
Yes. Yeah.

781
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,606
You should know, though,
he wants to come out to the house

782
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,045
tomorrow for Christmas,

783
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,440
have dinner with us.

784
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
What do you think?

785
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,807
If he's gonna be there,
I'm not gonna be there.

786
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,409
[doorbell rings]

787
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,840
Mom, what are you doing here?

788
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,731
Dottie just called
and she's just busy this morning.

789
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,041
This is so typical of her.
Busy with what?

790
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,043
She didn't say.
She just asked me to cover for her.

791
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,963
She is so irresponsible.

792
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,010
Oh, everyone has their own issues.

793
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,242
Besides,
what's up with you these days?

794
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,721
Doesn't the holidays
put everyone in a shitty mood?

795
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,405
No, it shouldn't.
it should do just the opposite.

796
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,005
Well, it never has for me.

797
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,400
Is it just the holidays

798
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,005
or is there something specific

799
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,570
- got you down in the mouth?
- Mom,

800
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,130
- I'm really not in the mood
- I mean, no...

801
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,248
- to have this talk.
- I look at this beautiful home,

802
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,971
that loving husband,
that gorgeous child,

803
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,885
and I can't imagine what you've got
to be so down in the mouth about.

804
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,963
Yeah? Well, as usual
you don't know half the story.

805
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,009
Well, why don't you
try explaining?

806
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:11,242
Mom, we don't have
that relationship.

807
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,050
We never did
and we never will.

808
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,168
You don't even want to try?

809
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,846
Consider it the birthday gift
you didn't get me.

810
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,764
Guilt trips, they work
with the others but not me.

811
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,766
- Ah.
- Hey, Rosie.

812
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,081
- You pinch-hitting?
- Hi, Corey, yeah.

813
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,123
- Happy belated birthday.
- Thank you.

814
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,248
Where are you two off to today?

815
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,367
Well, we're gonna
have some lunch,

816
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,648
see the tree, do the whole
Christmas Eve thing.

817
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,929
Aha. Oh, so even though
we don't believe in God

818
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,128
we're still celebrating
Christmas?

819
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,282
Doesn't mean you ever stop
believing in Santa Claus.

820
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,851
[Rosie chuckles]

821
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,001
You know, Rosie,

822
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,161
today would be the perfect day

823
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,164
for you to do that thing
you asked me about.

824
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,445
- Oh, my...
- Rosie.

825
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,960
If you do it,
don't tell anyone.

826
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,246
Especially this one.

827
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,083
It's between you,
Aaron and God.

828
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,525
- Okay?
- To the grave.

829
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,920
- To the grave.
- ERIN: So, Mom...

830
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,481
Aaron's down now
and he'll go back down again

831
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,483
- in two to three hours.
- Right. Okay.

832
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,248
Now, you two just take your time,
have a great day.

833
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,164
Aaron's in good hands with me.

834
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,367
Oh, I know he is.

835
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,090
You did such a great job
with this one.

836
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,844
I had nothing to do
with raising her.

837
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,371
She raised herself.

838
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,646
Bye!

839
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,244
Father Mike,
it's Rosemary Fitzgerald.

840
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,447
Hey, Mom! Look who's home.

841
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,239
Hey, Mom!

842
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,126
Ma!

843
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,210
Huh.

844
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,527
That's weird.
She must have stepped out.

845
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,445
Uh...

846
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,967
Well, look, the idea was for you
to stay in your old room.

847
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,286
So, you cool with that?

848
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,521
Yeah, of course.

849
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,728
And you're allowed to just
be left here on your own

850
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,722
without any supervision?

851
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,001
I suppose.

852
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,650
Yeah?
Well, what do you think?

853
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,851
- I think I'm good.
- Yeah?

854
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,650
- I don't need to lock up the booze or...
- No.

855
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,570
I'll be okay.

856
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,199
All right, brother.

857
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,690
Look, I got to get up
to the restaurant,

858
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,967
but it was awesome
to see you.

859
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,202
- All right? You're looking good.
- Yeah.

860
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,646
Hey, Gerry...

861
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,322
Can I borrow a couple of bucks?

862
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,809
Look, there's plenty of food
in the fridge and...

863
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,360
No. I want to do some
Christmas shopping.

864
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,322
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

865
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,324
That should cover it.

866
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,686
Thanks.

867
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,762
Hey. And don't worry
about anybody else.

868
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,371
Just get Mom something good.

869
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,487
All right?

870
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,880
She's gonna be excited
to see you, brother.

871
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,239
Welcome home.

872
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,766
[Door closes]

873
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,844
I think I'm good.

874
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,126
[Knocking]

875
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,009
- [whispers] Hey.
- [whispers] Hey. What's going on?

876
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,809
She's asleep.

877
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
- shooot. Sorry about that.
- No. It's cool. It's cool.

878
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,443
Come over here.

879
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,965
- How's it going?
- Good. Good.

880
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,530
What are you doing?

881
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,769
Look, I just wanted to come by
and apologize for last night.

882
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,967
I mean I don't know
if that was...

883
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,644
No, you don't have to apologize.

884
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,121
I had a great time.
It was really fun.

885
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,204
Oh, cool. And I brought a little gift
for Mrs. McGowan.

886
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,322
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

887
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,925
What a nice boy.

888
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:53,650
Yeah, well, I figured it'd give me
a good excuse to come by,

889
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,686
see you again today.

890
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,411
Right, oh...
I'll be sure she gets this.

891
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:01,201
So, um, what do you got
doing for Christmas?

892
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,722
Well, I volunteered
to stay with Nancy through New Year's

893
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,887
so that the other nurse
could go be with her family, so...

894
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,565
Well, what about your family,
though?

895
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,210
You're not going up to Boston or...

896
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,168
I don't really have anybody left.

897
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,530
Um, yeah, after my dad,
it's kinda just me. So...

898
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,610
Well, in that case why don't you
and Mrs. McGowan

899
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,523
come over
to my mom's house tonight?

900
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,920
It's just gonna be a little dinner.

901
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,922
But at least you're not going
to be sitting here alone.

902
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,047
That would be great.
But she can't leave the house.

903
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,123
The doctor just wants her
to kinda stay put. So...

904
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,527
But we're great.
We're gonna order in pizza,

905
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,889
eat our faces off
till she falls asleep at 8:30.

906
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,929
Then I'm gonna have
a glass of wine, maybe two.

907
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,043
I gotta tell you
that just sounds, uh,

908
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,280
a little bit depressing.

909
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,521
- I mean, for Christmas Eve.
- It's not depressing.

910
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,364
If you think it's so depressing,
why don't you come over?

911
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,965
Come over for the wine part.

912
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,603
You know what,
I would love to.

913
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,086
But I actually...
It's Christmas Eve.

914
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,923
And we've got
this thing going on

915
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,606
with my father
and my whole family that...

916
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,603
that's gonna need
to be addressed tonight.

917
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,842
Yeah. So you're gonna
need a drink.

918
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
Yes. I probably will.

919
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,641
So, you know what,
maybe when I'm done with them,

920
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,610
- I could come by here.
- Yeah. Okay.

921
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,327
All right. I'll, uh...
I'll throw a pebble at your window

922
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,322
if you're still up.

923
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,800
All right.
Just don't wake up Nancy, please.

924
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,201
GERRY: [sighs]
What do you say, Dad?

925
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,840
Hey. I was hoping to get
a decent burger.

926
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,081
But no such luck.

927
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:35,367
Yeah. Well, that didn't stop you
from eating it.

928
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,931
That's probably
why this place is empty.

929
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,889
You know my dad would be heartbroken,
he saw the place like this.

930
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,086
Yeah, well, look,
you're more than welcome

931
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,367
to jump behind the grill
any time you want.

932
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,324
[Dad sighs]

933
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,922
Why don't you get some young people
in here, you know?

934
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,490
Bring the kids in.

935
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,768
Hey, maybe your brother, Cyril...

936
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,925
Good idea. Dad,
Cyril just got out of rehab today.

937
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,400
All right? The last thing he needs
in his life is this bar.

938
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,887
Yeah.

939
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,440
That's another regret in my life.

940
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,806
- I don't even know that kid.
- Yeah.

941
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,445
Try picking up the phone.

942
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,085
He won't talk to me.

943
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,445
You know what he told me?

944
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,360
That I'm dead in his life.

945
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,601
Can you blame him?

946
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,722
You were a lousy father.

947
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,121
Exaggerated.

948
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,090
I slapped the kids around
a little bit. But...

949
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,969
that's the way it went
in those days.

950
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,326
I'm not talking about that.

951
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,208
You walked out on us.

952
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,766
- I got back when I could.
- Yeah. Which was never.

953
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,648
Look, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

954
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,960
So, what else you got, Dad?

955
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,487
Ah, I went to see Father Mike.

956
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,210
I had a confession.

957
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,123
You must have been in there
a while.

958
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,925
Hmm.

959
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,043
We had a good talk.

960
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,088
Well, I didn't with Mom.

961
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:50,686
I spoke to her and she does not
want this to happen at all.

962
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,481
I don't understand that woman.

963
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,961
All I wanna be is with my family
at Christmas.

964
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,280
Is that so unreasonable?

965
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,806
You're just lonely.

966
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,927
All right? This is your first
Christmas on your own.

967
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:06,050
After the holidays pass,
I'm sure you will be fine.

968
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,085
No, Gerald.

969
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,480
It's, uh...

970
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:13,088
It's gonna be my last Christmas.

971
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,925
Your last Christmas?

972
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,969
What are you gonna do?
Kill yourself because of the money?

973
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,327
Because of Carol.
I mean, come on, Dad.

974
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,811
Oh, it's not that.

975
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,329
Well, then what--what is it?

976
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,005
I'm dyin'.

977
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,768
Pancreatic cancer.

978
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,969
Very advanced.

979
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,007
I got four or five months, tops.

980
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,646
[Whispers] What?

981
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,007
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

982
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,764
What are the doctors saying?

983
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,650
That I'm dying.

984
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,563
Oh, Jesus Christ.

985
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,481
Who else knows?

986
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,331
Just Erin.

987
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,168
Driving over to see Dorothy,
tell her, then...

988
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,369
I thought it would be better
to tell each of you face to face.

989
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,722
So... I need your help.

990
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,570
Can you talk to your mother?

991
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,840
Tell her this is
so important to me.

992
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,639
Okay. Yeah.

993
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,005
- I will.
- Okay?

994
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,128
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Gerry.

995
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,521
[Pats Gerry's hand]

996
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:31,244
We got a good family.

997
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,248
The best.

998
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,766
The best.

999
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:44,610
- Let me get you a drink.
- Yeah.

1000
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,324
[exhales deeply]

1001
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,880
[doorbell rings]

1002
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,090
Skippy, it's...

1003
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,240
What are you doing here?

1004
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,686
It's Christmas Eve.

1005
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,804
I've got some gifts for the boys.

1006
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,126
I was hoping
that maybe we could talk.

1007
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,963
No. I don't want to talk.

1008
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,929
I told you if you wanna talk,
call my cell.

1009
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,206
Is he here?

1010
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:18,846
- There's nobody here.
- There's nobody here.

1011
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,126
Is he in my flaping bed?

1012
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,847
Because I'd like to have
a little chat with him,

1013
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,922
- rip his flaping head off.
- Calm down.

1014
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,047
There's nobody here. All right?

1015
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:29,048
What is going on?

1016
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:31,971
I can't do this anymore, okay?

1017
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,003
Our life wasn't bad,
but I know that there's more out there.

1018
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,525
- And I just can't do it.
- What is that?

1019
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,762
What's... What's...
What's better?

1020
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,882
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1021
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,326
I don't know, but when I find it
I'll let you know.

1022
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,050
Oh, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

1023
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,360
That's extremely generous.

1024
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:46,806
Please, please,
let me know when you find it.

1025
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,367
Skippy.

1026
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,329
Merry flaping Christmas, Dot.

1027
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,005
[Footsteps]

1028
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,329
DOTTIE: Hey. Hey.
Where are you going?

1029
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,527
- Hey.
- Come on.

1030
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:27,842
Yeah. You know
with Mr. Ryan comin'...

1031
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,967
And I gotta go help my mother
for dinner tonight.

1032
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,521
No, no, no, no. Come on.
I want some more action.

1033
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:33,721
I would. I would.

1034
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,201
But I gotta go pick up
a bunch of fish for my mom

1035
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,010
and help her with the tree
and with the lights.

1036
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,923
You know, I'm looking forward
to meeting your mom tonight.

1037
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,844
Yeah, Dottie, about that...

1038
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,480
Um, you know, it's just gonna be

1039
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,610
sort of like a little get-together
with family.

1040
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,730
I'll bring a few decent bottles
of wine, okay?

1041
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,248
'Cause it's terrible to eat a nice dinner
with cheap-ass wine.

1042
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,402
- All right?
- Okay.

1043
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:59,005
- All right. Bye.
- Ciao,<i>mammone.</i>

1044
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,240
<i>Ciao.</i>

1045
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,480
Good morning.

1046
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,965
- Hey.
- How are you?

1047
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,405
Good.

1048
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:12,005
- Oh, hi, babe.
- Hi.

1049
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,242
It's 1 P.M.,
so that's actually afternoon.

1050
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,402
Oh, good afternoon.

1051
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,284
All right. What's the plan?
What are we doing?

1052
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,086
Hey.
Just doing a crossword.

1053
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,445
What do you need,
a four-letter word

1054
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,762
for sitting around on your ass
on a beautiful day?

1055
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,925
Just relax, okay.
Have a little breakfast.

1056
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,286
Relax? No, come on.
I wanna go down to the beach.

1057
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,681
Mm-mm. It's way too cold
to go to the beach today.

1058
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,842
I got some herb
if anybody wants some.

1059
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:38,041
- Really, you got weed?
- Yeah.

1060
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:40,601
Wait. Seriously, we're not going
to the beach at all while we're here?

1061
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,204
- No. We are going to the beach.
- Just relax.

1062
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,168
You and I,
we're going to the beach.

1063
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,721
Enjoy the herb.

1064
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:47,166
I will.

1065
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,601
Come on, last chance.

1066
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,121
Have a good time.
I'll see you when you get back.

1067
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,405
Okay.

1068
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,280
Hi.

1069
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,248
Hey.

1070
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,048
- Where you been?
- I was down at the pub.

1071
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,922
That was fun last night.

1072
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,969
Yeah. I guess.

1073
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,320
Been a while.

1074
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,969
Yeah.

1075
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:19,447
Actually, it's been
about three months.

1076
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,806
Yeah. Well,
I've got things on my mind.

1077
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,364
You know howl remembered?

1078
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,601
'Cause it was so special?

1079
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,001
Yeah, it was.

1080
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,043
You're not gonna believe it.

1081
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,487
And I didn't want to tell you
'cause I know you're scared,

1082
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:35,885
but it's gonna be okay.

1083
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,963
No. What are you talking about?

1084
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:40,365
I missed a couple of periods.

1085
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,005
- You what?
- And I took a pregnancy test.

1086
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,606
- And guess what?
- No, no, no, no, Connie, do not say that.

1087
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,170
- Oh, JJ, it's a good thing.
- Do not say this.

1088
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,362
- It's a good thing.
- No, no, no. This is not a good thing.

1089
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:50,284
This is a goddamn disaster.

1090
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,090
How could you let this happen?

1091
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,804
How the hell could you
let this happen?

1092
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,882
We can't afford this.

1093
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,530
It's gonna be fine because you're
gonna find something soon.

1094
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:57,806
And we can ask
my brothers for help.

1095
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,485
No, no, no, no. I don't want
any favors from your brothers.

1096
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,369
- shooot. This is a nightmare.
- Oh, JJ. JJ.

1097
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:03,442
Once it settles in,
you're gonna see it.

1098
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,681
- Why didn't you take the pill like I asked you to?
- This is a blessing.

1099
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,445
- JJ, we're gonna have a family.
- A blessing?

1100
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:09,806
Yeah. Oh, come on.

1101
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,449
Just get out of my way.

1102
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,521
RICHIE: Hey.

1103
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,364
You better get your ass
out of here right now

1104
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:20,123
- before I kick your...
- Piss off, Richie.

1105
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,043
Get your ass out of here.

1106
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1107
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,199
Yeah, I'm okay.

1108
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,210
What are you doing with this guy?
He's a total scumbag.

1109
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,766
No, no. It's not like that.
He's just having a hard time.

1110
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,409
He's out of work and...

1111
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,244
Bullshit. I've heard
what goes on over here.

1112
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,731
Look. I'll call Gerry, okay?

1113
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,449
He'll know what to do.
Please, just... It's fine.

1114
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:43,726
It's fine.

1115
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:46,846
Thank you.

1116
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,242
Father, not a word of this
to anyone.

1117
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,760
Agreed. Confidential.

1118
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,730
And now, I want to ask
something of you.

1119
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,530
Anything you want, Father.

1120
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,161
James was in to see me
this afternoon.

1121
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,766
Was he, really?

1122
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,440
I am forbidden to break
the seal of confession

1123
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,320
but I want you to know
that he is deeply sorry

1124
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,208
for the wrongs he committed
in the past,

1125
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,250
particularly to you
and the children.

1126
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,608
I'm glad he's made
his peace with you.

1127
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,121
But I am not having him
over tomorrow.

1128
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,362
Rosie, he only has
a few months left.

1129
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,005
A few months?

1130
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:46,400
Where's he going?

1131
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:48,286
He's dying.

1132
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:50,646
Is that what he told you?

1133
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,121
People don't lie about dying.

1134
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,164
Then you don't know
the same James that I know.

1135
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,681
Rosie, this is it.

1136
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,603
Now, he's going to be dead soon

1137
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,684
and I suggest,
in your own best interest,

1138
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,284
that you forgive him

1139
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,967
and invite him back into the arms
of his own family.

1140
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,644
Family?

1141
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,643
Is that what he calls us now?

1142
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,407
You insisted on having
this child baptized.

1143
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,009
Yet you yourself will not follow
Christ's teaching on forgiveness?

1144
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,731
Because he's got his whole life
ahead of him.

1145
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,847
Me?

1146
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,570
I figure I'm already a lost cause.

1147
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:30,451
This is not the season
for your jokes

1148
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:32,125
or for hardness of heart.

1149
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,931
You say that as if I have
a choice in the matter.

1150
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,923
- Thanks again, Father.
- [phone rings]

1151
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,802
<i>Hi, this is Rosie.
Leave it at the beep.</i>

1152
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,007
[beep]

1153
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,360
Yeah. Hey, Mom, it's me.

1154
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,681
Look, the whole idea
of having a cell phone

1155
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,003
is that periodically
you pick the thing up.

1156
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:53,481
All right, look. I just saw Dad.
He came by the restaurant.

1157
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,971
And we need to talk. Okay?

1158
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,360
So, give me a call
when you get this.

1159
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,411
Thank you very much.

1160
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,123
Hey, Nora, it's, uh,
it's Gerry.

1161
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,005
Look, uh...
[laughs nervously]

1162
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,963
I kinda need
to talk to someone

1163
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,090
who isn't completely
out of their flaping minds.

1164
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,001
And that kinda disqualifies
my entire family. So...

1165
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:26,521
ls there any way
I could maybe swing by,

1166
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,568
pick your brain for a little bit?

1167
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,969
All right. Great. I'll see you,
15, 20 minutes or so?

1168
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,322
All right. Perfect.
I'll just pull up outside.

1169
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,690
Cool. Thank you.

1170
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:44,525
COREY:
You know he married the shiksa.

1171
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,121
And he's celebrating his first
Christmas with her and her kids.

1172
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,282
[Erin laughs]

1173
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,204
Back up. Your father
is celebrating Christmas?

1174
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,963
He's making an effort.

1175
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,086
You see.

1176
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,083
These old geezers hook up
with a younger girl,

1177
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,650
they think they're getting
a free ride.

1178
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,960
But there is no such thing.

1179
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,929
I know.
I know, it's pathetic.

1180
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,320
- But that's not the point.
- No, it's hysterical.

1181
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,721
I would love to see the look
on your father's face

1182
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,768
as he has to pretend
to enjoy Christmas.

1183
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,126
Oh, she should make him
dress up as Santa.

1184
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,123
[chuckles]
Well, I can grant you that wish

1185
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,963
since he wants us to be there.

1186
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,965
Absolutely not.

1187
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:22,123
I'm his only kid.

1188
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
This is his first Christmas.

1189
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,362
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1190
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:27,284
I'm serious. He wants us...
Thank you.

1191
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,521
He wants us to drive up
to Connecticut and help him do this.

1192
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:31,085
No shot.

1193
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:33,804
We've always done every Christmas
with your family.

1194
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,882
I mean...

1195
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,960
Last year.

1196
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,009
Erin, that was awful.
I mean...

1197
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,882
Well, he was drunk and he apologized
and he's sober now.

1198
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,485
Okay.

1199
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:47,721
Listen, I don't ask for much.

1200
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,166
All I'm asking for
is this one Christmas.

1201
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,085
Well, it would kill my mother especially
since we just blew off her birthday.

1202
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:54,447
You don't even like
your brothers and sisters.

1203
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:55,521
Well, why not
blow them off this year?

1204
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,001
'Cause this year's different.
I'm sorry. End of discussion.

1205
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:01,005
End of discussion?

1206
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,130
What--What's so different
about this year?

1207
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,519
Just different.

1208
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,322
Why won't you talk to me?

1209
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,170
Can we please just shop?

1210
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,164
- Let's shop.
- Okay.

1211
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,362
See? Isn't this great?

1212
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:31,760
QUINN: Yeah, it's great.
Freezing my balls off.

1213
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,322
So, hey, you're really
gonna propose to this girl?

1214
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,447
Yeah. It's time.

1215
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:39,601
Why? Why is it time?

1216
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,809
Why can't you give it a year,
or like, at least another month.

1217
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,327
Because I'm not getting
any younger, Sharon.

1218
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,050
And I want to have kids
before I'm an old man.

1219
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,530
Well, do you love her?

1220
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:54,568
I like her...a great deal.

1221
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,528
She has her faults, but...

1222
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,684
she's a good kid.
She's smart, she's funny.

1223
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,489
But you don't love her.

1224
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:05,722
She comes from
a very good family.

1225
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,768
It's a shame she can't say
the same thing about you.

1226
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,001
That's another reason
I gotta lock this girl down.

1227
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:12,440
But you can't tell me
that you love her.

1228
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:17,039
You know, at my age,
love is not the first priority.

1229
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:20,402
I'm done looking around.
This is it.

1230
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,400
[Quinn exhales]

1231
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:24,891
- [cellphone chiming]
- Oh.

1232
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,965
Richie T?

1233
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,485
Hey. Rich, what's up?

1234
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,847
What?

1235
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,010
Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.

1236
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,331
Which sister?

1237
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,364
Is he still there?

1238
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:52,240
Okay. I'm on my way.

1239
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,561
What is it?
What happened?

1240
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,244
JJ flaping hit Connie.

1241
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,523
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

1242
00:55:57,679 --> 00:55:59,681
I gotta go deal with this.
I'll drop you off at the house.

1243
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,967
No freaking way.
I'm coming with you.

1244
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,969
[Knock on door]

1245
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,965
Hi, honey.

1246
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,487
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1247
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:20,722
Listen, this is
flaping horrible, okay?

1248
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,449
- No, no, no.
- No, it's terrible.

1249
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,284
Listen, you're not
going back to your house.

1250
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,766
- You can stay with me--
- No, you don't know the whole story--

1251
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,159
No, listen. You can stay with Mom
or you can stay with me,

1252
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,485
but you're never going
back to that house.

1253
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:29,880
No, it's my house.

1254
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:32,121
Yeah. But you've got to do
this now, honey.

1255
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,721
- You know, he had a hard year.
- Oh, flap that.

1256
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,121
flap that. I'm sorry.
That's what you said the last time

1257
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,280
and the time before

1258
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,282
and you keep giving him
another chance,

1259
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,487
- and look what happens.
- Oh, I know.

1260
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:42,606
You've gotta do this.
I mean,

1261
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
you've got to tell him
that you're leaving him.

1262
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,041
You're gonna file for divorce
and that's it.

1263
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:46,360
I'm pregnant.

1264
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,409
Oh, my God.
Oh, Connie.

1265
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,327
- Why?
- I don't know why.

1266
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,208
It just happened.

1267
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,771
And he knows this?

1268
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,570
And he still pushed you?

1269
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,050
I'm sorry,
for the sake of this kid

1270
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:02,724
you've got to get him
the hell out of your life.

1271
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,449
He's an asshole.

1272
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:06,601
- You have to, honey.
- I know.

1273
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,364
- Okay.
- [doorbell rings]

1274
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:11,485
- You think it's him?
- I don't know.

1275
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,449
Here.
Go hide in the TV room.

1276
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:16,965
Oh, my God, it's Dad.

1277
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,605
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1278
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,969
- Daddy?
- Hey, it's Christmas Eve.

1279
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,201
- What are you doing?
- I got presents.

1280
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,521
I sot gifts.

1281
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,045
- Good to see you.
- Come in. Oh, my God.

1282
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,440
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

1283
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,001
Oh, it's Christmas Eve.
Come on.

1284
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,889
It's the best.

1285
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,963
- Baby, Connie, how are you?
- Hi, Daddy.

1286
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:40,043
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, sweetie.

1287
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:41,440
- All right.
- This is great.

1288
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:42,561
The house looks fabulous.

1289
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:43,721
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1290
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,804
Is it too early for wine?
Because, you know, I could use a glass.

1291
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:50,521
This is ridiculous.
I mean...

1292
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,090
I'm just give 'em a quick call.

1293
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,121
Hmm.

1294
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,925
See what's going on.

1295
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,289
[cellphone vibrating]

1296
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,686
Oh, shooot.

1297
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,206
- Hey.
- FX: Hey.

1298
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,282
What's going on?
It's like, almost two hours.

1299
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,726
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I should have called earlier. I'm sorry.

1300
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,320
But we had an emergency
and so we had to go.

1301
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,844
You had to go?
What are you talking about?

1302
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,239
What kind of emergency?

1303
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,925
We had a family emergency,
but we're taking care of it.

1304
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:16,161
Well, when are you
coming back here?

1305
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,367
And what are you talking about?
When are you coming back here?

1306
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:20,601
I don't know.
We have to go by one of my sister's.

1307
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,885
We don't have
a flaping car here.

1308
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,246
You're leaving me stranded
here without a car?

1309
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,925
What are you talking about?

1310
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,889
I don't understand.
Are you kidding me with this?

1311
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,041
I'm telling you that we have
a family emergency

1312
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:30,724
and this is how you react to that?

1313
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,166
Look, I can't even talk to you right now.

1314
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,284
- God, what a jerk.
- What, they pissed at us?

1315
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,771
I don't really give a crap.

1316
00:58:58,199 --> 00:58:59,565
Ohh.

1317
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:01,440
What's up?
ls everything okay?

1318
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:02,846
[sighs]

1319
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,686
I don't even know why I called,
quite honestly,

1320
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,161
dragging you into my mess.

1321
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,606
Don't worry about it.

1322
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:12,201
What's going on?

1323
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,324
All right. Well, it's...

1324
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,806
It's my dad.

1325
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:19,971
He just told me he's got

1326
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:23,248
a few months to live and...
[sighs]

1327
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,880
I don't know,
I'm just kind of numb,

1328
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,161
I didn't know who else to call.

1329
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:29,240
[Gerry sighs]

1330
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:30,851
You're probably sitting here
looking at me like,

1331
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,804
"Who the flap is this guy?
I just met you yesterday

1332
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,161
"and you're dropping
this shooot on me?"

1333
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,606
No. I'm not.

1334
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:38,969
- I'm not. I'm not at all. Yeah.
- You sure?

1335
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,485
Don't apologize.

1336
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,288
Oh, you know,
I mean, he's dying, right?

1337
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,206
So, obviously I'm upset, but...

1338
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,762
I'm also flaping furious with him

1339
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,163
because it's the kind of bullshit
he's always pulled.

1340
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,806
You know, he only calls
when he wants something from me,

1341
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,610
like everybody else
in my family.

1342
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,969
You know, they're all consumed
with their own shooot.

1343
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:05,527
I mean, yesterday,
it's my mother's birthday, and...

1344
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:08,081
not one of them can find time
in their busy flaping schedules

1345
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,048
to come out and celebrate
her day with her?

1346
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:12,168
And they get that from him
because...

1347
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,331
you know, he's the most selfish
son of a bitch alive.

1348
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,324
And, you know, now,
now he wants my help because...

1349
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,800
he wants to come home
for Christmas.

1350
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,409
And I'm like, "You know what,
I've been helping you

1351
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,079
since you walked out on us
20 years ago."

1352
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,891
I mean,
I raised half of his kids.

1353
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:32,882
I took care of my mother
when she was losing her mind

1354
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:34,041
those first couple of years,

1355
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:36,168
and he's off in Manhattan
having a great time.

1356
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,364
I even took over his father's business
when his old man died.

1357
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,405
And I didn't wanna do
any of this shooot.

1358
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:43,880
I didn't ask for it, but I didn't have
a flaping choice, you know.

1359
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:45,643
And it's like...
Do you think he ever said thank you?

1360
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,690
Do you think any of them ever say
thank you for anything? No.

1361
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:52,400
I'm just...

1362
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,286
[sighs]

1363
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,726
I just... I'm kinda...

1364
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,842
I just wish I could be
flaping done with them.

1365
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,239
The whole...

1366
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,922
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm just...

1367
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,922
No, no, no, no. That's okay.

1368
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,403
Is there a question in there
anywhere

1369
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:12,965
OI' are we...

1370
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,487
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

1371
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,563
- You know?
- What do you wanna do?

1372
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,291
I wanna wash my hands
of the whole lot of them.

1373
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,521
Just like, "You know what,
why don't you guys just figure it out

1374
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,090
on your own for once?"

1375
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,726
So do that.

1376
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,603
You know,
have your dad figure it out,

1377
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,286
have your brothers and sisters
figure it out for themselves.

1378
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,362
Let them
do it for themselves.

1379
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,440
It might surprise you.

1380
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,608
I seriously doubt it. But...

1381
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,123
I definitely like the idea
of letting them try, you know.

1382
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,282
I think that's the hardest thing
in the world, you know,

1383
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,965
for people like us.

1384
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,443
But it sounds like it's time.

1385
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,806
SHARON:
Connie went over to Dot's.

1386
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,121
Hopefully this guy's
still flaping here.

1387
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,686
[Brakes screech]

1388
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,603
- QUINN: Stay here.
- SHARON: [scoffs] You kidding?

1389
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,088
Hey, jerk-off, what is your problem?

1390
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,923
- Hey, douchebag!
- You can't keep your hands to yourself?

1391
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,724
Seriously,
what is your problem?

1392
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,485
Do me a favor
and listen real close.

1393
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:19,927
You're gonna go inside,
you're gonna pack up,

1394
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,161
and you're gonna
get the flap out of this house.

1395
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,322
- That's right.
- And out of Queens.

1396
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,563
I see you here past tonight,

1397
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,443
you're not going to the hospital,

1398
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:31,244
you're going to the flaping morgue.

1399
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,686
And he means it.
Don't you think he doesn't.

1400
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,804
You understand me?

1401
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,041
Answer me!

1402
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:39,690
[whispers] I understand.

1403
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:42,847
Now get the flap out of here.

1404
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,128
Get the flap out of here!

1405
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,003
Pack your shooot and go.

1406
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:54,971
We'll wait till he leaves.

1407
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,284
Hey, Rosie, we're home.

1408
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,726
Oh, um, I'm in the TV room.

1409
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,251
Where's Aaron?

1410
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,851
He's still napping.

1411
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,728
Oh, Mom,
you can't let him sleep all day.

1412
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,643
I'll never get him to bed tonight.

1413
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,927
It's all right. I got him.
How was he?

1414
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:16,240
He was great.

1415
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,847
ROSIE: Erin.

1416
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:24,367
Could you come in here?
I-I've got something I wanna tell you.

1417
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,641
I talked to Gerry.

1418
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,407
And I'm assuming that you want me
to have your father over tomorrow, too.

1419
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,525
Yeah. Of course I do.

1420
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:38,648
And you really believe this bullshit
that he's dying?

1421
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,442
No, Mom, it's for real.
He's been sick for a while.

1422
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:45,126
It wouldn't be the first time
he told an elaborate lie

1423
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,280
to get what he wants.

1424
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,487
Mom, I've been with him
to the hospital

1425
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:50,688
and I've gone with him
to see the specialist.

1426
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,764
The why wouldn't he
tell anyone before this?

1427
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,606
And on my birthday, too.
That's a great present.

1428
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,764
He didn't want anyone to know.
I haven't even told Corey yet.

1429
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,925
Why would the stubborn jackass wait
and keep it a secret?

1430
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:06,411
Mom, you know Dad.

1431
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,686
He thought he'd beat it.

1432
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,650
Oh, he's been
such a stubborn old fool.

1433
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,086
- Mom!
- Well, I don't know what to say.

1434
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,322
If anyone deserved it,
it would be him.

1435
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,603
But there will be no tears
shed for him from me.

1436
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:24,971
How can you say such a thing?

1437
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,885
I know he hurt you
but he's still our father.

1438
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:31,010
The pain he's dealing with now

1439
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:35,210
is insignificant
to the pain he's caused us.

1440
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,168
What about me?

1441
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,210
What about you, your childhood,
those little ones?

1442
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,125
Never having a father
in the house.

1443
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,601
That is real pain.

1444
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,887
Pain you carry with you
for a lifetime.

1445
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,690
So you're gonna cause
more pain for all of us

1446
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,682
and not let him come over.

1447
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,846
When he walked out on this family
20 years ago,

1448
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,641
I told him he would never set foot
in my house again,

1449
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,166
and I am sticking to it.

1450
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,164
You son of a bitch.

1451
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,568
You're not gonna make me cry.

1452
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,121
Son of a bitch!

1453
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,440
Oh.

1454
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:41,449
- QUINN: Hey, Dottie, we're here.
- Oh, hey.

1455
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,931
We're in the kitchen.

1456
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:46,806
Whoa!
Dad, what are you doing here?

1457
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:49,288
And a very merry to you too.

1458
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,045
I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.
How you doing?

1459
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,123
DAD: Give me a hug.
There you go.

1460
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,806
- Sharon.
- No. I'm good. Thanks.

1461
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,889
Why didn't you tell us
Dad's here?

1462
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:04,168
Uh... He just showed up.

1463
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,400
[Dottie and Dad laugh nervously]

1464
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,681
All right.
Well, despite this pleasant surprise,

1465
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,887
we came to see Connie.

1466
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,407
Now, before I get to the part
about how you're an idiot,

1467
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,324
- are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1468
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,719
Okay, good, because you're
a flaping idiot.

1469
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,041
- Thanks.
- What are you doing with this guy?

1470
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,240
- Sharon?
- Are you kidding me?

1471
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,969
Sharon, Sharon, please.

1472
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:22,606
Listen, she's just upset
and frankly, so am I.

1473
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,889
I gotta find out from Richie T
what's going on in your marriage?

1474
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,085
We just came from a little visit
with your soon-to-be ex-husband.

1475
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:30,400
- CONNIE: What did you do?
- Quinn.

1476
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,846
Quinn, what did you do?

1477
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,001
I just talked to the guy.

1478
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,644
But believe me,
he got the message.

1479
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,045
- What's this you're talking about?
- Nothing.

1480
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:38,246
It's none of your business.
Just butt out.

1481
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,889
- Can I talk to you privately?
- Sure.

1482
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:43,365
[sighs] us...

1483
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,967
- What did you do to him?
- I did not hurt him.

1484
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,451
Not that he didn't deserve it.

1485
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,090
But you know what?
I got a question for you.

1486
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,804
This is going on,
you don't tell me about it?

1487
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,246
- What's that about?
- Well, it's not like we talk a lot, Quinn.

1488
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,925
I'm still your brother.

1489
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:02,925
And if anybody hurts you ever,
I wanna know about it.

1490
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,610
And just so you know,
what I did tell this prick,

1491
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,967
is he is never
to go near you again,

1492
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:12,846
which also means,

1493
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,206
you are never going near him
again either.

1494
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,202
You're finished with this guy.

1495
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,442
- I know, I know, I know.
- Do you?

1496
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,210
- [sighs]
- Because if this happens again,

1497
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,168
I will flaping kill this guy.

1498
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,123
And doing 25 to life,
for homicide,

1499
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,884
is really gonna screw up my plans
for the future.

1500
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:31,643
So...

1501
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,643
Please don't put me
in that position.

1502
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:37,440
Connie,

1503
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,246
I love you.

1504
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,722
So, Sharon, uh...

1505
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,166
Dad stopped by because he has
some big announcement

1506
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,731
he wants to share with all of us.

1507
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,159
Isn't that right, Daddy?

1508
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,210
Well, it's nothing
to celebrate, really,

1509
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:02,050
although some of you might.

1510
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:06,324
I...
It's just something I...

1511
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,170
I need to discuss with you.

1512
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:13,483
Can't wait. I gotta go outside
and make a phone call.

1513
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:14,641
DOTTIE: Sharon...

1514
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,765
[door opening]

1515
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,164
[door closes]

1516
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,091
Don't mind her, Daddy.
She's just a spoiled brat.

1517
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,122
Yeah, can't blame her though.

1518
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:27,690
Can't blame her.

1519
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:31,122
What are you talking about,
you're not coming back tonight?

1520
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,567
Look, we just figured,
since we're already out here

1521
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,485
and you seem to be dealing with
some kind of important emergency

1522
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,085
that we thought we'd
just hang out a little bit.

1523
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:40,923
What is this "we"?

1524
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:43,280
Me and Abbie.

1525
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:44,930
Yeah, yeah, I know who.

1526
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,729
Sharon, I don't know what
you want me to say, okay?

1527
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,007
You and your brother seemed
to think it was fine to take off

1528
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,445
and abandon us
without saying anything.

1529
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,324
I don't know what the flap you thought
was gonna happen.

1530
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,284
Okay, I told you we had
a family emergency.

1531
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,720
Right, I don't know what you
want me to say, Sharon.

1532
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,680
Okay? We're hanging out,
and we're kinda having a good time.

1533
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,524
You're "kinda having a good time"?

1534
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,841
[laughs humorlessly]

1535
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,650
You know my brother is planning on
proposing to her tonight!

1536
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,244
You have to get her back here.

1537
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,528
You know, he may wanna
check his voice-mail on that one,

1538
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,524
because she's pretty pissed off
that he left without saying anything.

1539
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,329
Let her know.

1540
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,163
FX: And you know what, Sharon?

1541
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,243
Seeing as you think this relationship
has no future,

1542
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,925
I was kinda thinking
this might be a good time

1543
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:23,411
for us to call it quits anyhow.

1544
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,166
[gasps] Oh, my God.

1545
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,606
You know what?
You are a creepy old freak

1546
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,284
and the two of you
deserve each other.

1547
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:32,090
- Yeah, whatever.
- [laughing]

1548
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,685
- Nice.
- Done.

1549
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,805
[sighs]

1550
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,283
CYRIL: I had no idea
what to get you,

1551
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,123
so you're probably
gonna hate it.

1552
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,043
Got Ma something nice, though.

1553
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,439
That's good.

1554
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,529
Hey.

1555
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,841
You know you're gonna
get through this, right?

1556
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,206
You think so?

1557
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,961
Absolutely flaping certain of it.

1558
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:06,121
Gerry,

1559
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:09,520
I don't know
what the hell to do now.

1560
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,962
Look, you don't need to worry
about that right now, all right?

1561
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,168
After the New Year,
we'll get you hooked up with a job,

1562
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,970
or maybe, I don't know,
you go back to school, maybe both.

1563
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:19,121
Go back to school?

1564
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,247
I'm not going back
to flaping school.

1565
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:24,725
What the flap job
am I gonna get?

1566
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,644
I will find you something, all right?

1567
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,721
You're home now.

1568
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,166
- You're with your family.
- [sighs]

1569
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:30,320
All right? That's what we do.

1570
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:31,720
We take care of one another.

1571
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,529
[cellphone vibrating]

1572
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,284
shooot, man, I'm sorry.

1573
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:40,328
Speaking of family...

1574
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:42,005
Yo, Fitzy, what you got?

1575
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,480
Hey, Gerry, it's Quinn.

1576
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,289
[sighs heavily]
What are you doing right now?

1577
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:48,408
No, I'm just actually
sitting here with Cyril.

1578
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,770
- We're having a little talk.
- QUINN: Dad's here. He just told us.

1579
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,167
Can you flaping believe
he's dying?

1580
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:58,685
Anyway,
you gotta get over here.

1581
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,841
We need to talk about Christmas.

1582
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,240
All right, yeah.
Yeah, we'll be right over.

1583
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,409
You think you're ready
to see the old man?

1584
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,484
No. [laughs]

1585
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,686
No!

1586
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,801
[soft music playing]

1587
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,002
ROSIE:
So what's with her nibs?

1588
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:20,445
How does she know my Gerry?

1589
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,728
Oh, they met here, yesterday.

1590
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,128
She asked about him,
so I sent her up to the bar to meet him.

1591
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,688
But don't you think
she's a little old for him?

1592
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,411
No, I don't think so.
I think they'd make a cute couple.

1593
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:35,005
- Well, what's her story?
- [chuckles]

1594
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:37,242
No, rea--
Why isn't she married?

1595
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,605
At her age.

1596
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,286
I'm not as nosy as you.
I didn't ask her.

1597
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:43,288
She seems like a nice girl.

1598
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:45,005
I thought I'd do them each a favor.

1599
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:47,765
Yeah, but there must be a story.
There's always a story.

1600
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,890
What do you want?
Do you want him to die a bachelor?

1601
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,600
No kids, having a Christmas
like the one that I'm gonna have tomorrow

1602
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,646
with no one by my side?

1603
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,244
Look, you do not have to be alone.

1604
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:58,890
I want you to come over
to my house.

1605
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:00,729
I don't want to go to your house.

1606
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,770
There's gonna be more drama there
than my poor heart can take.

1607
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,086
[Rosie sighs heavily]

1608
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,320
[Exhales]

1609
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,887
So what am I gonna do about James?

1610
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:15,527
I can't have that man in my house.

1611
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,449
I gotta tell you something.

1612
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,762
My Thomas,
that son of a bitch,

1613
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,002
as much as I hated him
with a passion,

1614
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,163
there's not a day that goes by

1615
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:29,805
that I don't wish that he were here.

1616
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,006
You don't mean that.

1617
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,405
I do. I do mean it.

1618
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,925
And you know what I would do?

1619
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:36,082
I would tie him up in that chair

1620
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,287
and I would pistol-whip him
until he screamed

1621
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:40,568
for all the trouble
that he caused me.

1622
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,131
[Both laughing]

1623
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,287
- You know.
- [laughing]

1624
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:49,442
You know.

1625
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,680
[sighs]

1626
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,166
But seriously,

1627
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:54,963
if Deirdre were still here,

1628
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:57,009
and she wanted me
to forgive him,

1629
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:59,730
she wanted me to spend
Christmas with him...

1630
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,610
[clicks tongue]
how could I say no?

1631
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,323
Well, if I do forgive him,

1632
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,729
I might have to borrow your pistol.

1633
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,291
[Mrs. G. laughs]

1634
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:15,770
I mean it.

1635
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:22,003
- Hey! Look who's back.
- SHARON: Cyril!

1636
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,969
- Hey!
- CONNIE: Hi!

1637
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:28,523
CYRIL: Oh. [sighs]
Missed you.

1638
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,005
Come here.

1639
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,849
I'm really proud of you.

1640
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:40,399
How's it going, Son?

1641
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:42,524
Better than you, I hear.

1642
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,204
Yeah, you look good.

1643
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:46,168
Welcome back.

1644
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:47,845
Oh, shooot. Is this...

1645
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,886
...allowed?

1646
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:50,564
Are we okay to drink
in front of you?

1647
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,926
You never gave a shooot
about my feelings before. Okay?

1648
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:54,161
Don't start now.

1649
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:56,567
Makin' it easy.
That's a change.

1650
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,369
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1651
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,329
All right, so we're all here.
Let's talk about tomorrow.

1652
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,244
No, no, no, no.
Not till Erin gets here.

1653
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:06,402
[sighs] And why...
Why do I always forget her?

1654
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,641
Because she's a stuck-up
pain in the ass.

1655
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,846
You know,
she's really not stuck-up.

1656
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,126
She just thinks
she's better than you.

1657
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:13,168
Yeah, well,
she's not the only one.

1658
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:15,083
Where... Where are these
comments coming from?

1659
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:16,685
I think you know where
these comments are coming from.

1660
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,841
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1661
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,161
Yeah, we talked about this.

1662
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:20,650
Let's cut all the bullshit.

1663
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,042
Erin's been through this
every step of the way with me.

1664
01:14:24,199 --> 01:14:26,009
She brought me
to the best doctors.

1665
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,729
She's been at my bedside
all through this ordeal.

1666
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:33,561
So I don't want anybody
bad-mouthing her.

1667
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,801
We can still bad-mouth you,
though, right?

1668
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,842
[sighs] Do what you must.

1669
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:43,520
You know, Daddy,
you should've told us about this.

1670
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,805
We... We could've helped you.

1671
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,081
That's not entirely true.

1672
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,650
Yeah, I gotta agree with him on that.

1673
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,564
- Can't you guys just be nice?
- Who said anything about...

1674
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,801
QUINN: Yeah, you wanna chill
with the comments?

1675
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,569
It's Christmas. Be jolly and merry
and all that other shooot.

1676
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,768
No, no, no, no.
They're entitled. But...

1677
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,570
Hey, Gerry, why don't you call and see
if there's any word from Erin.

1678
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,041
I called her on the way over.

1679
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,530
She should be here any minute.

1680
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,244
[doorbell rings]

1681
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,640
An angel just got their wings.

1682
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,529
None for you, though, Pops.

1683
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,360
I'll get the door.

1684
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,726
God!

1685
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,404
- What the flap's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you, Cyril?

1686
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,927
- It was just a joke.
- Oh, it's a joke.

1687
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:17,447
Pancreatic cancer victim,
Christmas, it's a joke?

1688
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,203
Shut up.
Just lay off him, all right?

1689
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:20,327
- QUINN: Lay off?
- Yes!

1690
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:21,447
- You lay off!
- Give him a flaping break!

1691
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,011
[whispering]
Shh! Our father is dying!

1692
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:26,769
[Erin sobbing] Oh, Daddy.

1693
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,159
[softly] Nancy?

1694
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,605
You asleep?

1695
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,444
Mmm. I'm fine.

1696
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,444
I'm gonna go now, sweetie.

1697
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,648
Oh... Okay.

1698
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,449
- Have a good Christmas.
- Okay.

1699
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:02,890
She's falling asleep.

1700
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:05,645
[Chuckles]
Yeah, well, it's about that time.

1701
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,246
I understand
you...you met my boy.

1702
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:09,810
I did. I did.

1703
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,364
He's very nice.

1704
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,123
[laughs wryly]
I don't need you to tell me that.

1705
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,720
Okay.

1706
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,170
What's your name?

1707
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:22,686
My name? Nora.

1708
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,409
What's your last name?

1709
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,965
Daugherty.

1710
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:27,645
How do you spell that?

1711
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,246
If you're wondering
if I'm Irish, I'm not.

1712
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:32,163
Then what is it? Scottish?

1713
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:34,402
Grandparents were English.

1714
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,564
Merry Christmas.

1715
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,641
- [door opens]
- [whispering] Merry Christmas.

1716
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,801
[Door closes]

1717
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:48,483
So, what are we supposed to do
if Mom does not agree

1718
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,243
to have Dad over for Christmas?

1719
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:53,051
It seems clear she already said
she wasn't gonna have him over.

1720
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,528
Does she know he's dying?

1721
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,204
Yeah, she knows.

1722
01:16:58,359 --> 01:16:59,963
And she still said no?

1723
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:02,167
She's still got a lot of anger
towards your dad.

1724
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:04,208
But not all of it deserved.

1725
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:06,043
[Chuckles]
How do you figure that?

1726
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:08,042
She and I were young.

1727
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,002
[sighs] It's never black and white
as it seems.

1728
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:15,560
Oh, please, Dad,
don't even start with that.

1729
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,720
I mean, you cheated on her.

1730
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,166
How the hell is that
somehow her fault?

1731
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:20,726
Can you just give him
a flaping break, please?

1732
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,881
Look, we were kids.

1733
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,569
When Dorothy was born,

1734
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,847
neither one of us had an education.

1735
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,287
We weren't prepared
to deal with life.

1736
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:34,806
And life [sighs]...
just showed up,

1737
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,002
and we had to do
the best we could.

1738
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:38,969
Yeah, well, you know,
for some of us,

1739
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,484
- you did a good enough job.
- Mm-hmm.

1740
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,926
Yeah, for others,
you didn't do shooot.

1741
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:46,003
And I apologize to you, Cyril.

1742
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:50,248
And you too, Sharon,

1743
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,528
and Connie,

1744
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,488
all you little ones.

1745
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,164
I wasn't there.

1746
01:17:57,279 --> 01:17:58,690
It's unfortunate,

1747
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,479
for you,

1748
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,841
and me.

1749
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,810
All right.
So, we take a vote.

1750
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,645
If Mom refuses to have
Dad over for Christmas,

1751
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,724
then we have the holiday at Erin's

1752
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,564
and Mom is welcome to come
if she wants.

1753
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,404
Well, I just wanna say,

1754
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,403
that whatever you all decide,

1755
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,970
I will be having Christmas
with Mom.

1756
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:25,645
- Period.
- CYRIL: Yeah, me too.

1757
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,922
I don't care if Mom
changes her mind, Dad, but...

1758
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,206
I'm with Mom.

1759
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:33,921
Yeah, Dad, it wouldn't feel right
to leave Mom alone on Christmas.

1760
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:38,886
Okay, so, guess
there's nothing else to say.

1761
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:40,451
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I had no intention

1762
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,489
of breaking this family up
at Christmas.

1763
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,609
What I wanted to do is
pull you all together.

1764
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,007
If your mother doesn't want it,
she doesn't want it.

1765
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,404
Okay?
Let's forget about Christmas.

1766
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,846
You're all here.

1767
01:18:57,039 --> 01:18:58,769
Why can't we spend tonight...

1768
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,324
together?
It's Christmas Eve.

1769
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:02,083
Oh, shooot, it's Christmas Eve.

1770
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,402
I was supposed to propose
tonight.

1771
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,846
Oh, yeah, Quinn,
that's not gonna happen.

1772
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,001
What does that mean?

1773
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:10,685
You better check
your messages.

1774
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,250
What does that...
What do you mean?

1775
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:15,041
I'm really sorry.

1776
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,247
I didn't wanna say it
when I met her,

1777
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:18,323
but I knew she was a gold-digger.

1778
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:22,011
Go ahead, Gerry, say it.
I know what you're thinking.

1779
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,242
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

1780
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,484
What about the rest of you?

1781
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,371
You're not stealing
Christmas Eve from Mom.

1782
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,648
Yeah, look, I gotta go.
[sighs]

1783
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,529
I'm gonna go help Mom
get ready.

1784
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:41,569
How about you?

1785
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:46,283
I should go with them, Dad.
I'm sorry.

1786
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,564
I really wish
you could be there tomorrow.

1787
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,887
I hope Mom changes her mind.

1788
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:57,810
Well, Erin?

1789
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:00,166
You're gonna stick with me, right?

1790
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:02,606
Sorry, Daddy,
I should get home to Aaron,

1791
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,127
but don't worry.
Mom's gonna change her mind.

1792
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:09,440
Okay.

1793
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,689
Listen, Dad,
I'm really sorry. I...

1794
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,445
[stammers] I have to go
to a friend's house for dinner,

1795
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,841
and I'm late already.

1796
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:20,371
I'm sorry.

1797
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,561
I love you so much.
I hope I see you tomorrow, okay?

1798
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,085
Yeah, okay.

1799
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:31,810
[Door closes]

1800
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,046
I guess you reap what you sow.

1801
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,845
[sighs]

1802
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:45,164
Yeah. I made a lot of mistakes
in my life, Gerry.

1803
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,328
I was a bad father.

1804
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,289
I'm not a perfect man.

1805
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:56,929
[sighs]

1806
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:58,645
But God damn it,

1807
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:03,761
I should be able to spend
my last flaping Christmas

1808
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,484
with my family!

1809
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,126
It's not right.

1810
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:18,966
It's not right.

1811
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,569
I'll talk to Mom.

1812
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,926
Okay.

1813
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:29,730
Talk to Mom.

1814
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:32,923
[Door closes]

1815
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:34,319
[sighs]

1816
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,291
[Connie sniffles]

1817
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,167
Did you guys even know
he was sick at all?

1818
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,480
No.

1819
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,561
But I think it's pretty
flaping weird

1820
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,250
that Erin knew for, like, a year
and never said anything.

1821
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:56,050
Yeah, well,
Erin's flaping weird.

1822
01:21:56,199 --> 01:21:59,170
I think we should ask Mom
to let him come for dinner.

1823
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,001
Look, call me
a cold-hearted prick.

1824
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:03,570
I'm not feeling that much sympathy
for him.

1825
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,961
Why? What did he do
that was so bad?

1826
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:07,326
[Scoffs]

1827
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,010
He walked out on us?

1828
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:11,400
He never came to one
of our birthday parties.

1829
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,846
You know, I don't have one picture
of me and him together.

1830
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,604
Not one.

1831
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,000
CYRIL: shooot, he wasn't even there
the day I was born.

1832
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,689
No, I know. He didn't do shooot
for me either,

1833
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,364
but he is our father,

1834
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,329
and he's gonna be gone
in a few months.

1835
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:25,243
And you know...

1836
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,288
I feel bad for him for that,

1837
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:29,806
but I don't think that's a reason
for me to forgive him.

1838
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,364
Me neither.

1839
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,524
We forgave you.

1840
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,404
What are you talking about?
What did I do to you?

1841
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,288
All the shooot that you did
before you went to rehab?

1842
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:41,440
Connie.

1843
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,368
- What?
- What shooot did I do?

1844
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:47,527
You were that fucked up
you don't--you don't remember?

1845
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:50,850
You lied to me,

1846
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:53,850
you stole from me.

1847
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,400
And that's not even
the worst of it!

1848
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,845
- Connie!
- What?

1849
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,809
We said we weren't
gonna talk about it.

1850
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,404
Sharon, what?
What did I do to you?

1851
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,721
CONNIE: You and your crackhead
friends broke into her apartment

1852
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,801
and trashed the place.

1853
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,605
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

1854
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,329
[sighs heavily]

1855
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,920
- I'm sorry.
- [scoffs]

1856
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:16,411
It's okay. It's fine.

1857
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,166
You were sorry right when you did it.
It's okay.

1858
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:20,923
Sharon,
I don't remember doing that.

1859
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:24,083
I don't wanna talk about this.
We don't have to talk about it.

1860
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,925
Cyril, you're my brother.
I love you and I forgive you.

1861
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,923
See?

1862
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:33,162
That's all I'm saying.
You can forgive him?

1863
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:35,088
Can't we forgive our father?
Just one day?

1864
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:38,726
Just one day.
Just one flaping normal Christmas,

1865
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,484
once in my life!

1866
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,039
[sighs]

1867
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,600
Hey, Mom.

1868
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,604
You said it would be okay
if I spent the night?

1869
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,363
Of course, baby.

1870
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,289
Are you okay?

1871
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:57,488
Yeah. I'm fine.

1872
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,051
Okay.

1873
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:00,564
Good night.

1874
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,886
CYRIL:
Hey, Ma, where you at?

1875
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,850
Oh, my God! [laughs]

1876
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,966
I'm back!

1877
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:09,564
Oh, honey!

1878
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,721
Look who I brought.

1879
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,088
My two babies! Come down here
and give me some sugar!

1880
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,082
Oh! Oh!

1881
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:18,930
Cyril. Hi, honey!

1882
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:21,242
Oh! Look...
[exclaims softly]

1883
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,323
I can't believe you're here.

1884
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:26,163
What are you watching?

1885
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,287
Your father sent me this video.

1886
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,328
It's the first I've seen it.

1887
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:32,005
I just put the DVD in.

1888
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,490
Is that you guys?

1889
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:36,480
- Yeah?
- Really?

1890
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,368
- ROSIE: Yes. [laughs]
- CYRIL: Ah!

1891
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:40,402
Look at your hair!

1892
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,845
You look like you guys actually
liked each other.

1893
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,402
Yeah, well, on that day,
we loved one another.

1894
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,328
ROSIE:
Oh, my God.

1895
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:49,641
Look how handsome he is.

1896
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,689
I have to tell you guys,
you know,

1897
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,729
your father wasn't always a prick.

1898
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,804
Oh, he was charming.

1899
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,603
Oh, my God.

1900
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,564
We were something.

1901
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:08,368
I'm glad you guys
are here with me.

1902
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,760
Me too, Mom.

1903
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,284
Whoa.

1904
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:13,805
What a night.

1905
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,082
My girlfriend leaves me
for my sister's boyfriend and...

1906
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,203
Dad... [sighs]

1907
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:23,362
I know.
It really hasn't even sunk in yet.

1908
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,090
He does not seem that sick.

1909
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,722
Gerry, we gotta
make this happen.

1910
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,201
We don't have a say in this.

1911
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:32,327
Did you even talk to Mom?

1912
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,363
Yeah, yeah,
of course I did.

1913
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,561
All right? And I get both
of their point of views

1914
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,404
and I'm not taking sides.

1915
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,881
Well, man, you gotta
have a horse in this race.

1916
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:42,041
Oh, and you think
it should be Dad's?

1917
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,128
- He deserves to be there.
- Does he?

1918
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:46,926
This is a guy who walked out
on his family.

1919
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:48,849
His life had changed.

1920
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,479
Overnight, he's practically a millionaire
after he sells the company.

1921
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,961
I still don't understand
how that gives you an excuse

1922
01:25:54,119 --> 01:25:56,407
to walk out
on your wife and kids.

1923
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,403
We were only gonna be
holding him back.

1924
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,528
He had a dream.
He had to go for it.

1925
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,922
Great. So this "dream"
as you put it, can't involve us?

1926
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,845
You know, you say you understand
both points of view. Do you?

1927
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,411
He had to make a choice.

1928
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,921
Yeah, and he made
the wrong choice. Clearly.

1929
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:14,962
So, he fucked up.
He knows it.

1930
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:16,645
Give him a break.

1931
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,289
Think about how heartbreaking
this must be for him.

1932
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:20,926
Think about how heartbreaking
this must be for Mom.

1933
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:23,525
- Dredging up all these old feelings again.
- [sighs]

1934
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,569
I feel guilty
that I even brought it up.

1935
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,369
I wish I would've just
nipped it in the bud,

1936
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,761
told Dad it's not gonna happen.
No shot.

1937
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:33,725
Gerry, you gotta
talk to her again.

1938
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,761
Look, it's not up to me.

1939
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,371
This is Mom's call.

1940
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,408
I don't understand.

1941
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,163
When did this happen?

1942
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:47,287
Tonight at dinner.
She came over with her parents

1943
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,123
because our parents
are friends.

1944
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:50,280
You know,
and we got to talking.

1945
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:51,362
Oh, so that's it.

1946
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,761
You got to talking and now you're
back together again.

1947
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,729
No!
No, it's just what I told you.

1948
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,369
It's like this little
family get-together.

1949
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,606
But this is bullshit!

1950
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,569
I was supposed to come
to dinner with you.

1951
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,766
Not really, no.

1952
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,569
You kind of invited yourself.

1953
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,801
I did not!

1954
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,926
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

1955
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:07,844
I just didn't know
how to say no to you.

1956
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,331
This is unbelievable.

1957
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:11,766
So I can't come in
for dinner with you.

1958
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,569
She has all her nieces
and nephews here.

1959
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,643
It's a whole Christmas thing.
Look at me!

1960
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,369
Huh.

1961
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,248
I'm a flaping idiot.

1962
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:20,730
Johnny, what are you doing?

1963
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,164
Who's this you're talking to?

1964
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,560
JOHNNY: Hey...
How you doing, baby?

1965
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,161
Oh... Nobody.
It's just, uh... It's just...

1966
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:30,402
A lady I work for.

1967
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,685
I'm just a lady he works for.

1968
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,844
And I had to bring
his Christmas bonus by,

1969
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,082
for being such a good boy,

1970
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:39,720
cutting my grass all year.

1971
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,923
No worries, sweetheart.

1972
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,850
Seriously?

1973
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,689
Teresa. Hold on.

1974
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,128
ERIN: We're so lucky
to have him.

1975
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,845
He's the man.

1976
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:02,886
You know, I know we said
we'd have a few kids,

1977
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:06,203
but I think I'm good
with this little guy.

1978
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:08,521
Big families are overrated.

1979
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:11,010
Especially yours.

1980
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,207
I'm sorry I've been
being such a bitch lately.

1981
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:23,560
You wanna talk about it?

1982
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:28,360
It's my father.
[sniffles]

1983
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,207
He's been sick and he didn't
want me to tell anyone.

1984
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:33,805
Sick? How sick? How?

1985
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:37,926
He's only got a couple of months.
[sniffles]

1986
01:28:38,119 --> 01:28:41,090
- Hey... Hey, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry I didn't...

1987
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:43,048
He made me promise
not to tell anyone.

1988
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:44,247
[softly] Oh.

1989
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:46,640
It's okay, it's okay.

1990
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,409
Erin, it's okay. Hey.

1991
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,247
QUINN: So, we good?
You gonna call Sharon?

1992
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:58,448
GERRY: Yes, I will call
and I will apologize

1993
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,640
and tell her I was wrong

1994
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,404
and next time I'll learn to keep
my big mouth shut.

1995
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,921
Well, you weren't wrong.
The guy is a flaping creep.

1996
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:06,810
But sometimes, even when you're right,
you gotta apologize.

1997
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,840
Ah, this is me.

1998
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,765
All right, look. Are you okay
to drive all the way back to the city?

1999
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,921
You didn't drink too much?

2000
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:14,046
I'm only going down the block.

2001
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:15,765
Gonna stay at Mom's tonight.
I'm not going back to the city.

2002
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,921
You wanna come with me?

2003
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:20,283
No, no, no. I'm going to go
meet this girl for a drink actually.

2004
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,488
Ooh! Gonna meet this girl
for a drink?

2005
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,564
Congratulations.
Little Yuletide booty call, is it?

2006
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,641
Oh, we'll see about that.
[laughs]

2007
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,244
Enjoy yourself.
Come on.

2008
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:29,605
- Bye, brother.
- All right.

2009
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,766
Good night, man.

2010
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:33,162
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

2011
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:34,445
Hey, Santa.

2012
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,122
Don't hurt yourself
going down the chimney.

2013
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:39,645
[Car door closes]

2014
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:43,640
[cellphone chiming]

2015
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,289
[chiming]

2016
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,720
Hello?

2017
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,087
Hey, Sharon, it's, uh, Gerry.

2018
01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:55,280
Hey.

2019
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:58,603
Yeah, look,
I just wanted to call...

2020
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,922
I-I-I know
you're upset with me and...

2021
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:04,207
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

2022
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:07,125
I shouldn't have said that stupid shooot
about your boyfriend.

2023
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:09,680
So, I was totally out of line.

2024
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,247
Yeah, well, with all the crazy shooot
that's going on with our family right now,

2025
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:14,605
that is small potatoes.

2026
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,881
No, no, no.
It's um, I, you know, I-I-I...

2027
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:19,042
I should learn to keep
my big mouth shut.

2028
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,645
I mean,
it's none of my business.

2029
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,324
All right.

2030
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,930

You wanna share some details,
Romeo?

Oh... Okay. Um...

I... I just...
just wanted everybody to know that

2085

if your father
survives this cancer,

2086
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,244
he will not be invited back
next year.

2087

What are you talking about?

2088
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,327
I talked to him this morning.

2089

He's--He's coming out
on the 11 :00 train

2090
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,360
and joining us for Mass,

2091
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,204
and if he behaves himself,

2092
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:48,805
he can stay for dinner.

2093
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,609
