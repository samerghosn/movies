1
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:39,488
Tuesday, After Christmas

2
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,291
- It's really off.
- What is?

3
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,511
Can't you see?

4
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:45,381
It's ugly.

5
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:49,261
Normally, one has a big one, a
smaller one and an even smaller one.

6
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,097
Beautiful.

7
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,306
Aesthetically pleasing.

8
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,980
Wherever did I find you, you aesthete?

9
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,019
Wherever did I find you,
with these mutant toes?!

10
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,156
You're clueless. This is a sign,
of virility in men.

11
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,408
So what is it in women?

12
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:10,196
Still a sign of virility.

13
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,040
So, see? I'm right.

14
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:16,284
As a woman, I'm better off without.

15
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:22,998
Your index toe is the mark of
an artistic temperament.

16
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,386
Of the creator type.

17
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,682
I don't know, in my book,
it's a sign I've got a big dick.

18
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,307
I've seen bigger.

19
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,436
Wherever did you see
such big ones?

20
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,020
Back home, on the beach,
in Constanta.

21
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,404
So did you see them, too?

22
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:43,989
"Yeah!"

23
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,361
What ever did you see?

24
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:49,157
- "Big dicks!"
- You chatterbox, you!

25
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,948
Yes, mutant.

26
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,201
Let me see...

27
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,207
Paula, quit your smoking, Paula!

28
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,166
Oh, right you are. C'mon,
let me have a smoke.

29
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,713
- Just one ciggie, babe!
- No...

30
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,932
Why are you upsetting me?

31
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,387
Can't you see what it does,
to your teeth?

32
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,887
Don't you call me in for a,
plaque removal. I'm not coming.

33
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,307
If you keep smoking like a mad man...

34
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,860
- Oh, no. I just had one. No.
- What do you mean you just had one?

35
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:26,776
Should be about 4 months now. Five.

36
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:30,526
- We'll do it next time you bring Mara.
- You've already taken her measurements.

37
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,904
Give me the braces, and we're through.

38
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,121
Don't change the topic.

39
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,332
Promise me you'll quit on Christmas.

40
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,129
As a present...

41
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:43,709
For your gal.

42
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,633
What's smoking got to do
with Christmas?

43
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:49,129
I told you I just can't do it.

44
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:51,632
Come on, love... How come I did it?

45
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,891
Well, I just can't.

46
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:59,096
I'll ask Santa to bring me
a man with more willpower.

47
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,061
Go ahead.

48
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,023
Hasn't anybody told you that
he doesn't exist?

49
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:08,531
I don't know. He came by my place
and left a present for you.

50
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,695
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:17,155
- It's 'cause I've been a good boy
- You haven't been all that good.

52
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:20,367
You've tricked Santa this year.

53
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,923
I didn't get anything for my mom.

54
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,423
- Never mind, there's still time.
- Not really.

55
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,968
Her birthday is
the day after tomorrow.

56
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,267
Damn, that's right.

57
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,849
Many happy returns.

58
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,442
Thanks.

59
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,978
So you're going and leaving me alone.

60
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:49,649
Maybe something from Channel, to coax
her out of that Laura Biagiotti of hers.

61
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,614
So you're going away
and leaving me alone, huh?

62
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:55,571
Yeah, I'm leaving.

63
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:58,830
I'm leaving 'cause I promised her, too.

64
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,248
Do you know how long it's been
since I was last home?

65
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,913
Weren't you there now, in October?

66
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,834
How long did I stay? Barely two days.

67
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,593
I came back quickly, 'cause you were
driving me crazy with your calls.

68
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,174
Well, missing you was killing me!

69
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,797
I know what was killing you...

70
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,102
"Missing you... "

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
You Celentano!

72
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,438
I've got an Italian version, too.

73
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,315
Oh, yeah? Let's hear it, then.

74
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,326
I'm not in the italian mood today. .

75
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,876
What are you getting Mara?

76
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,829
We were thinking of a snowboard.

77
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:47,877
For her to go down the slopes
with her old man.

78
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,462
Very nice.

79
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:57,595
Too bad you don't want me
to teach you.

80
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:01,224
Yeah Paul, I'll come with you
to Kaprun.

81
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,648
You tell Adriana that someone else
I will be joining you there.

82
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,349
Maybe you can put an extra bed
in your room.

83
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,361
Where do you think you're going?

84
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:18,820
We can go to the mountains whenever
you want to. But you just don't.

85
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:20,575
Yes, I do.

86
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,078
You do?

87
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:24,955
Yes.

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,248
All right, then.

89
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,175
No, please, don't.

90
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,928
Really.

91
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:45,021
Really now, open the windows, please...

92
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,520
Come on, seriously!
Leave me alone, don't be a cow!

93
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:52,935
No! Cut it out!

94
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,315
Cut it out, I can't take it anymore!

95
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,661
I told you to carpet this place.

96
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,672
Lift me up.

97
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,091
Rambo...

98
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,428
I nearly broke my tailbone...

99
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,683
I'm sitting up straight...

100
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:34,895
No, seriously...
I'll slap you!

101
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,731
I just wanted to give you this.
And I'm injured, too.

102
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:39,695
Oh, good grief, you...

103
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,578
You stupid cow.

104
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,706
See what you did there? Huh?

105
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,757
You latin lover...

106
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,422
Hooch, give me my cigarettes, please.

107
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:08,265
What're these?

108
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,856
Your cigarettes.

109
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,703
Paul...

110
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,288
Paul!

111
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:32,919
Come here for a second, please.

112
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,639
- It's great.
- Isn't it?

113
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:49,473
I'll go look for some shoes, too,
and that's it, Santa's come for me.

114
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:54,433
I like this... patterned one.

115
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:56,314
I want to get that one for my sis.

116
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:58,362
It won't fit her. You get it.

117
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:01,028
- You think?
- Definitely.

118
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,616
It's a bit stretchy and it'll give.

119
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,878
Well, we'll see...

120
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,505
See? That's why it's better for you
to get stuff for yourself.

121
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,710
I'll take it and we'll see.

122
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,721
- Check these out, see if they fit.
- What's up with these?

123
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,473
Your folks gave me some money
to get you new boots.

124
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:31,805
Come on, Adriana,
what's with this nonsense?

125
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:33,850
What do you want me to do Paul,
argue with them?

126
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:36,275
Try them on, it won't kill you.

127
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,479
Just be thankful they didn't buy
them themselves.

128
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:45,530
Here, hold this.

129
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:50,076
And please act surprised when
you get them.

130
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,209
- Oh, I'll act up all right!
- That's the spirit!

131
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,245
On the one hand we give them money,

132
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,083
and they give it to us to get boots.

133
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,163
Is this it?

134
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:03,552
No. He's looking for a smaller one.

135
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,344
This one's 130 and it's too long.

136
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,681
It's got pink, she'll like it.

137
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,601
Will we ever get out of this
pink phase?

138
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:16,141
- Do they fit?
- Perfect!

139
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:19,100
I can climb mountains now!

140
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,362
Here, this is the only small board
we've got.

141
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,198
And it's the last one.

142
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:27,446
No. We'll keep looking.

143
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:30,414
There's nowhere else to look.

144
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:34,165
It's the only place left with kid's boards.

145
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,160
We'll give it some more thought.

146
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,255
OK, you call me...

147
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:44,591
Then let's get her one from Austria.

148
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,509
- We'll find her another gift for now.
- What else?

149
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,597
I don't know, we'll look around.

150
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,428
Girlie, we're not going to look for
anything else.

151
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,305
Seriously, what else?

152
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,679
We said we'd get her a board,
let's get her a board!

153
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:57,898
She even wrote Santa about it.

154
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,519
- We can't just change our minds.
- I'm not going to put

155
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:02,813
a skeleton board
under the Christmas tree.

156
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,772
Yes...

157
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,113
I'm very impressed...
What did the guy tell you?

158
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,002
But I never told him there was
a fixed interest rate.

159
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,456
Man, does this guy think
we're all morons?!

160
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:20,917
He should thank the bank.

161
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,550
Show him the file.

162
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:28,254
Don't these people ever watch TV?

163
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:34,264
No, you're going to take the file
from Carmen and go over to him.

164
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,265
She will give it to you.

165
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,113
Well, what could I tell him
that you couldn't?

166
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,653
All right, forget it.

167
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,037
Tell him I'll stop by his place
and talk to him.

168
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:57,329
Yeah... thank you so much
for you help...

169
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:58,913
Come on, bye.

170
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:02,744
So?

171
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,875
We'll just have to get this pink one.

172
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:08,176
We'll drop it off at my parents'.

173
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:09,467
All right.

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,302
And if it's too tall,
it'll fit her next year.

175
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:15,637
It'll just be a bit tougher for her
to steer.

176
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,764
But she'll get used to it.

177
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,727
You like 'em?

178
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,228
I'm smitten.

179
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:43,171
- Where's mommy?
- She's on the phone

180
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,255
with... Salrom.

181
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,258
With "Salrrrom"?

182
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:52,379
File no. 7. 800.077

183
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,965
regarding Court ruling

184
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,558
no. 1.000. 200.077

185
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:00,932
- Careful, you'll break it like this.
- No, I won't!

186
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,477
- Yes, you will...
- No, I won't.

187
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:05,650
I told you we'd open a can of worms.

188
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,399
Meaning?

189
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:10,444
Will she take him out and feed him?

190
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:12,362
It's out of the question.

191
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:15,075
That's what I told her, too.

192
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,448
Santa won't bring her another pet.

193
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,662
She already has Coco
and she needs to take care of him.

194
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,792
So then why do you give me
the "meaning" routine?

195
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:28,593
Anyway, this Santa business won't
hold out for much longer.

196
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,800
- Mommins!
- Yes, honey!

197
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,218
We're out of liquid soap!

198
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,891
OK, honey. Use the regular one.

199
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,517
- Is there any left?
- Yes.

200
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:45,441
She doesn't believes that
Santa gets her letters.

201
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:47,894
Last year she wanted a talking parrot

202
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:49,732
and Coco just cackles.

203
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,314
Santa's not what he used to be...

204
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,825
What were you talking about?

205
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,031
I was just telling mom about a movie.

206
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,451
What kind of movie?

207
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:03,119
A movie for grown-ups.

208
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:04,956
OK then...

209
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,004
If you don't tell me,

210
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,665
I won't tell you other stuff either.

211
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:11,801
What other stuff?

212
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:13,715
Nothing...

213
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,218
- Do you have something to tell us?
- No.

214
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,427
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

215
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,888
Then start eating and shut up.

216
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:23,516
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

217
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:25,137
Let me see.

218
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:37,700
What's with the grass?

219
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:41,617
I'm not a giraffe,
I won't eat this thing.

220
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,369
No, you're a goat, not a giraffe...

221
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:44,948
Not even that...

222
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:50,956
See, I put in some spinach for you...
rocket salad...

223
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,419
Come on, eat. Please.

224
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,385
I'd rather have a cream cheese sandwich.

225
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,012
Make yourself a cheese sandwich,
there isn't any left anyway...

226
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,972
- Oh, give me a break...
- Make one with butter.

227
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,563
Cream cheese is better.

228
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:09,316
You want some cheese?

229
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,023
Yes.

230
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:25,039
I was thinking of buying
a Christmas present for Mara.

231
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:26,746
Why?

232
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,621
That's what I'd like to do.

233
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,834
I could give it to her at the clinic.
That way it won't cause any trouble.

234
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:36,385
- Well, no. What's the point
- Why?

235
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,717
It's not about the trouble. It just,
doesn't make any sense for now.

236
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,681
It's my pleasure.

237
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,475
There'll be plenty of opportunities.

238
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:47,684
Whatever...

239
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,601
- Do you think it's inappropriate?
- What is?

240
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:57,148
- This present thing.
- God forbid.

241
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:06,325
Because if you don't agree,
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

242
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,163
You get to have the last say.

243
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,247
Don't worry about it.

244
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,050
Then you give them to her.

245
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:25,222
I hope she likes them
and I hope they fit.

246
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,804
Wow, they're awesome!

247
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:31,564
I'll have you know I asked around,
I didn't just wing it.

248
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,611
Let me kiss you for her.

249
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,484
Thank you, Santa!

250
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:41,778
Don't forget to put them
under the Christmas tree.

251
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:44,821
They've got some pink, too...

252
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,077
Real cool.

253
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:54,923
Are you staying on for lunch?

254
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,090
No. I've got to split.

255
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,462
- Is it four o'clock already?
- Yes.

256
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,221
Hurry on home
to the wife and kids, then.

257
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:05,971
Am I interfering with your schedule?

258
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,263
Why wouldn't you, Paul?

259
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:11,231
- Single woman, beautiful...
- Who is it?

260
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,519
Don't you worry, there are always
a couple of guys warming up.

261
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,443
Well, introduce me to them, then.

262
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,323
Next time I get the chance.

263
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,861
By all means.

264
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:33,253
That's it, then...

265
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,929
- What's that?
- Santa's come to our place, too.

266
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:53,136
Why do you do stuff like this?

267
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,315
- What?
- You know I can't go.

268
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:58,479
Why? They're for the 23rd.

269
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,025
Yes, Paul. They're for the 23rd.

270
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,446
I'll be in Constanta on the 23rd.

271
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,907
Well, didn't you say you were going
to go there now, for her birthday?

272
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:08,287
So what am I going to do, Paul, mess
around on the road on Christmas Eve?

273
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:09,993
I can't.

274
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,795
This is the kind of thing I'd rather
we decided upon together.

275
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:17,165
Yeah, OK, make a big fuss 'cause l
got you a couple of concert tickets.

276
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,041
- I thought I'd surprise you.
- You'd better not start with this.

277
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:24,839
You don't want to, we won't go
and that's that. Big deal.

278
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:29,016
But it's a shame, though...

279
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:33,264
You're something else...

280
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:37,100
C'mon, scram!

281
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,272
I'll see you tomorrow.

282
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:41,445
Tomorrow's the last time
I see you this year.

283
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,691
Good thing I'll be rid of you.

284
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,699
Rid of me...

285
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:59,166
I forgot...

286
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,905
- So why did you two argue?
- Because she stole my cow pen.

287
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:36,073
- But are you sure she stole it?
- Yeah.

288
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:41,288
Because mine used to keep jamming and
then the next day she wrote with it.

289
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:44,425
And it kept jamming. Just like mine.

290
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:48,753
And she said it was brand new.

291
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,181
But I know she took it from me.

292
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,350
Come on, now, quit pouting.

293
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:56,178
I didn't like this Alexia anyway.

294
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,806
She's mean and she's a jerk.

295
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,931
Mind your language.

296
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:04,106
I even moved out of our desk.
Let her share a desk with Steffi.

297
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:07,065
- Are the two of them friends now?
- Yeah...

298
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,816
And they keep saying
gross stuff about me.

299
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:12,195
She's very mean and a big jerk, too...

300
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,531
I told you to mind your language.

301
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,160
So, with whom do you share your desk?

302
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:21,205
- With Bogdan Dema.
- With whom?

303
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,964
With Bogdan Dema.

304
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,502
Is that the one who...

305
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,336
Is that the one who was
at your birthday...

306
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:31,212
- ... and did the cake thing?
- No... He's this new kid.

307
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:33,640
- Oh, so it's a different kid?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:39,184
So what kind of gross things
are they saying about you?

309
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:44,568
That I cheat on the math tests,
and that I eat boogers, and stuff...

310
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:50,987
Yes, Mom.

311
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,566
What are you two doing?

312
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:56,032
We just left school and we're
on our way to get the x-ray.

313
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,906
You?

314
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:02,413
Well, the bailiffs are on strike,
so we've all gone home.

315
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:05,379
So they just went on strike,
without any sort of notice?

316
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,666
Yeah. At a quarter to two,
with a full courtroom.

317
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:10,209
You tell me...

318
00:21:11,514 --> 00:21:13,554
So what are you going to do now,
hit the gym?

319
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,639
No, I was thinking to join you
at the dentist's office,

320
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,220
and then we could all go
to your parents' place.

321
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:22,437
How are you doing there, sweetie?
Are you nervous, baby?

322
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,607
Are you coming with us, too, Mom?

323
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,061
I sure am.
To see how brave you are.

324
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,197
But I don't think she's going to get
her braces put in today.

325
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:31,780
That's what you told me.

326
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,985
No, I said I was going over
to the dentist's, but...

327
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:36,196
I don't know the exact procedure
for today.

328
00:21:37,457 --> 00:21:38,999
Yes... We'll see.

329
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:44,621
As you wish, but we can stop by
afterwards and pick you up from home.

330
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:48,045
No, it's all right, I'll join you.

331
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:50,134
Tell me the exact address.

332
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:55,096
I don't think there's any point...
It's behind Hala Traian.

333
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:59,686
It's this old, four-storied building.
Popa Soare 45.

334
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,015
OK, I got it.

335
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:08,110
Don't rush. We'll get there in
about an hour or so.

336
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:10,779
All right, then... See you there.

337
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:14,401
- Kisses, you two!
- Bye-bye.

338
00:22:14,952 --> 00:22:17,574
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye, baby...

339
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:33,340
Mommy!

340
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,174
- Hey! How's it going, princess?
- I brought in the x-rays!

341
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,679
- You're here already.
- Yeah. I got here five minutes ago.

342
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:39,465
Look at those nice pictures...

343
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:43,186
- Look how good I look here!
- Yeah... You're gorgeous.

344
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:44,888
Did you have a hard time
finding the place?

345
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:47,895
No, not at all. I know the area,
I sometimes drop by to see Jeni.

346
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:51,565
- So her office is around here.
- Right next to the restaurant.

347
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,987
Oh, look, baby, your hair looks
really great in this one.

348
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:59,737
Oh my God, what crocodile did
they take a picture of here?

349
00:22:59,956 --> 00:23:01,580
Oh, my, you gave me such a fright!

350
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,123
- How are you?
- I'm beat...

351
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:09,922
- Did you talk to them?
- Yeah, she's got someone inside.

352
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,207
So, tell me, baby...
Were you scared?

353
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:17,426
No. They put this thing on my
forehead, for a couple of times.

354
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:21,802
Then they put this other thing
on my nose, like a sort of laser...

355
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,764
and then they put a vest on me, see?

356
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:26,062
And it was too heavy,

357
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:29,358
So I sat down on a chair.

358
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,605
Then they put these plastic
spoons in my mouth...

359
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:37,780
Oh, Mr. Hanganu, the pleasure.

360
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:39,536
Did you bring the patient in?

361
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,246
Let me introduce you to my wife.

362
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:44,243
- Adriana Hanganu.
- Mircea Dumbraveanu, glad to meet you.

363
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,822
You know Mara.

364
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,954
- Sure I do. How's it going, Missy?
- Fine.

365
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:49,962
"Fine". Brief and to the point.

366
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:52,380
That's how she usually communicates.

367
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:56,251
- Mommy, let me show you something!
- Please excuse me.

368
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,639
I can't really tell who she looks like.

369
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:03,259
She's taken after both of us,
so that we don't get upset.

370
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,304
She's real cute...

371
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:08,477
- How you doin', man?
- Working, what else?

372
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:11,390
I'm staying on to help Raluca,
Marcela had to go earlier.

373
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,434
How's the house doing?

374
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:16,441
The house is the problem.

375
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:20,323
I mean, I've built it,
I've put up the roof...

376
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:23,027
But that's it.
The money pipe stopped running.

377
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,407
- You've exceeded your budget.
- Really bad.

378
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,914
So what can you do?
Just be patient...

379
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:30,453
I might pay you a visit after all.

380
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:32,671
Maybe you can help me scrape up
another line of credit.

381
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:35,124
- You got the first one from...
- From BRD.

382
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:37,677
- What, is there anything wrong?
- No, it's all right...

383
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:40,881
It'll be one year this January.

384
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:45,090
Then, I'll be expecting you.

385
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:48,100
Bring the paperwork for your loan.

386
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:51,436
I don't want to take out another loan
but I don't have a choice.

387
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:53,312
This house knocked me out...

388
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,230
Look who's here...

389
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,985
- How are you, pretty girl?
- Fine.

390
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,362
- Hello.
- Hello.

391
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:02,113
- How are you?
- With the patient...

392
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,576
Very nice. Come on in please.

393
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,831
I'll be there in a second.

394
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,495
- Did you bring the file, too?
- Yes.

395
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,707
Mara, where'd you put the file?

396
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:15,833
Oopsie! It's on the table.

397
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,470
Can I take that laser gun?

398
00:25:29,522 --> 00:25:31,100
A bit later.

399
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,852
You can ask Daddy to make you ride
the elevator a bit, if you want to.

400
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,272
Yeah! Please, Daddy, will you?

401
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,651
Just a bit. We don't want
to break anything...

402
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:46,075
Oh... This is so great!
I can even go to sleep.

403
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:54,128
We'll leave you here.

404
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,245
That's enough.

405
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,337
It's morning already!

406
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:04,006
I don't know if you're up to speed
with Mara's issues.

407
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:05,137
Sort of...

408
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:08,220
- Or how much Mr. Hanganu told you.
- He's told me some things.

409
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:09,764
As much as I could remember.

410
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:12,305
I'll run you through the whole thing
once again, then.

411
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:23,325
Mara's got a slight under-bite.

412
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,092
That's it... .

413
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:42,296
Come closer, please.

414
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:44,293
Close it.

415
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:47,718
This is particularly apparent
if you look at the molar teeth.

416
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,177
Those are the first
permanent molars...

417
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:53,764
... to emerge behind the baby teeth.

418
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,355
She hasn't gotten all
her permanent teeth yet.

419
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:58,976
We don't know how the other ones
will evolve...

420
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:02,031
but this is the mark of
a slight maxillary pressure

421
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,231
... the narrowing of the upper arch bone.

422
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:10,698
Her skeletal pattern is graded 3.
She has a slightly jutting mandible.

423
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:13,916
- But I'm in the fourth grade...
- Good for you.

424
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,247
Mara... let's see what the doctor
has to say, all right?

425
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:18,994
Bottom line...

426
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:21,458
Her superior arch bone is
insufficiently developed.

427
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,170
It needs to be stimulated...

428
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:26,423
... or her permanent teeth
will have no room.

429
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,637
I'm talking about her canines.
Please close it a bit, Mara.

430
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:33,553
Right now, her canine teeth
will emerge in vestibular position.

431
00:27:34,147 --> 00:27:36,056
- They just jut forward like this...
- Yes.

432
00:27:36,816 --> 00:27:38,773
These canine teeth are small...

433
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:42,235
She'll get a bigger set of canines,

434
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:45,490
- which will have no room to develop.
- But I won't get them now, am l?

435
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,322
No. When you get slightly older.

436
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:50,821
So, if we intervene now,

437
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,037
we can automatically solve the issues

438
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:55,865
with her entire upper arch...

439
00:27:56,085 --> 00:27:58,837
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

440
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,921
Can I have the colored sheet?

441
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:06,089
- What did you say?
- That paper with the colored bears.

442
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,805
The colored bears...

443
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,643
They should be around here...

444
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:16,553
I had another girl in here earlier.

445
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:22,396
Here you go.

446
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:27,312
I knew there was a pink one, too!

447
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:31,283
- Take your time looking.
- Dad, should I get a dark pink?

448
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:33,949
I say purple.

449
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:35,998
Nope... Pink!

450
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:40,753
- What are you looking for?
- The removable braces...

451
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:42,755
I'll go check in the other room.

452
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:48,720
- I found them.
- Should I fix you some molding?

453
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:51,630
Not right now. A bit later.

454
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm sorry.

455
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:05,529
Don't worry about it.

456
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,740
So, long story short, it's too early
for fixed braces.

457
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,650
We don't have all
our permanent teeth yet,

458
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:15,284
so we'll put her
a pair of removable braces.

459
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:17,158
This is a sample...

460
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:21,080
It's not a new piece, but an example
of what we're talking about.

461
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,202
- I hope it turns out to be efficient.
- I think it will.

462
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:27,628
Removable braces can stimulate
transversal development.

463
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,756
- It was supposed to be pink!
- Your braces are going to be pink.

464
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:34,766
I want a pink one...

465
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:39,384
We've got plenty of time,
I believe that it will prove efficient.

466
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:44,224
Later we might put in a spacer,
if we need...

467
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:46,235
What's a spacer?

468
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:49,363
- The spacer is the metallic butterfly.
- That really ugly one?

469
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:51,905
The ugly one, yes.
I showed you last time.

470
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:56,702
So how long does she have to wear it?

471
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,908
At least sixteen hours a day.

472
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,789
Wearing it at night alone
will not suffice.

473
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:06,499
Teeth have a natural tendency of
resuming their initial positioning.

474
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:09,707
I was actually asking for how long
will she need to wear it.

475
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:12,675
- No longer than one year.
- That long?

476
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:17,722
We could be looking at less time.
Her situation is not so complicated.

477
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:23,606
It seems a bit too long, seeing as
it's not really necessary.

478
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,518
I mean, it's not an emergency, is it?

479
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,729
Well... It's not mandatory
or compulsory but...

480
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,817
An under-bite can trigger
an abnormal development.

481
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,194
Her facial bones
might develop asymmetrically.

482
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,116
Obviously, it's your call.

483
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:45,578
I don't want to torture her
if there's no point to it.

484
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:48,085
- I'm telling you that there is a point.
- Mara.

485
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,750
- Do you want to get those braces?
- Yes.

486
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:52,511
- You do?
- Yes!

487
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,594
- Can you keep wearing 'em for a year?
- Yes.

488
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:58,931
- I don't want to hear any whining...
- Yes.

489
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:02,016
Mara! You'll wear it,
as long as you need to.

490
00:31:02,814 --> 00:31:05,221
Even if some kid said
God-knows what.

491
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:08,015
Yes, I'll wear it. I like it!

492
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,017
She likes it.

493
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,909
Anyway, from what the doctor's said,
she won't even feel it after a week.

494
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:21,953
She will feel something,
it's only normal.

495
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:26,208
But, as time goes by,
she'll get used.

496
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,792
But she will have to wear it
nearly all day long.

497
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:37,304
I say we should have it put in now.
We don't want things to complicate.

498
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,141
Let's have it put in.

499
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:43,389
- Whatever you say.
- You know best.

500
00:31:44,397 --> 00:31:46,686
Yes. Let's get to work then.

501
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:49,643
Who is our next patient?

502
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,436
Doctor, please take your seat...

503
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:55,941
I am a doctor, too!

504
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,947
We are going to get her dental
imprint for the braces now.

505
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:05,327
It will be ready in a couple of days.
Before Christmas.

506
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:11,127
One of you should bring Mara back in,

507
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,800
to teach you how to adjust it.

508
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:18,136
If I'm not here,
Mircea will show you what to do.

509
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:21,847
- We'll adjust it ourselves?
- It's simple. With a little key.

510
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:27,813
Well, I say we go out,
let the folks do their job.

511
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:30,852
Can we stay here and watch, too?

512
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,020
- Of course you can.
- Thanks.

513
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:39,776
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

514
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,529
Will I have a lisp?

515
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:44,657
Not right now. In a couple of days.

516
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:47,413
I'll test you with some spoons now.

517
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:50,457
I need to know if anything hurts,
or feels awkward, OK?

518
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:52,249
Are you going to talk like
Duffy Duck again?

519
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:55,632
A bit later.
All right now, open wide...

520
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,259
Is this all right?

521
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:01,428
Good girl. Open wide, now.

522
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:10,689
Why do you keep slamming it?

523
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,273
I've told you a thousand times.
Like this.

524
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,403
Look, nicely, like this.

525
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:22,196
Please remind Ica to give you
the marbles, all right?

526
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:24,701
- The yellow ones?
- The yellow ones tonight...

527
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:27,363
... and the blue ones in the morning.
Until Monday.

528
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,372
- Remind her, 'cause she forgets, OK?
- OK.

529
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:37,625
No drinking, no eating for half
an hour before and after the marbles.

530
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:40,005
All right. It's us!

531
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:44,089
- You won't forget, will you?
- No, but Ica doesn't give them to me

532
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:46,100
from the bottle cap,
but from her hand, not like you.

533
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:49,888
- Well, let's talk to her.
- I've told her before,

534
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:52,099
but she told me
that's the way to do it.

535
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,238
This was '91,
when I got into college.

536
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,742
I used to shave my head.

537
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,704
I don't believe it!

538
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:14,286
You were dating that guy,
the Timpuri Noi drummer, right?

539
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:17,335
- No, we were already going out.
- I broke up with Tobi a year before.

540
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:23,676
The punk! She used to change
her hair color every week.

541
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,516
Timpuri Noi is the band that plays
that "Father" song, right?

542
00:34:30,229 --> 00:34:33,100
Come on, you guys, quit making
fun of me because I'm young.

543
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:38,189
By the way, guys, did you know that
Enrique's dad is a singer, too?

544
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:41,071
I heard a guy at the mall yesterday
telling another guy:

545
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:44,409
"Did you know that Enrique's dad
is also a singer. "

546
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,157
- But did you know?
- What?

547
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:53,375
- That Enrique's dad...
- Enrique who?

548
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:57,042
What?

549
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:02,260
That's enough, you'll
scare my girl away.

550
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:10,144
- I think we'll take my car after all.
- Why?

551
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:16,640
I don't think my board and Narcisa's
skis will fit inside your car.

552
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,941
Oh, come on. We'll cram them
in the top trunk.

553
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:21,940
I don't know, we'll see.

554
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,948
Suit yourselves...

555
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:27,368
We could've both driven
and not stop till Salzburg.

556
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:33,080
I wanted to go to Turda for New Year'
have my folks meet Cristi.

557
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:38,000
So we'd rather leave straight
from there on the 3rd, luggage and all.

558
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:45,633
Cristi says it's a bit early
for introductions. But...

559
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:49,886
Oh, now! Let your folks see
what a dependable fellow he is.

560
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,345
Paulie, you'd better behave...

561
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,139
- Are you from Turda?
- Yes.

562
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:59,015
- You can come, too, if you want to.
- No...

563
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:03,363
- We've got the little girl...
- It's complicated...

564
00:36:04,073 --> 00:36:06,445
- The salmon pasta?
- For the young lady.

565
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:13,875
- Where's the toilet?
- Round the corner and up the stairs.

566
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,502
Hey, how are you?
I've called before.

567
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:30,221
I know. I'm really sorry,

568
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:32,551
but there was no way
I could've avoided it.

569
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,814
I know what you mean...

570
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:42,611
Oh, come on...

571
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:45,567
I'm well aware that it bothers you,
try as you might to...

572
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:51,367
Raluca, what are we talking about?
I'm not trying to excuse myself.

573
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,287
Because I have no reason
to excuse myself

574
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:56,534
I just wanted to tell you that
I felt like crap, too. That's it.

575
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,752
Because I was the one who...

576
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:04,210
Are you on your way right now?

577
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:07,298
Oh, I'm sorry.
Should I call you back later?

578
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:15,433
All right, then. As you wish.
We'll talk when you get back.

579
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,220
Bye...

580
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:57,845
You can turn it up,
I'm basically not sleeping.

581
00:38:11,284 --> 00:38:13,407
Humor me with a little massage?

582
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:16,032
Sure.

583
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:35,049
What are you doing tomorrow?

584
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:40,553
The Salrom case was postponed, 'cause
Mrs. Lupea wanted it that way.

585
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:42,933
Lupea who?

586
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:46,353
That judge I challenged this spring.

587
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:52,816
I might see Cosmina.

588
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,283
Give her a kiss from me.

589
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,039
Aren't you going to join us?

590
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:03,332
I'll be in Constanta tomorrow.

591
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:07,745
What do those people want this time?
On a Saturday.

592
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,508
They want more...

593
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:22,392
God bless you.

594
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:29,480
What about Mara's piano class?

595
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,069
Wasn't that tomorrow afternoon?

596
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,909
- The piano lesson's on Monday, Paul.
- Yeah, that's right.

597
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:47,585
We need to give Mrs. Hershcovici
her money for this month, too.

598
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,174
I'll give it to her on Monday.

599
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:02,428
So how much did we pay
for the braces after all?

600
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:06,273
2700, including the treatment.

601
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:10,854
Did you pay for it?

602
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:13,819
No. We'll pay when we get it.

603
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:19,279
Never mind,
it's better to have it put in now.

604
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:21,745
You were right.

605
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,660
Oh, this is so good...

606
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:59,779
How long do you think
she'll stay in the picture?

607
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:01,536
Who?

608
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:04,164
Narcisa...

609
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:07,579
I'm giving her a month or two.
Tops.

610
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,790
I don't know how but he's managed to
stay on good terms with all of them.

611
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:14,420
Not with the last one he didn't.

612
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:17,418
- They had a nasty fight.
- I didn't know that.

613
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,971
Well, these things happen.

614
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:31,857
- She's kind of pretty, little Narcisa.
- Yeah.

615
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:38,691
Done, you're handsome.

616
00:41:56,676 --> 00:41:58,253
How are you?

617
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:00,504
Well I haven't left yet.

618
00:42:00,847 --> 00:42:03,717
Cosmina called me to tell me to
reschedule for two o'clock.

619
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,297
You?

620
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,096
Well, I'm on the road.

621
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,645
I called earlier to ask if you want
something from the supermarket.

622
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:13,472
Oh, I don't know...

623
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:15,811
I could pick some stuff up
on my way back.

624
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:20,240
Well, I'll think about it
and text you a list.

625
00:42:20,658 --> 00:42:22,152
Will you be late?

626
00:42:22,577 --> 00:42:25,412
I don't know yet.
It's not that busy.

627
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,126
OK...

628
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:36,457
Guess what Christmas present
my sister is getting for her husband?

629
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:37,955
Tell me.

630
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:39,878
Hang on to your seat.

631
00:42:40,303 --> 00:42:41,927
I'm hanging on to the wheel.

632
00:42:42,722 --> 00:42:45,474
So check this out:
A 3.000 Euros telescope.

633
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:47,684
A Pentax.

634
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:51,056
Very nice.
Half a year's rent.

635
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,731
I think this is just...

636
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:58,235
3. 330 Euros I think.
She sent the money in Belgium

637
00:42:58,446 --> 00:43:00,439
to my cousin.
He'll buy it there.

638
00:43:00,698 --> 00:43:02,905
What can you do about that...
gives you a mind-freeze.

639
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,115
I didn't even tell her anything
about it, believe me.

640
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:10,073
She won't listen anyway.

641
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:15,211
He's going to spy on the women
in the neighborhood.

642
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:17,541
You bet.

643
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,592
I don't know what she thinks she'll
accomplish with these presents?

644
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:22,962
To each his own...

645
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:27,257
You know he's just going to buy her
another CD Box-Set.

646
00:43:28,935 --> 00:43:30,263
What?

647
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,932
I said he's going to buy her
another set of music CDs.

648
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:38,394
Yeah.
"Best of Italian Music".

649
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:42,272
I can barely hear you?
Where are you?

650
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:46,987
It's this shitty car-kit.
I'm outside Lehliu.

651
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:49,409
OK.

652
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:53,453
All right, bye.

653
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:56,538
- C'mon, work well. Kiss.
- Kiss, bye-bye.

654
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:49,264
Good afternoon, ma'am.

655
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,342
Hello.

656
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,852
Raluca!

657
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:00,647
Come on in. I think she's in the
bathroom, taking a shower.

658
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,146
I'm sorry to bother you. I called from
downstairs, but she didn't answer.

659
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:14,531
Ralu, Mr. Hanganu is here.

660
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:20,542
Come into the living room, please.

661
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:31,970
- Does Ralu know you are coming?
- What was that?

662
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,592
Raluca...
Does she know you're here?

663
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:37,855
No, I wanted to surprise her.

664
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:04,505
A slice of cake.

665
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:06,330
Thank you.

666
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:10,088
- Happy belated birthday.
- Thank you.

667
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:15,638
You've changed things around here.

668
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,019
Yes.

669
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:55,551
It's very good.

670
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:01,434
So...
What's going on in the capital?

671
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,309
It's crazy.

672
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:06,686
It's better not to leave the house this,
time of year.

673
00:47:07,653 --> 00:47:08,982
If you can...

674
00:47:09,197 --> 00:47:10,905
But can you?

675
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:15,160
I wanted to come to Bucharest too.

676
00:47:15,536 --> 00:47:18,407
Ralu insisted to come home instead.

677
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:20,279
That's right.

678
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:23,156
She really wanted to be here for
your birthday.

679
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,495
I was talking about the holidays
just now.

680
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:29,752
True.

681
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:39,348
How's your little girl?
I heard she's a sweetheart.

682
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,855
She is.

683
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:49,693
What can you do?
We all work for our kids.

684
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:57,482
You should know that I care
a lot about Raluca.

685
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:06,536
We see these things differently.
If you don't mind me saying so.

686
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:09,121
I don't mind. I just wanted
to tell you this.

687
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:16,342
Excuse me,
I have something on the stove.

688
00:49:00,683 --> 00:49:03,684
- What is it with you here?
- I came to see you.

689
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,348
Why?

690
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:07,723
I wanted to see you.

691
00:49:08,357 --> 00:49:11,275
We said we'd see each other on
Tuesday. Has anything happened?

692
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,027
No, I just wanted to surprise you.

693
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,317
I'm sorry you're not happy about it.

694
00:49:18,618 --> 00:49:20,409
Of course I'm happy about it.

695
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,580
Are you?

696
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,291
I'm happy.

697
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:32,622
- Did you cut your hair?
- I had it fixed up a bit.

698
00:49:34,342 --> 00:49:36,714
I liked it when it was
a bit longer, too.

699
00:49:38,304 --> 00:49:40,012
You'll get used to it.

700
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:43,386
You're always getting nasty,
about new things.

701
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,646
I called you to tell you
Mr. Hanganu was here.

702
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,393
Still going out?

703
00:49:53,945 --> 00:49:56,649
I think so. I don't know
right now.

704
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:06,824
Let's go to my room.

705
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:15,705
I open them, she closes them.

706
00:50:30,857 --> 00:50:33,478
Leave Dori alone.
What have, you got against him?

707
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:43,149
- How long will you stay?
- I you want me to go, tell me.

708
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:46,748
I'm asking because
I'd like us to talk.

709
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:49,780
OK, let's talk.

710
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:52,914
That's why I told you on the phone
that I was coming back to Bucharest.

711
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:57,041
Well what was I supposed to do?
I couldn't stand being without you.

712
00:50:57,717 --> 00:51:00,290
I've seen you,
now I can be on my way.

713
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:04,719
Where are you really right now?

714
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:06,808
What do you mean?

715
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,433
Where did you tell
the family you were?

716
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:13,686
I'm in Constanta.

717
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:17,892
Don't worry she hasn't figured it out.

718
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:20,943
And you think that's reassuring?

719
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,114
If you stay here overnight,
she's going to figure it out.

720
00:51:42,595 --> 00:51:45,216
- Where did you find it?
- That's for me to know.

721
00:51:54,357 --> 00:51:56,764
It's just like that one.

722
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:26,299
- She'd fed you cake.
- Yes.

723
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:35,849
I have been tossing and turning.

724
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:38,733
Me, too.

725
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:40,897
On a slow fire.

726
00:52:41,362 --> 00:52:43,983
And I heard that upset voice
of yours over the phone, too.

727
00:52:44,532 --> 00:52:46,940
Then you got me the watch,
to appease me.

728
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:52,077
Not true. I've got it a while back.

729
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,041
You got it...

730
00:52:55,418 --> 00:52:57,410
Because you knew
the time would come.

731
00:52:57,712 --> 00:53:00,285
- Such far sighted man.
- Not really.

732
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:02,713
For example, I forgot
about your mother.

733
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,126
- Good thing you didn't get her flowers.
- You think?

734
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,713
Maybe that wouldve softened
her up to me.

735
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,841
- She gave you a hard time?
- Yep.

736
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,302
What can you do?
She's awfully fond of you.

737
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,893
You do realize they had
big plans for me.

738
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:22,891
How about yourself?

739
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:26,156
What about me?

740
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:28,483
What plans do you have for yourself?

741
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:36,162
Paul, I love you and I care about you
very much. Those are my plans.

742
00:53:38,169 --> 00:53:40,375
Approved.

743
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:47,421
Of course I was taken a back by that
close encounter of the third kind.

744
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:50,464
It kind of hurt me.

745
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:56,891
Yesterday,
I was determined to end it.

746
00:53:57,105 --> 00:53:58,812
But you didn't.

747
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:04,400
I cried all night long like an idiot,
and I kept thinking about what to do.

748
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,242
Paula, Paula...

749
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:16,283
You've turned me into a weakling.

750
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:20,127
Me too...

751
00:54:20,586 --> 00:54:22,579
I haven't been getting any
peace of mind either.

752
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,046
And now you feel better?

753
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:29,052
That's good...

754
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:36,472
I don't want to go through this
it ever again.

755
00:54:38,771 --> 00:54:41,060
I know you don't want either...

756
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:44,062
But believe me, I don't handle
this things well.

757
00:54:48,531 --> 00:54:51,864
I'm your lover, your Constanta client
I'm whatever you want me to be.

758
00:54:52,535 --> 00:54:54,860
I try not to think about the other
woman in you life...

759
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:57,790
... but it's hard for me when I see her.

760
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,460
Yeah, I know.

761
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:06,289
I love you very much, believe me.

762
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:10,592
I don't want to hurt you.
That's the last thing I want.

763
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:35,945
It would've been so great
if wed met ten years ago.

764
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:39,746
You were underage back then.

765
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:45,871
Eight years ago, then.

766
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:01,475
- Does it have ringtones?
- I don't think so.

767
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:06,060
Is the time set?

768
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:08,400
Yeah, I put in the batteries.

769
00:56:17,078 --> 00:56:19,830
Mita is coming by to take me
out to eat at "On Plonge"...

770
00:56:20,498 --> 00:56:22,704
Call her and tell her you'll be late.

771
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:24,495
Can't.

772
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,541
- You come with us, too.
- I can't.

773
00:56:31,175 --> 00:56:33,501
Have you made up your mind?
When are you coming back?

774
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,042
On Tuesday.

775
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:44,311
Thirty-six times.

776
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:47,434
- Ask Paul if you don't believe me.
- What?

777
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,651
How many times has Madalina
seen "The Hours"?

778
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,899
- Come again?
- I'm talking about Madi and that movie.

779
00:56:54,574 --> 00:56:57,444
Oh. A whole lot of times.
What's up Cosmina?

780
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:01,028
Just getting ready to head home.

781
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:04,198
What are you doing, Paul?
Working on Christmas Eve, too?

782
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,493
Aren't does banks going to close
down already?

783
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,287
They forgot to ask
for your permission.

784
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:14,547
If youd come home earlier,
we'd have eaten together.

785
00:57:14,886 --> 00:57:16,428
I ate at Mc Donald's.

786
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,924
Cosmina got a really pretty
cap for Mara.

787
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:25,926
Thanks.

788
00:57:26,939 --> 00:57:29,691
Board, gloves, cap...

789
00:57:30,943 --> 00:57:33,648
- ... full gear.
- It's no big deal.

790
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:36,864
I just liked it 'cause it
had a tassel and strings.

791
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:40,118
Wouldn't you rather show it to me
than describe it?

792
00:57:40,453 --> 00:57:42,611
It's on the couch.
I'll bring it to you.

793
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:46,030
I heard you bought Liviu
a spy glass.

794
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,294
It's a telescope, love. He's been
wanting it for a whole year.

795
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:52,085
Oh, it's gift wrapped.
Never mind don't open it.

796
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:56,042
So that's the trick? If one craves
for something for a year,

797
00:57:56,302 --> 00:57:57,880
the wife gets it.

798
00:57:58,262 --> 00:57:59,673
Oh, it's not like that, really.

799
00:57:59,972 --> 00:58:02,926
If you don't speak your mind
you don't get anything.

800
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:05,218
For instance, I didn't
buy you anything.

801
00:58:06,729 --> 00:58:10,015
From our side, we got you
a blouse, two sizes smaller.

802
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:13,104
You said you wanted
to shave some kilos off.

803
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,683
You're such a sweetheart.

804
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:18,356
Maybe we could all get together after
Christmas and swap presents then.

805
00:58:20,493 --> 00:58:22,782
- Where are you spending it?
- At Liviu's folks'.

806
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:25,742
Did you fix things so that they'd send
the telescope to Breaza?

807
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:28,616
How are you shipping it in, by DHL,
By UPS?

808
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,788
Oh, you so get on my nerves.

809
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:35,549
- He's just acting all tough.
- Oh. We're well acquainted.

810
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,507
Well what shall I wish you?
Merry Christmas...

811
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,886
And maybe we'll get to see
more of each other next year.

812
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:43,426
- Sure!
- Great!

813
00:58:44,517 --> 00:58:46,510
Come on, let me kiss you, too.

814
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:50,602
Give the astronomer a kiss, too.

815
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,102
Let's all have a better year...

816
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,438
Let's both be happier.
And more loved...

817
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,112
That's right.
Thanks for the treat...

818
00:59:02,452 --> 00:59:04,361
... as your mother likes to say.

819
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:06,287
- Bye.
- Kiss-kiss.

820
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:14,502
Didn't I tell you I was
keeping the blouse for myself?

821
00:59:14,797 --> 00:59:16,126
No.

822
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:19,336
Now I'm going to have to look for a
bigger one.

823
00:59:20,636 --> 00:59:22,594
I'm punishing you.
You're going with me.

824
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:30,219
- What, are you crabby?
- No, I'm just tired.

825
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:32,596
Well you can relax now.

826
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:48,575
Dad!

827
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,082
Dad!

828
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:31,622
Mom said we should
get a smaller one,

829
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,790
since we end up throwing
it away anyway.

830
01:00:34,085 --> 01:00:36,540
I said, listen, Ica, we're not
getting it for ourselves,

831
01:00:36,754 --> 01:00:39,126
it's for the little one.
She will enjoy it.

832
01:00:39,507 --> 01:00:42,176
Never mind, we know who we're
dealing with here.

833
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:45,469
Same thing about the presents, too.

834
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:47,222
I thought I made myself
crystal clear.

835
01:00:47,515 --> 01:00:49,389
We're already decided that Sant
was bringing her only a snowboard.

836
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:51,054
It was more than enough.

837
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:54,803
- Yeah, so?
- So what's with the synthesizer?

838
01:00:56,941 --> 01:00:59,859
It's a Casio, it's very good.
She can use it to practice at home.

839
01:01:00,653 --> 01:01:02,195
Yeah, you buy her all sorts of junk

840
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,314
and then wonder why she's
got an attitude.

841
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:07,235
It was my pleasure...

842
01:01:07,785 --> 01:01:09,410
In that case,
please excuse me, Dad.

843
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:14,030
- So, is this one Dutch?
- It's from Denmark.

844
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,833
Watch out,
you're whistling again...

845
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:23,461
You're imagining things.

846
01:01:24,886 --> 01:01:27,258
Look, mother asked me
to ask you...

847
01:01:27,513 --> 01:01:29,636
We were thinking to get Adriana...

848
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:32,966
... a purse, for Christmas.

849
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,431
That would be swell.

850
01:01:35,646 --> 01:01:39,015
Stop pulling those faces!
What were we supposed to get her?

851
01:01:39,525 --> 01:01:40,806
A pair of boots...

852
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:42,522
You're being an ass.

853
01:01:44,572 --> 01:01:47,573
- How much will that be?
- The gentleman already paid for it.

854
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,866
- Happy holidays!
- Merry Christmas.

855
01:01:54,332 --> 01:01:57,867
- Leave it to me.
- I can help you, still...

856
01:01:59,128 --> 01:02:00,872
No, nothing's come up so far.

857
01:02:03,174 --> 01:02:04,668
Nothing I know of, at least.

858
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:08,750
On the third.

859
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,226
At your place?

860
01:02:15,394 --> 01:02:17,850
Hold on, let me ask Paul.

861
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:21,102
Cosmina's asking if were spending
New Year's with them.

862
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:26,439
He says we don't know yet.

863
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:32,697
Sure...

864
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,120
I'll let you know tomorrow.

865
01:02:39,377 --> 01:02:41,120
I'd like that, too.

866
01:02:44,215 --> 01:02:46,338
What you've given it to him already?

867
01:02:47,385 --> 01:02:49,259
So, was he delighted?

868
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:52,219
Maybe he'll discover a new galaxy.

869
01:02:52,598 --> 01:02:56,098
Get a load of Paul, he says maybe
he's going to discover a new galaxy.

870
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:58,634
Yeah...

871
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,105
A black hole rather,
you never know.

872
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:04,731
OK, kiss-kiss, bye.

873
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:10,608
Why do you do stuff like this?

874
01:03:11,909 --> 01:03:13,368
I'm really not up for it.

875
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:17,243
So you'd rather spend it
with Cristi and Narcisa?

876
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:19,035
No.

877
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:22,159
Then we'll stay at home with Mara.

878
01:03:22,962 --> 01:03:25,038
Great. Whatever you want.

879
01:03:28,092 --> 01:03:30,085
What's up with you, love?

880
01:03:30,595 --> 01:03:31,923
Nothing.

881
01:03:34,056 --> 01:03:38,054
You're lying to me, I know it.
Look how tense you are.

882
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:40,685
It's as if youve swallowed
a coat hanger.

883
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:24,848
I'm very much in love.

884
01:04:29,904 --> 01:04:32,027
I've met someone.

885
01:04:32,865 --> 01:04:34,573
I'm very sorry...

886
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,204
- Oh, so that was it?
- Yes.

887
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:47,785
I'm very sorry, I wanted to tell you
a long time ago, but I couldn't.

888
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:51,798
So why are you telling me this now?

889
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:55,137
I kept hoping I'd get over it.
I didn't think it was serious, but...

890
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,222
I didn't get over it.

891
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:40,471
So, the time for this has come, too.

892
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,807
It could've never come.

893
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:45,388
Cut the crap, will you?

894
01:05:46,272 --> 01:05:48,941
It couldn't not have come
'cause, it has...

895
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:50,935
Not even I know how.

896
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:04,569
Yes...

897
01:06:06,876 --> 01:06:08,703
The whole situation changes.

898
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,343
This woman,
she's younger, isn't she?

899
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,714
No, she's 26 years old. 27...

900
01:06:23,142 --> 01:06:26,013
So, you eventually found
yourself a younger one.

901
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,475
Really ugly stuff.

902
01:06:35,822 --> 01:06:37,565
You're a huge disappointment to me.

903
01:06:40,827 --> 01:06:42,950
You're my biggest
disappointment ever...

904
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:03,670
Yes...

905
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,804
I already got them.

906
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:14,811
On Sunday, yes.

907
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:19,485
Sunday around noon, for lunch.

908
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:23,699
OK then...

909
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,034
So this is it, then...

910
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:16,172
"You mind the home, you idiot",

911
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,373
"while I go out gallivanting
around town".

912
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:20,502
It's not like that.

913
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:24,256
I don't know what
you were imagining.

914
01:08:24,639 --> 01:08:27,130
That I'd make friends with her
or that I'd turn a blind eye?

915
01:08:27,725 --> 01:08:29,552
I wasn't imagining anything.
How could l?

916
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,394
That's why I told you.

917
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:33,223
But you did want it.

918
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,432
There's no way I could've wanted
anything like this.

919
01:08:35,775 --> 01:08:38,895
So you didnt want it.
You only wanted her.

920
01:08:39,612 --> 01:08:42,068
Adriana, I'm aware there
can be no other way.

921
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,069
Why not?

922
01:08:45,326 --> 01:08:48,576
There are women witch don't make a
big fuss if the husband is cheating.

923
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:51,498
Is that what you were imagining?

924
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:54,157
I wasn't imagining anything,
that's why I confessed.

925
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:56,168
It seems fair to me like this.

926
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:59,960
So what, now you're expecting me
to congratulate you for being fair?

927
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:04,760
Good job, Paul, thank you for
telling me and for ruining my life.

928
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:07,055
Adriana, please...

929
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,715
You've ruined my life.
What, did I say something wrong?

930
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:13,386
What are you pleading
with me for, now?

931
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:18,514
I'm asking you to understand
that I'm shattered, too.

932
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:20,686
I'm torn to pieces right now.

933
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:23,024
Really?

934
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:25,857
Why are you so torn?

935
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:29,193
Because I dont want to hurt you.

936
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:32,452
And because I am very well aware
of what I am losing.

937
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,785
Amazing!

938
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:38,292
You're still the one
playing the victim.

939
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:40,542
No, I'm not.

940
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:42,625
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

941
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:45,299
Why are you putting on
the sad show here with me?

942
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:49,428
You're awfully lame, you know.

943
01:09:49,974 --> 01:09:51,634
OK, I'm lame.

944
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:57,897
I told you I was sorry.

945
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,847
Do you want me to poke one of
my eyes out so you believe me?

946
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:03,684
What can I do now?
I can't pretend it never happened.

947
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:13,114
Let me see you telling Mara...

948
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:15,869
... that her father and her mother
are not together anymore.

949
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:18,203
We'll tell her together.

950
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:21,585
We're not doing anything
together anymore, Paul.

951
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:25,967
The instant you're with another
woman, you're no longer here.

952
01:10:26,594 --> 01:10:28,337
We don't do stuff together.

953
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:32,805
'Cause we didn't sleep with
another woman together.

954
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:37,099
Or, what,
you didn't sleep with her?

955
01:10:39,023 --> 01:10:41,229
OK, then. I'll tell her myself.

956
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:45,361
That her father no longer...

957
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:55,031
That daddy loves another woman
and that he can't live without her.

958
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,820
Right?

959
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,325
Please understand. It just happened.

960
01:11:00,044 --> 01:11:01,586
It's not something I wanted.

961
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:03,463
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

962
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:07,373
It's never happened to me!
I don't flap married men.

963
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,378
I feel like bashing my head
against this heater,

964
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:11,926
for wasting my life with you.

965
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,303
- You never loved me.
- I did love you.

966
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:18,307
I know it sounds shitty,
but it's true.

967
01:11:18,938 --> 01:11:20,729
It sounds really shitty, Paul.

968
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:25,023
If you loved me, you wouldn't
have broken our home.

969
01:11:25,236 --> 01:11:27,478
You have a child, a family
and you two just shooot on them!

970
01:11:27,697 --> 01:11:29,239
You and that woman!

971
01:11:31,117 --> 01:11:33,655
And now you're acting all
super-wise and shooot with me...

972
01:11:34,871 --> 01:11:37,658
Please, do calm down. You're only
making it worse for yourself.

973
01:11:38,082 --> 01:11:40,289
Worse how, Paul?

974
01:11:41,252 --> 01:11:44,835
- What could be worse than this?
- You're making it worse.

975
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,149
You flaping jerk!

976
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:54,527
Tell me, how long have you been
taking me for an idiot?

977
01:12:56,035 --> 01:12:58,989
I just want you to tell for how long
have you been cheating on me?

978
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:03,704
- A few months.
- I see. How many months?

979
01:13:04,502 --> 01:13:05,782
Nearly five.

980
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:09,337
- Since when, precisely?
- Since five months ago.

981
01:13:10,258 --> 01:13:11,752
Since August.

982
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:14,129
Since July!

983
01:13:16,722 --> 01:13:18,466
What were we doing in July?

984
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:23,645
Who is she?

985
01:13:25,398 --> 01:13:26,773
It's Raluca.

986
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,859
Raluca who?

987
01:13:30,278 --> 01:13:31,855
The dentist.

988
01:13:33,739 --> 01:13:36,361
Is she the one with braces,
the one we took Mara to?

989
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:41,121
You took the child to have her
work on her mouth.

990
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,663
So what did you tell her?
Did you introduce them?

991
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:46,791
"Mara, here's your next mommy. "

992
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:50,290
Cut it out!
I didn't tell Mara anything.

993
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:53,460
You're a liar and a sleaze and you
had her work on the child's mouth,

994
01:13:53,676 --> 01:13:56,214
with the same hands with which
she gives you hand-jobs.

995
01:13:57,013 --> 01:13:58,970
That's who you are!

996
01:13:59,182 --> 01:14:01,637
What you're saying right now
is sleazier and uglier than that.

997
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:10,352
Raluca...

998
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:15,853
How she stood there,
telling me about those braces...

999
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:18,902
Amazing...

1000
01:14:21,078 --> 01:14:23,237
And I just stood there
like an idiot, listening to her.

1001
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:28,331
With the child on the dentist chair.

1002
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:35,919
How does this girl know
what's best for my child?

1003
01:14:36,803 --> 01:14:38,213
What do you mean?

1004
01:14:39,472 --> 01:14:41,761
You two aren't going
to make her wear any braces.

1005
01:14:41,974 --> 01:14:44,014
What do you mean?
That's her job.

1006
01:14:44,227 --> 01:14:46,303
Mara has a problem and
it needs to be taken care of.

1007
01:14:46,521 --> 01:14:49,059
So where did she get the money
to start that clinic of hers?

1008
01:14:49,273 --> 01:14:50,649
Oh, give me a break with that crap!

1009
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:52,566
I am not cutting anything out, Paul!

1010
01:14:52,777 --> 01:14:55,066
I have the right to know, don't l?

1011
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:57,023
I have the right to know
who you're flaping!

1012
01:14:57,281 --> 01:15:00,531
Well, then, ask me and I'll answer.
What do you want to know?

1013
01:15:03,496 --> 01:15:05,074
Give her a call, Paul.

1014
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:07,915
Call her and tell her I found out.

1015
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:10,208
She doesn't have to play
the fool anymore.

1016
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:12,415
Call her!

1017
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:15,459
Why aren't you calling her?

1018
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:17,585
Call her, tell her I know.

1019
01:15:18,219 --> 01:15:20,888
- Where's that phone?
- Come on, cut it out...

1020
01:15:21,514 --> 01:15:22,973
What's her name?

1021
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:24,713
Raluca.

1022
01:15:25,351 --> 01:15:26,726
Ralu-caca.

1023
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:29,552
Where's the R key
on this shitty phone?

1024
01:15:30,022 --> 01:15:32,430
- flap you and your Raluca.
- Give me the damn phone!

1025
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:34,519
Call her, Paul.

1026
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:37,104
Call her to tell her I found out.

1027
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:40,237
- I will.
- That's right, great!

1028
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:46,533
Or did you lie to her, too?
Does she know that you're married?

1029
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:51,161
You know I didn't lie to her.
She knows that I'm married.

1030
01:15:51,794 --> 01:15:53,787
So she's talked you into
leaving your family.

1031
01:15:54,213 --> 01:15:56,965
On the contrary.
She's never even alluded to it.

1032
01:15:59,385 --> 01:16:01,674
You have such nice things
to say about her.

1033
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:04,048
See, I'm all teary-eyed.

1034
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:07,382
I'm just trying to tell you that l
was the one who took this decision.

1035
01:16:07,602 --> 01:16:10,009
She didn't pressure me in any way.

1036
01:16:10,521 --> 01:16:12,015
Please understand that.

1037
01:16:14,525 --> 01:16:15,854
Call her.

1038
01:16:18,863 --> 01:16:20,322
Call her!

1039
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:53,396
Hi...

1040
01:16:54,482 --> 01:16:57,566
Look, I just called to
let you know I told Adriana.

1041
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:02,273
You flaping retarded shooot-hole!

1042
01:17:05,993 --> 01:17:07,618
You goddamn jerk!

1043
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:20,549
You... Let me go!

1044
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,555
Let me go...

1045
01:17:38,651 --> 01:17:40,110
Let me go...

1046
01:18:16,314 --> 01:18:18,805
I want you to leave.

1047
01:18:21,444 --> 01:18:23,187
Go wherever you best see fit.

1048
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,693
That's just what I need to do.

1049
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,813
May I please have my keys?

1050
01:20:47,006 --> 01:20:49,924
Don't think you're taking my child
away from me, Paul.

1051
01:20:59,268 --> 01:21:01,759
I'll make sure you never
see the child again.

1052
01:21:03,898 --> 01:21:06,436
Have that girl make you one herself.

1053
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:09,768
I don't know if thats what I want.

1054
01:24:44,494 --> 01:24:45,952
Hey, how are you?

1055
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:48,203
I just got here.

1056
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,283
No, it doesn't seem cold.

1057
01:24:57,089 --> 01:25:00,423
She wasn't there but she does know
I've started to move my stuff out.

1058
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:05,050
OK.

1059
01:25:09,769 --> 01:25:12,438
Did you already promise you'd go?

1060
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:15,393
I see.

1061
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:20,443
No, 'cause I need to go see her,
and Mara, and my folks, too.

1062
01:25:22,657 --> 01:25:25,408
Can I throw away the coffee
in that polka-dot tin?

1063
01:25:27,328 --> 01:25:30,199
What do you mean you don't own one
if I'm holding it right now.

1064
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,661
White, with some colored dots...

1065
01:25:39,298 --> 01:25:41,754
I thought it was just
some stale coffee.

1066
01:25:42,635 --> 01:25:44,675
Never mind, I'll put it
somewhere else.

1067
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:49,682
I have to get the door for Cristi.

1068
01:25:50,935 --> 01:25:52,726
He's helping me assemble the locker.

1069
01:25:53,646 --> 01:25:55,354
Yeah, I bought it.

1070
01:25:58,442 --> 01:26:00,234
What was that?

1071
01:26:00,903 --> 01:26:04,106
Same as the other one.
Maybe in a slightly lighter shade.

1072
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:08,742
Shall I put them up on the shelves?

1073
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:13,540
Hold on a second.

1074
01:26:25,678 --> 01:26:26,958
So...

1075
01:26:28,222 --> 01:26:29,800
Raluca says hello.

1076
01:26:30,266 --> 01:26:33,302
Hello... Ask her why
she doesn't have a Christmas tree.

1077
01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:35,013
You heard that?

1078
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:37,886
She says you can buy one for her.

1079
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:45,106
Listen, there's no point in me
clearing up room for clothes.

1080
01:26:45,323 --> 01:26:47,648
I think the best way is to let you
arrange things when you get back.

1081
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:50,577
All right.

1082
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:53,914
Well, I don't know.

1083
01:26:54,707 --> 01:26:56,913
If you head out here before lunch,
you'll catch me.

1084
01:26:57,126 --> 01:26:59,997
I have to be at my folks' around six.

1085
01:27:02,089 --> 01:27:03,584
The day after tomorrow?

1086
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,050
I thought it was going
to be tomorrow.

1087
01:27:09,263 --> 01:27:12,513
No, there's no problem.
You come back whenever you can.

1088
01:27:16,854 --> 01:27:18,432
We'll talk around ten.

1089
01:27:20,566 --> 01:27:22,974
After your mom goes to sleep, yeah.

1090
01:27:24,529 --> 01:27:26,189
Come on. Bye. Bye.

1091
01:27:27,907 --> 01:27:29,567
Throw a beer my way, man.

1092
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,792
"12:08 East Of Bucharest"

1093
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:50,169
She got this one
at Carturesti Store.

1094
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,756
- Could be.
- For sure.

1095
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:01,183
Cheers.

1096
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,279
It's done up pretty nicely,
but it's kind of small.

1097
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:20,625
Well, now...

1098
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:23,458
With the both of you living here...

1099
01:28:24,672 --> 01:28:26,795
- Yeah.
- Well, yeah.

1100
01:28:33,806 --> 01:28:36,926
As they say, the New Year
brought a change in your life.

1101
01:28:37,852 --> 01:28:39,679
Are we going to start putting
that locker together?

1102
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:43,266
Let's finish our beers first,
relax a little.

1103
01:29:07,173 --> 01:29:09,925
- Adriana is not with you?
- I thought she'd be here by now.

1104
01:29:10,218 --> 01:29:12,673
When I talked to her
she was around Mosilor Street.

1105
01:29:13,095 --> 01:29:16,049
- Nucu! Let's set the table.
- Of course we will.

1106
01:29:16,265 --> 01:29:18,139
Come on, Mara, help me out, too.

1107
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:24,096
- How are you, Dad?
- Fine, honey.

1108
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:26,224
Are you setting the table?

1109
01:29:27,276 --> 01:29:29,020
She's helping me out.

1110
01:29:29,237 --> 01:29:30,779
How are you?

1111
01:29:30,988 --> 01:29:32,364
- All by yourself?
- Adriana's going to be here soon.

1112
01:29:32,573 --> 01:29:35,360
- Daddy do you want to see what I got?
- Show me!

1113
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:38,534
I hope she hasn't found the presents.

1114
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:41,784
Olguta came by yesterday
and she didn't come empty-handed.

1115
01:29:50,383 --> 01:29:52,174
Look what I got!

1116
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:57,970
Wow, that's so neat.

1117
01:29:58,516 --> 01:30:00,758
- Noah's ark.
- It's not Noah's ark!

1118
01:30:01,102 --> 01:30:03,675
It's the Barbie Party Cruiser.
See, it even has an alarm.

1119
01:30:06,023 --> 01:30:09,309
And if you open it,
you find a disco ball.

1120
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:12,985
- A black Barbie?
- No, she just has a tan!

1121
01:30:13,364 --> 01:30:16,531
- Grams, where's the bar?
- Wherever you left it, honey.

1122
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:18,982
Oh, yeah...

1123
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:22,866
Found it!

1124
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:27,453
Look dad, a bar!

1125
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:30,505
When you press this, it starts
to move. Can I have Barbie?

1126
01:30:30,756 --> 01:30:32,085
Listen to that lisp!

1127
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:35,051
Why did you put those
wires on her teeth?

1128
01:30:35,261 --> 01:30:37,419
- You're so clueless!
- Don't you talk back like that.

1129
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,967
Don't worry, Paul. Santa might
hear and decide not to come.

1130
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:43,385
Look, she wants to have a pizza.

1131
01:30:43,644 --> 01:30:45,304
Feed her some.

1132
01:30:47,064 --> 01:30:49,935
Look, she's gotten all dirty.

1133
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:53,811
I have Boeuf salad...

1134
01:30:54,113 --> 01:30:57,447
... some pressed cheese
and meats for starters.

1135
01:30:58,451 --> 01:31:01,654
For second course
some cabbage rolls.

1136
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:03,365
I'll take them out of the oven.

1137
01:31:03,623 --> 01:31:06,458
You said you'd bring
a cake for dessert.

1138
01:31:07,084 --> 01:31:08,744
I hope Adriana hasn't forgotten.

1139
01:31:09,003 --> 01:31:11,576
I made some cookies just in case.

1140
01:31:11,797 --> 01:31:14,123
Take a look,
you're my food critic.

1141
01:31:14,425 --> 01:31:16,217
- Can I have one, too?
- What, honey-bunny?

1142
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:18,503
- A cookie.
- After dinner, baby.

1143
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:21,508
- But is Barbie allowed one now?
- Sure, Barbie is allowed.

1144
01:31:22,725 --> 01:31:24,303
It's good...

1145
01:31:24,602 --> 01:31:26,844
We have to remember to remove
the braces before dinner.

1146
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:29,394
OK, but what about the presents?

1147
01:31:29,607 --> 01:31:32,276
Mother has to get here first, and
then presents will show up, too.

1148
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:34,561
Mother will get here first,
and then Santa will come, too.

1149
01:31:34,779 --> 01:31:37,021
If we put the food on the table,
he'll get here faster.

1150
01:31:40,743 --> 01:31:42,902
Call Adriana, it's getting late.

1151
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:44,823
Late for what?

1152
01:31:45,081 --> 01:31:48,532
- What's she doing right now anyway?
- She's gone to buy the cake.

1153
01:31:48,876 --> 01:31:50,785
I'm kind of hungry.

1154
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:56,963
Mommy's coming!
Mommy's coming!

1155
01:31:58,219 --> 01:31:59,879
How are you, sweetheart?

1156
01:32:01,013 --> 01:32:03,683
I was about to say how you've grown
since I last saw you.

1157
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:06,673
She's really changed, hasn't she?
I think she's gotten heavier.

1158
01:32:06,894 --> 01:32:08,519
Look whos here...

1159
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,222
Have Ica and Nucu started
you on a fattening diet?

1160
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,267
I'll take the wine
and the water now.

1161
01:32:13,776 --> 01:32:15,151
The presents?

1162
01:32:15,444 --> 01:32:16,903
In the pantry.

1163
01:32:17,113 --> 01:32:18,737
Don't forget to distract her.

1164
01:32:18,948 --> 01:32:21,024
I'll call her out on the balcony
to watch the fireworks.

1165
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:22,950
Mom, look!

1166
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:26,194
I saw it. Very nice.

1167
01:32:26,414 --> 01:32:28,453
I fail to see what's so nice about it.

1168
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:32,125
It's pink, but you can't see it,
'cause it's inside.

1169
01:32:34,422 --> 01:32:36,165
Let your mom take her coat off.

1170
01:32:36,716 --> 01:32:38,625
But I want to show it to Mom, too.

1171
01:32:40,678 --> 01:32:45,139
I got the Barbie Party Cruiser,
with Barbie, a bar and a pool.

1172
01:32:45,766 --> 01:32:47,177
What did you get?

1173
01:32:47,477 --> 01:32:49,635
A Barbie boat from Olga.

1174
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:55,475
Take this boat someplace else
honey, this is not playtime.

1175
01:32:56,277 --> 01:32:59,397
Do you want Santa to find us
unprepared like this?

1176
01:32:59,614 --> 01:33:01,939
Come on,
put it in grandma's room.

1177
01:33:02,492 --> 01:33:04,983
Oh, don't you have
a hard-knock life?

1178
01:33:17,131 --> 01:33:19,883
I'm not going to stay on for
too long. I'll let them know, too.

1179
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,381
- I suppose you told them already.
- No. After the holidays.

1180
01:33:30,686 --> 01:33:33,522
Good thing you're concerned
with not ruining their joy.

1181
01:33:34,315 --> 01:33:36,473
You want me
to tell them right now?

1182
01:33:38,152 --> 01:33:41,272
I'd rather not tell you what
I want right now.

1183
01:33:44,075 --> 01:33:47,444
On a completely different topic,
I'm going to go in Austria with Mara.

1184
01:33:50,414 --> 01:33:52,988
So, you want us to tell Mara before.

1185
01:33:54,043 --> 01:33:57,744
You'll tell her when we both
agree it's best.

1186
01:33:59,507 --> 01:34:02,508
I don't want us to pretend that
nothing happened.

1187
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:07,598
But I don't want you to
traumatize her either.

1188
01:34:10,768 --> 01:34:13,686
When she finds out,
what exactly she finds out...

1189
01:34:14,147 --> 01:34:15,427
We'll see...

1190
01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:21,143
So you're saying we shouldn't
call off the holiday.

1191
01:34:23,698 --> 01:34:27,363
We, Paul, are calling off absolutely
everything concerning the two of us.

1192
01:34:29,537 --> 01:34:31,826
If I'm going,
I'm doing it for Mara.

1193
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:36,248
That's what I was talking about, too.

1194
01:34:41,591 --> 01:34:44,046
I'd better put this in a cup, right?

1195
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:45,671
Leave it like that.

1196
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:48,176
It's for the stuffed eggs.

1197
01:34:48,473 --> 01:34:50,798
Ica! Nucu said "buzz off. "

1198
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:54,267
I'm going to teach
this Nucu a lesson.

1199
01:34:54,729 --> 01:34:57,813
- Should we take out the presents now?
- We will, Mother, be patient.

1200
01:34:58,274 --> 01:35:00,231
It's as if you were the children here...

1201
01:35:00,568 --> 01:35:03,771
All right... You don't have to
take that tone with me.

1202
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:14,908
I'm going to need your written
agreement for Austria.

1203
01:35:19,086 --> 01:35:23,036
When the divorce is final and
the Court entrusts the child to me,

1204
01:35:23,257 --> 01:35:24,835
you won't need to do that anymore.

1205
01:35:25,092 --> 01:35:26,503
I understand.

1206
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,843
Till then, that's where we stand.

1207
01:35:31,682 --> 01:35:33,225
All right, then. Bottom line.

1208
01:35:33,893 --> 01:35:36,645
Not tomorrow, nor
the day after tomorrow...

1209
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:39,931
Call me in the morning
of the 27'th.

1210
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:43,601
We'll go to the notary and
you'll issue the statement for me.

1211
01:35:44,529 --> 01:35:47,399
And then we'll decide on what
and when you tell Mara.

1212
01:35:48,157 --> 01:35:50,114
- All right?
- Right...

1213
01:35:51,577 --> 01:35:53,036
Who could that be?

1214
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:55,119
Probably the garbage men.

1215
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,291
Who is it?

1216
01:35:59,544 --> 01:36:01,702
It's the carolers!

1217
01:36:09,887 --> 01:36:11,963
Paul! The presents!

1218
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:07,652
That's all?

1219
01:37:08,154 --> 01:37:10,312
Do you know
"Let us praise the Lord?"
