1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>Niko 2 - Little Brother, Big Trouble</i>

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:32,198
Okay, guys, let's make
this practice flight count!

3
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,368
How much fun is this?

4
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:40,957
Alright, let's just say...
Santa overboard!

5
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:46,380
How come is it that Santa
never comes on our practice runs?

6
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,884
Do you really want to be dragging
him around the sky?

7
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:59,435
Okay boys, well done.
Now... a sleigh malfunction!

8
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,564
Come on, Niko!

9
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,486
It's all in the antlers!
Now you try it!

10
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,575
<i>- I did it!
- That's my boy!</i>

11
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,831
Not bad. Not bad at all.
But what if we lose the sleigh?

12
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,667
Try not to scream like a sissy.

13
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,680
Why can't Santa just walk
like everybody else?

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,352
And finally, let's check
the Santa speed before C-day.

15
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,896
Now remember what I told you.

16
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,526
Clear your mind and concentrate
on your happy heart. - Got it, Dad.

17
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:53,197
Up here they call me Prancer.
- Santa Speed, men!

18
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,123
Niko, it'll never work!

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,962
Hey it is working! You're doing
it! You're doing Santa speed!

20
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:14,884
I can't go any... faster!

21
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:22,016
I can't see! I can't see!

22
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:27,147
That's better. I can see!

23
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,328
Hello.

24
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,667
Hello. What's your name?
- Unhand me, madam!

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,502
- I love you.
- We just met!

26
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,841
Niko! Are you okay!?

27
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,846
Sorry, Dad. I guess I'll never
be able to fly Santa speed.

28
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,765
Of course you will. It just takes
time... and a happy heart.

29
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:08,605
You do have a happy heart don't you?
- Sure I do! Let's try it again!

30
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,109
Maybe next weekend.
It's getting a little late.

31
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,028
Your Mom will be wondering
where you are.

32
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,949
If you lived with me and Mom,
in New Home Valley -

33
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:23,954
we wouldn't have to keep flying
back and forth. - I know, but...

34
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:28,209
Maybe we could get her
some of that high mountain moss.

35
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,629
She'd really like that,
it's her favorite.

36
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:39,469
She will be happy just as long as
I bring you home safe and sound.

37
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,722
I guess.

38
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,352
Which means
we won't be doing any of this.

39
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:53,400
You mean, this?
- Exactly. Or this...

40
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,239
Oh, I'd never do this.

41
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,078
And we certainly won't be
racing home. - Certainly not.

42
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,332
You're going to race home,
aren't you?

43
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,595
Why do they always
make me worry like this?

44
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:28,060
Niko should be home by now. - He's got
Prancer and Julius to look after him.

45
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:33,524
A hotheaded reindeer and a chubby
squirrel. What could go wrong?

46
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:42,283
Finally! And what time
do you call this? Where's Niko?

47
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:47,538
Don't worry. You know as long as
Niko's with me he's perfectly safe.

48
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,295
- Well... pretty safe.
- Did I win?

49
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,548
What did I say about racing?!

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,886
But Mom, if I'm going to learn
how to go Santa speed...

51
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,889
We talked about this.
The boy's too young to go that fast.

52
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,810
I know, but...
- But I wouldn't listen!

53
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,646
Dad was all, like,
"You're too young to go that fast" -

54
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,817
and "you should listen
to your mother."

55
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,821
And I was all like,
"why?" and he was all like -

56
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:26,994
"because she's a very special lady"
and then his eyes went like this.

57
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:33,500
Okay. So, I'll see you next
weekend after Christmas, Niko.

58
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,004
Have a merry Christmas, everybody!

59
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,346
You want to go to the wild woods
with us tomorrow?

60
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,725
I hear there's lots of fresh moss
up there. - Yeah! Can I Mom?

61
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:56,023
Okay. But right now it's time
for dinner. Good night, guys.

62
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:11,454
So what do you think?
I picked your favorite. - Wow!

63
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,041
There's so much!
Is that just for us two?

64
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:19,713
Niko, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

65
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:25,968
Me too. I found out today that my
heart isn't as happy as it should be.

66
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:30,766
So I was thinking
that wouldn't it be great -

67
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,019
if we had someone around
who could help us out? - It would be.

68
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:39,983
Someone who could help us forage
and keep you company?

69
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:45,322
I'm really glad that you think so,
Niko. Because I have good news.

70
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:49,742
We're not going to be alone
anymore. - You mean...?

71
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,917
- Dad!
- No, Niko, wait!

72
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,007
- Hi, Niko.
- But... but...

73
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:09,096
Niko, this is Lenni.
- It's so nice to finally meet you!

74
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,266
I've heard so much about you.

75
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,687
I was nervous about meeting you. I
thought I wouldn't know what to say.

76
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,274
Thought I'd end up
rambling on about the weather.

77
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:26,447
But, now that I'm here,
this isn't awkward at all!

78
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:33,120
I hear it might snow.
- What are you, a weatherman?

79
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:39,293
There's someone else we'd like you
to meet. - Come and say hi, Jonni.

80
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:44,882
Hi. Are you my big brother now?

81
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:50,052
- Big brother?
- Um, so who's hungry?

82
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:55,350
Starving! Jonni and I brought
something for desert.

83
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:00,146
Some high mountain moss.
- My favorite.

84
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:13,494
So, Niko. I couldn't help but notice
it's a bit cloudy out there.

85
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:19,582
I was saying to your Mom, "I think
we might be in for some rain, dear."

86
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,670
Do you always talk
about the weather? - No.

87
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:28,091
I was telling a joke...
about the weather.

88
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,345
I don't hear anybody laughing.

89
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:41,772
"Rain dear"! I just got that!

90
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:52,282
Niko, why don't you tell us all
about your weekend at Santa's Fell?

91
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,702
It was nothing special.
Just hanging with the Flying Forces.

92
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,121
Wow! The Flying Forces!

93
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,626
Jonni is a big fan of the Flying
Forces. He knows all their names.

94
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,298
Comet, Cupid, Dancer, Dasher,
Blixen, Donner and Vixen!

95
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:14,388
You forgot Prancer.
- Oh, I always forget him.

96
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,393
That's all right, Jonni.
It could happen to anyone.

97
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,604
Not to me.

98
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:35,908
You know you'll always be my number
one, Niko, right? - I know that.

99
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:42,665
I was really hoping you'd be okay
with Lenni coming to live with us.

100
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:49,172
He's very special to me, and if you
give him a chance, you'll see why.

101
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,259
Well... of course I'm okay with it.
- Really?

102
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:59,600
Sure.
- You've made me very happy, Niko.

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,476
Sweet dreams, my little man.

104
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:10,027
I'm really not okay with this.
What am I going to do?

105
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,032
Maybe you should give him a chance.
- I thought you were on my side!

106
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:22,121
I am! Look, Niko,
I know it's hard, change always is.

107
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:27,711
But your Mom deserves a happy heart
too. - Yeah. I guess.

108
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:33,716
And he seems like a nice guy.
He certainly is funny.

109
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,892
I can't help it... "Rain dear"!

110
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,645
"Rain dear"!

111
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:57,740
Before there was you
We had nothing to do

112
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,995
Before there was you
We were lonely and blue

113
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,835
Alone and estranged
Now that's all changed

114
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:16,176
And now that you are here
There's nothing to fear

115
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:28,522
That was beautiful, boys,
just beautiful.

116
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:33,025
I'm so glad I met you fellas.

117
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:38,948
I could really use some friends right
now. You are my friends, aren't you?

118
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,033
- Oh, yes!
- Best Friends!

119
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:48,207
Totally!
- Good. Because I need a little favor.

120
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,471
Good!

121
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,726
Well done!
- Throw it higher, Julius!

122
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,019
This one's for the title!

123
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,235
How about that,
pretty high, right?

124
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,908
Did you hurt yourself, son?
- No, Dad. I'm fine, really I am.

125
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:27,163
Niko didn't mean any harm.
He just wants to play, too.

126
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:33,669
Can I play with Niko, Dad? - I think
we'd have to ask Niko about that.

127
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,923
Niko would love to play with Jonni,
wouldn't you? - What?

128
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,927
But we're going to the
Wild Woods with Saga and Wilma!

129
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,309
I think he's cute.

130
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,355
Me too. He reminds me of... me.

131
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:58,278
You've found yourself a new best
friend. - How could you say that?

132
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,116
After all we've been through, do you
really think that some little kid...

133
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,037
How adorable is that?

134
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:14,711
So what do you want to do, Jonni?
Do you like games? - I love games!

135
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:21,467
How about we play hide and seek?
- Really? I'm a great hider!

136
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:27,890
Let's hope so. You run deep into
the woods and hide. Off you go!

137
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:33,813
I have a better idea.
You and Niko hide together.

138
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,984
Hey, hang on. That's not...
- I just love hide and seek!

139
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,988
One, two, three...

140
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,908
Does this mean we're a team?

141
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,413
What's it like to fly?
Do you get scared?

142
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,582
Do you really know
all the Flying Forces?

143
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,672
What does Santa's beard smell like?
Will you bring me with you next time?

144
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:04,510
No! Not just anyone can go
to Santa's Fell and meet the Forces.

145
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,682
Saga! Have you looked over here?
- Hey, where should we hide?

146
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,976
How about here?

147
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:19,275
Maybe you should decide.
You're the big brother.

148
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,447
Stop calling me that. I'm not
your brother! Okay? - But Mom says...

149
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,284
And she's not your Mom.
She's my Mom!

150
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,788
Okay.

151
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,298
I wish he would just disappear!

152
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,056
- It worked?
- Help!

153
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:59,649
What happened? Where's Jonni?
- I don't know! I left him there.

154
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:04,321
You left Jonni on his own?
- Just for a second.

155
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,909
- Help me Niko!
- Jonni!

156
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,918
Niko, look out!

157
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:29,261
They're gaining on us!
- I can't go any faster!

158
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:37,729
I love it when they run!
- You've got to save yourself!

159
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,357
Forget it. I'm not going anywhere!

160
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,120
Well, well, well.
And what do we have here?

161
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:59,209
Reindeer. You can tell by the
antlers. - I was trying to be scary.

162
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:05,631
Sorry. You carry on. - No, forget it,
you've ruined the moment.

163
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:12,221
That's Boss, we'd better get going.
- You won't be so lucky next time.

164
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,150
Over here!

165
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:33,659
What happened?
- The eagles... they took Jonni.

166
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,664
What do we do now? - We stay calm
and think this thing through.

167
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,168
There's no time for that! It's my
fault and I'm going to get him back.

168
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:47,256
I can't possibly allow that!
It's far too dangerous.

169
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,761
There has to be another way. Firstly,
we return and raise the alarm.

170
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:57,600
Secondly, we elect a search party
leader. Fourthly... or thirdly?

171
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:04,941
Hey, Nutboy. - Oh no.
He'll never find Jonni on his own.

172
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:17,369
Where are you taking me?
- Save your breath, Niko.

173
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:22,208
- I'm Jonni.
- Sure you are!

174
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,299
Jonni! Jonni!

175
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,184
Jonni!

176
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:15,010
Wilma, I want you to go
to Santa's Fell and tell Prancer.

177
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:20,724
Saga, I need you to stay here in case
Niko or Jonni return. - And you?

178
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:26,355
I'm going after Niko. But first,
Lenni and Oona have to be told.

179
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:31,861
I find honesty is
always the best policy.

180
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,865
It's best you let me do the talking.
- Hey, you're back early.

181
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,868
Where are the boys?
- Boys? What boys?

182
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:46,041
Jonni and Niko.
- Oh! Jonni and Niko. Right.

183
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,297
The boys went out to play and then
huge flying... - I should have known!

184
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:56,635
Prancer's taken them up to see
Santa's fell, hasn't he?

185
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:03,768
As soon as I've turned my back,
Niko's disappeared with his father.

186
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,981
Hey! Come on! Hold on a sec!

187
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,736
What? It went well.
Why didn't you say something?

188
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:19,576
Well excuse me, Mister
"honesty is always the best policy"!

189
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:25,664
I thought you said it was best
if you do the talking. - Stop it.

190
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,002
It doesn't matter who tells them
but Lenni and Oona need to know.

191
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,006
Need to know what?

192
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:51,441
- Hello...?
- Who said that?

193
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,528
Where am I?
- Don't worry, you're perfectly safe.

194
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,782
I've been keeping a watchful eye
on you, young lady. - Young lady?

195
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,288
What? I mean, young buck.
- Can you see okay?

196
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:10,876
I could count every green hair
on your head from fifty paces.

197
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,883
That's moss. You're talking
to a rock. - I knew that.

198
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:21,637
Thanks for your help, sir,
but I have to fly.

199
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,308
A flyer, eh? I could tell you
a few stories about flyers.

200
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:32,397
Thanks but I've got to go. A little
reindeer was taken by the eagles.

201
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:38,654
You're not going to the Eagles Domain
by yourself, are you? - Where?

202
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:43,492
That's where the eagles take all
their prey. Very dangerous indeed.

203
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,913
You need to go to the Flying Forces.
- I can't tell them!

204
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:54,671
I mean, it's so close to Christmas,
they're probably too busy.

205
00:20:54,753 --> 00:21:01,176
Hey, maybe you could take me?
- To the Eagles Domain? Gracious no.

206
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:06,641
My adventuring days are long over.
- But... but I really need your help.

207
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,769
I'm sorry, but I live out here
on my own for a reason.

208
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:16,276
I got tired of getting tangled up in
the world's problems many years ago.

209
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,862
The only friends I want
are the rocks and the trees.

210
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,865
Out here I don't need anybody
and nobody needs me.

211
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,705
There's a little reindeer boy who
needs me, with or without your help.

212
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:37,880
Stop looking at me like that.

213
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:43,970
Fine, go ahead then, look at me all
you want! But it's not going to work.

214
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,641
You really think I'm going to let
old rocks tell me what to do?

215
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,185
Alright, alright, I'll go!

216
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,148
Are you happy now?

217
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,487
It's best if the reindeer who knows
where he's going leads the way!

218
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,325
Step aside, sir,
can't you see we're in a hurry?

219
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:34,729
We're back! And I think
you're going to be very happy.

220
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:41,443
I knew I could depend on you,
my darling eagle friends.

221
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:48,201
I brought you the little reindeer boy
just like you asked! I got Niko, see?

222
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,702
- Hey! We all got him.
- Yeah!

223
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,538
- That's not Niko!
- He got him!

224
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:57,292
It was just him!
- It's not Niko? But you said:

225
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:02,632
"Get the little lying reindeer boy."
That's a little lying reindeer boy.

226
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,551
What are you talking about?! I said:

227
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,473
"Get the little flying reindeer boy".

228
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:15,394
I told you it didn't make sense.

229
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:20,982
Didn't you even ask him his name?
- But we thought he was lying.

230
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:25,404
You can see our confusion.
- Get him out of my sight.

231
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,574
What do you want us to do with him?
- I don't care!

232
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,327
Great, 'cos I'm starving.

233
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:37,834
Niko is my big brother and the
Flying Forces are his best friends!

234
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,921
When they come to rescue me
you'll be sorry! - Stop!

235
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:50,596
Niko is your brother?
Nice work, fellas.

236
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,057
Put him somewhere safe.

237
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:59,939
The eagles have Jonni?!
I've got to find him!

238
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,607
Now.

239
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,281
Where am I going? - I guess they're
taking Jonni to the Eagle's Domain.

240
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,951
To the Eagle's Domain!
Where's the Eagle's Domain?

241
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,622
It'll take you days
to get there on foot.

242
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,375
Let me go, I can fly.

243
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,628
You and Wilma ask
the Flying Forces for help.

244
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:30,135
Ask Prancer for help? I don't
think so. - Not even for Jonni?

245
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,097
You're right.
But what am I going to tell Oona?

246
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:39,103
I always find
honesty is the best policy.

247
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:46,486
What? I do! - Julius is right.
I've got to tell her the truth.

248
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:51,740
You're going to Santa's Fell
to challenge Prancer? - Yes I am.

249
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:57,163
I'm tired of him upsetting you.
I'm sorting it out once and for all.

250
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:01,500
Reindeer to reindeer. - Really?
It just doesn't sound like you.

251
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:06,672
That sounds more like a tough guy,
not like my sweet weatherman guy.

252
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,593
There's more to me than weather.

253
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:16,848
If you don't mind I have to be going.
It looks like it might snow.

254
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,441
A strange way of telling the truth.

255
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:29,362
I would never lie to Oona.
Not normally.

256
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:35,617
But... Let's just say she shouldn't
be upset at the moment. - Why?

257
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:40,623
I'm coming! You're right. Someone
needs to put Prancer straight.

258
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:45,877
And I've got a thing or two
to say to him myself. - Okay.

259
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,804
I hope Jonni's alright. Do you know
when we'll get to the Eagle's Domain?

260
00:25:54,886 --> 00:26:00,183
We'll get there when we get there.
Let's keep the talk to a minimum.

261
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,353
Right.

262
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:07,316
I live in the new Home Valley.
Have you ever been there?

263
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,403
There's loads of reindeer.
My name's Niko.

264
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:16,741
The name is Tobias, if you must know.
I like it just fine on my own.

265
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,663
Don't you get lonely?
- Lonely? Ha!

266
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:26,251
You've got to learn
to take care of yourself, Niko.

267
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,006
I don't need anybody but me.

268
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:35,927
You don't get this old without
knowing how to look after yourself.

269
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:42,602
You can't rely on me to save the
day every time you get into trouble.

270
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,863
Can we just take a minute?
- This is just what I'm talking about!

271
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,366
You wouldn't last a second
out here without me.

272
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,711
Scary down here, isn't it?

273
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,548
Down here
where the light doesn't get in.

274
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,301
No way of knowing night from day.

275
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,472
Just endless, dark tunnels.

276
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:27,896
- Hi, Speedy!
- Every time. Every time!

277
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,653
Do you think, just once, I could
be scary without you ruining it?

278
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,905
Sorry.

279
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:46,164
Behold! The Woods of the Vanishing.

280
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,752
- Why are they called that?
- No idea.

281
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,339
But don't worry,
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

282
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:18,446
You you look a little tired,
young buck.

283
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,702
If you want to rest I'll be okay
with that. - No, no, I'm fine.

284
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:28,457
Because you sound
a little breathless.

285
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,296
We're not resting
until I find Jonni, alright? Tobias?

286
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,650
Tobias? Wake up, will you?

287
00:28:55,984 --> 00:29:01,490
I am awake. I figured out why they're
called the Woods of the Vanishing.

288
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,996
But if you're awake,
then who's snoring?

289
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:12,084
Is that a bear?
- You don't have to worry about him.

290
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,255
He's hibernating for the winter.
You couldn't wake him.

291
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:22,260
Hey! Bear! Wake up!
You see? Nothing.

292
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:27,098
Or am I thinking of hedgehogs?
- Let's get out of here.

293
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,269
I think that would
probably be best.

294
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,859
- I'm stuck!
- Hang on!

295
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,028
He's coming!

296
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:59,964
Wow! That was amazing!
You totally defeated the bear!

297
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:07,640
Did I?
I did, didn't I? HOW about that!

298
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,101
You were lucky I was there.
- Yeah. Thanks.

299
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,980
Although, you were the one
who fell down the hole -

300
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,650
and you woke the bear...

301
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:22,654
Now what did I say about keeping
the talk to a minimum?

302
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:50,473
So you didn't have any brothers or
sisters to get you in trouble? - Nope.

303
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,978
And no mother or father
to boss you around? - Nope.

304
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:58,606
That must have been great.
You could do whatever you wanted!

305
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:04,864
I saw the world many times over and
had more than my share of adventures.

306
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:11,202
You're so lucky! Now you live all on
your own. Just you and your memories.

307
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:17,542
No friends or family to bother you.
No one at all to bother you, right?

308
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:23,214
I bet nobody even knows you exist.
- You're probably right.

309
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:35,435
Are you okay? You look kind of sad.
- What are you talking about?

310
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,151
I'm the luckiest reindeer in the
world, remember? Let's move on.

311
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,423
The Eagle's Domain is just up ahead.
We must be very careful from now on.

312
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,430
- Where are you going?
- To get Jonni.

313
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:15,017
You won't last a second
in the air with those eagles!

314
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:20,189
What else can I do? - I used to
play around here as a youngster.

315
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,609
There was a passageway into
the Domain somewhere... around...

316
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,779
- Here!
- Perfect!

317
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,365
Follow me.

318
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:38,374
It appears I've grown a little over
the years. I'll have to wait here.

319
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:48,467
I won't be long.
- I'll be waiting right here for you.

320
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,637
If I sense any danger,
I'll whistle down the tunnel.

321
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,923
I heard what you were saying there
and you're right.

322
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:34,012
We really need to get some light
down here. It's so creepy.

323
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:38,017
This is a dungeon.
It's supposed to look horrible.

324
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:44,940
There's no need to shout, we don't
want to scare the prisoner. - We do!

325
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,195
Eddie, why don't you go and get
some fresh air? - Fine. I will.

326
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,701
I could get some fresh air
down here if we let the light in.

327
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,209
Who's there?

328
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:09,630
This isn't funny, Eddie.

329
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:13,802
It's only funny when I do it.

330
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,731
- Jonni!
- Niko! I knew you'd come!

331
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,400
We have to get out of here!

332
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:36,657
Hey, did you see that?
- What's a reindeer doing out here?

333
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,835
- Hello.
- Who's that?

334
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,010
Thought you could sneak up on old
Tobias. - Actually, we're over here.

335
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,893
Niko! Watch out!

336
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:09,525
Looks like we found our little
flying reindeer boy after all.

337
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:15,364
He looks older than I imagined.
- Not him, birdbrain! Down the tunnel!

338
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,880
Come on!

339
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:49,398
Now isn't this nice,
a family reunion. How touching.

340
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:55,153
Under it all, you are such a softie.
- I was being sarcastic!

341
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:59,992
When I say "now", jump on. Now!

342
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,411
Stop them!

343
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:18,342
There has to be another way
out of here! - Niko, up there!

344
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,443
Going somewhere?

345
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:53,795
What on earth?
- Come on, you're like an elephant.

346
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,715
One, two, three and...

347
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,722
Excuse me, sir. But you didn't happen
to see a young reindeer boy, did you?

348
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:10,353
What? Okay, just stay calm
and don't tell them anything.

349
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,231
I have no Niko
what you're talking about.

350
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:17,818
I mean, I have no idea
what you're Niko-ing about.

351
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,655
- Darn it!
- We should talk.

352
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:34,585
Well, aren't you a difficult
young man to get hold of.

353
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:41,677
Who are you? - I'd forgotten
we've never actually met.

354
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,766
I believe you knew my brother.
- Black Wolf is your brother?

355
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,938
Was my brother!
Until you destroyed him!

356
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,025
Jonni isn't part of this.
He isn't even my real brother.

357
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:05,284
Real or not, at least you still
have a brother. But not for long!

358
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:16,711
You just can't stay out of trouble,
can you? You're not the only flyer.

359
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:21,048
- Seize them!
- A little to your left!

360
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,219
Left! No, left!

361
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:31,393
That's not left! - Who cares,
you never forget how to fly!

362
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,438
Don't worry, Boss, I got him.

363
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:44,989
You can't carry all of us. - Just hang
on and learn from the master.

364
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,326
Get a move on!

365
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,496
I had forgotten
how much fun this is!

366
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,920
Do I have to do everything myself?

367
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:36,541
What's so funny? - I'm sorry, it's
all the feathers. I'm so ticklish.

368
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,293
Give me patience...

369
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,764
Everyone okay? - Why didn't
you tell me you could fly?

370
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:58,396
Well, to tell you the truth,
I wasn't sure I could anymore.

371
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:04,402
Oh no! We need to hide.
- I'm a great hider.

372
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,742
In here!
- Hurry, Niko! They're coming!

373
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,338
They're not here. Move out!

374
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:31,096
You saved us, Jonni.
- Good work, Jonni. Well done.

375
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:36,016
We can't stay here.
Come on, keep low.

376
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:51,867
Well? Where are they?
- They appear to have disappeared.

377
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:58,539
Does that sound weird to you?
- You fools! You've ruined everything!

378
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:10,635
I just mean that if you can't help me
catch that little flying reindeer -

379
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,637
- I have to go.
- You can stay.

380
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:17,224
Nobody ever wants to stay.
- Just tell us what to do.

381
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,728
Join me in destroying
the Flying Forces!

382
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:26,067
Once they're gone,
Niko will have nowhere left to hide!

383
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,320
Destroy the Flying Forces?
- We can't do that.

384
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,492
Those guys are tough.
- I'm sorry. My mistake.

385
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:39,079
I thought it was the Flying Forces
who'd banished you from the skies.

386
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,250
- It was.
- Really?

387
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,670
And that doesn't make you
the tiniest bit annoyed?

388
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:50,675
Now that you mention it.

389
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:54,179
If the Flying Forces had banished
me from the skies -

390
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,266
and forced me to live
in this creepy hovel -

391
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,561
I might be feeling
a little angry myself.

392
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:09,193
I told you it was creepy. - I'd go
up to Santa's Fell right now -

393
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:14,032
and let those flying freaks know
who really rules the skies!

394
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,059
Good!

395
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,313
Tobias, were you ever
on the Flying Forces?

396
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:49,150
Yes I was. And they were
the best years of my life.

397
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:55,657
So why did you leave?
- There was an... incident, you see.

398
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,659
What kind of incident?

399
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:03,998
Well, at that time I was leader
of the Flying Forces, you see.

400
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:09,003
But I was getting older
and my eyesight was starting to fail.

401
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:14,342
I didn't say anything. I was afraid
I'd lose my place on the forces.

402
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,177
They were the only family I had.

403
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:23,226
So, like a fool, I just went ahead
with the Christmas present run.

404
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:29,273
Turns out my eyes were worse
than I thought. I missed two houses.

405
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:34,778
The next morning two children woke up
without any presents.

406
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,699
All because of me.

407
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:43,038
I was so ashamed I just left
in the middle of the night-

408
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,206
and I never went back.

409
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:50,045
You've made up for it today.
Look at me and Jonni.

410
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:53,213
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

411
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:58,219
You're good boys. You're lucky
to have each other for brothers.

412
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:03,266
Actually, we...
- We're not really brothers.

413
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:09,146
Jonni's Dad and my Mom are moving in
together. - Mom died when I was born.

414
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:15,235
Me and my Dad have always been alone.
- Being alone is the greatest.

415
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,155
- Just ask Tobias!
- Well...

416
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,827
It's not so great. My Dad has always
been sad as long as I remember.

417
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:29,333
But after he met Miss Oona
he's always happy. And me too.

418
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,420
But it's okay
if you don't want to be my brother.

419
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,423
I'll stay out of your way.

420
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,431
Well, if it's what he wants...

421
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:15,045
Okay guys. Pre-Christmas takeoff
checklist: Right rudder. - Check!

422
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,880
- Left rudder.
- Check!

423
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,550
Air pressure.

424
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:27,307
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Alright, final practice before C-day.

425
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,407
Look, there they are!

426
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:47,494
Now be brave, Lenni. You go give
Prancer a piece of your mind.

427
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,588
It's been nice knowing you Lenni,
gotta go!

428
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,177
Boys, I need to check this out.

429
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,099
Two minutes, Prancer!

430
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:15,106
Oona! What are you doing up here?
- The name's Lenni -

431
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,443
and you've got some
explaining to do. - I do?

432
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:23,280
This could get a little rough. You
might want to leave this to the men.

433
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:27,786
I'm not going anywhere.
We know they're here with you.

434
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:32,539
What are we talking about? - Now
don't you act the innocent with me.

435
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,043
You know very well
what we're talking about.

436
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,797
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

437
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,137
Do you have something in your
eye? - What's going on, Lenni?

438
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:53,186
Factory alarm!
- We'd better take a look.

439
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,396
Sorry, but I really have to go.

440
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:07,909
What's going on? - There won't
be enough toys for Christmas.

441
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,661
Come on, let's check it out.

442
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,922
Those are Mom's tracks!
- And those are Dad's!

443
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:27,344
Listen, Jonni. About the eagles and
stuff... - Hold on there, young man!

444
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,849
Your mother thinks
you've both been at Santa's Fell.

445
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:37,605
It's time she knew what happened.
- But why? Everything's fine now!

446
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:43,360
If she finds out Jonni was kidnapped,
she won't trust me anymore.

447
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,280
I'll never be allowed
go to Santa's Fell.

448
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,034
I'm sorry Niko, but she's your mother
and she needs to know the truth.

449
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,789
I'll be grounded for life.

450
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:02,463
Don't worry. I'm sure
Niko will do the right thing.

451
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:06,050
Where are you going?
- Well, I'm going home.

452
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:10,637
Now that the boys are safe, they
don't need Old Tobias any more.

453
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,724
You can't leave
without saying goodbye.

454
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:20,565
It's better this way. Besides, he'll
soon forget about me. He'll be fine.

455
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:35,413
Dad! - Jonni! Are you all right?
I was so worried about you boys!

456
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:40,751
I'm fine, Dad.
- Where have you been hiding?

457
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:45,005
Well, you see, what happened was...

458
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:49,677
We went to Santa's Fell.
It was so much fun!

459
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,309
How many times have I told you? You
can't go off when you feel like it.

460
00:48:56,434 --> 00:49:02,940
Niko, wasn't there something else you
wanted to say to your mother? - Yes.

461
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:09,112
I won't do it again. Promise.
- Well, alright then.

462
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,699
At least you and Jonni are safe.

463
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:17,288
Lenni? You look like you
have something to say. - Yes.

464
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:22,543
Looks like there's a storm brewing.
Let's go while the weather holds.

465
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:28,382
I don't know why I bother!
- Come on, Julius, let's go home.

466
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:39,601
Where's Tobias?
- Tobias said he had to go, Niko.

467
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:46,317
He didn't even say goodbye. I guess
he really doesn't need anybody else.

468
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:54,157
Someone must have
shut down the factory.

469
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,661
I don't like this.

470
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:19,349
Hey, what is this?

471
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,021
Let us outta here!

472
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,364
Not flying so high now, are we?

473
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:45,043
I just wanted to say thanks, but
I don't think you should have lied.

474
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:52,215
I never lied before.
It was easier than I thought.

475
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,387
But somehow it makes
me feel kind of bad.

476
00:50:57,472 --> 00:51:02,434
So what are you two boys
whispering about? - Nothing.

477
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:08,648
It makes me so happy to see
you two getting along so well.

478
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:13,237
I know what you and your Dad
mean by a happy heart.

479
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,659
I just knew you would be
a good big brother to Jonni.

480
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,163
When we went out
to play hide and seek -

481
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:26,250
I left Jonni on his own
and the eagles took him. - What?

482
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,838
I knew you'd tell the truth.
- Julius! You knew?

483
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:35,009
I tried to tell you but Wilma...
- Hey, don't look at me.

484
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,429
I thought we should say
something, but Lenni...

485
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:42,599
I wanted to tell you.
But I didn't want to worry you -

486
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,228
because... well, you know why.

487
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,942
- You were all lying to me?
- No!

488
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,362
- Yes.
- Yes.

489
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,447
Yes.

490
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:02,702
Lenni, I thought you were different.

491
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:08,543
Come on, Niko.
We're going home... alone.

492
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:18,635
We won! It's true! We won! It's true!

493
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,684
I don't know you, but
nobody crosses the Flying Forces -

494
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:31,231
and gets away with it!
- Really? Are you sure about that?

495
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:40,407
Now all we're missing is
the guest of honor... little Niko.

496
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:47,331
I'd bet he'd come running
if he knew his father was in trouble.

497
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,168
Leave Niko alone!

498
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,025
It's a harness.
They've got the Flying Forces.

499
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:19,780
I've got to go. I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry about everything.

500
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:24,117
Don't! No! Niko, come back!

501
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,456
I know somebody who can help us.
- You read my mind.

502
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:11,414
You weren't thinking of going
in there on your own, were you?

503
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:16,003
Am I glad to see you guys!
But why would you bring Jonni here?

504
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,088
The kid brought me here.

505
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:22,677
I hate to break up the happy reunion,
but take a look.

506
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,391
The Flying Forces must be trapped
inside. We have to get in there.

507
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,811
We'll never get past those eagles.
- I could help.

508
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:39,193
It's too dangerous. Hide in the
woods until all this is over. - But...

509
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:44,364
What if I act as a decoy?
While the eagles are chasing me -

510
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:51,121
you could get inside the
toy factory. - Let's stick together...

511
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:58,545
I don't see nothing.
- He'll be here soon, trust me.

512
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:06,887
What did I tell you?
Good guys are just so predictable.

513
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:15,061
Where are they going? - The question
is: what are we waiting for?

514
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,740
This feels too easy.

515
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,076
No! Jonni!

516
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,177
Look! Down there.
- My nose itches.

517
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,972
Hey! That's my nose! - You set them
free and I'll start up the factory.

518
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,601
Niko's got nowhere to hide.

519
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,693
Looking for me? Well here I am.

520
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:07,030
Not a moment too soon, Niko!

521
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,201
You'll have to catch me first.

522
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:17,791
So this is what the Flying Forces
look like nowadays, is it?

523
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:22,880
Isn't that...
- Tobias, a living legend! A hero!

524
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:27,385
What are you doing here? - What
else would a hero be doing here?

525
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,304
I'm saving the day. Oops.

526
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,391
Help!

527
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,896
- Do something, anything!
- Oh dear.

528
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:44,568
- Not that!
- Well how about this?

529
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:33,617
The factory!
Get back to the factory!

530
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,793
Useless feather balls!

531
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:57,056
Come get me!

532
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:08,485
- Come on!
- Help us!

533
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:14,824
Come on guys, I gave you the
easy job. - Push! No, wait... pull!

534
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,577
We're running out of time!

535
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:31,342
- Hey guys, it's Wilma.
- Hi, fellas.

536
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,643
That looks a little easier.

537
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,360
Help!

538
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,864
Let him go!

539
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:04,791
Jump, Jonni! I'll catch you.
Trust me.

540
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,713
That tickles!

541
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,432
Jonni!

542
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,153
Jonni!

543
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:43,329
Jonni! Are you okay? Jonni?

544
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,668
Please, wake up.

545
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,925
Jonni! You're alright!

546
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:59,096
I've felt better.

547
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:11,358
So you wanna play hide-and-seek?

548
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,472
Come on!
- You'll be faster without me.

549
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:46,434
I'm never letting you
out of my sight again. Look out!

550
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,271
Niko!

551
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:57,153
I'm not sure how much longer I can
keep this up. - You're a hero.

552
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:05,079
Time to ruffle some feathers!

553
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:12,835
Let's get outta here!
- I've missed this.

554
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:32,438
I'm sorry, wasn't I making
it easy enough for you?

555
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:11,769
- Niko!
- Jonni, look out!

556
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,148
No!

557
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,083
Badly wrapped,
but the perfect gift.

558
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:40,507
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

559
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,177
Hey Wolfie!

560
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:52,393
Jonni! No! - It seems in all
the excitement I forgot my starter.

561
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,855
Jonni!

562
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:10,454
What are you doing here? - Just
making the odds a little more even.

563
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:29,472
Happy Christmas to me!

564
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:41,902
Let go! - Nice work.
You know how to open that thing too?

565
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:46,155
I think so.
- Great! I'll let you know when.

566
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:52,829
Let me go you little runt!
- Gladly.

567
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,333
Now!

568
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,264
- You'll regret this!
- Allow me.

569
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,643
Not quite.

570
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:28,699
Retreat! Retreat!
- Retreat? What does that mean?

571
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:32,869
I don't know but
I'm not waiting around to find out!

572
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:37,875
Take that, you nasty eagles.

573
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,297
All right boys,
that ought to do it!

574
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:48,802
We're reindeer we're not horses!
We're Santa's Flying Forces! Ho-ho!

575
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,139
Time to get going, boys.

576
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:58,769
And to think,
some people call this "the holidays".

577
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:12,242
It's OK,
you can come a little closer.

578
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:27,840
Wow! This is like,
the best Christmas present ever!

579
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:34,431
Niko! Nice to see you.
And who is this fine young fellow?

580
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:38,309
This is Jonni, my little brother.

581
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:44,190
Nice to meet you, Jonni.

582
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,527
Is that who I think it is?

583
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:58,038
Good to see you again, old friend.
- Yes.

584
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:10,467
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas everybody!

585
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,018
- Jonni!
- Niko!

586
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,146
- Mom!
- Dad!

587
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:36,409
Boys! Are you all right?
- We're fine.

588
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:41,664
I'm sorry, Mom.
This was all my fault.

589
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:45,501
I should have been
a proper big brother to Jonni.

590
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,422
I'm sorry I never
gave you a chance, Lenni.

591
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:55,762
There's more to you than the weather.
- Families have their ups and downs.

592
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,016
There's gonna be
good days and bad days -

593
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:04,021
but as long as we weather
these storms together...

594
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:08,108
Wow, I really do talk
about the weather all the time.

595
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:26,960
Tobias! Wait! Hey, Tobias!

596
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,380
Please wait.

597
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:36,969
Do you have to go? I was hoping you
might wanna come home with us.

598
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:42,641
I know you like it out there
on your own with the rocks.

599
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:46,646
Are you kidding? Have you
ever tried talking to a rock?

600
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:51,318
They're worse than trees. I'll tell
you all about it on our way home.

601
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:58,992
This rock told me that
most trees are as thick as a plank...

602
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,505
See? It's all in the antlers.

603
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:18,845
Good! I knew you could do it. Catch!

604
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:23,350
It's taking so long.
- I know. Is that normal?

605
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:29,773
Nothing to worry about. No nervous
to be reason... Reason to be nervous.

606
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:34,860
Hey boys! There's somebody here
who'd like to meet you!

607
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,949
Race you!

608
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:48,958
Hey! When did you
get to be so fast?

609
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,881
Say hi to your little sister, boys.

610
01:08:56,882 --> 01:09:01,805
I guess that makes us both
big brothers now. - I guess so.

611
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:06,393
Come on.
Your Mom needs to rest now.

612
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,070
Do you wanna play hide and seek?

613
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:24,077
Hide and seek? Why I'd find you
in two second flat, young buck!

614
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:31,917
Maybe we should get some air.

615
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:47,266
We've got ourselves quite
the little family here, don't we?

616
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,523
Happy heart, Julius!
Happy heart, Niko!

617
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:59,112
Santa speed!
You're doing Santa speed!

618
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,056
I can't wait until next Christmas.

619
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:31,269
Me neither. Do you think Santa
will bring us another present?

620
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:35,231
Sure he will! So far,
we've been real good this year.

621
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:40,654
Let's try and be extra good
for the rest of the year! - Yeah!

622
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,489
What do you think, dear?

623
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:50,829
- I love you.
- We love you too.
