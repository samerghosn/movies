1
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,557
I don't think we're in Grandville anymore.

2
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,399
No, this is the boonies,
that's for sure...

3
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,799
What else?

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,519
They just got iicensed last week.

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,999
Married thirteen years, one chiid..

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,199
And she paints furniture...

7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,599
- For a iiving?
- I don't think so.

8
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,751
Artistic stuff, it's kind of interesting...

9
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,799
And he's an...
interior automotive systems engineer.

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,519
And skies cross-country.

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,670
Working?

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,999
Not for over a year.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,150
Figures.

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,519
Everybody thinks the DCS payments
are going to make the difference.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,874
At fifteen dollars a day.

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,355
How you doing there back there, Miss Julia?
You warm enough?

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,754
still not talking.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,157
None of that when we get there, Missy.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,399
Scott, where have you been?

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,119
- They're going to be here any minute.
- Sorry.i, ah, I had an accident.

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,999
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,399
I, I broke a binding.

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,519
Scott, I really wish you'd take it easy.

24
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,119
- You gotta stop beating yourself up.
- I'm not beating myself up, okay?

25
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,119
You will find something.

26
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,680
The Lord always provides.

27
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,270
Right.

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,071
Jesus Saves at the Bank of Grand Rapids.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,759
Except they're all out of work too.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,075
Well, what do you think?

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,999
Patti, this place has been immacuiate
ever since the first time they came.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,999
Yeah, well that was just an inspection.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,399
This is... it's permanent.

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,719
It's not permanent.

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,919
- You know what I mean.
- It's for a few months.

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,719
Six at the most.

37
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,074
It's a trial, honey.

38
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,277
Scott, we want to do this.

39
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,674
You want to do this.

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,159
We need to do this.

41
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,351
Hi. I'm Patti.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,399
- This is my husband Scott.
- Tamara Williams.

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,360
Hank VanEe, he's new with the agency.
I'm breaking him in.

44
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,271
Get out of the car, please, Julia.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,719
Are you not hearing me, young iady?

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,756
It's okay.

47
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
We'll get to know each other.

48
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:55,674
Please don't coddie her, Mrs. Cooper.
It's not good for either of you.

49
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,274
You know what, I'll get those.
Honey, why don't you get the door?

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,519
<i>"What is real?" asked the Rabbit one day,</i>

51
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,719
<i>when they were lying side</i>
<i>by side near the nursery fender,</i>

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,319
<i>before Nana came to tidy the room.</i>

53
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,399
<i>Does it mean having things that</i>
<i>buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?</i>

54
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,599
<i>"Real isn't how you are made,"</i>
<i>said the Skin Horse.</i>

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,199
<i>It's a thing that happens to you.</i>

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,999
<i>When a child loves you for a long,</i>
<i>long time, not just to play with,</i>

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,719
<i>but REALLY loves you,</i>
<i>then you become Real...</i>

58
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,234
<i>Does it hurt?, asked the rabbit?...</i>

59
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
And there's just one other chiid?

60
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,599
Yes, Billy.

61
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,919
He should be home any minute.

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,480
They're out eariy today
for Christmas vacation.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,799
We wanted more...
i just had some internai problems...

64
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,599
I don't... think they need
to hear the gory detalls, Patti...

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,199
That's why we're interested in fostering.

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,919
- And adopting.
- Possibiy.

67
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,199
- Possibiy adopting.
- Of course.

68
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,519
This is just a triai run.

69
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,199
Well, you'll have your hands full
with this one, I'm afraid.

70
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,799
Yes.
You were, ah, saying about the mother?

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,919
Fairiy typicai.

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,199
Drug possession. Soiicitation.

73
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,599
- Negiigence, of course.
- I see...

74
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,719
Every time she would get her chiid back,
she would move.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,599
Then when she gets in trouble,
she ioses custody of the chiid.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,150
This is Julia's third foster
home in the past six months.

77
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,079
Are you sure you're ready for this?

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,599
Hey, Mom? Fred Bentiey threw my math
book in the siush so I siugged him, alright?

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,159
Hey, hot chocoiate!

80
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,920
Oops.

81
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,799
Billy, this is Ms. Williams
and Mr. VanEe, from Heiping Hands?

82
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,519
They brought Julia,
the little girl we told you about, remember?

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,719
Right, cool. Can I have some hot chocolate?

84
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,552
Yes, you may.

85
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,156
Manners?

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,799
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you...

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
- William...
- May I bring anyone anything?

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,199
Okay, Billy, you know what, ah, were fine.

89
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,319
Why don't you introduce yourself to Julia
and see if she needs anything.

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,674
Okey dokey...

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,073
Ha-hey. I'm Billy.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,554
Hei-ioooow!

93
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,199
Dad told me you might be a little weird.

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,350
At first.

95
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,199
You got hot chocoiate.

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,759
You got TV.

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
You want some graham crackers?

98
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,319
Alright, well, I'm out of here.

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,357
Dib's on the TV when that's over.

100
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
She has three dollars
and some change in her pocket.

101
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,519
We like to send them out
with a little spendin money.

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,549
I'd go sparingiy with that video,
she'd watch it all day if you give her the chance.

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,519
Ms. Williams, one more question...

104
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,119
if she...
when she does start talking...

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,519
what should she call us?

106
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,919
Personally, I recommend Mister and Mrs.

107
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,599
It teaches respect.

108
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,599
After all,
she's only going to be here a few months.

109
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,599
Whatever Julia's comfortable with, I guess.

110
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,599
No, Mrs. Cooper,
whatever you're comfortable with.

111
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,354
- You're the parents, remember?
- Of course.

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,470
Well?

113
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,199
Hey, Mom, can I play some video games?

114
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,599
Yeah, sure, as soon as
Julia's done watching her video.

115
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,354
She is done. But she won't move.

116
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,270
And...

117
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,080
...your sweaters are all
in the bottom drawer with your jeans.

118
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,159
And I even saved the plastic bags
that your clothes came in. Okay?

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,319
Oh, dear.

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
Maybe you wanted to put things
away yourself.

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,554
Did you want to do that?

122
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,276
Julia,

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,999
I want you to know,
that's it's okay if you don't want to talk.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,519
It must be hard moving into a new house
and having a new family.

125
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,471
But you are part of our family,
as long as you're here.

126
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,549
Is that alright?

127
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,876
Come on.

128
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,919
Just think,
it's only one more day until Christmas.

129
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,999
And tomorrow
we'll go to Uncle Chip's new house,

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,919
and you'll get to meet Johnny,
and Rebecca, who's just about your age.

131
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,479
And they're really nice.

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,675
Good night, sweetheart.

133
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,752
Just give us a chance, okay?

134
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,271
So, what do you think?

135
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,599
Well, there's something here
with Johnson & Bower.

136
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,119
They're doing controi paneis
for soiar eiectric now.

137
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,919
I think I should call them.

138
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,071
I mean about Julia.

139
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,271
Well, ah, I don't know, I mean how long
is this... not-talking thing going to last?

140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,671
Let's just give some time, okay?

141
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,152
That's why we're here.

142
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,119
Scott, I know why you're doing this.

143
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,271
And it's not just for the money.

144
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,156
I love you.

145
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,399
- So let me in...
- No!...

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,319
- Why not?
- Because the brat's still up, that's why...

147
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
Come on, baby.

148
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,799
Come back in fifteen minutes...
And bring the stuff!

149
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,760
- alright.
- Go!

150
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,152
I told you to sleep in the tub tonight.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
I wanted to see you.

152
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,759
Did you eat like I said?

153
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,354
There wasn't anything.

154
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,319
There's cereal.

155
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,519
There's no miik.

156
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,477
Oh, Jesus...

157
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,319
- What's this?
- The motei iady gave it to me.

158
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
- I can change it.
- No.

159
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:39,719
No, it's nice.

160
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,679
It's like the music
they had when you were born...

161
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,670
Pam!

162
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,999
Pam, I got it.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,599
- Pamela...
- Mom?

164
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,399
- Mom
- Pam, I got it, open up.

165
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,278
- Mom, wake up!
- Pamela.

166
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,917
<i>There was once a velveteen rabbit,</i>

167
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,791
Don't play these games with me, baby.

168
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,799
<i>And in the beginning he was really splendid.</i>

169
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,473
Pamela, open the damn door!

170
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,835
<i>He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be;</i>

171
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,274
Damn it, Pam, open the door...

172
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,510
<i>his coat was spotted brown and white,</i>

173
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,072
<i>he had real thread whiskers, and</i>
<i>his ears were lined with pink sateen...</i>

174
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,873
I can't believe they're still building out here...

175
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,199
Somebody's got money.

176
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,919
Chip said they got
a really great deal on the house.

177
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,719
The developer
was practically giving them away.

178
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,599
Nine hundred thousand dollars
is giving them away.

179
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,556
Imagine that.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,199
Good lord.

181
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,999
It is big, isn't it?

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,719
All this for four people?

183
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,919
Well, they like to entertain, Scott.

184
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,674
Well, who are they entertaining,
Donald Trump?

185
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,556
Scott, just try to be happy for them, okay?

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,159
Tis the season?

187
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,919
- Hey!
- Ha, ha, duck, you sucker!

188
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,599
- No fair, I'm on your side!
- I got the new Mario Kart!

189
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,750
No way!

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,471
Welcome, welcome,
welcome to our little cabin in the woods.

191
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,676
Merry Christmas!

192
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,356
Merry Christmas!

193
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,319
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Scott.

194
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,276
Chip...

195
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,199
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's something, isn't it?

196
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,319
I'm sorry it's such a mess,
we're still unpacking.

197
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Right...

198
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,880
And is this the magical Julia?

199
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,152
Rebecca, say hi to Julia.

200
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,199
She's still a little shy.

201
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,352
There they are... Merry Christmas,

202
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,599
- Merry Christmas.
- Where's Dad?

203
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,160
I think he ended up in the solarium.

204
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,751
- The what?
- Hi.

205
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,119
Okay, guys, enough.

206
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,158
Now Bill, no.. come on.

207
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,319
- Everyone?
- Chip, do you want to...?

208
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,073
You go ahead, sis, it's all yours.

209
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,999
Lord, we thank You for Your bounty
and Your abundant blessings.

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,119
We're grateful to be in your service

211
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,149
and we ask You to help us
welcome our friend Julia into ourliives.

212
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,557
- Amen.
- Amen.

213
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,558
Alright, pass the potatoes,
I'm going to start right on the potatoes...

214
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,871
I do have cookies here
if anyone needs a snack...

215
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,399
And now for the moment
you've all been waiting for...

216
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,519
- Yeah!
- Presents!

217
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,719
Chip, Christmas morning isn't 
until tomorrow.

218
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,199
Yes, but our plane leaves at 7 AM
and Santa here will not be denied.

219
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,799
No I will not.

220
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,519
- Mom?
- Imagine!

221
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,119
Flying to Mexico on Christmas Day!

222
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,759
still seems odd to me.

223
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,271
- Pop, I think that ones for you.
- Thank you.

224
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,999
- No way!
- Yeah, guns!

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,119
- Guns?
- BB guns.

226
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,119
It's okay. We talked.

227
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,719
I think they're old enough.

228
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Oop, you know what?

229
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:38,719
I think there's one other present
over here for you too, young lady.

230
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,758
Oh, did you hear that, Julia,
there's a present for you too.

231
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,599
Come on, Julia.

232
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,159
Don't you want to open it?

233
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,356
Here...

234
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,077
oh... my... goodness...

235
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,554
- Can you believe this, Julia?
- Chip...

236
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,319
- it's amazing, where on earth did you find it?
- What are you doing?

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,999
If she doesn't like it, just exchange it.

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,399
Come on, what did that cost,
two hundred, three hundred dollars?

239
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
I can't compete with that.

240
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,519
Scott, it's Christmas,
no one's competing with anyone.

241
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,919
We just wanted to welcome her to the family.

242
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
Yeah, and what am
I supposed to get her now, huh, a pony?

243
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,870
Her own car?...

244
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,557
Look, Julia, isn't she beautifui?

245
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,519
Come here.

246
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,874
Come on!

247
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,675
Look at her!

248
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,672
And look at her hair,
it's just like the real thing.

249
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,759
Come on, touch it.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,150
It's okay.

251
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,070
Julia!

252
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,556
Julia!

253
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,269
Julia! Julia, stop!

254
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,676
Julia.

255
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,550
Come on.

256
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,150
It's okay...

257
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,919
What? You're not leaving already?

258
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,919
No, she just... wanted to put her things on.

259
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,199
Why? Is she cold?

260
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,719
I think she's just more comfortable like that.

261
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,119
Do you need any help in there?

262
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,519
Oh, no, no, it's alright,
I'm used to doing them by myself.

263
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,352
Been doing it for forty years.

264
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,399
Look, I'm sorry I lost it in there.

265
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,153
I appreciate you thinking of her.

266
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,876
No sweat, bro.

267
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,754
Hey, how's the job thing going?

268
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,270
Could be better.

269
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,799
Steelcase is laying off 
another fifty people.

270
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,199
I thought they just did.

271
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,680
Second time in a month.

272
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,080
- Wow.
- Yeah. It's bad.

273
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,719
You know, ah... my offer still stands.

274
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,319
Chip... look, I, ah, I appreciate it, okay.

275
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,119
But... I'm an engineer.

276
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,119
You know, I don't know 
the first thing about mortgages.

277
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,599
You don't have to.

278
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,199
- We give you a list.
- Chip...

279
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,199
people who are behind on their payments.

280
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,119
You ask them like three questions.

281
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,199
When they find out they can refinance at like,
forty percent less than what they're paying now,

282
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,351
they fall all over themselves just to sign up.

283
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,470
Look.

284
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,075
You need a gig.

285
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,999
- You're clearly stressed, Patti is stressed...
- I can take care of my own family, Chip.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,070
Really? How?

287
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,799
By taking in other people's mixed-up kids?

288
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,756
You know what?

289
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,279
Just stay out of it, okay?
Just leave us alone.

290
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,799
Daddy! Uncle Scott!
Come quick!

291
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,399
Johnny and Billy shot the Easter Bunny!

292
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,799
Oh, good grief, what now...

293
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,319
Daddy! Come on!

294
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,399
Honey, what is it?

295
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,519
Johnny and Billy shot a bunny!

296
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,199
- Oh, no...
- What's going on, Billy?

297
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,271
Dad. I think you better come.

298
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,799
Then we got tired of 
shooting paper cups and,

299
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,319
and Johnny said he knew
where some squirrels were

300
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,999
and then we came back here
and then we didn't find any,

301
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,919
then we saw it and...

302
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,559
It's not going to die, is it?

303
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,080
Is it going to be okay?

304
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,719
I don't, ah, I don't know.

305
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,799
I don't, I don't think it's too bad,
I just think it's in shock.

306
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,919
I don't want the Easter Bunny to die...

307
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,319
Oh, oh honey, it's not going to die.

308
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,719
Daddy and Uncle Scott
are going to take good care of it. Okay?

309
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,119
Okay...

310
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,759
Come on, let's go in the house.

311
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,399
Chip, ah, have you got a box,

312
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,474
ah, of some kind,
maybe some old toweis or something,

313
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,314
- I don't think we should handle it too much.
- Yeah, you got it.

314
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,356
Yeah...

315
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,399
I want you two back in the house.

316
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,799
Take the guns with you.

317
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,399
Put them back in the boxes
and put the boxes in Uncle Chip's office.

318
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
And wait for me.

319
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,199
- Now.
- Okay, Uncle Scott.

320
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,350
Yes, sir...

321
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,999
- The poor thing.
- It's probably somebody's lost pet.

322
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,560
We don't have wild rabbits
like this in Michigan.

323
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,070
Should I call a vet?

324
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,999
Well, I don't know, it's Christmas Eve.

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,119
You could, ah, you could try.

326
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,156
Okay.

327
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,519
Scott, I catted Candy Reintges

328
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,599
and she wants to know
if we could drive All the way to Lansing.

329
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,671
Yeah, just a sec, I'll be right there.

330
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,554
Can you stay with it, Julia?

331
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,677
alright, don't touch it, okay,
just stay beside it, can you do that?

332
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,556
Okay.

333
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,354
You came back.

334
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,919
- Just have him call us as soon as he can.
- Later...

335
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,599
Are you sure you guys
are okay taking care of this?

336
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,719
Yeah, it's not a problem,
just, you know, enjoy your vacation.

337
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,199
We'll put a notice up at the market
on the way to the airport.

338
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,874
I'm sure somebody'll claim it.

339
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,879
That can only be good, right?

340
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,119
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

341
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,999
When do you think
we can get the BB guns back?

342
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,119
I don't know, Bill.

343
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,199
When do you think you should get them back?

344
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,669
Like, when we're, like, twenty?

345
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,554
That sounds about right...

346
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,799
Kay, kids, go put your pajamas on,

347
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,399
Dad's going to build a fire and
we'll read Christmas stories before bed.

348
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,599
Hey, ah, Mom, can we watch
The Nightmare Before Christmas?

349
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,672
No, we cannot. We are going to read.

350
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,277
Honey, please go put your pajamas on
and then you can sit with the bunny, okay?

351
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,276
Julia.

352
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,151
Please, go your pajamas on.

353
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,156
Julia.

354
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,550
What do I do?

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,319
Julia, if you want to be with the bunny,
you've gotta get your pajamas on.

356
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,472
Otherwise I'm going to put it in our room.

357
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,554
Do you understand?

358
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,270
Thank you.

359
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,549
I'll get the wood.

360
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,919
...it was always said of him,
that he knew how to keep Christmas well,

361
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,719
if any man Alive possessed the knowledge.

362
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,799
May that be truly said of us,
and all of us!

363
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:40,070
And so, as Tiny Tim observed,
God Bless Us, Every one!

364
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,473
- Okay?
- Okay.

365
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,151
Come on, William, bedtime.

366
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,359
Santa here yet?

367
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,319
He's on the roof.

368
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,399
He's waiting for you to go to bed.

369
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,550
Okay...

370
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,156
Good night, kiddo.

371
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,154
That's your cell phone.

372
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,356
Hello?...

373
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,671
Doctor, thank you so much for catting...

374
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,199
Yes, yes, we found him in the woods.

375
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,399
Well, we think it's leg might be broken...

376
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,719
Yes... No, no, we'll be there...

377
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,758
- 10 A.M.
- Okay, okay...

378
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,553
Merry Christmas to you, too.

379
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,276
Okay. Bye.

380
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,799
I didn't get to open one present!

381
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,156
They'll all be there when we get back.

382
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,874
Hey. I wanna see.

383
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,119
- You know, you don't share very well.
- Billy...

384
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,679
Well, she doesn't.

385
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,119
Well, it's fractured all right.

386
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,199
You can see the tibia,
right there, just above the joint.

387
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,799
Now it looks like the BB fell
out on it's own, so that's good.

388
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,199
And it's still not eating.

389
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,399
No, we tried everything-appies, nuts, carrots.

390
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,119
And no stools or urine?

391
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,319
Well, you've got a few options...

392
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,399
Ah, we might want to talk on our own,
just the three of us.

393
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,799
O- kay.

394
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,119
Uhm, kids, I need you to go out
into the waiting room for just a minute.

395
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,519
Oh, brother.
What are you going to do, put it to sleep?

396
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,119
Absolutely not. We would never do that.

397
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,271
- Whatever...
- Go.

398
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,119
Julia, honey, you need to go with Billy

399
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,719
or you won't be able to ride
with the bunny on the way home.

400
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,870
I mean it.

401
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,876
Good job.

402
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,319
Basically, you've got three options.

403
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,119
We can try to splint it.

404
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,670
Now given where the bone is broken,
that's not going to be completely reliable.

405
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,519
Two: we can go in and operate.

406
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,919
We'll basically go in and use pins
or a plate to hold the bones in place.

407
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,319
Now that is the best solution.

408
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,119
But that is also the most expensive.

409
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,919
And, ah, number three?

410
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,072
Well, it doesn't sound like
number three is a possibility.

411
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,272
No way. It would break her heart.

412
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,519
How much is the surgery?

413
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,319
Well, it generally runs between
eight hundred and a thousand dollars,

414
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,999
depending on what we find when we go in.

415
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,519
You've got to be kidding me, ah...

416
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,319
Now if we splint it,
you're looking at about five hundred.

417
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,199
- This is, this is crazy, honey.
- Scott...

418
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,159
No, it's insane.
I mean, it's out of the question.

419
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,319
Is there nothing else you can do?

420
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,199
Well, you can wait and see
if the bone mends on it's own.

421
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,199
But then you've still got
the problem of why it's not eating.

422
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,599
Now I will be honest with you,
we do not see a lot of rabbits in here.

423
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,119
They are actually considered an exotic pet.

424
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,119
But there is this woman
out on Conservation Road.

425
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,599
Now, I don't know her phone number.

426
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,876
In fact, I don't even know 
if she's got a phone.

427
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,999
Her name is Betsy Ross, believe it or not.

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,319
But everybody just calls her
"The Bunny Lady".

429
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,319
Wait, does she have an old sign
in front of her place, just says "Rabbits"?

430
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,470
That's it.

431
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,000
You know her?

432
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,999
Remember, I told you about this,

433
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,719
her house was on Billy's school bus
route in elementary.

434
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,919
We stopped by there when he was
setting magazines for Cub Scouts?

435
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,519
Oh, right...

436
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,599
She practically ran us
off her property with a pitchfork.

437
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,919
I mean, she's, she's nuts.

438
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,599
Yeah, Betsy can be a little eccentric.

439
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,799
But, ah, she knows more about rabbits
than anybody I know.

440
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,319
If you really want to know
what's going on with this little guy,

441
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,674
you might want to talk to her.

442
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,719
5680 Conservation Road
Grandville, Michigan

443
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,199
Well, I, ah, I know it's probably more
since it's a holiday...

444
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,199
Nope, no. No charge. Not today.

445
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,680
My wife would kill me.

446
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,270
Merry Christmas.

447
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,799
Bless you. Thank you so much.

448
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,756
Thanks.

449
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,355
William Scott Cooper, put those down, now.

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,676
Julia, if you want to carry
the rabbit you need to let me know.

451
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,875
Julia.

452
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,680
Do you want to carry the rabbit?

453
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,756
Okay.

454
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,154
That's good enough for now.

455
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,399
Okay, guys, let's go.

456
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,472
Looks like Peter Cottontall
is coming home with us.

457
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,678
His name is Rumpie.

458
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,719
Come on, she's not going to bite.

459
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,359
That's what you think...

460
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,670
Come on, Julia.

461
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,799
I don't hear anything.

462
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,759
It's probably broken,
like everything else from the looks of it.

463
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,556
Don't want any!

464
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,199
Ah, ma'm, we're, ah,
were not setting anything.

465
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,119
Uhm, Dr. DeVos sent us,
we have a sick rabbit.

466
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,351
We'd like your advice, if you'd be so kind.

467
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,874
Mrs. Ross?

468
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,076
- This is pointless. Let's go.
- No...

469
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,919
Ross, we have a little girl out here
that's worried sick about her rabbit

470
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,071
and we'd just very much appreciate it...

471
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,719
Whaddya do to it?

472
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,999
Well, we, ah... we didn't do anything.

473
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,199
There was an accident
and it's leg was broken but, ah...

474
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,078
I thought you said you didn't do nothin'.

475
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,719
Look. It was,
the rabbit was running wild in the woods.

476
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,799
It got shot in the leg with a BB gun.

477
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,600
But it's not eating.

478
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:29,799
The doctor said that there was
something wrong with it's digestive system.

479
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,999
You shoot him?

480
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,519
No. This is Julia, our... daughter.

481
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,276
I'm Patti Cooper, this is my husband Scott,
and we'd just really like your help.

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,150
Got any money?

483
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,477
- Well, yeah, I guess, if that's what it's going..
- Not you.

484
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,359
- Her.
- Okay, now look here, Mrs. Ross, just...

485
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,474
How much you got?

486
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,752
That oughta cover it.

487
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,875
- So...
- Wait, just...

488
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,879
Hey! Mrs.Ross!

489
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,919
Mrs.Ross?

490
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,355
Oh, man, this broad is completely whacko.

491
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,119
- Mrs. Ross!
- Next Tuesday!

492
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,719
Tuesday?
You want us to come back next Tuesday?

493
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,799
Honey, that's like a week from now.

494
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,280
Well, what'll we do?

495
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,756
I don't know.

496
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,473
What do you think we should do, Julia?

497
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,559
I guess we're coming back on Tuesday.

498
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,999
...so, you want to make the angle sharp
enough that you get air,

499
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,319
but not so sharp that you fiip at the bottom.

500
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,880
But I like to fiip at the bottom...

501
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,199
<i>The Rabbit sighed.</i>

502
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,719
<i>He thought it would be a long time</i>
<i>before this magic called real happened to him.</i>

503
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,199
<i>He longed to become real,</i>
<i>to know what it felt like...</i>

504
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,119
<i>...And yet the idea of becoming shabby and</i>
<i>losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad.</i>

505
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,353
<i>He wished that he could become it without</i>
<i>these uncomfortable things happening to him...</i>

506
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,354
What's the matter, honey?

507
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,680
Are you thinking about Rumpie?

508
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,399
Well, it's only three more days.

509
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,155
School starts on Monday,
and the day after you we go back.

510
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,919
Come with me.

511
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,876
Upstairs.

512
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,879
I'm going to show you something.

513
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,670
Okay.

514
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,874
You see out there, past those trees?

515
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,035
That's where the Bunny Ladyliives.

516
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,999
So whenever you're worried about Rumpie,

517
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,319
you can look out there and
know that he's safe

518
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,349
and warm and he's waiting for you too.
Okay?

519
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,319
Honey, you have to put that down
to get your hand through the sieeve.

520
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,119
- alright, we all set, everyone?
- Yes.

521
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,599
Just make sure that her teacher knows
that she's taking the bus home.

522
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,719
I know, honey, I know...

523
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,519
Kay. Where's your interview?

524
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,719
The Foremost Center.

525
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,199
I looked up their stock.

526
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,919
It's up 15% in the last month.

527
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,877
- Oh, Scott...
- I know.

528
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,399
Okay, gang. Let's go conquer the world.

529
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,356
Bye.

530
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,799
All right, Julia.
This is your bus. Number 305.

531
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,319
Can you remember that?

532
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,519
It's 305.

533
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,480
And your Mom will be waiting for you
at your stop, so you just watch for her, okay?

534
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,555
alright, 305, let's go...

535
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,870
Hey!

536
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,119
I know you.

537
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,873
You're the little girl
that shot her rabbit.

538
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,999
What?

539
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,754
You're not the little girl or
you didn't shoot your rabbit?

540
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,071
I thought I told you to come back Tuesday.

541
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,073
Patience is a virtue, you know.

542
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,556
You're not much of a talker, are you?

543
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,477
alright. Come on.

544
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,399
He was all plugged up.

545
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,519
Somebody fed him a bunch of junk.

546
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,557
Candy, bread.

547
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,156
You?

548
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,719
Well somebody did.

549
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,319
Now, rabbits have to have hay every day,
otherwise they can't digest their food.

550
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,549
Did you know that?

551
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,078
No, I didn't think so.

552
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,072
My guess is you hardly know
anything about rabbits at all, do you?

553
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,470
Well, if you're going to have a pet,
you need to learn how to take care of it.

554
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,759
You ready to do that?

555
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,271
alright. If you learn,
I might let you have him back.

556
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,274
Now, where are your parents?
Do they know you're here?

557
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,271
I guess I gotta drive you home now, too.

558
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,071
Well, I hope you know
where youliive at least...

559
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,557
All right. Come on...

560
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,399
You may have put her on the bus,
Miss McPherson,

561
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,551
but she was not on it 
when it got to our stop...

562
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,671
Yes, I checked every seat...

563
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,671
Well, she has to be somewhere...

564
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,755
Wait, somebody's here.
I'll call you back...

565
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,399
Mrs. Ross! What...

566
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,999
She wanted to see the animal.

567
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,275
She what?

568
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,919
Julia, did you get off the bus
at Mrs. Ross's house?

569
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,719
I told her not to do that no more.

570
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,999
- Not without permission.
- Thank you.

571
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,550
Julia, please go inside the house 
right now.

572
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,919
Thank you so much, I am so sorry
to put you to all this trouble...

573
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,719
- She gonna keep it?
- What?

574
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,319
- The animal.
- Well, yes. I guess so.

575
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,199
I mean, as long as nobody else claims it.

576
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,919
Well, she's gotta learn
how to take care of it.

577
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,999
Yes, of course.

578
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,519
We'll make sure that she does.

579
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,119
Did you... bring it with you?

580
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,599
She can come by my house after school,
get off the bus, like she did today.

581
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,919
There's another bus
that comes by at 5 o'clock.

582
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,719
- Well, yes, but..
- I'll teach her, she can get back on the bus.

583
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,719
Look, she can't have a rabbit
if she don't know how to take care of it.

584
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,870
That's that.

585
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,119
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

586
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,799
What, she's going to hold the rabbit hostage
unless Julia goes to Bunny School?

587
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,077
Julia wants to do it. She told me so.

588
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,271
- She spoke again?
- Yes.

589
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,154
I think we should let her.

590
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,799
I'll go with her next time,
make sure everything's okay,

591
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,399
but, Scott,
that little bunny is opening her up,

592
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,599
and if Mrs. Ross
can help her make a connection...

593
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,919
okay, okay.
Whatever, whatever you think...

594
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,919
- okay.
- Okay.

595
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,355
- So?
- So?

596
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,673
The interview? How'd it go?

597
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,153
They want me to come back next week.

598
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,399
The V.P. of Engineering
is flying in from Dallas.

599
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,999
Scott, that's wonderful.

600
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,199
It pays eighty thousand dollars a year,
with benefits,

601
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,350
and...

602
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,919
...stocks up another four bucks today.

603
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,999
- Oh, Scott!
- It's just a second interview, okay?

604
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,356
It's not a job. Not yet.

605
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,756
Oh, yes!

606
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,399
Oh my goodness...

607
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,799
Mrs. Ross, may I ask you?
Where did they all come from?

608
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,719
- Kids.
- Kids?

609
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,919
Yeah, yeah, they get'em for presents,
birthdays, Easter.

610
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,799
Then they get bored of 'em and
they don't want to be bothered anymore.

611
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,919
Neither do the parents.

612
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,799
You take care of them all yourself?

613
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,799
I used to have a helper.

614
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,870
No more.

615
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,153
Never helped that much anyway.

616
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,599
Goodness, how many are there?

617
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,671
Enough to keep me busy, I guess.

618
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,599
...only Timothy.

619
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,199
That or oat, brome, maybe Bermuda.

620
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,319
No alfalfa.

621
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,551
Clover neither. Makes 'em fat.

622
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,399
No alfalfa.

623
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,319
What about rabbit pellets?

624
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,919
The pet store said that
the pellets provide all the nutrients that...

625
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,919
Pellets! Ha, waste of money.

626
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,599
Just another way for
the feed companies to rob you blind.

627
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,557
Oh, pellets! Puh!

628
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,799
Hey. You.

629
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,759
Are you listening? This is your animal.

630
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,399
What's that it's eating?

631
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,119
Oh. Oh, thems cecotropes.

632
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,399
Their first droppings.

633
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,199
Rabbits can't digest everything
in their food first time through,

634
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,079
so they, ah, they eat 'em again.

635
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,119
- Ceco...?
- Cecotropes.

636
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,875
Yeah. My helper used to 
catted them... poopsicies.

637
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,679
Good night, Rumpie.

638
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,399
You been here long enough...

639
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,471
It's time to meet the special ones.

640
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,156
Now.

641
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,599
Over here?

642
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,399
This here's old Fred.

643
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,519
Fred is eighteen years old.

644
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,719
You know Fred is the oldest rabbit
in the state of Michigan?

645
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,474
Probabiy in the whole USA.

646
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,599
Sounds like he's purring, don't it?

647
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,557
That's his teeth rubbing together.

648
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,399
Did you know that rabbits'
teeth never stop growing?

649
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,474
Yeah, that's why they always have to have
something to chew on, to wear 'em down.

650
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,160
Over here, over here is Gabby...

651
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,799
Yeah, Gabby's back legs don't work.

652
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,399
Somebody dropped her off one night,
at my back door.

653
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,999
I guess they thought
I'd put her out of her misery.

654
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,473
Well, three years later,
still going strong.

655
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,553
See these little guys over here?

656
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,799
They just love to lay all over her at night.

657
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,157
Yep. I guess cause she can't go nowhere.

658
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,799
You know, everything has a purpose.

659
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,558
Even things that seem too broke down
or too hurt to do anybody any good.

660
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,353
Well. That goes for people, too.

661
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,151
Come on. We got work to do.

662
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,919
Hey.
Are you paying attention to where you are?

663
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,999
What if I dropped dead right here?

664
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,559
How you gonna get back?

665
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,399
You can lost in a Michigan woods faster
than green grass through a goose.

666
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,319
Happened to me once, right up near ionia.

667
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,599
Yeah, me and my Dad,
we were out pickin' wild blueberries.

668
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,919
Whew. I wasn't much older than you,
I guess.

669
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,799
We found a big blueberry patch,
and then another one, and then one more.

670
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,999
Finally, my bag was full.

671
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,152
Well, I looked up, and my dad was gone.

672
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,478
Well I yeiied and I yeiied,
but he wasn't anywhere.

673
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,270
See this here?

674
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,999
This here's ida Red.

675
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,719
The books'll teii you to get Jonathan,
but the rabbits like these better.

676
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,680
Here. I'll cut, you hold the sack.

677
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,877
I must have wandered in circies
for hours and hours.

678
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,199
You know what I finally did?

679
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,519
I looked around and I found the tallest tree, 
and I, I started ciimbing.

680
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,199
Maybe thirty or forty feet.

681
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,271
Scared the pants off me.

682
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,319
Well, I got to the top
and I looked out way in the distance,

683
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,119
and there was the top of
the ionia Methodist Church.

684
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,799
Well, I climbed back down
and I started walking.

685
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,919
And there was the road.

686
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,399
A Bissell Sweeper man picked me up.

687
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,675
He catted my dad.

688
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,999
Oh, was my dad mad.

689
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,599
Yup, he whooped me good.

690
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,599
But I didn't even care.

691
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,557
I was so happy to see him.

692
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,119
Well, I guess we don't really know
how we feel about our family til,

693
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,476
til we think we're never gonna see'm again.

694
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,677
What's the matter with you?

695
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,475
Are you crying?

696
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,399
I swear, girls're always crying 
about something.

697
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,471
alright, that's enough.

698
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,080
Now, next Monday.

699
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,879
Old Freds birthday.

700
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,876
I think we ought
to do something special for him.

701
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,875
Are you gonna help me?

702
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,080
Okay, then.

703
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,670
Here's a good one...

704
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,799
- Hi.
- Hi.

705
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,119
Is Dr. DeVos in?

706
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,271
- I just wanted to speak to him for just a moment.
- Yeah.

707
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,919
- Well, hi there.
- Hi.

708
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,919
- How's your little bunny?
- Great.

709
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
Mrs. Ross has him.

710
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:12,599
And he's getting well, I think.

711
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,150
Uhm, I just wanted to thank you
for your kindness...

712
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,199
it's a business card holder.

713
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
It's great.

714
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,919
You don't have to use it,
it just reminded me of our visit.

715
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,550
No, it's perfect. It can live right here.

716
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,519
Dr. DeVos, I wanted to ask you a question.

717
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,919
Julia's been going over
to Mrs. Ross' farm almost every day now,

718
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,319
and she really seems to love it,

719
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,319
but... she is okay, isn't she?

720
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,399
I mean Mrs. Ross.

721
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,719
Living out there on that big farm,
all by herself...

722
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,719
Yeah, that's kind of a sad story.

723
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,999
Betsy lost her husband a long time ago.

724
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,119
But she had a daughter.
Her name was Sarah.

725
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,119
And she used to help Betsy around the farm,
they were pretty close.

726
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,799
And then one day apparently
they had a big argument,

727
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,599
Betsy can be a little difficult, you know,

728
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,999
and Sarah left
and she never came back.

729
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,519
She refuses to have anything
to do with her mother.

730
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,671
That was almost twenty years ago.

731
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,719
But I don't think that makes
Betsy dangerous or anything.

732
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,756
No.

733
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,319
Just lonely, I guess.

734
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,280
Yeah, I'm afraid that that's a condition
that even cute little rabbits can't cure.

735
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,719
<i>Just then Nana caught sight of him.</i>

736
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,719
<i>"How about this old Bunny?,"</i>
<i>she asked.</i>

737
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,119
<i>"That?" said the doctor.</i>

738
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,199
<i>Why it's a mass of scarlet fever germs.</i>

739
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,919
<i>Burn it at once. What?</i>

740
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,119
<i>Nonsense.Get him a new one...</i>

741
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,119
oh, man, not again.

742
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,077
alright, when are you gonna be done?

743
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,551
No, no, it's my turn for the TV, alright...

744
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,519
Mom!

745
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,751
Let her finish, please, Billy.

746
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,154
You know what?
I don't think I like you anymore.

747
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,549
It went okay.

748
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,399
- Better than okay.
- Really?

749
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,999
We hit it off pretty well.

750
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,599
He's just taken up cross-country.

751
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,319
I told him
I'd show him some traits at Berry Park.

752
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,799
Did they say when...?

753
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,760
Anytime.
They said they could decide anytime.

754
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,556
You get it.

755
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,150
Hello?...

756
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,757
Mrs. Williams, how are you?...

757
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,799
No, she's fine, she's doing just fine...

758
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,519
No, only a few words,
but we're hoping...

759
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,476
What?

760
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,756
When?...

761
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,676
Here?...

762
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,754
I'm sure that would be fine...

763
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,079
5 o'ciock... alright.

764
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,270
Thank you.

765
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,357
Julia's mother wants to see her.

766
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,199
For Pete's sake, Patti.

767
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,719
Relax.

768
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,359
She's not the Queen of England.

769
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,480
Not by a long shot.

770
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,719
Should I make coffee or tea?

771
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,155
Honey, why don't you ask her
when she gets here?

772
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,676
Scott, what if she wants Julia back?

773
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,599
Well, that's the point, isn't it?

774
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,399
I mean, that's what everybody wants, is...

775
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,919
for her mother to get her act together
so she can take care of her own daughter.

776
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,149
I guess.

777
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,676
I don't know...

778
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,319
I've really fatten in love with
that little girl, Scott,

779
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,755
and I don't know if I can give her up.

780
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,799
Hey, look.

781
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,399
It's not up to us,

782
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,551
and it's not up to her Mom,
it's up to the court.

783
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,869
It's out of our hands.

784
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,477
So... let's just leave it to...

785
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,754
your friend up there.

786
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,149
Okay?

787
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,274
Okay...

788
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,354
okay. He's your friend too, you know.

789
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,879
We'll see...

790
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,756
Julia?

791
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,870
Are you ready?

792
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,275
Honey,

793
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,279
what is all this?

794
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,159
What have you done?

795
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,880
Honey, you're not going anywhere today.
Do you understand that?

796
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,157
She's just coming to visit.

797
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,551
She's just visiting today.

798
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,077
Let me take off your coat
cause you're going to get hot. Okay?

799
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,354
It's okay...

800
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,199
Ms. Williams. It's Patti Cooper again.

801
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,759
She's still not here...

802
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,152
No, nothing...

803
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,556
I've catted her four times...

804
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,760
Well, shouldn't somebody call
the hospitals or something...

805
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,870
I see...

806
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,556
Really...

807
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,356
Thank you.

808
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,599
She's done it before. More than once.

809
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,599
Honey, this is why Julia's here.

810
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,919
Doesn't she see
what's she doing to that little girl?

811
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,880
Maybe. Or maybe she just doesn't care.

812
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:21,550
Honey, I just spoke to Ms. Williams
and apparently your Mom got...

813
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,073
caught up in some kind of work thing
and she just couldn't make it.

814
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,750
But she promised that 
as soon as she could...

815
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,199
- Hello!
- Brought her animal.

816
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,119
Thank you. Please, come in.

817
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,199
Julia! Come down here, please!

818
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,599
Mrs. Ross is here and she brought Rumpie!

819
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,199
Yeah, he's eating alright
and leg's all heated up.

820
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,271
My gosh, that's wonderful!

821
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,199
Isn't that wonderful, Julia?

822
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,399
Mrs. Ross says Rumpie's all better.
Isn't that great?

823
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,359
I left some hay outside.
And some of them branches.

824
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,751
You remember what he eats?

825
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,759
Yes, of course.

826
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,119
And don't keep him penned up all day,
neither. Here...

827
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,119
I wrote it out for you.

828
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,476
Julia? Can you thank Mrs. Ross?

829
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,157
Well. That's that, then.

830
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,199
Wait, Mrs. Ross, let me pay you something.

831
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,078
You've done so much...

832
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,119
oh my goodness.
There must be thirty pages here.

833
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,919
All hand-written.

834
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,319
It's just supposed to run loose like that?

835
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,399
That's what she says.

836
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,155
And we have to put protectors on
all the furniture and the electrical cords.

837
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,919
And they like company.
She recommends we get another rabbit.

838
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,070
You're kidding.

839
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,119
Rabbits don't like to be alone.

840
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,353
Either get you another rabbit or
play with your animal four hours a day.

841
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,477
Well, doesn't look like
that's going to be a problem...

842
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,799
<i>Spring came,</i>
<i>and they had long days in the garden,</i>

843
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,399
<i>for wherever the Boy</i>
<i>went the Rabbit went too.</i>

844
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,399
<i>He had rides in the wheelbarrow,</i>
<i>and picnics on the grass,</i>

845
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,156
<i>and lovely fairy huts built for him under</i>
<i>the raspberry canes behind the flower border.</i>

846
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,319
<i>And once, when the Boy was called</i>
<i>away suddenly to go out to tea,</i>

847
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,676
<i>the Rabbit was left out on the lawn</i>
<i>until long after dusk...</i>

848
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,070
Hello?...

849
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,519
- Hello?
- Hey!

850
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,999
- Hey, welcome back!
- Buenos dios!

851
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,719
Where's Johnny?

852
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,999
Ah, sorry about that.

853
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,999
Boys, thirty minutes outside
before any video games.

854
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,319
You know, Billy, why don't you go show
Johnny what you and your Dad made?

855
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,719
Oh, yeah, dude, you gotta see it,
it's like so rad!

856
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,199
I swear, if they don't see each other for a while,
it's like the end of the world.

857
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,399
- Hello, Rebecca.
- Hello.

858
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,319
Would you like to see the bunny?

859
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,676
I thought so. Come on...

860
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,799
Julia.

861
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,360
Rebecca's here
and she'd like to see Rumbie.

862
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,756
Julia!

863
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,749
Julia.

864
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,271
Julia, get out of the way
and let Rebecca see the rabbit.

865
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,471
Fine. Go to your room.

866
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,670
Now.

867
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,119
Oh, honey.

868
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,119
You know, I'll go make you something to drink
and I am sure he'll come out in a minute, okay?

869
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,349
Okay.

870
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,755
- I am so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

871
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,399
She still isn't talking?

872
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,999
No. Nothing.

873
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,519
And everything's about the rabbit.

874
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,072
The other day, she took it to school
with her hidden in her backpack.

875
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,750
- Oh, no.
- They had to call me to come get it...

876
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,554
Come on, I want to see your pictures.

877
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,673
We need a passenger...

878
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,073
- Get a towel.
- Got it.

879
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,071
And this is a fishing charter we went on...

880
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,075
oh, and this is a clown fish,
they come right up to you...

881
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,152
Boys, take your boots off
before you come in the house.

882
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,354
Billy?

883
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,350
Oh, no...

884
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,476
They gave it to some consultant 
from Chrysler.

885
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,119
From Detroit!
He's moving his whole damn family out here.

886
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,799
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

887
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,750
All that talk, you know, about
supporting the local economy. You know?

888
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,680
I bought right into it!

889
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,149
It was all B.S.

890
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,154
it's going to be okay.

891
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,119
- We're going to be taken care of.
- By who?

892
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,759
Huh, your "friend" up there?

893
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,480
I don't even think he knows this family exists.

894
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,519
Stupid animal...

895
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,999
Julia! I want that rabbit
back in his cage now!

896
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,753
And I want you to keep him there!

897
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,354
Nooooo!

898
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,074
- Julia!
- Do it!

899
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,156
Hey!

900
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,556
Hey! Cut it out!

901
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,473
Julia...

902
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,276
- Julia! No!!
- Julia!

903
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,552
- Owww, no, owww, owww!
- You, okay.

904
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,116
You all right?

905
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,874
This isn't working, Patti.

906
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,399
I mean, what's it going to take?

907
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,599
You know, I mean, she could hurt Billy.

908
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,719
She could seriously hurt him.
She could hurt you.

909
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,119
She's just a little girl.

910
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,919
She's a disturbed little girl.

911
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,999
- And we can help her.
- She needs professional help, honey.

912
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,599
Full-time professional help.
She's not ready for a family.

913
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,919
Yes, she is.

914
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,071
She's already made a connection.

915
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,119
- The rabbit.
- Oh, for Petes sakes,

916
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,119
don't get me started on the rabbit!

917
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,119
I mean, he's what caused
this whole problem in the first place!

918
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,199
The whole flasco with the rabbit.

919
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,919
I mean, come on, no,
Billy wouldn't have reacted like if she didn't..

920
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,799
I mean we talked about adoption,
we didn't talk about a pet, this is way too much.

921
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,519
It's not her fault that
two little boys want to go

922
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,599
and take her rabbit outdoors, 
that was nuts!

923
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,119
All I can say is she doesn't say
a word the entire time,

924
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,120
we don't know what to think,

925
01:11:12,121 --> 01:11:13,799
we hear her screaming and
she's going for the rabbit...

926
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,919
Well I would have screamed too
if I say my little brother taking my animal

927
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,199
- and throwing it down...
- She's a wild animal.

928
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,919
- Did you not see what happened, did you not
- I don't know, right now

929
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,319
I think that what the heck was going on?

930
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,399
I mean it's caused nothing but problems
ever since she got it.

931
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,999
It's always underfoot,
it ruined your new chair.

932
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,277
It's got to go, Patti.
I'm sorry. They both do.

933
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,079
We've got problems we cannot handle,
we are not prepared...

934
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,277
Kids! Time to get up!

935
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,876
Julia?

936
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,070
You awake?

937
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,280
She's nine...

938
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,199
- I don't know. How tall is she, Scott?
- She about four-foot five.

939
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,554
Four-foot-five...

940
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,559
She's wearing a pink parka...

941
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,551
alright. Thank you.

942
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,319
- They want us to wait.
- You wait. I'm going to check the fields.

943
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,399
- Why would she go there?
- Honey, why would she go anywhere?

944
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,799
She's got the rabbit with her, maybe she thinks
they're going to live happily ever somewhere.

945
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,678
- I'll be on the cell.
- Scott.

946
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,878
Do you think she heard us last night?

947
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,076
You don't mean us. You mean me...

948
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,799
Yeah. There's tracks back here.

949
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,359
I think she went into the woods.

950
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,719
Well, we're looking for a little girl.

951
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,719
Discovered missing at 7 AM this morning.

952
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,519
So she doesn't speak at all.

953
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,799
Almost never.

954
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,350
So I don't even know
if she'll answer even if she does hear you.

955
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,119
She's also carrying 
a bunny rabbit with her.

956
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,799
- A real rabbit?
- A real rabbit, that's what I understand.

957
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,871
Seek. Seek.

958
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,319
Look sir, I really think you should
let me take a look. Mr. Cooper, please.

959
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,319
We follow very specific procedures.
Just relax.

960
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,470
We know what were doing.

961
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,759
Thanks for catting us. Any luck?

962
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,551
No. Nothing.

963
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,199
- Has anyone told her mother yet?
- Probably not.

964
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,519
Well, don't you think somebody should?

965
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,919
Honestly, I don't think it matters.

966
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,919
She was arrested again yesterday.

967
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,319
Oh no.

968
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,519
Drugs again. Sales this time.

969
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,719
She'll probably draw a sentence,

970
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,199
but as far as Julia's concerned,
it may not make much difference.

971
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,120
What do you mean?

972
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:12,719
Tamara had a long talk with
her after the arrest.

973
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,359
She's giving up her parental rights.

974
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,874
Julia!

975
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,074
Julia!

976
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,754
Do you want to get down?

977
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,875
Are you hungry?

978
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,599
- Did you get it?
- It's going to be really bad, sir,

979
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,119
we got a weather front moving in and
it's going to be at least minus ten by midnight.

980
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,119
Sunsets at six-fifteen.

981
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,351
- So we got about an hour left, right?
- Right.

982
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,399
<i>The approaching storm front has already</i>
<i>reached the western edge of Kent County,</i>

983
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,119
<i>bringing intense flurries,</i>

984
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,799
<i>and temperatures</i>
<i>that will dip well below zero...</i>

985
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,799

986
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,999

991
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,071

992
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,475
Julia!

993
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,474
Julia!

994
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,750
Julia!

995
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:53,150
Look. I, ah, probably don't deserve for you to,
ah, even listen to me anymore.

996
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,472
But, um, just let us find her.

997
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,556
Please.

998
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,074
Everything else, we can do on our own.

999
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,559
Please.

1000
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,999
<i>Highway 31 is closed</i>
<i>from Port Shelton Street north...</i>

1001
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,151
okay, gather in. Bring it in.

1002
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,199
Okay, we're going to be switching
to night search techniques.

1003
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,799
That means smaller grids,

1004
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,158
and I want situation reports
from every team every five minutes.

1005
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,751
I have an idea where she, she might be.

1006
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,999
<i>All units, this is Search Command.</i>

1007
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,199
<i>Is anyone familiar with</i>
<i>a location known as Crissmans Oak?</i>

1008
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,119
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>is anyone familiar with Crissmans Oak?</i>

1009

1010
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,070
Julia.

1011
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,919
Come on, Julia, wake up, honey.

1012
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,920
Oh, honey.

1013
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:42,519
I couldn't climb it.

1014
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,799
- It's okay. It's okay, honey, I got you.
- Rumpie...

1015
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,399
Rumpie's safe, honey.

1016
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,519
And so are you, baby.

1017
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,799
So are you. I got you.

1018
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,359
I got you, honey.

1019
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,276
All right.

1020
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,719
- We just heard...
- It's okay. We found her.

1021
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,319
She's, she's okay.

1022
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,199
Thank God.

1023
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,270
Exactly.

1024
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,272
- How's Patti doing?
- She's with her. She's fine.

1025
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,919
Look, um, Chip,
I've been thinking, about your offer.

1026
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,119
If the job's still open...

1027
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,399
For you?

1028
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,550
Always.

1029
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,599
I don't know how long I'll be there, I mean
I'm still going to look for a, for a design job.

1030
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,999
But as long as you got me,
I'll give you everything I got.

1031
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,469
Of course you will. You always have.

1032
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,556
Nope.

1033
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,474
He's yours.

1034
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,870
She's right, Julia.

1035
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,074
Rumpie's your rabbit.
And he always will be.

1036
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,280
I think she's going to be okay,
Scott, I really do.

1037
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,352
Yes. We'll give it another shot.

1038
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,278
- You want some coffee?
- Please.

1039
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,919
I spoke to Ms. Williams and
she says we handled it just right.

1040
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,199
Apparentiy runaways are quite common.
She says...

1041
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,919
- Patti?
- Yeah.

1042
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,559
You're going to want to take a look at this.

1043
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,919
- What's this?
- Ah, that's a stamp, honey.

1044
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,199
- What's this?
- That's a book.

1045
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,919
- What's this?
- That's a truck.

1046
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,119
- Honey, Bobby...
- What's this?

1047
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,919
What's this? What's this?

1048
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,673
What's this!

1049
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,719
He's very, very curious.
His I.Q. is extremely high.

1050
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,999
No! I want my bunny!!

1051
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,599
We're going to get your bunny.
That's why we came here.

1052
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,919
Julia will be home any minute.

1053
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,399
I just wanted to give her
a chance to say good-bye.

1054
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,519
Oh, of course.

1055
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,519
I still don't understand
exactly how this happened.

1056
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:08,519
Well, to be honest with you,
the rabbit was not doing very well and...

1057
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,999
...my husband just thought it
would be happier out in the wild.

1058
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,070
Let go!

1059
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,999
We simply did not anticipate Bobby's reaction.

1060
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,519
I mean, we thought he'd forgotten all about it,

1061
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,799
he hardly ever visited the thing except
to give it candy now and then.

1062
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,799
So when we saw your notice at the store,
well... we're just happy we're getting it back.

1063
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,919
Him.

1064
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,319
Rumpie's a he.
And he's domesticated.

1065
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,119
He can't survive in the woods.

1066
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,799
Rumpie?

1067
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,399
What kind of a name is that?

1068
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,719
Well, what does Bobby call him?

1069
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:42,478
Oh, well, we never gave it a name.
It was always just the bunny.

1070
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,356
Julia.

1071
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:52,751
Julia, this is Mrs. Tramwell and Bobby,
the little boy I was telling you about.

1072
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,919
Rumpie... the rabbit belongs to him.

1073
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,354
I want my bunny.

1074
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,519
- No.
- Julia...

1075
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,670
No.

1076
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,319
Julia. The rabbit belongs to Bobby.
We have to give it back.

1077
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:18,519
- You didn't take care of him.
- I beg your pardon?

1078
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,119
What's the most important thing
to feed a rabbit?

1079
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,319
- Mommy...
- Hay. When do rabbit's teeth stop growing?

1080
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,119
I'm sorry. What's this all about?

1081
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,919
They don't. Ever.
That's why they need hay.

1082
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,799
Do you know 
what rabbits do with their poop?

1083
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,319
Jul, Julia!

1084
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,519
They eat it.

1085
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,919
- They eat their poop!
- Mommy, Mommy...

1086
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,199
This is outrageous.

1087
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,199
How much did you pay for the rabbit,
Mrs. Tramwell?

1088
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,919
- Excuse me?
- How much did the rabbit cost?

1089
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,399
I don't know. Thirty dollars, maybe.

1090
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,719
Here's fifty dollars.

1091
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,399
You know what, wait.

1092
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,119
Here's a hundred.
We're buying him from you.

1093
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,319
- But... but it's Bobby's.
- Don't want it! It eats poop!

1094
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,879
I wanna go home!

1095
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,470
Just take it.

1096
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,154
It's Mrs. Ross.

1097
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,556
Hey.

1098
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,919
Ah, I just come by to see how she's doing.

1099
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,480
She's doing fine.
She's, she's doing great.

1100
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,599
Good.

1101
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:56,719
Well, ah, you know, ah... the thing is,
ah, I need a helper.

1102
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,319
- A helper.
- Yeah, with the animals.

1103
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,551
You know, a couple hours a day,
three days a week.

1104
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,758
Seeing is how she knows them all, I,
I thought she might be the one.

1105
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,270
What do you think?

1106
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,760
Well, I guess you should ask her.

1107
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,155
Julia. Would you like to work
for Mrs. Ross after school?

1108
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,275
How much?

1109
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,555
Huh. So now you're talkin'.

1110
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,150
How much?

1111
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,874
A dollar an hour.

1112
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,554
To start.

1113
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,354
I'll see you on Monday.

1114
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,550
Well, that's that, then.

1115
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,876
Mrs. Ross, wouldn't you like to come inside?

1116
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,670
Whacko.

1117
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,399
Julia, we have something else
we want to ask you.

1118
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,470
Come in.

1119
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,351
Billy! Come downstairs, please.

1120
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,879
I think we should all sit together.
In a circle.

1121
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,319
Oh, brother. One of these...

1122
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,880
Just sit down, please, William.

1123
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,073
I think it's important that we're all 
here together as a family for this.

1124
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:03,360
Julia, Helping Hands catted.

1125
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:08,160
And they said you're ready
for a Forever Family.

1126
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,273
It's okay, honey. You can talk.

1127
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,275
You can say it.

1128
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,719
I want my mom.

1129
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,919
You still have your mom, Julia.

1130
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,719
And I am sure that when she gets better,

1131
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,119
she's going to want to come visit you.

1132
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,719
And she can.

1133
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,799
As much and as often as she wants.

1134
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:40,158
But she's sick right now, honey,
and she just needs time to get better.

1135
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,158
And we would like you, we want you...

1136
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,160
We want you to be part 
of our family, Julia.

1137
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,074
As long as you don't bite.

1138
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,749
Rumpie too?

1139
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,876
Rumpie too.

1140
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,754
Am I real now?

1141
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,556
What?

1142
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,273
Am I real now?

1143
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,349
Oh, honey.

1144
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,119
You're the most real,

1145
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,353
the most wonderful thing
in the whole wide world.

1146
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,670
Thank You.

1147
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,154
Eyoouuuu!!!
