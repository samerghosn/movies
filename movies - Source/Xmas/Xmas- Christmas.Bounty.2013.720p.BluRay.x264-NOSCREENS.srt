1
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,328
Jason, Stephanie.

2
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:55,789
Inside voice and
walking feet, please.

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,156
Yes, Miss Bell.

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,362
This is great.

5
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:05,786
Popcorn on a string?

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,621
Looking for someone?

7
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,081
James.

8
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,807
I'm so happy you made it.
- Of course I made it.

9
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,602
Next time, use that
app I showed you...

10
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,299
then you'll see...

11
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,063
if I'm not with you...

12
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm always on my way.

13
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,361
So how was the big holiday pageant?

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,323
Terrific, if you ignore the fact that two of
the shepherds were picking their noses...

15
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,366
and Mary twisted her
ankle on the dreidel.

16
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,235
Oh. A Judeo-Christian mishap.
- Heh.

17
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,991
I'm so happy we're spending
Christmas together.

18
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,793
So are you ready for tonight?

19
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,882
The Ballantine Capital Holiday Party
is the social event of the season.

20
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,383
At least to the Ballantines.

21
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,259
I'm still debating on what to wear.

22
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,347
Well, I'm sure whatever you wear,
you will look beautiful.

23
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,141
And my mother will scrutinize your
dress and find it distasteful.

24
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,770
Oh. Sounds like fun. Heh.

25
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,299
It will be, as long
as we're together.

26
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,269
Come on, I'll show you my classroom.
- Oh.

27
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,329
Good job today. Merry Christmas.

28
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,664
Bye.
- Bye, everyone. Merry Christmas.

29
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,210
Miss Bell?
- Oh, Mrs. Low. Wasn't Bobby just darling...?

30
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,295
I can't find him. I've looked everywhere.
- I'm sure he's here.

31
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,382
Okay, why don't you
check the cubby room?

32
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,300
I'll look in the classroom.
- Okay.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,844
I'm sure he's hiding under one of the desks.
- Oh, yeah.

34
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,292
Come on, in the car.

35
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:46,066
Honey? Heh, you know what?
I think I left my scarf by the manger.

36
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,402
Will you run and get it?
- Scarf retrieval. Can do.

37
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,524
Thank you, sweetie.
I'll go check on Bobby.

38
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,213
Stop!

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,759
Hey!

40
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:28,721
Miss Bell?

41
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,933
Miss Bell, that's my dad.

42
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,741
He is? You are?

43
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,454
Oh. Oh.

44
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:45,417
Well, unfortunately, the faculty was informed
your visitation rights have been suspended.

45
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,502
It's Christmas.
- Bobby, say goodbye to your dad...

46
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,213
...and then go find your mom.
- Okay. I love you, Dad.

47
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,537
Bye, Bobby.
- Bye.

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,588
Do you have a phone?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,143
You're lucky I'm in the
holiday mood, Mr. Low.

50
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:06,979
You see, if I call this into the police,
you would be in big trouble.

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,883
But if you did,
they'll probably give you a break.

52
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,055
Merry Christmas.

53
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,906
Was he under the desk?

54
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,242
Yep, I know my Bobby.

55
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:23,079
So you ready to face my parents?

56
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,574
I think I can handle it.

57
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,588
Yes. Wait out front.

58
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,471
Before my mother gets the
chance to berate you...

59
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,723
I have to say you look amazing.

60
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,752
Flattery will get you everywhere.
- Oh. Heh.

61
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:51,024
Honey, why is everything so quiet?

62
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,651
This is a party, isn't it?

63
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,862
Don't tell them.
They might actually smile.

64
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,353
Oh, got it.

65
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:01,826
Incoming Ballantines at 10 o'clock.
Remember, my parents are old money.

66
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,870
Establishment. Upper crust.
- Aloof. Arrogant.

67
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,038
This is gonna be fun. Hi.
- Hi.

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,708
Dad.
- James.

69
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,451
Oh, darling.
- Mom.

70
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,588
I'd like you to meet Tory Bell.

71
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:15,214
Hi.

72
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,209
Told you.
- Well, I'm glad you could join us, Tara.

73
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,678
It's Tory.

74
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,180
Happy holidays.

75
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,935
Not half as happy as yours is going to be.
The south of France sounds so exciting.

76
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,437
Oh, you've never been?

77
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,382
Sorry. Heh.

78
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,720
Will you just excuse me for a moment?

79
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,074
Dad, I know you have your reservations,
but I really have feelings for Tory.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,786
How much do you know about this girl?
- I care about her.

81
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,372
I know I wanna be with her.
And I know for me, that's enough.

82
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,582
<i>Guess who.</i>

83
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,584
Sorry, drawing a blank.

84
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,336
<i>I'm hurt, Tornado.</i>

85
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:58,550
<i>Spending six years on the inside
kept your memory very fresh for me.</i>

86
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,427
I didn't know they
allowed calls this late.

87
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,805
<i>Read the morning papers, Bell.</i>

88
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:06,600
<i>I'm out. And I'm coming for you.</i>

89
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,718
<i>All of you.</i>

90
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,353
Fresh glass?
- I have to go.

91
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,398
Go where?
- I have to leave.

92
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:18,598
I get it. You've had enough.
- No, I have to leave New York right now.

93
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,822
No, what...?
- I can't get into it right now.

94
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,567
It's just... It's too much.
But I love you.

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,913
I'm about to give my toast.
Where should we all stand?

96
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,663
Unfortunately, I have to go...

97
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,209
but I'm sure it will
be a great toast.

98
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,418
You okay?
- I'm fine.

99
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,002
You sure?
- I'm sure.

100
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,370
I have to go help my parents...

101
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,327
with stuff.

102
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,512
Tory.
- James, please.

103
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,473
Tory, I just need to know that
you're okay. That we're okay.

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,016
We're totally okay.

105
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,144
Look, I promise, I will explain
everything to you at New Year's.

106
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,148
New Year's? What about...?
- I will so make this up to you.

107
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,567
It will be a whole different
kind of celebration.

108
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,310
Something like...

109
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,225
You can do that?

110
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,869
I'm willing to try.

111
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:12,833
Okay. I'm completely baffled,
but my New Year's countdown starts now.

112
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,408
New Year's.

113
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,913
You are a mysterious
woman, Tory Bell.

114
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,370
Ma'am.
- Thank you.

115
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,550
10th and 1st for a quick stop.

116
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:35,091
Then Trenton, New Jersey.
In a hurry, please.

117
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,771
Baby.
- Daddy.

118
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,567
Sweetheart.
- Mommy.

119
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,141
Did you flip your daddy again?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,865
Ma, clothes.

121
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,035
Oh. How'd I raise such a prude?

122
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,412
She's so cute.

123
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,039
Look at you. You look like
a real New Yorker now.

124
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,442
I didn't hardly...

125
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,086
I'm gonna get you something
for your shoulder.

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,080
She took you down pretty hard.
That's my girl.

127
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,993
What were you thinking, Dad?
That move has never worked on me.

128
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,053
You're home for the holidays?

129
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,097
Kind of for the holidays.
- Not spending it with that new guy?

130
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,059
I Googled him. I gotta know
what my little girl is up to.

131
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,437
Guys, guys, guys, look,
I'm so happy to see you...

132
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,273
but I'm actually not just
here for the holidays.

133
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,900
I got a call.
- Monte's Motorcycles?

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,350
I put your name in the raffle.
- I got a call from Manucci.

135
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,948
He's still got 20 years
on his sentence.

136
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,993
He's out, and he's coming for us.

137
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:15,317
For me.
- He threatened you?

138
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,914
I was always afraid of this.

139
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,168
You took him out when you were
a teenager. Drove him crazy.

140
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,911
We gotta take him down again.

141
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,629
Put him away for good.

142
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,091
I'll get cousin Bones to put
a tail on Manucci's sister.

143
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,914
I wanna know where
Big Donna's heading.

144
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,596
Nobody threatens the Bells.

145
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,919
Nobody.

146
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,052
Welcome home, Tornado.

147
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,186
Let's get to work.

148
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:52,015
Our tail said Big
Donna should be here.

149
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:59,065
Yep. Big Donna's definitely here.

150
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:09,451
You and me will suit up so Donna and
her bodyguards don't pick us out.

151
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,914
Ma? What's up?

152
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:44,284
You never could get
your hair right yourself.

153
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,220
Still gorgeous.

154
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,221
That does not look like me.

155
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,265
It used to.

156
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:01,394
I can't believe I got
my baby girl back.

157
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,562
You sure you're up for this?

158
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,215
Yeah, I'm cool.

159
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,236
Ma?
- Yeah, hon?

160
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,572
What if someone sees
me in these pants?

161
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,368
Let's go catch a bad guy.

162
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,043
You sure I look okay?
- I think you look gorgeous.

163
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,161
Okay.

164
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,409
Wow.

165
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,467
He's your tail?

166
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:37,013
Just because you two broke up
doesn't mean we fired him.

167
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,289
Hey, come here.

168
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,434
Be careful out there.

169
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,087
I love sounding official.

170
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,111
What?

171
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,279
Electric blue pumps look good on you.

172
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,783
Very funny, but I have work to do.

173
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,951
Tweaking on seeing me?
- I'm not tweaking.

174
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,121
I just... I wanna get this done
and I don't want any distractions.

175
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,749
And I'm a distraction now?
I used to be your partner.

176
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,368
I have a new boyfriend now,
and a new life.

177
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,464
I heard. In fact, most of Trenton has heard.
An investment banker. Pretty fancy.

178
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:15,217
As much as I'm enjoying the small talk,
this is what we're going to do.

179
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,263
As soon as we see Big Donna,
you guys take the bodyguards out.

180
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,850
I'll get close enough to drop the
tracking device, then we're out.

181
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,018
Dad, Tory. You copy?

182
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,966
<i>Sweetie, code names, remember?</i>

183
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,317
Right. Tornado to Banshee-1.
Any sighting of the target?

184
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,765
No target present. Black Hawk?

185
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,447
No visual.

186
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,099
Ho-ho-ho.

187
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:58,251
I've got her.
She's definitely covered.

188
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,479
<i>Did she spot you?</i>

189
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,258
No. She's looking at shoes.

190
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,403
Hideous shoes, but shoes.

191
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,850
<i>And the bodyguards?</i>

192
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,725
Too close. We can't move yet.

193
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,553
She's at the salon. There's no
way they'll let the bodyguards...

194
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,379
into the treatment rooms.
Now is the time to take them out.

195
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,985
Whoop.

196
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,477
Here you go.

197
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:10,236
I just need someone to touch up my gels.
- Sure. Let me see what I can do.

198
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,336
Whenever you have an opening.

199
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,908
Move. Now.

200
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,833
It's true what they say.

201
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:32,091
The right undergarment makes
a woman feel like a woman.

202
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,474
You coming?

203
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,903
She'll be in there a while.

204
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,447
Ain't that the truth.

205
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,441
I'm going to hit the head.
- All right.

206
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,965
One down. He'll be out for a while.

207
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,366
Ho-ho-ho.

208
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,682
You want a closer look?

209
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,380
Come on, don't be shy.

210
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,226
Come closer.

211
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,918
Two down. And out.

212
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,967
Puppy?

213
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,433
Come on, Mike.

214
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,432
Come on.

215
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,616
Thank you, Santa.

216
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,883
Is he okay?
- Yeah, he slipped.

217
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,956
Slipped?
- Yeah.

218
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,384
Three down. It's all you, Tor.

219
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,995
Tory "Wild Woman" Bell?

220
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,320
I can't believe you're back.

221
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,921
Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,840
We're gonna have to catch up later.

223
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,799
Tony? Mario?

224
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,048
Cover's blown. She's running.

225
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,172
Excuse me.

226
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,775
Excuse me. Pardon me.

227
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,551
Watch it!

228
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,518
Excuse me.

229
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:42,111
What's wrong, Manhattan?
Jersey too rough for you now?

230
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,304
Out for a day of beauty, Donna?

231
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,806
A girl's gotta look her best.

232
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,599
Now, back off me, Bell.

233
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,767
All of you.

234
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:00,046
I know my rights.
You can't hassle me like this.

235
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:03,065
I'm a classy lady in these parts.

236
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,394
You're right, Donna. I'm sorry.

237
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,905
We just get ahead of
ourselves sometimes.

238
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,400
That's more like it.

239
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,496
It's like you never left, Tor.

240
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:30,550
Oh, cousin Bones is texting.

241
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,249
According to Bones,
she's heading east on Ashmore.

242
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,018
Oh, no, you're not going anywhere.

243
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,645
Mikey Muscles. How's it hanging?

244
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,105
Lizzie the Legs.

245
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:47,817
Shaved, moisturized and ready for action.
- I'd love to catch up, but this really isn't the...

246
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:50,403
First of all, you never told
me you were coming back.

247
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,531
What the front door
is that all about?

248
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,200
I miss you, girl.
- I...

249
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,787
Second, I thought you got out of the
bounty business. That's why you left.

250
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,288
She thought she did too.
But we pulled her back in.

251
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:01,874
Well, I'm glad.

252
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,417
Liz, I got a great
teaching job there.

253
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,711
So what, you move to
Manhattan and that's it?

254
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,339
It's only through the Holland Tunnel.

255
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,334
But I guess it's also kind
of a different world.

256
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,960
It is to some people.

257
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:18,557
Liz, I'm sorry I didn't call.

258
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,142
I meant to. It's just that I...

259
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:23,479
You got all caught up in your new guy.
Been there, done that.

260
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:26,606
But you can't forget your girlfriends.
- I know.

261
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,901
So how does it all work, Tory?

262
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,278
I mean, a big banker
and a bounty hunter?

263
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,698
Yeah, how does that work?

264
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,906
It works fine.

265
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,954
I'm not a bounty hunter anymore.
This is kind of a one-off.

266
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,582
Oh, okay.

267
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,167
Well, I hope this whole
visit isn't just a one-off.

268
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,913
It'd be nice to hang out with you again.
- For sure.

269
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,133
Later, Mikey Boy.

270
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,160
Over and out, Legs.

271
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,880
Smile. Got it.

272
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,767
I get why you don't wanna
hang out with me...

273
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,688
...since I'm you're smoking-hot ex-boyfriend.
- Ha, ha, very funny.

274
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:10,984
Thank you. There's a lot of people on this
side of the bridge who still care about you.

275
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,355
You might wanna think about that while
you're so busy planning your new life.

276
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,404
Worked like a charm.

277
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,982
Good.

278
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,003
What do you think?

279
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,714
If he's in there, that service
door is his access point.

280
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,175
No fugitive wants to be
far away from his vehicle.

281
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,930
Gale, watch the front, I'm gonna take
the east exit. Two of you stay together.

282
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,707
It could be a trap.

283
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,799
Go.

284
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,116
Really?

285
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,134
Okay, that works too.

286
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,028
They're here.

287
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,856
Leopold.

288
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,460
The girl is mine.

289
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,827
You got it, boss.

290
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,938
You hungry?

291
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,028
Tory?

292
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,799
Tory.

293
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,919
I know you're here.
I used that app I showed you.

294
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:43,655
Mike, 12 o'clock.

295
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,476
All right.

296
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,329
Did the bear just explode?

297
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,891
Who's this guy?

298
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,476
This?

299
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,021
Dad, James.

300
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,799
James, Dad.

301
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,929
All right. Here we go.

302
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,575
How is he?

303
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,326
Delicious and fine.

304
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:32,246
It's just a bump.
- Thanks for the house call, Liz.

305
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,491
Nice having a nurse in your contacts, isn't it?
- Yeah.

306
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,837
Liz, I'm sorry. I let so much
time pass between us.

307
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,882
You were always a really good friend.

308
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,549
I still am.

309
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,625
You should give me a test-drive sometime.
- You got it.

310
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,468
So aside from Mr. Delicious,
what's so great in Manhattan?

311
00:24:55,035 --> 00:25:00,356
Well, in Manhattan, I can be Tory.

312
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,192
In Trenton, everyone
sees me as "Tornado."

313
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:05,738
It's like this role I fell
into that never ends.

314
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,990
I thought you loved being a bounty hunter?
- No, I do.

315
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,784
I did. But...

316
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,413
You know, I like the
other parts of me.

317
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,249
You know, when I met James,
that's all he saw.

318
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:20,461
It's the other parts of
me and it felt great.

319
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,990
The guys here, they just
see me as one of the guys.

320
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,840
One guy didn't.

321
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,836
Oh, I guess I wanted an option
other than Mikey Muscles.

322
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,080
I understand.

323
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,973
All right. House call's over.

324
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,843
I've gotta get back to work.
- All right.

325
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,548
Thanks again.

326
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,835
Okay, I just need to make
a few little adjustments.

327
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,836
What's she doing with Redneck Santa?

328
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,298
I just want the place to look nice.

329
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,218
Honey, I worked for hours getting it just right.
- Okay.

330
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,304
Okay. This stuff cannot
be in the house.

331
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,972
What are you so worried about?

332
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,546
He doesn't know about the...

333
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:18,810
family business.

334
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,717
You didn't tell him we're bounty hunters?
- It never came up.

335
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,276
I know, I know. It's just...

336
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:30,196
James is not just another boyfriend.
He's from a whole different world.

337
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,740
Mom, you know. You Googled him.

338
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,701
Tornado Renee Bell...

339
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,327
you can't hide yourself.

340
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,913
She's not hiding herself.

341
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:40,249
She's hiding us.

342
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,125
I'm not hiding you.

343
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,836
I love you guys.

344
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,238
I do. It's just... Well...

345
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,633
This would be a bit
of a shock for James.

346
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:51,844
I just need to ease him into it.

347
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,290
Please?

348
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,964
Please, help me. Just play along.

349
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,960
Okay, honey, okay. How?

350
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,895
Just act normal.

351
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,355
Can do.

352
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:05,732
We got your back, Tor.

353
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,101
Consider it done.

354
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,761
What do you mean by "normal"?

355
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:15,366
Let's start by putting the girls away.
- Well, I'll try, but the girls aren't exactly shy.

356
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,703
Okay, Ma, normal people
don't say things like that.

357
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,413
Got it.

358
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,031
Daddy?

359
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,088
Do you have any sleeves?

360
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,468
Ain't doing it.
- Do it.

361
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,386
Done.
- Use mine.

362
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,638
Anything else, sweetie?
- JAMES:

363
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,224
Just act fancy.
- Oh.

364
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,844
Act fancy.

365
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,971
Oh.

366
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,390
Cracker?
- Cheese?

367
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,564
Foot rub?

368
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,752
Sweetie.
- Oh, thank God.

369
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,530
I thought I was...

370
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,383
Did that cheese come out of a can?

371
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:16,095
Honey, I am so glad
you're feeling better.

372
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,930
You really hit your head hard.

373
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,583
I did?
- Yeah.

374
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,093
Mom, Dad...

375
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,588
cousin Bones...

376
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,763
this is my boyfriend,
James Ballantine.

377
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,111
Charmed.

378
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,573
Oh.

379
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,366
Nice to meet you all.

380
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:42,613
Ha, ha. Oh, very festive tree.

381
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,207
And crossbow.
- I know, right?

382
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,375
That was a wedding gift.

383
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,198
My dear?

384
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,622
Don't mind if I do.

385
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,927
Libation.

386
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,471
You know, I think James
should rest some more.

387
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:03,558
No, no, no. Really, I'm fine.

388
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,686
So I've never been to this part
of New Jersey. It's very...

389
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,559
Is that a weapon?

390
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,566
It's just a stun gun.

391
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,952
For a little peace of mind, you know.

392
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,080
Criminals always come to the
nice side of town to steal.

393
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,624
Right. Of course.

394
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,334
<i>Got one in sight...</i>

395
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,987
Not to worry,
that's just my police scanner.

396
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,423
Computer game, that I play nonstop.

397
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,842
That's why it's always on.

398
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,927
Oh, you're a gamer?
At work, I have "ExcelTetra."

399
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,750
No way. Which version?

400
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,515
Five.

401
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:48,979
Wow, that's impressive.

402
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,980
See? We're all getting
along so well. Ha-ha-ha.

403
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,358
Yes, we are, Mrs. Bell.
And I am so happy about that...

404
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,762
because I actually came
here to speak to Mr. Bell.

405
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,265
Me?
- Yes.

406
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:02,867
I know you don't know
much about me...

407
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,662
and that I haven't been
dating Tory for very long.

408
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,539
So your mind must be
filled with questions.

409
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,916
Who is this man?

410
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,542
What does he stand for?

411
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,086
Where is he from?

412
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:19,622
My names is James
Oswald Ballantine III.

413
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,220
Fancy.
- Mom.

414
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,431
I come from the Upper
East Side of Manhattan.

415
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,131
And I stand for whatever
makes Tory happy.

416
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,354
Oh! my.

417
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,730
I know you feel protective.

418
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:35,349
Protective? You obviously haven't
seen my girl choke someone out.

419
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,778
Up. Choke someone up.

420
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,113
With emotion.

421
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:42,490
Tory's got a lot of heart.
- A crazy amount.

422
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,313
Yeah.
- I know.

423
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:49,498
And that's why the real reason
I came here today, Mr. Bell...

424
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,195
was to ask your permission...

425
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,494
to propose to your daughter.

426
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:08,171
What did I miss?
- Tory's getting married!

427
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:45,412
That's some ring you got her.
- Well, she's worth it.

428
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,478
Well, I didn't unscrew the
good stuff for nothing.

429
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:55,146
Let's celebrate.

430
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,050
I say we take this party to Bochino's.
- Oh, you were banned from there.

431
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,432
Oh, yeah.

432
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,810
Bochino's sounds good.
- But don't we have work to do?

433
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,490
Serious work?

434
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,244
Tory, you gotta celebrate tonight.
This is everything you've ever wanted.

435
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,115
But I don't have clothes for Bochino's.
- Of course she does.

436
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,585
But, honey...

437
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,962
Bochino's is kind of a dive.
- Oh.

438
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,924
Oh, your favorite bar is suddenly "a dive"?
- A dive bar? Really?

439
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,762
Good, because I can't tell you
how sick I am of Crystal.

440
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,307
I know, I know.

441
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,923
You and me both, right?

442
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,253
What is that?
- Ma, help me get dressed.

443
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,096
Okay.

444
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,923
So you like the ring?

445
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,279
Hello, Jersey.

446
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,806
I know, right?

447
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,700
I picked out all of your faves.

448
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,146
So many choices.

449
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,607
And so little time.

450
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,667
Help with your hair?
- Oh.

451
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,786
Not tonight, Ma.

452
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,714
I know it's not quite your style.

453
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,093
Me, I'd say it needs more gold.

454
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,220
But it's nice.

455
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,722
Thanks, Mom. For trying
so hard with James.

456
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,625
Well...

457
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,811
You got what you wanted, Tory.

458
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,465
A new life in Manhattan.

459
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,653
You're always gonna
be my little girl.

460
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,431
And I'm gonna miss you.

461
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,534
But I'm so happy for you.

462
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,606
Thanks, Ma.

463
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,252
Tory, if you wanna go back to
New York with James, we get it.

464
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,463
Between us and Mike,
we can handle Manucci.

465
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,883
No. I put Manucci
away the first time.

466
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:49,051
He's back because of me.

467
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,125
And I'm gonna put him
away the second time too.

468
00:33:57,576 --> 00:34:01,471
Like it or not, you're a Bell.

469
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,766
Okay.

470
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:17,496
Welcome back.

471
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,130
Oh, my God.

472
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,507
Tory, that's like the
Taj Mahal of rocks!

473
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,260
Heh. James, this is Nurse Sembrook.

474
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,054
But I've known her my entire
life as Lizzie the Legs.

475
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:39,603
You can use Elizabeth if it feels better to you.
- No way. I much prefer Lizzie the Legs.

476
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,755
Oh, he's so cute, I could just spazz.

477
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,465
Mikey Muscles, what brings you by?

478
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,056
I just missed the big moment.
I couldn't miss the celebration.

479
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,237
Mike.
- Yeah, Tory.

480
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,436
Don't take it personally.
Exes are like that.

481
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:59,398
And by exes I just meant...
I'm gonna stop now.

482
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,625
Do you need to use the bathroom?
- No.

483
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,322
Yes, you do.

484
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,911
You dated him?

485
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,923
Young and dumb.

486
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,009
Well, how long did you guys go out?

487
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:15,255
Oh, I wouldn't even call it going out.
It was over before it began.

488
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,391
He used to work for my
dad and... You know.

489
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,934
Right. Right.
- Yeah.

490
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,353
Tory, what kind of
business is your dad in?

491
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,606
When you mentioned that your father
was a businessman, I pictured...

492
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,110
James, I want to explain
it all to you. And I will.

493
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,489
But it's a little complicated. And I
just want to do it at the right time.

494
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,110
Honey, can we please
just celebrate tonight?

495
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,605
Yes.

496
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,458
Aw.
- Oop.

497
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,835
Sorry, Tor. I figured
you told him about Mike.

498
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:49,422
I was going to,
but this thing came up.

499
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:51,757
Plus, Mike and I are done. It's over.

500
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,510
If you say so.

501
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,052
Come on, lose the coat, girl.

502
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,764
Oh, no, no. It's fine.
I think I'll keep it on.

503
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,132
Come on, Tor, you gotta move.

504
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,003
Come on, Bell, dance!

505
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:06,639
You look gorge!

506
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,144
Now you're talking!

507
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,159
How long have you known Tory?

508
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,311
Since junior high. You?

509
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,025
Ten months.

510
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,498
Ten months.

511
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,376
Dude doesn't waste any time.

512
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,128
Well, when it's meant
to be, it's meant to be.

513
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,047
What are you drinking?

514
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:34,916
Well, I think champagne
is appropriate.

515
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,596
Can I get a champagne
for my friend and a...?

516
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,498
A shot and beer chaser?

517
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,307
How'd you guess?

518
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,018
Actually, forget the champagne.

519
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,436
I'll have what he's having.

520
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,554
A shot and a beer chaser.

521
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:53,068
Aw. Looks like your ex and
your man are getting along.

522
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,516
Oh, shoot.

523
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,521
Help me.

524
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:00,525
So, what do you do?

525
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,692
Well, we look for companies that are
in trouble and we acquire them.

526
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:11,045
Sounds like we're in the same business,
except we find people in trouble and we...

527
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,619
Stop it! Stop being such guys and
get your butts on the dance floor.

528
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,135
I'm waiting on a shot.

529
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,554
And a beer chaser.

530
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:22,431
I'll go easy on you because
it's your first night tonight.

531
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,550
Muscles, don't make me play hard.

532
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,686
You win, Legs.

533
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,759
Here you go.

534
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,309
Thank you.

535
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,722
Pookie! Hi!

536
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,621
Hi.
- Hi.

537
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,068
Whoo.
- Heh.

538
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,402
Nice work today.
- You too.

539
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,427
Okay, should we talk?

540
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,512
About what?
- Well...

541
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,349
Three years later, you're engaged,
and now you wanna talk?

542
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:08,173
You know when I wanted to talk?
Before you ditched me and left town.

543
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,230
I know I didn't handle it well.

544
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,023
But, Mike, it wasn't anything
you did. It was me.

545
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:16,527
Wow, that's what it
feels like to hear that.

546
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,028
What?

547
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:21,648
"It's not you, it's me." I've used
that line a few times myself.

548
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,601
Have a nice night.

549
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,750
Hey.
- Hey, I haven't danced in quite a while.

550
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,960
Oh, you're pretty good.

551
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,213
No, Tor, I'm inspired.
- Aw.

552
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,458
<i>You know tonight is the night
You got me feeling good</i>

553
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,014
Hey, Tory!

554
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:48,893
You up for a shot and a beer chaser?

555
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,519
It's pretty good.

556
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,672
Sure.

557
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,650
Come on, future
Mrs. Delicious, let's toast.

558
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,652
You snagged a good one.
- Yeah, I know. James is amazing.

559
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,612
It's hard to celebrate
with Mike here.

560
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,365
Oh, come on, you can't expect
Mikey to be happy tonight.

561
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,242
He's been hung up on you for years.

562
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,163
But he'll get over it.
- Years?

563
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,414
He hasn't had a girlfriend
since you left.

564
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,958
A guy who looks like that?
You do the math.

565
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,668
But he'll get over you.

566
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:16,628
If you let him.

567
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:18,547
<i>Now come here
Tell me whatcha think, girl</i>

568
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,260
<i>You know tonight is the night
You got me feeling good</i>

569
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,166
<i>We must be doing it right
Got me feeling good</i>

570
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:30,213
Whoo! Party.

571
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:34,606
I know you think I didn't care about you.
- Don't tell me what I think.

572
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,983
You don't understand why I...
- Don't tell me what I don't understand.

573
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,987
Let's not make this any more
difficult than it already is.

574
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:44,266
Difficult? For you or the
guy you left behind?

575
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,204
Tory, what you don't understand is...

576
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,322
I love you.

577
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,239
Loved.

578
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,579
Past tense, right?

579
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:02,701
Past, present...

580
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,244
future.

581
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:12,710
I'm engaged.

582
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,438
<i>We've been doing it right
You've got me feeling good</i>

583
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,059
<i>Hands up
I wanna see your hands right now</i>

584
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,407
You've been holding out on me.

585
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,001
You're an incredible dancer.

586
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,119
Come on, I wanna see some more moves.

587
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,525
What are you doing with those?
- Oh, just reminiscing.

588
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,849
Gosh, our lives are
really crazy, but fun.

589
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,992
Remember that Christmas in Key West?
- That was the best Christmas ever.

590
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,985
We nabbed Tommy Franklin.
- Yeah.

591
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,204
Dewey Beach.

592
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,081
When Hawk and Gale
collared Cole Harper.

593
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,960
Wasn't that the first
time you used a stun gun?

594
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,782
Yep.

595
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:28,452
Do you think I can be a normal
wife with a normal family?

596
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,847
I think you can be anything
you wanna be, Tor.

597
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,000
We all do.

598
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,269
Mike called. He got a tip.

599
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:41,398
Manucci will be at the Cliff Street lot tonight.
- Where they sell Christmas trees?

600
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:42,692
Yep.
- Let's roll.

601
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,719
Come on, let's stake it out.

602
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,398
Maybe someday, honey.

603
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:00,293
Where is everyone?
- They went out.

604
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,003
Out? Where?

605
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,880
To the Christmas tree lot.

606
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,909
In case Auntie got sick of hers.

607
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:11,387
Oh. Well, shouldn't we
have gone with them?

608
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,806
I mean, shouldn't we
help pick out the tree?

609
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:17,684
I prefer to stay here,
in case the phone rings.

610
00:42:17,784 --> 00:42:21,230
You're the desk guy.
- Exactly.

611
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:24,429
Besides Mike is with them and
he can help them with the tree.

612
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,945
Mike is with them?
- Yeah.

613
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,565
He's a pretty strong guy.

614
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,577
You know, I'm a desk guy too.

615
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:39,248
And, heh, sometimes I
get really sick of it.

616
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,365
Tell me about it.

617
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,786
Don't you ever wish you can just say
"screw the rules" and follow your passion?

618
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,177
You have no idea.
- Let's go.

619
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,081
Let's go chop down a tree.
- Yes!

620
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,757
Come on!

621
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,494
Tory!

622
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,237
Hey!

623
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,708
James. Honey,
what are you doing here?

624
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,335
Yeah, what are you doing here?
- James and I aren't desk guys.

625
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,112
Have you lost your mind?

626
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,755
A little, I'm sorry.

627
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,409
We both wanted to help pick out the tree.

628
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,885
Huh?

629
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,469
I mean, I...

630
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,932
Honey, I wanted to surprise you with
what will be our first Christmas tree...

631
00:43:39,032 --> 00:43:40,976
to hang my crystal angel on.

632
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,771
Oh, well, a family should
pick out their tree together.

633
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:46,297
Where do we start?

634
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,144
Daddy, where do we start?

635
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,572
Well, Gale's gonna wait by the car...

636
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,824
...to make sure that it keeps running.
- Yeah.

637
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:01,121
And, Tory and Mike, why don't
you check around that trailer...

638
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,206
see if you find anyone.

639
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,653
Bones and James...

640
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,628
take the far, far,
far east end of the lot.

641
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:10,827
Far.
- Great trees there.

642
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,885
Wow, sir, you take your
tree shopping seriously.

643
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,083
I do.

644
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,621
Deadly serious.

645
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,541
Now go!

646
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:24,394
Be careful!

647
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:26,563
It's a tree lot in Trenton, Tory.

648
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,092
Not the Black Forest.

649
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,972
I love you.

650
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,666
Mike, if anything goes wrong,
I've got to watch out for James.

651
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:48,043
Will you help me?

652
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,378
Really?

653
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,577
You're really asking if I'll
help protect your fiance?

654
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:57,210
Sure. I'm just your partner.

655
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,887
Manucci is here for sure.

656
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,936
Okay, you get him,
I'll look for Manucci.

657
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,719
Now, I'm almost sad
to see this end, Bell.

658
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,347
Almost.

659
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,793
Goodbye.

660
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,773
What was that?
- Sounded like a.38.

661
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,983
Yeah, right.

662
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:58,976
Get off of me, you little
spider monkey. Come on!

663
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,735
Are you kidding me?

664
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,632
Yeah, I got this boss. I got this.

665
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:47,900
I didn't know Manhattan socialites can fight.
- I'm not a Manhattan socialite.

666
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,360
Yet.

667
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,835
Let's go! Let's go!

668
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,014
Tory?
- James, get down!

669
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:08,041
Why are you holding a gun?
- Because I'm...

670
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,809
a bounty hunter! Get down!

671
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,882
A what? A what?

672
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,139
No, Tory!
- James!

673
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,471
Daddy!

674
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,481
Daddy? Daddy, are you okay?
- Oh. I'm okay.

675
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,695
Go with Mike.

676
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,827
I can't believe I got James into this.
- It's not your fault.

677
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,139
He poked his head out
from behind the tree.

678
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,132
Mike.

679
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,893
Seriously, who hears gunshots...

680
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,342
...and pokes their head out?
- Mike.

681
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,860
Don't most people hit the deck?
- He's not one of us, okay?

682
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,182
Okay. I didn't mean anything by it.

683
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:23,050
"Hey, bad guy with a gun.
I'm over here, shoot me."

684
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,952
Psh-psh. Ouch!

685
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:45,726
Damn it!

686
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,197
This is my fault.

687
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:01,451
He shouldn't even be here.

688
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:07,376
Listen to me.

689
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,264
We're gonna get him
back for you, okay?

690
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,588
You're gonna get married and
it's all gonna be good. Okay?

691
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,588
Thanks.

692
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,757
They're not gonna hurt him.

693
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,766
It's you they want.

694
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,237
Wow, thanks.

695
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,606
I didn't mean it like that.
- No, really...

696
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,985
thanks. You're right. I'm good now.

697
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:44,757
Manucci is gonna lay down
low like the rat that he is.

698
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,760
But with a hostage,
he's gonna need a solid base.

699
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,554
If the tracking device is in Big Donna's
pocket, I could try to reactivate it.

700
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,224
Good thinking.

701
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,684
Hey, guys!

702
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,186
Look who snagged the end
of the shift doughnuts.

703
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,271
Any takers?

704
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,898
Everyone okay?

705
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,275
Manucci got James.

706
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,068
Oh, snap.

707
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:09,315
Could you imagine how much that boy
must be freaking out? That dude's scary.

708
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,067
I'm shutting up now.

709
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,331
I don't know what to do, Dad.

710
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,666
If James gets hurt...

711
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,583
The Tory I know...

712
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,922
knows exactly what to do.
She knows how to catch a criminal.

713
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:28,121
And probably save a fiancé too.

714
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,090
You got him once, Tory. You can
do it again. Come on, Bells, think.

715
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,853
Oh, my...

716
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,346
What is it, Tory?

717
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,846
White rhinestone heels...

718
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,987
facial wax, extensions, spray tan.

719
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,514
Prom?

720
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,451
White glittery gazebo.

721
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,661
Oh, my God. A Jersey wedding.
- A Jersey wedding.

722
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,831
Big Donna's getting married.
- Probably gonna be a big wedding.

723
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,030
Because Big Donna's...

724
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:05,365
big.

725
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,548
What we have to figure out is...
- Where.

726
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,844
That's where we'll get Manucci and James.
- I know the location. It's at the warehouse.

727
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,806
I saw the gazebo. Nobody moves
a gazebo once it's built.

728
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:17,378
But when is the wedding?

729
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,809
When did she get a spray tan?

730
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,436
Two days ago.

731
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,230
Spray tan goes streaky in...

732
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:26,400
Seventy two hours. It's tomorrow.
- It's tomorrow.

733
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,985
Bones, find plans on the warehouse.

734
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,822
I need points of entry, passageways,
underground, everything.

735
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,565
Okay.

736
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,148
What is it, Tory?

737
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:38,273
Our invitation.

738
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,572
I need a doughnut.

739
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,985
You look beautiful, Donna.

740
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,208
That makes two of us.
- Huh?

741
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,878
It means a lot that you came
back to Jersey for this.

742
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:32,715
I wanted at least one family member
at my wedding and everyone else is...

743
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:34,458
...dead.
- Dead.

744
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,012
Or in prison.
- Or in prison. Heh.

745
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,516
Look, I wouldn't have
missed this for anything.

746
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:44,353
I mean, it's not every day you
see your little sister get married.

747
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,878
No, it's not.

748
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,856
You know, but...

749
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,402
I know this isn't exactly how you
pictured your wedding day...

750
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,737
but I can't risk being seen...
- I know, being seen in public.

751
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,481
I know.

752
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,894
Do you think we would have been
happier if we'd have gone straight?

753
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,625
No. Absolutely not.
- No way.

754
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,487
Now, remember...

755
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,465
this is my day, okay?

756
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:16,510
No funny stuff...

757
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,003
no guns, no business.

758
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,724
You think I'm dumb enough to
mess with a girl's wedding? Heh.

759
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,001
Even I'm afraid of that.

760
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,264
That's exactly what happened.
- Yeah, right here.

761
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,713
Yeah.
- I don't know, she got...

762
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,536
Oh, really?
- Come on.

763
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,304
Is the perimeter secure?
<i>- East end secure.</i>

764
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,472
<i>South, secure.</i>
- Bones, any building plans?

765
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,434
<i>Working on it.</i>
- Work faster.

766
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,382
You're sexy when you're bossy.

767
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:12,260
Good to see you.
- Great to see you. So glad you could make it.

768
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,782
Oh, it is my honor, my friend.
It is my honor?

769
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,492
Look at you. Who let you in?

770
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,744
Two beautiful women.

771
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,206
What does he got that I don't got?
- Yeah.

772
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,074
Share the wealth.

773
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:32,235
Good to see you. Good to see you.

774
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,588
They're here.

775
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:38,717
Good. Glad they could make it.

776
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,219
Try the shrimp.
- Definitely.

777
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:46,641
Where is the shrimp?

778
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:50,396
How am I supposed to rescue
him if I don't know where he is?

779
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,797
Wait a sec.

780
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,358
You're gonna call him?

781
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,985
I'm gonna track where he was.
Obviously, Manucci took his phone.

782
00:54:58,085 --> 00:55:01,407
But if we can find it,
James will be nearby.

783
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,322
This does it for you?

784
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,918
He's close. Black Hawk...

785
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,130
<i>... I see where James is.</i>
- Great.

786
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,007
<i>Northwest corner.
I can't tell which room.</i>

787
00:55:19,106 --> 00:55:20,217
Hold up.

788
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,914
<i>Hold up.</i>

789
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,641
Check out the crowd.

790
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,891
What is it?

791
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,512
Ho, ho, ho, and a Merry
Christmas to the Bell family.

792
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,860
<i>All of these guys have
outstanding bounties on them.</i>

793
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,737
Oh! my.

794
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,309
Yeah, I'm a happy guy.
- Yeah.

795
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:46,326
Bobby Waves, $20.000.

796
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:49,579
Sticks Kaczmareck, 30.000.

797
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:55,237
Oh, if we play our cards right, this is going
to be a very bountiful Christmas for the Bells.

798
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,255
Okay, fine, but stay focused here.

799
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,175
James first, Manucci second.

800
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,927
Then you guys can have
your holiday shopping spree.

801
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,804
Roger that. Banshee-1,
I'll see you at the east exit.

802
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,206
Not if I see you first.

803
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,315
Should have been in here.

804
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,641
They had him here.

805
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,824
There's got to be another
concealed space close by.

806
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,900
You actually thought I'd be dumb
enough to let him keep his phone?

807
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,106
I'm insulted.

808
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,532
Get down! Get down! Get down!

809
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:28,628
Are you freaking kidding me?

810
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,179
Pardon me. It's just a small caliber.

811
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,902
Sorry about that.

812
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,021
Oh, boy.

813
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,184
I told him no funny
stuff at my wedding.

814
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,869
My brother's a dead man.

815
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,818
He's heading that way.
- Find James. I got this.

816
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,306
What's your name?

817
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,130
Sorry. Exit's closed.

818
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,032
Stick around. It's almost cake time.

819
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,918
How's the shrimp? Yummy?

820
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,291
It's been fun.

821
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,146
Freeze!

822
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,653
It's over, Manucci.

823
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,246
Yeah, Bell.

824
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:28,293
It finally is over.

825
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,963
Let him go.

826
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,438
Let's make a deal, Bell.

827
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,190
I mean, after all,
Prince Charming over here...

828
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,610
he's not the one who caught me...

829
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,762
and sent me away for six years.

830
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,056
What are you proposing?

831
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,576
I let him go.

832
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,244
And you...

833
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,987
well...

834
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,117
you come with me.

835
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,923
Tory, or whoever you actually are...

836
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,871
don't.

837
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,231
Yeah.

838
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,134
Yeah, that's a good Bell?

839
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,554
Chin up.

840
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,664
It's going to be okay.

841
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,634
Just try and stay calm.

842
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:01,552
Please, calm is my middle name.

843
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,954
Or sort of calm.

844
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,184
Three fingers, duck.

845
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,086
What?

846
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,570
Oh!

847
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:34,818
Oh!

848
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,164
Tory, baby.

849
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,081
Tory, are you okay?

850
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:47,333
Okay, James, stay right here. Don't move.
- No, no, no. Tory!

851
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,403
Open the door. Open the door.

852
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,492
Do it!

853
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,748
Hey! Watch out!

854
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:46,523
Come on.
- Go. I'm right behind you.

855
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,887
She's good.
- She's really good.

856
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,255
She's a Bell.

857
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,431
Hey, watch your head.

858
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,786
Escaped convict with a new
attempted-murder charge.

859
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,664
He's not gonna see the light
of day for a long time.

860
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:37,958
You're amazing, Tory.

861
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,452
But you probably already know that.

862
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,130
I do.

863
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,590
But you can tell me anyway.

864
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,342
I could tell you.

865
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,762
I could stand here and tell you all day
that every time I see you or talk to you...

866
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,836
it's as exciting as the
first time I saw you.

867
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:55,601
How I love watching you fight...

868
01:05:55,702 --> 01:06:00,302
but I also love watching you
walk and talk and just be.

869
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,777
But there's another guy
who wants to do that.

870
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,528
A great guy who can
give you a good life.

871
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:09,556
The new life you wanted so much.

872
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:13,561
Lizzie keeps telling
me how you've changed.

873
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,121
She's right.

874
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,289
There is something
different about you now.

875
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:18,750
I'm even more handsome?

876
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,336
What changed, Tory, is you.

877
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:26,548
You left and I realized you needed more than
just Mike Muscles, although he was fine.

878
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:28,385
In your eyes.

879
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,181
So I took some courses at college.

880
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,516
I'm pre-law now.

881
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,724
Get out!

882
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:38,561
Word of honor. Losing you changed me.

883
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:44,692
So maybe the next beautiful, smart, motivated
butt-kicker that walks into my life...

884
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,014
will have a reason...

885
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,054
to stay.

886
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,871
Your guy's waiting.

887
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,148
My hero.

888
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:26,842
You okay?

889
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:32,657
So crazy, but I thought you meeting
my family was the big hurdle.

890
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:39,940
I should have never lied to you.
- No, you shouldn't have.

891
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:43,835
Because I can't help but wonder
what else wasn't true, Tory.

892
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,612
Your name is Tory, right?

893
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,157
I'm sorry.

894
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,469
If I was just honest with you,
none of this would have happened.

895
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,762
You wouldn't have been knocked out...

896
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:58,182
Well, that's actually happened
before on the slopes of Chamonix.

897
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,393
You would have never been zapped.
- That was a first.

898
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,105
Kidnapped.
- Ditto.

899
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:05,773
But it was kind of a rush.

900
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:13,239
I just wish you'd give me a
chance to love the real you...

901
01:08:13,338 --> 01:08:15,157
because...

902
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:20,064
the woman I met in New York
and the woman I met here...

903
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,157
they're both pretty amazing.

904
01:08:24,516 --> 01:08:28,117
So now that all three
of us have met...

905
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,454
can we try again?

906
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:37,764
A big part of me wants to say yes...

907
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:42,351
but in these last few
days I've learned...

908
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:46,801
an even bigger part of me realized...

909
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:52,529
I'm still a bounty-hunting,
criminal-collaring...

910
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,681
occasional animal-print-wearing
Jersey girl.

911
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,695
Well, I'm gonna
miss you, Jersey girl.

912
01:09:22,574 --> 01:09:24,421
Sit.

913
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,021
Bell. What the-J?

914
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,500
Welcome back to Jersey.

915
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,804
Okay. Attention, attention.

916
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:04,337
I just wanna say
"welcome home" to my girl.

917
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,145
We love you and we missed you...

918
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:10,845
and we are so happy that
you are home, I can't tell you.

919
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,599
And because you and Mikey
work so well together...

920
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:20,033
I was thinking me and my Banshee
could take some time off...

921
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:23,436
and go on that honeymoon
we've been talking about.

922
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:25,829
What are you saying?

923
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,497
Follow me.

924
01:10:27,597 --> 01:10:30,993
What are you doing?
- Aw.

925
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,463
Crazy man.
- Wait for it. Wait for it.

926
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,922
Huh?

927
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,759
Huh?
- Oh!

928
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:40,787
Whoa! Whoo!

929
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,389
Yeah.
- Daddy, you are so romantic.

930
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:46,917
Oh, it's the best Christmas
present I ever got.

931
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:51,314
Another ride with my guy.

932
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,814
Ho-ho-ho.

933
01:10:52,914 --> 01:10:53,983
Whoo!

934
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:55,443
Fancy.

935
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,988
Look at you two. You must be
working some kind of magic.

936
01:10:59,087 --> 01:11:00,657
I know a trick or two.

937
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:04,368
I wanted to drop off my famous...
- Cookies? Liz's Christmas cookies?

938
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:07,162
Hot, sweet and straight
from the oven.

939
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:10,157
Whoa. Save some.
- Yeah, right.

940
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:14,783
So, what's this I hear about
you staying in Jersey?

941
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:17,614
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

942
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,997
Aw. Merry Christmas, you guys.

943
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:28,671
Oh, please.
- What did you do?

944
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:32,634
Maybe we should finish up with that.

945
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,422
<i>Ho-ho-ho.</i>

946
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:01,292
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

947
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,840
That's a wrap for <i>Christmas Bounty.</i>
