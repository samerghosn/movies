2
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,406
That was beautiful--

3
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,421
Take it, Russ.

4
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,634
Dad, can you explain again
what we're doing?

5
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,472
Sure, Russ. We're kicking off our fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas...

6
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,143
...by heading out into the country
in the old front-wheel drive sleigh...

7
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,812
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

8
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,106
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

9
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,319
We're not driving all the way out here so
you can get one of those stupid ties...

10
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,656
...with the Santa Clauses on it, are we?
No, I have one of those at home.

11
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:04,370
What we're looking for today is the
Griswold family Christmas tree.

12
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,007
What's the matter?
Some jackass is riding my tail.

13
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,346
Slow down and let him pass.

14
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,569
Clark! Don't provoke them.

15
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,072
Hey, kids, look a deer.

16
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,177
Clark, slow down!

17
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,889
You wanna ride behind somebody
who does that?

18
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,391
I'll pull around them
and leave them behind us.

19
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,228
Burn some dust here. Eat my rubber.

20
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:15,399
Dad, I think what you mean is,
"Burn rubber," and, "Eat my dust."

21
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,192
Whatever, Russ. Whatever.

22
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,410
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

23
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,415
Okay. That's enough of that.

24
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,088
Speaking of Christmas trees, kids,
can one of you tell me...

25
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,800
...what the first tree displayed
at the White House was?

26
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,136
Dad, they're back.

27
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:51,269
Clark, stop it! I don't want
to spend the holidays dead.

28
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,771
Honey, please!
I'll do the driving, okay?

29
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,233
Will you just take it easy, Ellen?
I'm in complete control.

30
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,237
I'll get around this egg timer.

31
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,744
Dad. Dad.

32
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,622
We're all right!
Thank God, we're all right!

33
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,500
Clark, we're stuck
under a truck!

34
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,637
Do you honestly think I don't know that?
Come on, you guys, don't fight.

35
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,182
For chrissake,
I didn't do this on purpose!

36
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:37,189
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

37
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,276
And forgive my husband.
He knows not what he does.

38
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,110
Amen!

39
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,531
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

40
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,713
Made pretty good time.

41
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,557
Dad, didn't they invent Christmas tree
lots so people wouldn't have to drive...

42
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:15,769
...all the way out to nowhere
and waste a whole Saturday?

43
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:20,190
They invented them because people forgot
how to have an old-fashioned Christmas...

44
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,735
...and are satisfied with scrawny,
overpriced trees...

45
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,612
...that have no special meaning.
My toes are numb.

46
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,699
Kids, this is what our forefathers did.
I can't feel my leg.

47
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,620
They walked out into the woods, picked out
the tree and cut it with their hands.

48
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,581
Mom, I can't feel my hips.
Clark.

49
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,668
Yes, honey?
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

50
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,379
That's all part of the
experience, honey.

51
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,675
There it is.

52
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,446
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

53
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:17,956
Isn't it a little big?
It's not big, it's just full.

54
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:23,129
Dad, that thing wouldn't fit in our yard.
It's not going in our yard, Russ.

55
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,755
It's going in our living room.

56
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:33,096
Look at it.
It really is beautiful, Clark.

57
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,765
It's something else, huh, Russ?
Yeah, Dad.

58
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,602
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?
She'll see it later, honey.

59
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,188
Her eyes are frozen.

60
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,942
Most enduring traditions of the season
are best enjoyed in the warm embrace...

61
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,278
...of kith and kin.

62
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,615
This tree is the symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

63
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,620
Dad, did you bring a saw?

64
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,668
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his living room ceiling.

65
00:09:56,514 --> 00:10:00,809
Hey, Griswold. Where do you think
you're gonna put a tree that big?

66
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,355
Bend over and I'll show you.

67
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,399
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

68
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,235
I wasn't talking to you.

69
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,254
Clark, do you think there's
enough room for the angel?

70
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,216
Oh, sure, honey. I have
a little more trimming to do...

71
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,759
...but that won't be a problem.
Ready?

72
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,556
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

73
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,941
There's a lot of sap in here.

74
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,111
It looks great. A little full.
A lot of sap.

75
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,354
Did I tell you I talked
to my mother today?

76
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,080
And?

77
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,767
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas too.

78
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:27,897
It's not too late to change our plans.
No, no, that's great. That's great.

79
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,816
You're forgetting how difficult
it's gonna be...

80
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,152
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

81
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,154
Honey, they're family. They're
not strangers off the street.

82
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,661
All they do is argue.

83
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,809
Christmas is about
resolving differences...

84
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,203
...and seeing through the problems
of family life.

85
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,792
Yeah. And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

86
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,961
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip.

87
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,548
And then they don't speak to each other--
Your mother waxes her upper lip?

88
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,970
She has for years.
It doesn't show.

89
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,538
I don't know, Sparky.
I have this feeling--

90
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:03,164
Ellen.

91
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,975
I want to have Christmas
here in our house.

92
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:10,355
It means a lot to me. All my life I've
wanted to have a big family Christmas.

93
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,399
I know.

94
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:18,822
It's just that I know how you build
things up in your mind, Sparky.

95
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:24,202
You set standards that no family
event can ever live up to.

96
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,831
When have I ever done that?

97
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:36,215
Parties. Weddings. Anniversaries.
Good night, honey.

98
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,510
Funerals. Holidays.
Oh, great.

99
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,764
Vacations. Graduations.

100
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,289
You should be looking at a fat
Christmas bonus this year, huh?

101
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:13,210
Word is you're an excellent choice to be
named Food Additive Designer of the Year.

102
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,046
I'm not kidding.

103
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,381
What's that new thing you got
at Food and Drug?

104
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,219
Oh, the crunch enhancer? Yeah, it's
a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

105
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,389
It's semipermeable, not osmatic.
It coats and seals the flake...

106
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,057
...prevents the milk from penetrating it.
Yeah.

107
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,519
It's a beautiful product.
I like it, yeah.

108
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,022
The question is,
what will you do with that bonus?

109
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,567
Gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.
Me? Heck, no.

110
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,735
Take a look at this.

111
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,241
I hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

112
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,537
Oh, my God, you're
putting in a pool.

113
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,341
I went ahead and I put a $7500
deposit down on it.

114
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,427
You're the last true family man.

115
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,890
Mark.
Clark.

116
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,351
That's Bill, sir.

117
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,230
Were you working on that
non-nutritive cereal varnish?

118
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,239
Yes, sir.

119
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:17,466
I've got to give a
speech to a trade group.

120
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:22,196
I'd like to mention it. Write a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

121
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,155
My pleasure.
Layman's terms.

122
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,991
None of that inside bullshit jargon
nobody understands.

123
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,827
Yes, sir.

124
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,085
Oh, Mr. Shirley. We got
your Christmas card the other day...

125
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,296
...and my family and I are very
flattered that you remembered us.

126
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,633
Corporate cards.

127
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,472
Don't forget that report, Bill.
Yes, sir. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

128
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,975
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

129
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:57,480
Kiss my ass. Kiss his ass.
Kiss your ass. Happy Hanukkah.

130
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,592
Can I show you something?

131
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:37,479
I was just smelling-- Smiling.
I was just blouse-- Browsing.

132
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,524
For your wife or your girlfriend?

133
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,278
What? What happened?

134
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,703
I guess it wouldn't be any--

135
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,540
Wouldn't be the Christmas shopping
season if stores were less hooter--

136
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,376
Hotter than they are.

137
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,129
It is warm in here.
You have your coat on.

138
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,091
Yes. Oh, do I? How did that happen?
Because it's cold out.

139
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:12,014
Yes. Yes. It is. It's a bit
nipply out. I mean, nippy out.

140
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,600
What did I say, nipple?

141
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,895
There is a nip in the air though.
Can I take something out for you?

142
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:33,369
I was just.... I was just looking
at something for my wife.

143
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,580
God rest her soul.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

144
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:42,461
Oh, no, no, she's not dead.
We're just divorced. She's history.

145
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:46,465
Obviously she doesn't wear underwear. And
there are plenty of shopping days left...

146
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:51,302
...until adultery-- Adulthood.
Which is to say Christmas, as in Yule.

147
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,750
Yule log. Not a log,
I don't have a log.

148
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:56,332
But, I mean, you know,
just if I had a log...

149
00:16:56,475 --> 00:17:01,730
...not in the sense that you think
I said I did. Good golly.

150
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,775
'Tis the season to be merry.

151
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,277
Well, that's my name.
No shooot.

152
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:20,499
What do these do?
Do they clip on here? Down there?

153
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,085
Would you like this one?
Sure.

154
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,131
These are cut really high on the hip.
Look, I'm wearing something similar.

155
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,173
See? You can't see the line.

156
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,844
You can't see the line, can you, Russ?
No.

157
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,636
No.

158
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,851
<i>That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.</i>

159
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:43,646
<i>Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...</i>

160
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,316
<i>...an angel gets his wings.</i>

161
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,019
Folks! Folks! Folks! Merry Christmas.

162
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,526
Hey! How you doing, son?
Fine.

163
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,197
There he is! Oh, my boy.

164
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:37,201
Look at how big you've gotten.
Merry Christmas.

165
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,161
Mom.
Sweetheart.

166
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,499
Oh, knock on the door.
Lift up the ladder.

167
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,959
Listen. Doesn't Nora look old?
You promised.

168
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,378
Of course I do.
They took a pint of fluid out of my back.

169
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,714
Do you see this mole?
This mole on my neck?

170
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,383
Think it's changing color?
No.

171
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,721
You keep touching it, it's getting redder.
I got hemorrhoids. Can you believe that?

172
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,932
Oh, Mother.
Isn't that terrible?

173
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,601
You're not getting the garage space.
After what you did--

174
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,644
I'm doing the parking.
Russ, you want to help?

175
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,855
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy, Mom.

176
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,359
Sweetheart. Your grandma Nora's
got a real painful burr on my heel.

177
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,862
If you rub it for me,
I'll give you a whole quarter.

178
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,781
A quarter. A quarter.
I'll give Audrey a quarter too.

179
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,326
I'm gonna put my car in the garage!
He damaged my car, you believe that?

180
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,577
I'll park the cars.

181
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,665
This is what Christmas is all about.

182
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,795
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage...

183
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,423
...and yeah, I'll be
outside for the season.

184
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,011
We're gonna have the
best-looking house in town.

185
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,682
I've always wanted to do this.
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

186
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,769
I'm sure it's a lot of work too,
but if I'm out in the cold...

187
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,105
...and I'm committed to decorating
the house, I'm gonna do it right...

188
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,732
...and I'm gonna do it big.

189
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,611
You want something you can
be proud of, don't you?

190
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,447
Yeah, I guess so.
Sure you do.

191
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:04,453
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?
When was the last time I overdid anything?

192
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,584
Come on, unravel these.

193
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,423
You have to check every bulb.
Got a little knot here. You work on that.

194
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,510
I'll get the other box.

195
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,984
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.
I'm sure he'll fall.

196
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,945
But I don't think we're lucky enough
to have him break his neck.

197
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,160
Let's go.

198
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,816
<i>Boy, these gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with that giant nutcracker float.</i>

199
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:19,195
<i>At this point I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.</i>

200
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:23,532
<i>But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.</i>

201
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,913
<i>Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.
These look like giant nuts to me.</i>

202
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,625
<i>Yeah, I'm reminded of a couple years
ago, the winds were so high here...</i>

203
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,211
<i>...we almost lost Santa's reindeer.</i>

204
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:39,215
<i>Rudolph's red nose took out a third
floor window at Marshall Field's.</i>

205
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,552
<i>They better keep their eyes out on
their nuts before someone gets hurt.</i>

206
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,615
Would it be indecent to ask
the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

207
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,285
Audrey.

208
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,121
Well, can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

209
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:55,208
Alex called this morning. Grandpa Clark
told him I couldn't come to the phone...

210
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,712
...because I was going to the bathroom.
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

211
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,048
Everybody?
Do you sleep with your brother?

212
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,634
Do you know how sick and twisted
that is, Mom?

213
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,181
Well, I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

214
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,017
I have nightmares about
what he does in his bed...

215
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,060
...when I'm not lying
right next to him.

216
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:20,357
Well, I don't know what to say except
it's Christmas and we're all in misery.

217
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,987
Ellen, are you smoking again?

218
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,530
No!

219
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,169
Hey, Dad, where do you want
these reindeer?

220
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,255
Just put them down there
on the lawn, Russ.

221
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,009
I can't find the Santa Claus.

222
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:51,013
It's in the basement.
We'll get it later.

223
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:52,616
Clark. Dinner's ready.
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

224
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,929
Obviously something
had to break the window!

225
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,098
Something had to hit the stereo!

226
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:30,905
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?
I don't know, Margo.

227
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,124
You want to hurry this up, Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

228
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,921
Two hundred and fifty strands of light,
100 individual bulbs per strand...

229
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:50,884
...for a grand total of 25,000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

230
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,180
Twenty-five thousand.
Well, I hope nobody I know drives by...

231
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:59,226
...and sees me standing in the yard,
staring at the house in my pajamas.

232
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,144
If they know your dad,
they won't think anything of it.

233
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,146
Fire it up, Dad!

234
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:09,818
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

235
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,740
Drum roll, please.

236
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,662
Drum roll.

237
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:55,030
Beautiful, Clark.
Talk about pissing your money away.

238
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,412
I hope you kids see what a silly
waste of resources this was.

239
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,665
He worked really hard, Grandma.
So do washing machines.

240
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,881
Let's get in where it's warm.

241
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:17,846
Clark, baby, I can picture it in my mind.
And it's breathtaking.

242
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,601
Thanks, Mom.
It's probably a bad bulb, son.

243
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:27,063
You know, if one goes out,
the whole thing doesn't work.

244
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,567
Now, if I were you
I'd personally check each one.

245
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,737
I did that, Dad. I can't--
Now, look, if you need any help...

246
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:38,199
...give me a holler. I'll be upstairs, asleep.
Thanks.

247
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:43,663
Sorry, Daddy. It looks good
even if they're not lit.

248
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,749
Thank you, sweetheart.

249
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:57,259
Well, Dad, it was a good try.
Thanks, Russ.

250
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,220
Russ.
Yeah?

251
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:05,434
We checked every bulb, didn't we?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sure of it.

252
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:10,230
I thought so. Well, maybe we ought
to go up there and just get--

253
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:17,364
Jeez! Look at the time. I gotta get
to bed. Brush my teeth. Feed the hog.

254
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,826
I've still got some homework to do.
Do the laundry. Wash the car.

255
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,746
I've still got those bills to pay....

256
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:29,459
Clark, don't stay up too late.

257
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,817
Get off me, you little fungus.

258
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,941
Where the hell is that
cold coming from?

259
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,296
Hello?

260
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,132
I need to get a few more--
Pay by check.

261
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,679
I will. Not a card?
No. If they return it, then it's a hassle....

262
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,097
Russ!

263
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,230
Help!
Daddy, is Clark coming?

264
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,440
How would I know?
Is he in the house?

265
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,442
If he isn't farting around
with his lights, he must be inside.

266
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,363
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

267
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:51,493
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pills.

268
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,736
Ellen! Hey! Ellen!

269
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:57,489
I want to take off these clothes, sit
with a glass of wine and kiss your body.

270
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,909
After you shower, of course.
Of course.

271
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,802
Sparky?
Yes, honey.

272
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,940
Are you out here for a reason,
or are you just avoiding the family?

273
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,610
No. I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

274
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:40,074
In the meantime, I can light the Santa and
the reindeer and the Merry Christmas sign.

275
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,869
That should look good. Ready?

276
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:49,291
You want me to do the drum roll thing?
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

277
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,800
I don't understand it.

278
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,304
The house lights don't work,
the flood lights don't work.

279
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,974
Is it plugged in?

280
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,768
Do you honestly think I would check
thousands of lights...

281
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,188
...if the extension
cord wasn't plugged in?

282
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,777
You used more than one
cord, didn't you?

283
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,409
Maybe the kids have been fooling
around with it. I'll check in back.

284
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,639
Clark!

285
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,851
Todd! What's that light?!

286
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,394
Clark!

287
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,023
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

288
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,375
I can't see.

289
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,378
No, no, no--
Oh, my God--

290
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,686
This ought to do it.

291
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,199
Ellen, I fixed it!

292
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,911
Oh, God!

293
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,541
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

294
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,802
Get a towel.
Okay!

295
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,807
Wait a minute. I don't believe this!
What's all the yelling about?

296
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,728
What?! But--
What's going on here?

297
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,983
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

298
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:23,987
What's he doing, Clark?
I haven't the foggiest.

299
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:26,282
What?

300
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:31,119
What the hell?
What is wrong with this?

301
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,623
Damn it! Damn it!

302
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,713
You goddamn light!

303
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,940
Go! Go! Do it!

304
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,456
Dad, it's beautiful!

305
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,681
Oh, my carpet!

306
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:46,695
Oh, Clark, it's so lovely.
Mom.

307
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,784
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

308
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:58,123
It's a beaut, Clark. It's a beaut.
Dad, Dad, Dad.

309
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,085
You taught me everything
I know about exterior illumination.

310
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,003
Thank you, thank you.

311
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,132
Russ. Audrey.

312
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:13,054
Dear, dear Francis.

313
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,184
I hope this adds to your enjoyment
of the holidays.

314
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,730
It's just wonderful.
Yeah.

315
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:26,110
Arthur. Art.

316
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,653
Dad.

317
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,324
Thanks for being here.
The little lights are not twinkling.

318
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:36,579
I know, Art, and
thanks for noticing.

319
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,918
The house sure does
look swell, Clark.

320
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:49,257
Thanks, Eddie. I hope it enhances
your holiday spirit. Dear Cathrine.

321
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:52,052
Eddie?

322
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:57,432
Oh, the house is gorgeous, Clark.
Eddie?

323
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,894
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account, Clark.

324
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,606
Kids, come on out here and see what
Uncle Clark's done to the house.

325
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,275
Eddie?

326
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:14,992
Eddie?

327
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,956
Yeah. If you don't remember,
this here is Rocky.

328
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,585
You got a kiss for me?
Better take a rain check on that, Art.

329
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,128
He's got a lip fungus
they ain't identified yet.

330
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:34,469
You remember Ruby Sue?
Oh, yeah.

331
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,597
Oh, my gosh!

332
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,601
Her eyes aren't crossed anymore.
That's something, ain't it?

333
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:46,356
Falls in a well, eyes go crossed. She gets
kicked by a mule, they go back to normal.

334
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,983
I don't know.

335
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,697
And this here's our pride and joy.
Snots.

336
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,867
Pretty name, Ed.

337
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,954
We named him that because he's
got this sinus condition.

338
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:04,123
Snots, you roll over and let
Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

339
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:10,338
You ain't never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got, Clark.

340
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,882
That's okay, Eddie.

341
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,010
That's something, ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

342
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,387
...and he'll love you
till the day you die.

343
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,516
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

344
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,561
We were gonna call, but Eddie
wanted to make it a surprise.

345
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:28,523
Yeah. You surprised?
Surprised, Eddie?

346
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:33,362
If I woke up with my head sewn to the
carpet, I wouldn't be more surprised.

347
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,742
We have plenty of room.

348
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:43,371
We have plenty of towels.
We have plenty of everything.

349
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:49,335
We're pretty well set up here
in the RV. It's a little tight...

350
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:53,047
...but we didn't come to impose.
Hell, there's plenty of room.

351
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,925
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

352
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,804
Cathrine and I, we're pretty
comfy in there, you know.

353
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:03,391
But maybe you wouldn't mind
the youngsters shacking up with you.

354
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,771
After that long drive, we could
use a little private time together.

355
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:13,777
Why don't you run and get the kids' things?
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

356
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,572
Come on. I wanna show you the home.

357
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,742
Audrey, help me get some
hot chocolate. It's cold.

358
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,112
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.
Is it real?

359
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,990
Yeah. Yeah, I dug it out
of the ground myself.

360
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,786
Is that a fact?
Hey, get out of there. Snots! Yo!

361
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,289
Don't worry about it, Clark. A little
tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

362
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,168
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

363
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:16,465
Boy, when he lifted his leg
the next morning....

364
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:20,177
If he drinks the water, the tree's
gonna dry up. Come on, out of there.

365
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:22,429
Snots.
Out, out, out.

366
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,472
Get out of there.
Get in the kitchen now.

367
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,809
Get in the kitchen there and get
you something to eat. Go on.

368
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:33,648
He's cute, ain't he? Problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

369
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:38,820
If the mood catches him right, he'll
grab your leg and just go to town.

370
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:43,574
Don't want him around if you're wearing
short pants, if you know what I mean.

371
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:50,164
A word of warning, though. If he does lay
into you, it's best to just let him finish.

372
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:55,586
I can't believe you're actually standing
here in my living room, Eddie.

373
00:45:55,753 --> 00:46:00,007
Never thought the day would come.
Yeah, I'm excited about it too.

374
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:03,887
It's a crying shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

375
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,936
I'll get that. Don't worry about it.
Let me get it.

376
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:18,318
Yeah, I got the daughter in the clinic,
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

377
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:23,030
And the older boy, bless his soul,
is preparing for his career.

378
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,699
College?
Carnival.

379
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,369
You gotta be proud.
Oh, yeah.

380
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:32,583
Yeah, last season he was a pixie-dust
spreader on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

381
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,543
He thinks maybe next year...

382
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,920
...he'll be guessing people's weight
or barking for the Yak Woman.

383
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,757
You ever see her?
No.

384
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:45,429
She's got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

385
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:49,182
Yeah, she's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.
And a hell of a good cook.

386
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,893
Can I refill your eggnog?
Get you something to eat?

387
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,563
Drive you out to nowhere
and leave you for dead?

388
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,858
No, I'm doing just fine, Clark.
Just glad to be here.

389
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:03,864
Yeah. So when did you get
the tenement on wheels?

390
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,117
Oh, that there? That's an RV.

391
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:11,371
Yeah, yeah. I borrowed it off a
buddy of mine. He took my house...

392
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:15,791
...I took the RV. It's a
good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

393
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,253
Yeah. Looks so nice parked
in the driveway.

394
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,507
Yeah, it sure does. But don't
you go falling in love with it now.

395
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,885
Because we're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

396
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,898
Well, get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures.

397
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,610
Oh, retooling.
That's a great excuse.

398
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,907
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

399
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:52,161
Mr. Shirley, merry Christmas.
Who's that?

400
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,623
It's me, Clark Griswold.
What do you want?

401
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,838
My wife and I came up with a little
something special. It's a gift.

402
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,635
Put it over there with the others,
greaseball.

403
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:20,648
By the way, I hope my report
helped out at the trade show.

404
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:28,239
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

405
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:32,159
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in
the middle of an important call.

406
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,831
Get me somebody. Anybody.

407
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,375
And get me somebody while I wait.

408
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:57,101
This is a new silicon-based kitchen
lubricant my company's been working on.

409
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:01,023
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than any cooking oil.

410
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,525
We're gonna fly down
the hill with this stuff.

411
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:07,362
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?
Not that I know of, Russ.

412
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:13,534
Well, don't go putting none of
that stuff on my sled, Clark.

413
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,788
You know that metal plate in my head?
How could I forget?

414
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,751
I had to have it replaced because every
time Cathrine revved up the microwave...

415
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,045
...I'd piss my pants and forget
who I was for a half-hour or so.

416
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:29,592
Over at the V.A. they had to replace it with
a plastic one and it ain't as strong, so....

417
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,012
I don't know if I ought to go down
no hill with nothing between...

418
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,391
...the ground and my brain
but a piece of government plastic.

419
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:44,398
You really think it matters, Eddie?
The plate runs underneath my part here.

420
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,402
Over here it's, you know, nothing.

421
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:52,365
But here, if this gets dented, then
my hair just ain't gonna look right.

422
00:49:55,077 --> 00:50:00,206
Yeah, I know the feeling. I better
try this first, see how it works.

423
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:03,585
Well, you be careful there.
There's nothing to worry about, Eddie.

424
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,757
Going for a new amateur recreational
saucer-sled land-speed record:

425
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,760
Clark W. Griswold Jr.!

426
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:16,764
Remember, don't try this at home, kids.
I am a professional.

427
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:23,605
Later, dudes. Let her rip. Hang 10.

428
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,108
Oh, shooot!

429
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:43,291
This is great! It's great!
It's great! I'm dead!

430
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,186
Look out!

431
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,588
Bingo.

432
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:47,021
Clark? You staying late?
Oh, hi, Bill. Yeah.

433
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,983
Just finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

434
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,445
Well, have a really Merry Christmas.

435
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,739
You too.

436
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:02,369
Are you okay?
Yeah.

437
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,583
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

438
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,043
I just talked to my son.

439
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,380
Company messenger brought something
to the house. I guess that's it.

440
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:17,010
Nothing like waiting till the
last minute, huh? Did you get yours?

441
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:21,556
If it isn't at the house,
I'm sure it's on its way.

442
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:26,186
If I don't get that bonus,
I'm in it up to here.

443
00:52:26,353 --> 00:52:31,398
Don't sweat it. It'll come. Merry Christmas.
Same to you.

444
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:48,768
<i>Me?</i>

445
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:44,365
Santy Claus!

446
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,867
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

447
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,036
What?

448
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,041
You scared me.

449
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,253
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

450
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:03,467
I wish I was.

451
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:06,929
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

452
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,391
Rocky bit my thumb.
What?

453
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,353
Him's nervous because
Christmas is almost here.

454
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,773
Nervous or excited?
Shitting bricks.

455
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:23,070
You shouldn't use that word.
Sorry. Shitting rocks.

456
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,907
I see. Good.

457
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:29,994
Him's nervous because he don't
know if he's getting nothing.

458
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,708
I don't think he should be nervous
and you shouldn't be either.

459
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,585
Because if you're
good, Santa knows it.

460
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,757
If you believe in him and you believe
in your mom and you believe in your....

461
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,260
Your dad.

462
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:50,931
If you've been good all year round, Santa
Claus is gonna bring you something.

463
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:55,103
Sometimes I think all that
Santa crap is just bull.

464
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,648
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

465
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:01,483
We didn't do nothing wrong
and we still got the shaft.

466
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,322
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

467
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,576
And in the next couple of days...

468
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,911
...somehow I'm gonna
prove it to you.

469
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:16,458
You know, every year he comes
to our house. I've seen him.

470
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,503
That's true?
Cross my heart.

471
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:27,885
So it's good you came to stay with us.
I love it here.

472
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,764
You don't gotta put on your coat
to go to the bathroom.

473
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,432
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

474
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:40,065
I think you'd better
go back to bed now.

475
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:44,777
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

476
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:50,240
Oh, I was just looking
for something.

477
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:57,539
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

478
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,751
Nope. How come?

479
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:02,253
Oh, just wondering.

480
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,677
Now you get back to bed. Come on.

481
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,686
Uncle Clark, are you sure
you ain't Santy Claus?

482
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:22,106
I'm sure.

483
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,614
I can't even afford to be an elf.

484
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:43,545
Two containers of K rations!
Two containers of K rations!

485
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,215
Then I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears.

486
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,342
Oh, bullshit!

487
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:03,565
Aren't you having any breakfast?
I'm not in the mood.

488
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:06,568
What are you looking at?

489
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:10,445
Oh, the silent majesty
of a winter's morn.

490
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,782
The clean, cool chill
of the holiday air.

491
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,619
And an asshole in his bathrobe emptying
a chemical toilet into my sewer.

492
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,753
Shitter was full!
Yeah.

493
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,672
Have you checked our shitters, honey?
Clark, please.

494
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,259
He doesn't know any better.
It's illegal.

495
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:35,597
It's a storm sewer. If it fills with gas, I pity
the person who lights a match near it.

496
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:03,958
Merry Christmas. Shitter was full.

497
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:21,768
<i>I have a terrible suspicion Cathrine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.</i>

498
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:27,690
Rocky said something about Eddie telling
him Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

499
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:32,110
Yeah. Ruby Sue said something
like that last night.

500
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:36,032
How can they have nothing for the kids?
He's been out of work for seven years.

501
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,326
In seven years he
couldn't find a job?

502
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:42,621
Cathrine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

503
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:51,672
So how's the live-bait business, Eddie?
Well, I can't complain. How you doing?

504
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,632
Not that good, actually.

505
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,135
Your company kill off all them
people over in India not long ago?

506
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:03,016
No. We missed out on that one. You're
pretty set so far as shopping goes?

507
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:08,438
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark. The truth
is, things ain't going too good at all.

508
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:13,902
You know, I told you I borrowed the RV
from my neighbor? Nope. It's mine.

509
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:19,909
We live in it. I had to sell off
the house, the barn, the 10 acres.

510
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:26,498
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

511
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,376
If only I had back the money
that me and Cathrine...

512
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:34,007
...sent that TV preacher that was
screwing the hockey players.

513
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,050
What about the kids?

514
01:00:36,217 --> 01:00:39,887
His kids can fend for themselves.
No, your kids.

515
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:43,557
Oh, well, that's the bitch of it.
See, I don't know what to do.

516
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:48,938
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Gurnee.

517
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,648
Eddie....

518
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,112
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

519
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,740
Clark, I couldn't do that.
No, no, we insist.

520
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:02,409
Oh, no. I'm not one
for charity, now.

521
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:06,079
Oh, I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

522
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,585
I don't know about that.
Now, come on.

523
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:15,547
If you don't tell me what they want,
I'll go out and get it on my own.

524
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:21,596
Oh, boy.
This is a surprise, Clark.

525
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:27,976
This is just a real nice surprise.
Just a real nice surprise.

526
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:37,110
Here's a little list. Alphabetical,
starting with Cathrine.

527
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:41,239
And if it wouldn't be too much, I'd
like to get something for you, Clark.

528
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:44,284
Something really nice.

529
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:05,222
Is your house on fire, Clark?
No, Bethany. Those are Christmas lights.

530
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,768
Don't throw me down, Clark.
I'll try not to, Aunt Bethany.

531
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,355
Is this the airport, Clark?
We're here!

532
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,317
Hey, Gris, me and Bethany figured
out the perfect gift for you.

533
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,152
Oh, Uncle Lewis, you didn't
have to buy me anything.

534
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,322
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

535
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:26,786
Oh, that was fun.
I love riding in cars.

536
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:30,664
When did you move to Florida?

537
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:35,420
Ellen, are you still dating Clark?

538
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:41,175
Oh, Aunt Bethany, you know
you shouldn't have done that.

539
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:44,010
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

540
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,849
Jesus, did the room
clear out, Bethany?

541
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,561
Hell, no. She means presents.
You shouldn't have brought presents.

542
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,898
It isn't every day somebody
moves into a new house.

543
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:58,192
They didn't move into a new house.

544
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,528
Mom?
In the living room, Russ.

545
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:07,367
This house is bigger
than your old one.

546
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,954
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

547
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:14,166
Aunt Bethany, why don't you go with
Francis and Cathrine into the living room...

548
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,835
...and say hello to everybody.
Hello, everybody?

549
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:19,130
Just in the living room.
I should say it?

550
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:22,257
You should say it.
Hello, everybody!

551
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,010
Mom.
What?

552
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,389
This box is meowing.
Let me see it.

553
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:36,898
She wrapped up her cat.
Take it in the kitchen and open it up.

554
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,067
Then we'll have a cat running around.
You can't leave it in the box.

555
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,652
Why would somebody
wrap up a cat in a box?

556
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,364
She gets confused, Rusty. She and
Uncle Lewis don't have much money...

557
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:49,784
...so she takes things from the
house and gives them as presents.

558
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,871
Great. Can't wait to see what I got.

559
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:55,123
This one here is leaking.

560
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:04,800
It's lime.
That's her Jell-O mold. I'll take it, Eddie.

561
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:08,762
Why don't you go back in the living
room and enjoy yourself? Russ?

562
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,264
Come on, boy.

563
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,434
Let's go find your sister.

564
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:39,460
Before we begin, since this is
Aunt Bethany's 80th Christmas...

565
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:43,672
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

566
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,923
Great.

567
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,719
What, dear?

568
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,472
Grace!

569
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:56,476
Grace? She passed away
30 years ago.

570
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,980
They want you
to say grace.

571
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,985
The blessing.

572
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:26,215
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America...

573
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:30,094
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

574
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,679
...one nation under God,
indivisible...

575
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:38,101
...with liberty
and justice for all.

576
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,688
Amen.
Amen.

577
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,739
Cathrine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

578
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,782
...I think we're all in
for a very big treat.

579
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,161
Thank you.

580
01:05:56,829 --> 01:06:00,373
Save the neck for me, Clark.
Okay, Eddie.

581
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,592
Look at that.

582
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:16,724
Sorry.

583
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:21,186
Why are you crying?
I told you we put it in too early.

584
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:25,565
Oh, it's just a little dry. It's fine.
It looks good to me.

585
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,610
Here's the heart.

586
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,255
Aunt Bethany?

587
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:33,592
Does your cat, by any chance,
eat Jell-O?

588
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:39,639
Well, I don't know about the cat,
but I sure am enjoying it.

589
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:54,155
Hey, kids?

590
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:59,784
I heard on the news that a pilot spotted
Santa's sled on its way in from New York.

591
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,210
You serious, Clark?

592
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:15,634
Art, you want to load me up with
a little more there. It is good.

593
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,019
Ed?
Yeah, Clark.

594
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,020
What's wrong with the dog?

595
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,237
Oh, he's just yacking on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

596
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,699
Maybe if you wouldn't
feed him from the table.

597
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,537
No, no.

598
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,707
He's probably just nosing
through the trash there.

599
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:58,844
Hey, Gris, if you're not doing
anything constructive...

600
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:02,347
...run into the living room,
get my stogy.

601
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:06,268
Is there anything else I can
do for you, Uncle Lewis?

602
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:09,854
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

603
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,817
If he keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

604
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,560
That should be it.

605
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,609
Honey?

606
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:08,372
You had too many plugs in one outlet.
Oh, God.

607
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,457
What is it?

608
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:16,171
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

609
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,969
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

610
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:30,853
If you don't mind, Clark, I'd like to see
if I can fumigate this here chair.

611
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,814
It's a good, quality item.

612
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:39,987
If you don't mind me asking,
how much it set you back?

613
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,988
You smell something?

614
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,118
Fried pussycat.

615
01:10:48,162 --> 01:10:51,664
It's not the chair. It's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

616
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,797
Lewis?

617
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,591
My tree!

618
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,886
So, what's the matter with you?

619
01:11:48,389 --> 01:11:50,932
Look what you've done to my tree!

620
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,061
Lewis.

621
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,324
It was an ugly tree, anyway.

622
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:10,868
At least it's out of its misery.

623
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,372
Dad's gonna flip out.
Nobody's gonna flip out.

624
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:16,207
We're gonna have
a wonderful Christmas.

625
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,878
What the hell do you want?

626
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:26,217
I have a delivery for Clark W. Grisman.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

627
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:31,431
...but it fell between the seats,
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

628
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:39,939
Merry Christmas.

629
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,359
Merry Christmas.

630
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,989
I can't believe it.
What is it?

631
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:51,326
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nut house?

632
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:53,453
It's from my company.

633
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,164
Your bonus.
My bonus.

634
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,796
Open it, Clarkie.
Open it.

635
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:06,966
Yeah, I hope it's a fortune, Clark.

636
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:09,094
I bet you do, Eddie.

637
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,390
I was afraid....

638
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,478
Are you gonna bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

639
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:24,650
I was gonna wait till tomorrow to
tell you all this, but what the heck.

640
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,863
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

641
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:35,996
That's it. That's the big one!

642
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,373
Open it!

643
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,046
I'm sorry if I've been a little
short with everyone lately.

644
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,341
I've been waiting
for this bonus.

645
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:50,176
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

646
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:53,012
...I had to pay in advance.
And until this arrived...

647
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,350
...I didn't have enough in my
account to cover the check.

648
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:58,726
Tear the sucker open, Dad.
Yeah.

649
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,731
Drum roll. Just kidding.

650
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:14,326
If there's enough left over, I'm gonna fly
you all down here to help us dedicate it.

651
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,541
I can't swim, Clark.

652
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,127
I know that, Eddie.

653
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,434
Clark, what's wrong?

654
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,060
Honey?

655
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,856
It's bigger than you expected?

656
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,653
Smaller?

657
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,657
What is it?

658
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:58,662
It's a one-year membership
in the Jelly of the Month Club.

659
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,829
Oh, God.

660
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:04,417
Clark, that's the gift that keeps
on giving the whole year.

661
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:09,797
That it is, Edward.
That it is, indeed.

662
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:13,051
I'm sorry. Clark....

663
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:19,099
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got. Goddamn it!

664
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,725
Son.

665
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:37,951
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

666
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,289
Hey!

667
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:49,630
If any of you are looking for any
last-minute gift ideas for me, I have one.

668
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,632
I'd like Frank Shirley, my boss,
right here, tonight.

669
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,136
I want him brought from his happy
holiday slumber on Melody Lane...

670
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,390
...with all the other rich people,
and I want him right here.

671
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,975
With a big ribbon on his head.

672
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,645
I wanna look him straight
in the eye and tell him...

673
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,689
...what a cheap, lying, no good,
rotten, four-flushing...

674
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,984
...low-life, snake-licking,
dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed...

675
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:16,907
...ignorant, bloodsucking, dog-kissing,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

676
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:20,827
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

677
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,997
...worm-headed sack
of monkey shooot he is!

678
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:28,460
Hallelujah! Holy shooot!
Where's the Tylenol?

679
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:46,560
He's got that crazed look in his eye.
I told you we should've gone to Hawaii.

680
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:49,981
Turn that thing off
and get in the house!

681
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,192
I'll talk to him, Mom.

682
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:58,030
You know, Dad.
I've been thinking.

683
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:01,409
Good talk, Dad.

684
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:09,835
Aren't you a bit sorry we didn't
get a Christmas tree?

685
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:13,546
Even though they're dirty and
messy and corny and clichéd.

686
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:17,216
Well, where you gonna find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

687
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,238
What's the matter?

688
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,908
Was that really necessary?

689
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,871
We needed a tree.
May I remind you that--

690
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:50,250
That this was all my idea. No.
No, no. I'm well aware of that, honey.

691
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:53,878
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

692
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:57,423
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

693
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:04,096
We needed a coffin.
I mean, a tree.

694
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:06,350
There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

695
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,479
Lewis burned down my tree, so I
replaced it as best I could. <i>Voilà.</i>

696
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:14,440
Are you okay?
I'm fine, honey.

697
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,759
Fixed the newelpost.

698
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,615
What's that sound?

699
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:31,309
Do you hear it?
It's a funny squeaky sound.

700
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:36,564
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

701
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:39,943
I hear it too.

702
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,244
I don't hear it anymore.

703
01:20:03,884 --> 01:20:05,760
What was it?! Oh, my God!

704
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:14,478
Quiet! Shut up!

705
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,408
Mom, don't move.

706
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:33,412
We can't let it get out
of the living room.

707
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:36,917
Where's Eddie? He usually eats
these goddamn things.

708
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:42,087
Oh, not recently, Clark. He read that
squirrels were high in cholesterol.

709
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:44,090
Thank you, Cathrine.

710
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:46,384
I'll try and trap it.

711
01:20:46,635 --> 01:20:48,470
Russ!
Right here, Dad.

712
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:51,096
Oh, there you are.

713
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,265
Go get the hammer.

714
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,560
Clark, what do you need
a hammer for?

715
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:59,271
I'm gonna catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

716
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:08,989
I'm going in with him.

717
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,787
Nora?

718
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,582
Nora!
Is it gone?

719
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,793
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

720
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:22,962
Squirrel!

721
01:22:01,585 --> 01:22:05,796
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

722
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:09,009
I can't just attack someone.
If you're not man enough...

723
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,095
...to put an end to this shooot,
then I am.

724
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, my God!

725
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:46,796
What happened to you?

726
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:57,390
Beautiful. God.

727
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:01,978
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

728
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:04,814
Nobody's walking out
on this family Christmas.

729
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,399
No, no. We're all in this together.

730
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,569
This is a full-blown, four-alarm
holiday emergency here.

731
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,365
We're gonna press on, and we're gonna
have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas...

732
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:16,868
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny Kaye.

733
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:20,329
And when Santa squeezes his ass
down that chimney tonight...

734
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:24,458
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nut house.

735
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:26,127
You're goofy.

736
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,087
Don't piss me off, Art.
Clark?

737
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,341
It's over.
Not according to Santa's watch.

738
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,342
Come on, son.
Stay out of this, Dad.

739
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,554
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

740
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:40,100
Before things get worse.
Worse?

741
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,768
How could they
get any worse?

742
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:46,314
Take a look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell.

743
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,457
Son?

744
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,253
I love you.
We all love you.

745
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:13,675
But this is a terrible night. Nothing's
gone right. It's a disaster.

746
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:17,136
You losing your temper with the whole
family only makes things worse.

747
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:20,305
You're too good a father
to act like this.

748
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:26,145
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us.

749
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,149
And how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

750
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,318
Well, I just--
You just cocked it up.

751
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:37,114
Oh, it's okay. It happens.

752
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,996
Our holidays were always such a mess.
Oh, yeah.

753
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,539
How did you
get through it?

754
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:49,168
I had a lot of help
from Jack Daniels.

755
01:24:57,886 --> 01:24:59,804
I love you.

756
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,349
Dad?
Yeah.

757
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:07,353
Are you gonna recite
<i>The Night Before Christmas</i>?

758
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,564
It's your house.
It's your Christmas.

759
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,359
I'm retiring.

760
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:17,279
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds...

761
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:20,908
...while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

762
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,744
And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

763
01:25:23,912 --> 01:25:26,706
...had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

764
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,917
When out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter...

765
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,545
...I sprang from my bed to see
what was the matter.

766
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:35,006
Away to the window,
I flew like a flash...

767
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:37,841
...tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash.

768
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:42,262
The moon on the new-fallen snow gave
a luster of midday to objects below.

769
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:48,394
When what to my wondering eyes should
appear but a miniature sleigh and...."

770
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,231
And Eddie with a man in his
pajamas with a dog chain...

771
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:54,984
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the--?

772
01:25:57,237 --> 01:25:58,904
Stay here.

773
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:07,247
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Clark.

774
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:10,958
You about ready to do some kissing?

775
01:26:12,627 --> 01:26:15,255
Yes, officer, it seems my husband's
been abducted.

776
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,422
The man was...

777
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:22,136
...wearing a blue leisure suit,
and the plates were from Kansas.

778
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:25,765
He was a huge, beastly,
bulging man and--

779
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:28,350
I've never been treated
like this in my life.

780
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:31,938
I'm sorry. This is our family's
first kidnapping.

781
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,274
You're fired. And where's the phone?
I'm calling the police.

782
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,444
Hey, just hold your wad there, fella.
Clark had nothing to do with this.

783
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,780
This here was my idea.

784
01:26:41,948 --> 01:26:45,784
All right. He's still fired,
and you are going to jail.

785
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:49,247
Oh, no. Eddie, it was my fault.

786
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:52,207
I lost my temper
when I got my bonus.

787
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:55,461
I guess I said some things I shouldn't have.
Bonus?

788
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,965
How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

789
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,341
Yeah. Thanks for telling us.

790
01:27:01,759 --> 01:27:05,596
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

791
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,850
Seventeen years with the company. I've
gotten a bonus every year but this one.

792
01:27:10,018 --> 01:27:11,810
You don't wanna give bonuses, fine!

793
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:14,771
But when people count on them
as part of their salary...

794
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:17,483
...well, what you did just plain--
Sucks.

795
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:21,154
Thank you, Russ.

796
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,323
My...

797
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,493
...cousin-in-law, whose heart
is bigger than his brain--

798
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,912
I appreciate that, Clark.

799
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,917
Is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this.

800
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:38,671
On behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

801
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:58,690
Look...

802
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,195
...sometimes things look
good on paper...

803
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:07,367
...but lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

804
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,578
I guess a healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much...

805
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:13,997
...if to get it you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

806
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,920
It's people that make the difference.

807
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:21,213
Little people, like you.

808
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:26,010
So, Carl...

809
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:29,305
...whatever you got last year...

810
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:32,057
...add 20 percent.

811
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:34,560
Our pool!

812
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:40,524
Dad.

813
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,572
Go away, Todd.

814
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:32,493
If you wanna come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

815
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,923
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

816
01:29:58,478 --> 01:30:00,313
Freeze!

817
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,149
Not you, them!
Them!

818
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,286
This way, please.

819
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:21,708
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
I told you to freeze, mister.

820
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:23,502
May we blink?

821
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,757
Frank.

822
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:30,926
Helen!
Thank God, you're all right.

823
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:32,929
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

824
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:35,264
It was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

825
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,684
Excuse me. Would you and
Mrs. Shirley like to step outside...

826
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,936
...so we can take care
of business here?

827
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,689
There's no business.
I'm not pressing any charges.

828
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,942
What?
It was a mistake.

829
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:49,153
Mistake? Frank, honey,
you were kidnapped.

830
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:53,032
I did something I shouldn't have,
and these people called me on it.

831
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,243
This is Clark Griswold
and his family.

832
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,537
Welcome to our home.

833
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:00,747
What's left of it.

834
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,876
Release B Squad.
What's going on here?

835
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:09,090
Remember how I was toying with the notion
of suspending the Christmas bonuses?

836
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:14,095
You didn't. Well, of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

837
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:17,890
That's pretty low, mister. If I had
a rubber hose, I would beat you to--

838
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:20,184
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating the bonuses.

839
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:24,229
Look!

840
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,899
Look, look!

841
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,570
Look!

842
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:34,448
Ruby Sue, sweetheart.

843
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:40,412
It's Santa Claus.
What? What's wrong?

844
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:45,376
What?
She thinks she sees Santa.

845
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,421
No, it's the Christmas star.

846
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:51,591
And that's all that matters tonight.

847
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:57,054
Not bonuses or gifts
or turkeys or trees.

848
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,015
See, kids...

849
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:02,268
...it means something different
to everybody.

850
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,479
Now I know what it means to me.

851
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:10,902
That ain't the frigging
Christmas star, Gris.

852
01:32:10,927 --> 01:32:13,679
It's a light on the
sewage treatment plant.

853
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,280
Sewer gas.

854
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:19,076
Don't drop that!

855
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:08,833
Play ball!

856
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,345
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

857
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,055
Merry Christmas, honey.

858
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:25,350
Come here.

859
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,295
I did it.

860
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:10,201
[ENGLISH]

861
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,112
