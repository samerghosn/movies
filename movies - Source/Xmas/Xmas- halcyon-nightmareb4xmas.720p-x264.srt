1
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,718
'Twas a long time ago,

2
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,726
longer now than it seems,

3
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,730
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.

4
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:08,561
For the story that you
are about to be told...

5
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,569
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.

6
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,073
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.

7
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:19,076
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun.

8
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,420
# Boys and girls #
# of every age #

9
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,260
# Wouldn't you like to see #
# something strange #

10
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,268
# Come with us #
# and you will see #

11
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,099
# This, our town #
# of Halloween #

12
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,936
# This is Halloween #
# This is Halloween #

13
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,771
# Pumpkins scream #
# in the dead of night #

14
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,778
# This is Halloween #
# Everybody make a scene #

15
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,610
# Trick or treat till the #
# neighbor's gonna die of fright #

16
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,618
# It's our town #
# Everybody scream #

17
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,780
# In this town #
# of Halloween #

18
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,448
# I am the one hiding #
# under your bed #

19
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,460
# Teeth ground sharp #
# and eyes glowing red #

20
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,292
# I am the one hiding #
# under your stairs #

21
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,299
# Fingers like snakes #
# and spiders in my hair #

22
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,131
# This is Halloween #
# This is Halloween #

23
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:20,798
# Halloween, Halloween #
# Halloween, Halloween #

24
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,138
# In this town #

00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,973
# Everyone hail #

26
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,072
# In this town #
# Don't we love it now #

27
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:32,980
# Everybody's waiting #
# for the next surprise #

28
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,646
# 'Round that corner, man #
# Hiding in the trash can #

29
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,816
# Something's waiting now to #
# pounce and how you'll scream #

30
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,824
- # This is Halloween #
- # Red and black #

31
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,587
- # Slimy green #
- # Aren't you scared #

32
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,664
# Well, that's just fine #
# Say it once, say it twice #

33
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,665
# Take a chance #
# and roll the dice #

34
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,168
# Ride with the moon #
# in the dead of night #

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,000
# Everybody scream #
# Everybody scream #

36
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,164
# In our town #
# of Halloween #

37
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,004
# I am the clown #
# with the tear-away face #

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,012
# Here in a flash #
# and gone without a trace #

39
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,843
# I am the "who" when you call #
# "Who's there?" #

40
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,680
# I am the wind blowing #
# through your hair #

41
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,516
# I am the shadow #
# on the moon at night #

42
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,353
# Filling your dreams #
# to the brim with fright #

43
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,188
# This is Halloween #
# This is Halloween #

# Tender Lumplings #

00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,871
# Life's no fun #
# without a good scare #

47
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,703
- # That's our job #
- # But we're not mean #

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,711

# Everyone's waiting #

51
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,718
# Skeleton Jack #

52
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,120
# And scream like a banshee #
# Make you jump out of your skin #

53
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,158
# This is Halloween #
# Everybody scream #

54
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,888
# Won't ya please make way #
# for a very special guy #

55
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,725
# Our man Jack is king #

56
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,562
# Everyone hail #

00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,158
# La la la la la la #
# Whee #

65
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,393
Whee!

66
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:35,497
- It's over!
- We did it!

67
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,100
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!

68
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,271
Great Halloween,
everybody.

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,076
I believe it was
our most horrible yet.

70
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,084
Thank you, everyone.

71
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,086
No. Thanks
to you, Jack.

72
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,452
- Without your brilliant leadership--
- Not at all, Mayor.

73
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,957
You're such a scream, Jack!

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,459
You're a witch's
fondest dream.

75
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,259
You made walls fall, Jack.

76
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,699
"Walls fall"? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.

77
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:08,797
- The deadly nightshade
you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go.

78
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:13,312
- You're not ready for much excitement.
- Yes, I am.

79
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,779
- You're coming with me.
- No, I'm not!

80
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:23,312
Come back here,
you foolish--

81
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,891
Ow! Oh. Oh!

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,725
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.

83
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,990
Thank you.
Thank you.

84
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,158
Thank you very much.

85
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,966
Hold it!
We haven't given out the prizes yet.

86
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,906
Our first award
goes to the vampires...

87
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,807
for most blood drained
in a single evening.

88
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,177
Our second
and honorable mention...

89
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:53,343
goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon Leeches.

90
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,086
Nice work, Bone Daddy.

91
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,288
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year.

92
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,060
And the year before that,
and the year before that.

93
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,401
# There are few who deny #

94
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,740
# At what I do #
# I am the best #

95
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:58,079
# For my talents #
# are renowned far and wide #

96
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:02,415
# When it comes to surprises #
# in the moonlit night #

97
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:06,583
# I excel without ever #
# even trying #

98
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,093
# With the slightest #
# little effort #

99
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,425
# Of my ghostlike charms #

100
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,728
# I have seen grown men #
# give out a shriek #

101
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,769
# With a wave of my hand #

102
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,100
# And a well-placed moan #

103
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,108
# I have swept the very bravest #
# off their feet #

104
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,944
# Yet year after year #
# it's the same routine #

105
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,112
# And I grow so weary #
# of the sound of screams #

106
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,954
# And I, Jack #
# the Pumpkin King #

107
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,656
# Have grown so tired #
# of the same old thing #

108
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,461
# Oh, somewhere deep #

109
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,471
# Inside of these bones #

110
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,634
# An emptiness #

111
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,713
# Began to grow #

112
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,146
# There's something #
# out there #

113
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,946
# Far from my home #

114
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,317
# A longing that #

115
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:15,485
# I've never known #

116
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,160
# I'm the master of fright #

117
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,324
# And a demon of light #

118
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:25,495
# And I'll scare you #
# right out of your pants #

119
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:30,007
# To a guy in Kentucky #
# I'm Mr. Unlucky #

120
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,171
# And I'm known throughout #
# England and France #

121
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,682
# And since I am dead #
# I can take off my head #

122
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,846
# To recite Shakespearean #
# quotations #

123
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:47,518
# No animal nor man #
# can scream like I can #

124
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:51,687
# With the fury #
# of my recitations #

125
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,698
# But who here #

126
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,201
# Would ever understand #

127
00:08:57,302 --> 00:09:02,206
# That the Pumpkin King #
# with the skeleton grin #

128
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:07,370
# Would tire of his crown #
# If they only understood #

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,442
# He'd give it all up #
# if he only could #

130
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:18,388
# Oh, there's an empty #

131
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,051
# Place in my bones #

132
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,062
# That calls out for #

133
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,224
# Something unknown #

134
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:30,393
# The fame and praise #

135
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,403
# Come year after year #

136
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:37,567
# Does nothing for #

137
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:44,081
# These empty tears #

138
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,590
Jack.

139
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,421
I know how you feel.

140
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,611
Sally.

141
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,020
You've come back.

142
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,784
- I had to.
- For this.

143
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,918
Yes.

144
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,293
Shall we, then?

145
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:48,643
That's twice this month you've slipped
deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.

146
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,477
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know.

147
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,986
I made you
with my own hands.

148
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,649
You can make
other creations.

149
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,658
I'm restless.
I can't help it.

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,457
It's a phase, my dear.
It'll pass.

151
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:09,000
We need to be patient,
that's all.

152
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,899
But I don't want
to be patient.

153
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,999
No, Zero.
Not now.

154
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,009
I'm not in the mood.

155
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,510
All right.

156
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,517
Here you go, boy.

157
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:48,034
Mornin', gents.

158
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,893
Jack?
You home?

159
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:25,409
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.

160
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,572
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.

161
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,082
Jack, please, I'm only
an elected official here.

162
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,849
I can't make decisions
by myself.

163
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,890
Jack!
Answer me!

164
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,597
He's not home.

165
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:50,100
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.

166
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,177
Where are we?

167
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,620
It's someplace new.

168
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:22,155
What is this?

169
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,143
Whoa!

170
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:16,683
Whoa!

171
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,191
# What's this? What's this? #
# There's color everywhere #

172
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,394
# What's this #
# There's white things in the air #

173
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,063
# What's this? I can't believe my eyes #
# I must be dreaming #

174
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,299
# Wake up, Jack! This isn't fair #
# What's this #

175
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,568
# La-la-la-la-la-la-la #

176
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,736
# What's this, What's this #
# There's something very wrong #

177
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:17,713
# What's this, there's people #
# singing songs, what's this #

178
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,750
# The streets are lined with #
# little creatures laughing #

179
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,753
# Everybody seems so happy #
# Have I possibly gone daffy #

180
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,789
# What is this #
# What's this #

181
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,255
# There's children throwing snowballs #
# instead of throwing heads #

182
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,264
# They're busy building toys #
# And absolutely no one's dead #

183
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,267
# There's frost in every window #
# Oh, I can't believe my eyes #

184
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,769
# And in my bones #
# I feel the warmth #

185
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,432
# That's coming #
# from inside #

186
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:46,239
# Oh, look, what's this #
# They're hanging mistletoe They kiss #

187
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,437
# Why, that looks so unique #
# Inspired #

188
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,447
# They're gathering around #
# to hear a story #

189
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,245
# Roasting chestnuts on a fire #
# What's this #

190
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,782
# What's this in here #
# They've got a little tree How queer #

191
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,859
# And who would ever think #
# And why #

192
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,852
# They're covering it #
# with tiny little things #

193
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,553
# They've got electric #
# lights on strings #

194
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,394
# And there's a smile on everyone, #
# so now correct me if I'm wrong #

195
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,899
# This looks like fun #
# This looks like fun #

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,491
# Oh, could it be I got my wish #
# What's this #

197
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,769
# Oh my, what now #
# The children are asleep #

198
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,809
# But look #
# There's nothing underneath #

199
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,971
# No ghouls, no witches here to scream #
# and scare them or ensnare them #

200
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,139
# Only little cozy things #

201
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,653
# Secure inside #
# their dreamland #

202
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,951
# What's this #

203
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:36,153
# The monsters are all missing #
# and the nightmares can't be found #

204
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,322
# And in their place there seems #
# to be good feeling all around #

205
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,162
# Instead of screams, I swear #
# I can hear music in the air #

206
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:47,466
# The smell of cakes and pies #
# are absolutely everywhere #

207
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:51,509
# The sights, the sounds #
# They're everywhere and all around #

208
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,669
# I've never felt #
# so good before #

209
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:57,179
# This empty place #
inside of me is filling up
# I simply cannot get enough #

210
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,013
# I want it Oh, I want it #
# Oh, I want it for my own #

211
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,519
# I've got to know, I've got to know #
# what is this place that I have found #

212
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,353
# What is this #

213
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,131
Christmas Town?

214
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:17,201
Hmm.

215
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,362
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

216
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,873
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

217
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,204
Hmm.

218
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,871
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.

219
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,210
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.

220
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,342
Stand aside. Coming through.

221
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,550
We've got to find Jack!

222
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,961
There's only 365 days left
till next Halloween!

223
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,964
364!

224
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,502
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?

225
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:56,064
- I looked in every mausoleum.
- We opened the sarcophagi!

226
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:59,076
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.

227
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,907
I peeked behind
the Cyclops' eye.

228
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,538
I did,
but he wasn't there.

229
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,346
It's time to sound
the alarms!

230
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,942
Frog's breath will
overpower any odor.

231
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,089
Oh!

232
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,958
Bitter!

233
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:54,556
Worm's wart. Wh-Where's
that worm's wart?

234
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,396
Sally!

235
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:00,131
Is that soup
ready yet?

236
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,041
Ah.
Coming!

237
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,651
Lunch!

238
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,153
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart!

239
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,317
Mmm!

240
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,895
And frog's breath.

241
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,328
Wh-What's wrong?

242
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,333
I-I thought you
like frog's breath.

243
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,165
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.

244
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:38,174
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.

245
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,109
I'm not hungry.
Oops.

246
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:44,671
You want me to starve.

247
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:49,618
An old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.

248
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,521
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.

249
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,459
Oh, don't be silly.

250
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:00,657
Mmm! See?

251
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,700
Scrumptious!

252
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,703
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?

253
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,145
This morning.

254
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,948
- Hear that? Shh.
- What?

255
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,682
Zero!

256
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:30,894
Jack's back!

257
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,895
Yea!
Jack's back!

258
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,865
Where have you been?

259
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:46,467
Call a town meeting
and I'll tell everyone all about it!

260
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,548
- When?
- Immediately!

261
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,252
Town meeting!
Town meeting!

262
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,917
Town meeting tonight!

263
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:06,424
Town meeting!

264
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,557
Town meeting
tonight!

265
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:29,612
Listen, everyone.

266
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,056
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.

267
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,796
# There were objects #
# so peculiar #

268
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,798
# They were not #
# to be believed #

269
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,630
# All around things #
# to tantalize my brain #

270
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:47,569
# It's a world unlike #
# anything I've ever seen #

271
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,971
# And as hard as I tried #
# I can't seem to describe #

272
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,307
# Like a most #
# improbable dream #

273
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,973
# But you must believe #
# when I tell you this #

274
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:03,487
# It's as real as my skull #
# and it does exist #

275
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,784
Here, let me show you.

276
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,721
Ooh!

277
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,319
# This is a thing #
# called a present #

278
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,230
- # The whole thing starts with a box #
- # A box #

279
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,996
- # Is it steel #
- # Are there locks #

280
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,470
- # Is it filled with a pox #
- # A pox How delightful, a pox #

281
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,336
If you please.

282
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,342
# Just a box with #
# bright colored paper #

283
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:28,173
# And the whole thing's #
# topped with a bow #

284
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,679
- # A bow #
- # But why #

285
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,510
- # How ugly! What's in it #
- # What's in it #

286
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,311
# That's the point of the thing #
# Not to know #

287
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,681
- # It's a bat #
- # Will it bend #

288
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,185
- # It's a rat #
- # Will it break #

289
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,847
# Perhaps it's the head #
# that I found in the lake #

290
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,518
# Listen now #
# You don't understand #

291
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,857
# That's not the point #
# of Christmasland #

292
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,864
# Now pay attention #

293
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,161
# We pick up #
# an oversized sock #

294
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,701
# And hang it like this #
# on the wall #

295
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,703
# Oh, yes, does it #
# still have a foot #

296
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,037
# Let me see, let me look #
# Is it rotted and covered with gook #

297
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,041
Um, let me explain.

298
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,544
# There's no foot inside #
# but there's candy #

299
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,705
# Or sometimes it's filled #
# with small toys #

300
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,682
- # Small toys, do they bite #
# or explode in the sack #
- # Do they snap #

301
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,378
# Perhaps they just spring out #
# and scare girls and boys #

302
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,048
# What a splendid idea #
# This Christmas sounds fun #

303
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:15,319
# I fully endorse it #
# Let's try it at once #

304
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,394
# Everyone, please #
# Now not so fast #

305
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,659
# There's something here #
# that you don't quite grasp #

306
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,064
I don't know.
Do you get it?

307
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:26,398
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.

308
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,066
# And the best I must confess #
# I have saved for the last #

309
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:33,576
# For the ruler #
# of this Christmasland #

310
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,079
# Is a fearsome king #
# with a deep, mighty voice #

311
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,583
# Least, that's what #
# I've come to understand #

312
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,086
# And I've also heard it told #
# that he's something to behold #

313
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,420
# Like a lobster #
# Huge and red #

314
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,086
# When he sets out to slay #
# with his rain gear on #

315
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:54,596
# Carting bulging sacks #
# with his big, great arms #

316
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,101
# That is, #
# so I've heard it said #

317
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:01,763
# And on a dark, cold night #
# Under full moonlight #

318
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:07,436
# He flies into a fog like #
# a vulture in the sky #

319
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,777
# And they call him #

320
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:17,185
# Sandy Claws #

321
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,785
# Well, at least #
# they're excited #

322
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,522
# But they don't #
# understand #

323
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,530
# That special kind #
# of feeling #

324
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,295
# In Christmasland #

325
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,801
Oh, well.

326
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,647
Hmm.

327
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,156
Hmm.

328
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:10,673
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.

329
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:27,349
You've poisoned me for the last time,
you wretched girl.

330
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,368
Oh, my head!

331
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,366
The door is open!

332
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,969
- Hello?
- Jack Skellington!

333
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
Up here, my boy.

334
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,882
Doctor, I need to borrow
some equipment.

335
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,648
Is that so?
Whatever for?

336
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,885
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.

337
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:05,224
How perfectly
marvelous.

338
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:09,391
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.

339
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,835
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.

340
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,532
Hmm.
Experiments?

341
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,108
Zero, I'm home.

342
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:28,978
Interesting reaction.

343
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,140
But what does it mean?

344
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:15,582
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.

345
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:17,746
Sally?

346
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,756
Sally?

347
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:23,794
Oh! Gone again!

348
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,942
Hmm.

349
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,157
Oh!

350
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,842
# Something's up with Jack #
# Something's up with Jack #

351
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,682
# Don't know if we're ever #
# going to get him back #

352
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,025
# He's all alone up there #
# Locked away inside #

353
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,866
- # Never says a word #
- # Hope he hasn't died #

354
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,268
# Something's up with Jack #
# Something's up with Jack #

355
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,374
# Christmastime #
# is buzzing in my skull #

356
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,544
# Will it let me be #
# I cannot tell #

357
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,712
# There's so many things #
# I cannot grasp #

358
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,883
# When I think I've got it #
# then at last #

359
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:38,052
# Through my bony fingers #
# it does slip #

360
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,188
# Like a snowflake #
# in a fiery grip #

361
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,200
# Something here I'm not quite getting, #
# though I try I keep forgetting #

362
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:48,067
# Like a memory #
# long since past #

363
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,073
# Here in an instant #
# Gone in a flash #

364
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,234
# What does it mean #
# What does it mean #

365
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,074
# In these little #
# bric-a-brac #

366
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,909
# A secret's waiting #
# to be cracked #

367
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,914
# These dolls and toys #
# confuse me so #

368
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,416
# Confound it all #
# I love it though #

369
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,420
# Simple objects #
# Nothing more #

370
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,422
# But something's hidden #
# through a door #

371
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,924
# Though I do not #
# have the key #

372
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,756
# Something's here #
# I cannot see #

373
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,422
# What does it mean #
# What does it mean #

374
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,362
# What does it mean #

375
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:21,598
Hmm. Hmm.

376
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,266
# I've read these Christmas #
# books so many times #

377
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,606
# I know the stories #
# and I know the rhymes #

378
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,771
# I know the Christmas carols #
# all by heart #

379
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,942
# My skull's so full #
# It's tearing me apart #

380
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,952
# As often as I've read them #
# something's wrong #

381
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,218
# So hard to put #
# my bony finger on #

382
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,624
# Or perhaps it's really not as deep #
# as I've been led to think #

383
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,128
# Am I trying #
# much too hard #

384
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,132
# Of course, I've been #
# too close to see #

385
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,464
# The answer's right in front of me #
# Right in front of me #

386
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,471
# It's simple really #
# Very clear #

387
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,472
# Like music drifting #
# in the air #

388
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,738
# Invisible #
# but everywhere #

389
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,743
# Just because #
# I cannot see it #

390
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,746
# Doesn't mean #
# I can't believe it #

391
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:07,978
# You know I think this Christmas thing #
# is not as tricky as it seems #

392
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,487
# And why should they have all the fun #
# It should belong to anyone #

393
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,490
# Not anyone, in fact #
# but me #

394
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,320
# Why, I can make #
# a Christmas tree #

395
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,826
# And there's no reason #
# I can find #

396
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,827
# I couldn't handle #
# Christmastime #

397
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,659
# I bet I could #
# improve it too #

398
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,165
# And that's exactly #
# what I'll do #

399
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,237
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

400
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,670
Eureka!

401
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:33,574
This year...
Christmas will be ours!

402
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,843
Patience, everyone.

403
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,682
Jack has a special job
for each of us.

404
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,523
Dr. Finkelstein!

405
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,356
Your Christmas
assignment is ready.

406
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:58,364
Dr. Finkelstein, to
the front of the line.

407
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,538
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?

408
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,545
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem.

409
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,547
I knew it!

410
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,311
Doctor!
Thank you for coming.

411
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,114
We need
some of these.

412
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,552
Hmm.

413
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:22,650
Their construction
should be exceedingly simple, I think.

414
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,059
How horrible
our Christmas will be.

415
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,860
No!
How jolly!

416
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:32,733
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.

417
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,570
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.

418
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,735
- Specifically.
- By name.

419
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:43,711
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.

420
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,748
Jack!
Jack!

421
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:47,818
It's Boogie's boys.

422
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,253
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick-or-treaters.

423
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,757
The job I have for you
is top secret.

424
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,829
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.

425
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,762
And we thought you
didn't like us, Jack.

426
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:07,268
Absolutely no one is to know about it.
Not a soul!

427
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,737
Now

428
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,777
tree

429
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:17,278
Christmas Town...

430
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:21,010
Ow! Hmm.

431
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,280
And one more thing.

432
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:27,119
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!

433
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:28,851
Whatever you say, Jack.

434
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,554
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.

435
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:54,317
# Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws #

436
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,820
- # I want to do it #
- # Let's draw straws #

437
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,822
- # Jack said we should work together #
- # Three of a kind #

438
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:05,385
- # Birds of a feather #
- # Now and forever La la la la la la #

439
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,831
# La la-la la la-la #
# La la-la la-la #

440
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,061
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Lock him up real tight #

441
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,663
# Throw away the key and then #
# turn off all the lights #

442
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:20,335
# First we're going to set some bait #
# inside a nasty trap and wait #

443
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,438
# When he comes a-sniffing we will #
# snap the trap and close the gate #

444
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:27,016
# Wait, I've got a better plan #
# to catch this big red lobster man #

445
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:30,451
# Let's pop him in a boiling pot and #
# when he's done we'll butter him up #

446
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:34,184
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Throw him in a box #

447
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,853
# Bury him for 90 years #
# Then see if he talks #

448
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,695
# Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man #

449
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,201
# Can take the whole thing #
# over then #

450
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,871
# He'll be so pleased #
# I do declare #

451
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,704
# That he will cook him rare #
# Whee #

452
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,382
# I say that we take a cannon #
# aim it at his door and then #

453
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:06,115
# Knock three times and when he answers #
# Sandy Claws will be no more #

454
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,387
# You're so stupid! Think now #
# if we blow him up to smithereens #

455
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,894
# We may lose some pieces and then #
# Jack will beat us black and green #

456
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:16,831
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Tie him in a bag #

457
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,402
# Throw him in the ocean #
# Then see if he is sad #

458
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:23,235
# Because Mr. Oogie Boogie #
# is the meanest guy around #

459
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:28,574
# If I were on his boogie list #
# I'd get out of town #

460
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,210
# He'll be so pleased #
# by our success #

461
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,081
# That he'll reward us too #
# I'll bet #

462
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,347
# Perhaps he'll make #
# his special brew #

463
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,358
- # Of snake and spider stew #
- Mmm!

464
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,088
# We're his little henchmen and #
# we take our job with pride #

465
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,427
# We do our best to please him #
# and stay on his good side #

466
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,592
# I wish my cohorts #
# weren't so dumb #

467
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,603
- # I'm not the dumb one #
- # You're no fun #

468
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,605
- # Shut up, I've got something #
# Listen now #
- # Make me #

469
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,436
# This one is real good #
# You'll see #

470
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,271
# We'll send a present #
# to his door #

471
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,173
# Upon there'll be #
# a note to read #

472
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,271
# Now in the box we'll wait and hide #
# until his curiosity #

473
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,782
# Entices him to look inside And then #
# we'll have him! One, two, three #

474
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,447
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Beat him with a stick #

475
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,786
# Lock him up for 90 years #
# See what makes him tick #

476
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,623
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# Chop him into bits #

477
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,960
# Mr. Oogie Boogie #
# is sure to get his kicks #

478
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:25,728
# Kidnap the Sandy Claws #
# See what we will see #

479
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,364
# Lock him in a cage #
# and then throw away #

480
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,135
# The key #

481
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:39,148
Sandy Claws, huh?

482
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,021
It goes something
like this.

483
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,492
How about it?
Think you can manage?

484
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,125
A-one and a-two
and a-three and a--

485
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,666
Next!

486
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,972
Fantastic!

487
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,880
Now, why don't you all practice
on that? And we'll be in great shape.

488
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:16,510
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.

489
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:19,681
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.

490
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:23,192
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.

491
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:27,594
- There was smoke and fire--
- That's not my Christmas!

492
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,929
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy...

493
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:34,731
and... this:
My Sandy Claws outfit.

494
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:37,501
- I want you to make it.
- Jack,

495
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:42,045
- please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.
- How could it be?

496
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,911
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red. The trim is white.

497
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,282
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.

498
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,550
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?

499
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:56,525
- Next!
- I have every confidence in you.

500
00:39:56,626 --> 00:40:00,358
But it seems wrong
to me, very wrong.

501
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,956
This device is called a nutcracker.

502
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,797
Jack, Jack!
We caught him! We got him!

503
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:10,840
Perfect!
Open it up, quickly.

504
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,539
That's not Sandy Claws.

505
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:19,081
- It isn't?
- Who is it?

506
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:22,380
Bunny!

507
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,947
Not Sandy Claws. Take him back!

508
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,891
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.

509
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,985
Which door?
There's more than one!

510
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,226
Sandy Claws is behind
the door shaped like this.

511
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,668
I told you!

512
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,898
- You knock it off!
- Ow! Ow!

513
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:49,505
I'm very sorry for
the inconvenience, sir.

514
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,447
Take him home first!
And apologize again.

515
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,485
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.

516
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,679
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.

517
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,190
- We'll get it right...
- next time!

518
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,989
You will be a decided
improvement...

519
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,963
over that
treacherous Sally.

520
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:12,798
Master! The plans!

521
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,871
Excellent, Igor.

522
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:36,891
# This time #

523
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,893
# This time #

524
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,693
# Making Christmas #

525
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,496
# Making Christmas #

526
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,003
# Making Christmas #
# Making Christmas #

527
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:52,132
- # Is so fine #
- # It's ours this time #

528
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:55,474
# And won't the children #
# be surprised #

529
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,548
# It's ours this time #

530
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:01,413
- # Making Christmas #
- # Making Christmas #

531
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,487
# Making Christmas #

532
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,614
# Time to give them #
# something fun #

533
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,159
# They'll talk about it #
# for years to come #

534
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,661
# Let's have a cheer #
# from everyone #

535
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,822
# It's time to party #

536
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:19,027
# Making Christmas #
# Making Christmas #

537
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:24,398
# Snakes and mice #
# get wrapped up so nice #

538
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,773
# With spider legs #
# and pretty bows #

539
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,507
# It's ours this time #

540
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,777
# Altogether #
# That and this #

541
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:38,844
# With all our tricks #
# we're making Christmastime #

542
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,322
Here comes Jack!

543
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,893
# I don't believe #

544
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,829
# What's happening to me #

545
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:51,731
# My hopes #
# My dreams #

546
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,896
# My fantasies #

547
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:59,498
Ha-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

548
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,635
# Won't they be #
# impressed #

549
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,179
# I am a genius #

550
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,581
# See how I transform #
# this old rat #

551
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:10,983
# Into a most #
# delightful hat #

552
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,056
Hmm.

553
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,387
# My compliments from me to you #
# on this your most intriguing hat #

554
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:20,260
# Consider, though this substitute, #
# a bat in place of this old rat #

555
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,264
# No, no, no #
# Now that's all wrong #

556
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:24,856
# This thing will never make a present, #
# it's been dead for much too long #

557
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,936
# Try something fresher #
# Something pleasant #

558
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,938
# Try again #
# Don't give up #

559
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,634
# Altogether #
# That and this #

560
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:36,940
# With all our tricks #
# we're making Christmastime #

561
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:48,980
- # This time This time #
- # It's ours #

562
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:52,282
# Making Christmas #
# Making Christmas #

563
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,222
# La la-la #
# It's almost here #

564
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:57,157
# And we can't wait #

565
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,458
# So ring the bells #
# and celebrate #

566
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:05,592
# 'Cause when the full moon #
# starts to climb, we'll all sing out #

567
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,900
# It's Christmastime #

568
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:11,838
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

569
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,550
Kathleen,
Bobby, Susie.

570
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:28,614
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice--

571
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,489
There are hardly any
naughty children this year.

572
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:35,052
Now who could that be?

573
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,728
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?

574
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:42,237
Ya!

575
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,773
You don't look like yourself, Jack.
Not at all.

576
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,972
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!

577
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,141
- But you're the Pumpkin King.
- Not anymore.

578
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,085
And I feel so much better now.

579
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:02,125
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but--

580
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,217
- Ow!
- Sorry!

581
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:08,458
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?

582
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:12,400
I've got the beard,
the coat, the boots, the belt--

583
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,438
Jack! Jack!
This time we bagged him.

584
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,168
- This time we really did.
- He sure is big, Jack.

585
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:21,938
- And heavy!
- Let me out!

586
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,844
Oh, Sandy Claws.

587
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,918
In person! What
a pleasure to meet you.

588
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,349
Wh-Why,
you have hands!

589
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,184
- You don't have claws at all.
- What?

590
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,952
Where am I?

591
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:40,030
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.

592
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,793
You don't need to have
another worry about Christmas this year.

593
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,597
- Wha-- Wh-Wha--
- Consider this a vacation,
Sandy, a reward.

594
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,105
It's your turn
to take it easy.

595
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:53,539
- B-But there must be some mistake.
- See that he's comfortable.

596
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:57,340
Just a second, fellas.
Of course!

597
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,416
- That's what I'm missing. Thanks.
- B-B-But--

598
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:04,385
You just can't-- Hold on!
Where are we going now?

599
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:07,047
Ho-ho-ho!
No.

600
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,650
- This is worse than
I thought, much worse.
- Ho-ho-ho!

601
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,320
- Ho-ho-ho!
- I know.

602
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,400
Me on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?

603
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,559
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?

604
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:20,898
To Oogie Boogie,
of course.

605
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,905
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.

606
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:28,239
- And Jack said to make him
comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did!

607
00:47:28,344 --> 00:47:32,838
Haven't you heard of peace
on earth and good will toward men?

608
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:35,885
No!

609
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,418
Oh! This'll stop Jack.

610
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,072
What a joy
to think of...

611
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,076
all we'll have
in common.

612
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:04,112
We'll have
conversations...

613
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,706
worth having.

614
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,146
Don't do this!

615
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,748
Naughty children
never get any presents.

616
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,023
- I think he might be too big!
- Oooh!

617
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:22,496
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney,

618
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,967
he can fit...
down... here.

619
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:57,827
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

620
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:02,371
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!

621
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:06,603
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.

622
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,677
# You're jokin' #
# You're jokin' #

623
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,905
# I can't believe #
# my eyes #

624
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,005
# You're jokin' me #
# You gotta be #

625
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,210
# This can't be #
# the right guy #

626
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:17,411
# He's ancient #
# He's ugly #

627
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,681
# I don't know #
# which is worse #

628
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:24,193
# I might just split a seam now #
# if I don't die laughin' first #

629
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,425
# Mr. Oogie Boogie says #
# there's trouble close at hand #

630
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,625
# You better #
# pay attention now #

631
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:32,702
# 'Cause I'm #
# the Boogie Man #

632
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:35,271
# And if you #
# aren't shakin' #

633
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:37,340
# There's somethin' #
# very wrong #

634
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,206
# 'Cause this may be the last time #
# you hear the Boogie song #

635
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,438
- # Whoa-oh #
- # Wah-ah #

636
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,606
- # Whoa-ho #
- # Ow #

637
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,809
- # Whoa-oh #
- # Wow #

638
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,478
# I'm the Oogie Boogie Man #

639
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:54,922
# Release me now or you must #
# face the dire consequences #

640
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:59,155
# The children are expecting me #
# so please, come to your senses #

641
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,527
# Ah, you're jokin' #
# You're jokin' #

642
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,759
# I can't believe #
# my ears #

643
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,835
# Would someone #
# shut this fella up #

644
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,130
# I'm drownin' #
# in my tears #

645
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:10,297
# He's funny #
# I'm laughin' #

646
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,637
# You really are #
# too much #

647
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:14,677
# And now #
# with your permission #

648
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:18,235
- # I'm goin' to do my stuff #
- What are you going to do?

649
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,407
I'm gonna do
the best I can.

650
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:22,541
# Whoa #

651
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,987
# The sound of rolling dice #
# to me is music in the air #

652
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,492
# 'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man #
# although I don't play fair #

653
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,289
# It's much more fun #
# I must confess #

654
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,557
# With lives on the line #

655
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,896
# Not mine, of course #
# But yours, old boy #

656
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,197
# Now that'd be #
# just fine #

657
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:44,706
# Release me fast or you will #
# have to answer for this heinous act #

658
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:48,675
# Oh, brother, you're somethin' #
# You put me in a spin #

659
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:53,614
# You aren't comprehending #
# the position that you're in #

660
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,483
# It's hopeless You're finished #
# You haven't got a prayer #

661
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,748
# 'Cause I'm #
# Mr. Oogie Boogie #

662
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:03,952
# And you ain't goin' #
# nowhere #

663
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,722
Hurray! It's Jack!

664
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:45,297
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky,

665
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,199
outshining every star;

666
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:52,331
your silhouette,
a dark blot on the moon.

667
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,809
You, who are our pride.

668
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,903
You, who are our glory.

669
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,974
- You, who have frightened
millions into an early grave.
- Ow!

670
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:04,610
You, who have, uh,

671
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:08,590
devastated the, the souls
of the... living?

672
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,525
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.

673
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:16,190
- The reindeer can't see an inch
in front of their noses.
- Phew!

674
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,268
This fog's
as thick as, as--

675
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,099
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!

676
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:25,471
- There go all of my hopes,
- Oh!

677
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:29,478
My precious plans,
my glorious dreams.

678
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,880
There goes Christmas.

679
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:38,114
No, Zero. Down, boy.

680
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:42,123
My, what a brilliant
nose you have.

681
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,557
The better
to light my way!

682
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:48,722
To the head of the team, Zero.

683
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,425
We're off!

684
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,137
Wait, Jack! No!

685
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,614
Ho-ho-ho!

686
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,775
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!

687
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,922
Good-bye, Jack.

688
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,521
My dearest Jack.

689
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:27,592
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.

690
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:36,976
# I sense there's something #
# in the wind #

691
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,347
# That feels like #
# tragedy's at hand #

692
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:47,788
# And though I'd like #
# to stand by him #

693
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:52,487
# Can't shake this feeling #
# that I have #

694
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:58,398
# The worst is #
# just around the bend #

695
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:02,733
# And does he notice #

696
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,333
# My feelings for him #

697
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:10,208
# And will he see #

698
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,409
# How much #
# he means to me #

699
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:19,454
# I think #
# it's not to be #

700
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:25,358
# What will become #
# of my dear friend #

701
00:54:25,461 --> 00:54:29,989
# Where will his actions #
# lead us then #

702
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:35,833
# Although I'd like #
# to join the crowd #

703
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:41,240
# In their #
# enthusiastic cloud #

704
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:46,077
# Try as I may #
# it doesn't last #

705
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:50,882
# And will we ever #

706
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:55,219
# End up together #

707
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:58,521
# No, I think not #

708
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,894
# It's never to become #

709
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,494
# For I am not #
# the one #

710
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,181
Ho-ho-ho!

711
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:32,659
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

712
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,297
Santa!

713
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:05,519
Santa?

714
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:06,996
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

715
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,023
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?

716
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:12,601
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.

717
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,603
I have a special present
for you anyway.

718
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,731
There you go, sonny.

719
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,242
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

720
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,181
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?

721
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:34,916
Merry Christmas!

722
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,050
Hello. Police.

723
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:41,152
Attacked by Christmas toys?

724
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:44,597
That's strange. That's the second
toy complaint we've had.

725
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:50,630
Ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

726
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:56,170
Ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

727
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,628
Huh?

728
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:25,195
Oh, wait!

729
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,074
Whoa! Help! Help!

730
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:11,643
You're welcome,
one and all!

731
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:14,018
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.

732
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,025
Police. I know, I know,
a skeleton. Keep calm.

733
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:20,358
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.

734
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:25,197
Reports are pouring in from all over
the globe that an impostor...

735
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:29,204
is shamelessly impersonating
Santa Claus, mocking and
mangling this joyous holiday.

736
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,797
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...

737
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:37,208
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.

738
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,282
- Jack. Someone has to help Jack.
- ...wherever you are,

739
00:58:40,382 --> 00:58:44,409
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- Come back and save Christmas.

740
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,833
Look, Zero,
searchlights.

741
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:07,501
They're celebrating!

742
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,445
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.

743
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:15,882
Whoa! Careful down there!
You almost hit us!

744
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,510
It's okay, Zero!

745
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,556
Head higher!

746
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:29,222
Are you a gamblin' man,
Sandy? Let's play!

747
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:31,458
Hmm?

748
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:37,362
My, my!
What have we here?

749
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,873
Hmm.

750
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,943
I'll get you out of here.

751
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:53,284
Ah! Lovely.

752
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,757
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

753
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,952
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

754
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:06,592
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me?

755
01:00:17,012 --> 01:00:19,413
Who's next
on my list?

756
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:23,885
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?

757
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:41,496
They're trying to hit us. Zero!

758
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:52,378
Merry Christmas
to all...

759
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:59,820
and to all
a good night!

760
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:20,637
I knew this Christmas
thing was a bad idea.

761
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:24,440
I felt it in my gut.

762
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,208
Terrible news, folks!

763
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:31,150
The worst tragedy
of our times!

764
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:35,418
Jack has been blown
to smithereens!

765
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:41,085
Terrible, terrible news!

766
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,894
Attention.
Attention, citizens.

767
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:47,902
Terrible news.

768
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:51,735
There's still no sign
of Santa Claus.

769
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,072
Although the impostor
has been shot down,

770
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:59,978
it looks like Christmas will have to
be canceled this year.

771
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,320
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,

772
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:04,650
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down,

773
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:09,054
but there's
still no sign of Santa.

774
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,934
# What have I done #

775
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:27,635
# What have I done #

776
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,804
# How could I #

777
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:34,349
# Be so blind #

778
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:37,614
# All is lost #

779
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:40,985
# Where was I #

780
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,320
# Spoiled all #

781
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:47,860
# Spoiled all #

782
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:51,262
# Everything's #

783
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,666
# Gone all wrong #

784
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,036
# What have I done #

785
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,440
# What have I done #

786
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:05,639
# Find a deep cave #
# to hide in #

787
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:09,014
# In a million years #

788
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,954
# They'll find me #
# Only dust #

789
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:18,460
# And a plaque #
# that reads #

790
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:24,726
# Here lies #
# poor old Jack #

791
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:29,737
# But I never intended #
# all this madness #

792
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:31,739
# Never #

793
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,936
# And nobody #
# really understood #

794
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,036
# Well, how could they #

795
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,411
# That all #
# I ever wanted #

796
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,576
# Was to bring them #
# something great #

797
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:46,347
# Why does nothing ever #
# turn out like it should #

798
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:49,391
# Well, what the heck #

799
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,789
# I went and did my best #

800
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,021
# And, by God #
# I really tasted #

801
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,132
# Something swell #

802
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:56,961
# Something swell #

803
01:03:57,065 --> 01:04:01,469
# And for a moment #
# why, I even touched the sky #

804
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,735
# And at least I left #
# some stories they can tell I did #

805
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:10,210
# And for the first time since #
# I don't remember when #

806
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:14,409
# I felt just like #
# my old bony self again #

807
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,677
# And I, Jack #

808
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,481
# The Pumpkin King #

809
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:24,184
# That's right #
# I am the Pumpkin King # Ha-ha-ha! #

810
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:28,059
# And I just can't wait #
# until next Halloween #

811
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,291
# 'Cause I've got #
# some new ideas #

812
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,425
# That will really #
# make them scream #

813
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:37,597
# And, by God, I'm really going #
# to give it all my might #

814
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:41,541
Uh-oh. I hope
there's still time...

815
01:04:41,643 --> 01:04:45,079
to set things right.

816
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,445
- Sandy Claws.
- Hmm.

817
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,951
You wait till Jack
hears about this!

818
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,954
By the time he's through with you,
you'll be lucky if you--

819
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,956
The King of Halloween...

820
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,789
has been blown
to smithereens!

821
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,126
Skeleton Jack...

822
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,690
is now a pile of dust!

823
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:10,329
C'mon, Zero! Christmas isn't over yet.

824
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:21,150
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?

825
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,088
Help! Help! Help!

826
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:32,092
Shhh!

827
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,389
Seven!

828
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:37,489
It's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.

829
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,195
One... two... three... four...

830
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:44,898
five, six, seven.

831
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,237
This can't be happening.

832
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:51,177
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

833
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,840
Oh! I'm feeling weak...

834
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:56,009
with hunger!

835
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,021
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.

836
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,623
What?
Snake eyes?

837
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:09,219
Eleven!

838
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:12,927
Looks like I won
the jackpot!

839
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:15,936
Bye-bye, doll face...

840
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,472
and sandman!

841
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:23,041
What the--

842
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,414
Hello, Oogie.

843
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,916
J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.

844
01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:33,476
You must be...
double dead!

845
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,887
Oh!

846
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:45,027
Well, come on,
bone man!

847
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,539
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!

848
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,913
Fire!

849
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,646
Ooooh!

850
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:15,188
Jack, look out!

851
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:24,706
So long, Jack!

852
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:28,436
How dare you treat my friends...

853
01:07:28,543 --> 01:07:31,445
so shamefully!

854
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,777
No, no, no, no, Jack!

855
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,717
Now look what
you've done!

856
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,449
My bugs!
My bugs!

857
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:44,617
My bugs!

858
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:48,025
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!

859
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,690
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs!

860
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,257
My bugs! My bugs!

861
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,737
Forgive me,
Mr. Claws.

862
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,572
- I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.
- Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

863
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:08,208
The next time you get the urge
to take over someone else's
holiday, I'd listen to her.

864
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:12,378
She's the only one who makes any sense
around this insane asylum!

865
01:08:12,487 --> 01:08:15,753
- Skeletons, boogie men--
- I hope there's still time.

866
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:19,418
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!

867
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:22,225
I'm Santa Claus!

868
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,666
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.

869
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,800
- How did you get down here, Sally?
- Oh, I-I was trying to--

870
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:38,676
- Well, I wanted to, to--
- To help me.

871
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,180
- I couldn't let you just--
- Sally.

872
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,219
I can't believe I never
realized that you--

873
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,583
Jack! Jack!

874
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,350
- Here he is!
- Alive! Just like we said!

875
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,121
Grab ahold, my boy!

876
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,287
Whoa!

877
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:57,332
Good news, folks.
Santa Claus, the one and only,

878
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:59,627
has finally been spotted.

879
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:02,728
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling
at supersonic speed.

880
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:05,329
He's setting things right,

881
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,001
bringing joy and cheer
wherever he goes.

882
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,569
Yes, Kriss Kringle has pulled it out
of the bag and delivered Christmas...

883
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,844
to excited children all over the world.

884
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,113
# La la la la #
# la la-la-la #

885
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,280
# La la la la #
# la la-la-la #

886
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,881
- Jack's back!
- Jack?

887
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,689
- Jack's okay!
- He's all right!

888
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:29,662
# Jack's okay #
# and he's back #

889
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,199
- # Oh, yea #
- # He's all right #

890
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,201
# Let's shout #
# Make a fuss #

891
01:09:34,302 --> 01:09:36,863
# Scream it out #
# Wheee #

892
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,338
# Jack is back now #
# Everyone sing #

893
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,969
# In the town #
# of Halloween #

894
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,878
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!

895
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,247
Happy Halloween!

896
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:54,015
Merry Christmas!

897
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:56,216
- What's this?
- # What's this #

898
01:09:56,324 --> 01:09:58,225
# I haven't got #
# a clue #

899
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,261
- # What's this #
- # Why, it's completely new #

900
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,662
- # Must be a Christmas thing #
- # What's this #

901
01:10:03,765 --> 01:10:06,394
# It's really #
# very strange #

902
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:15,435
# This is Halloween #
# Halloween, Halloween #

903
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,207
# Halloween #
# What's this, what's this #

904
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:27,087
Careful,
my precious jewel.

905
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:58,182
# My dearest friend #
# if you don't mind #

906
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:04,247
# I'd like to join you #
# by your side #

907
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:06,658
# Where we can gaze #

908
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:10,493
# Into the stars #

909
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,162
# And sit together #

910
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:19,297
# Now and forever #

911
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,935
# For it is plain #

912
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:27,277
# As anyone can see #

913
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:33,378
# We're simply #
# meant to be #
