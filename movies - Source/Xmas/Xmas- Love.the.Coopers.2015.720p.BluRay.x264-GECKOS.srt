1
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Ah, the holidays.
The most wonderful time of the year.

2
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,963
And so, begins my tale.

3
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,020
On the snowy morning of Christmas Eve,

4
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,043
as Charlotte Cooper
set out her 37th snow globe,

5
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,284
trying to create
the perfect Christmas for her family,

6
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,971
she remembered a moment, she'd hoped
she could hold on to forever.

7
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,245
Meanwhile, her husband, Sam Cooper,
who I can read pretty well,

8
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,247
was recalling the moment
just after that moment...

9
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,091
trying to remember
if he knew he was happy,

10
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,926
at the same time,
the happiness was going on.

11
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,210
And, their beloved dog, Rag,

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,489
remembered how good
it felt to be a Christmas present.

13
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,490
And all over town,

14
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,326
the Cooper clan, and then some,
were starting their morning too.

15
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,170
Who are all these people?

16
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,325
Well, that's the story.

17
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,009
I can't just give it away.

18
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,259
But for now, they're
heading into their holiday,

19
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,930
searching for comfort
and a little more joy.

20
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,407
- That's fine. Make gingerbread houses.
- All right.

21
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,370
Can you just have them at my
front door at 9:00 am?

22
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,806
Yeah, but, it's Christmas morning.
What if they want to sleep in?

23
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,180
What kid sleeps in on Christmas morning?

24
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,361
- I don't know.
- Why do you have to change things?

25
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,368
God forbid, I wanna spend another
15 minutes with my kids.

26
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,169
Why'd you have to be such a dick?

27
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,060
- Merry Christmas.
- Season's Greetings.

28
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,206
Merry Christmas.

29
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,889
We hope to see you tonight, Angie.

30
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,329
Hey, Charlie, Merry Christmas.

31
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,130
Don't take that personally.

32
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,242
Take it as a group, he hates everybody.

33
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,163
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

34
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,649
- Merry Christmas, Bo.
- Merry Christmas.

35
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,603
Charlie, please don't
ditch your brother at the mall.

36
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,045
Thank you for taking Madison today.
I really appreciate it.

37
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,487
I can't be late for work.

38
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,939
But it's Christmas eve, Hank. Come on.

39
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,120
Yeah, I know.

40
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,764
Job's a job, right?

41
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,659
Madison's been doing this weird thing.

42
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,939
I made the mistake
of laughing at it the first time.

43
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,326
So, now she does it all the time.

44
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,211
Do me a favor.
When she does it, don't laugh.

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,170
And then, hopefully,
she'll just stop doing it on her own.

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,646
- Sure. Of course.
- What is it?

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,899
- Hi!
- Hi, Madison.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,220
There she is.

49
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,420
Grandma and Grandpa are here,
they're going to take you for the day.

50
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,841
- Can you say, "Hi"?
- You're such a dick.

51
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,209
- Dad, don't.
- Stop it.

52
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,004
Okay, let's go.

53
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,209
As Ruby served her 19th Holiday Special,

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,644
she remembered serving
Christmas dinner to her brothers.

55
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,163
While her mother, six eggnogs to the wind,

56
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,163
was passed out on the couch.

57
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,247
Although her childhood had left
her feeling separate from the world,

58
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,480
Ruby felt an unexpected connection
to Bucky Newport.

59
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,367
For the last five years, she looked forward
to starting her mornings with him.

60
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,283
She loved how he wore
a suit and bow tie, every day,

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,163
just like did when he was a teacher.

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,808
Always straightening it
and only making it worse.

63
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,091
Good morning. I'm furious with you.

64
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,326
- What'd I do?
- That ending shattered me.

65
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,521
Well, it's supposed to.

66
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,886
That's what makes it one of the most
significant endings in the history of film.

67
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,259
But Chaplin's face...

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,730
Full of hope and fear and shame and
embarrassment and God knows what else.

69
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,367
But the genius was that
it's his subconscious autobiography.

70
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,649
He had fallen in love with several

71
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,684
young women over the years
and he was their mentor.

72
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,579
But, he was endlessly terrified that

73
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,329
they're going see him as he saw himself.

74
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,841
Which is nothing but a busker,
in the streets of London.

75
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,399
It's amazing.

76
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,379
Bucky looked away from Ruby, because,

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,608
oddly, he felt closer to her
than anyone in his life.

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,487
He understood the absurdity
of the situation.

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,860
He had shown her 67 movies.
Ate at her diner, daily.

80
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,370
And hated the food there.

81
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,007
You want the special?

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,843
- What day is today?
- Friday.

83
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,441
Friday? It's not so special.

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,606
How about Wednesday's?

85
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,245
Or Thursday's hash browns?

86
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,125
- Sold.
- Hey, Ruby.

87
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,321
The coffee's cold.

88
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,920
You'll be fine.

89
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,560
Sit down.

90
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,365
Spending Christmas with the family?

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,887
Ruby recalled the joys of gift giving.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Nope.

93
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,925
Believe me, I understand.

94
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,928
Christmas comes around, somebody yells,

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,841
"Time for comfort and joy,
it's Christmas."

96
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,290
Everybody panics as if
you can schedule happiness.

97
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,379
Can't do it.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,605
You going to your daughter's?

99
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,122
Oh, yes. She's a very good cook.

100
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,300
I don't know where
she got it from, because

101
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,326
when their mother died, the only thing
I could teach her was, how to order out.

102
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,805
I don't know what it is.
Everything is a contest with my girls.

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,728
Except, I have no idea what the prize is.

104
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,168
I try to ease the tension,
but they don't really hear me.

105
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,365
Hey, Ruby, my coffee's still cold.

106
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,124
Why don't you come over here
and warm me up?

107
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,365
Sorry, I got to go.

108
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,250
Clearly, an emergency.

109
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,567
I just don't feel like
spending any money on her.

110
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,161
She never spends a dime on me.

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,966
My own sister.

112
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,009
You know what she'll do.
She'll make a donation in my name.

113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,129
Oh, that's really festive.

114
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,244
And they never say how big a donation,

115
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,603
so there's no way of knowing
how much I'm supposed to spend.

116
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,420
I am tempted to get
the rattiest thing I can find,

117
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,807
just to see my sister Charlotte's face.

118
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,009
Hold on. I'll call you back.

119
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,205
When Emma was a little girl,

120
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,846
she overheard her parents say that
her sister, Charlotte, was planned,

121
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,803
but, that she was an accident.

122
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,440
She faithfully behaved
like one, ever since.

123
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,525
Ma'am, we need to detain you.

124
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,166
Give it, to me.

125
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,681
Come on. Let's just make
life easier on everybody.

126
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,600
Spit it out.

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,605
Spit it out.

128
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,764
Give it, to me.

129
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
Merry Christmas.

130
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,687
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Best ever.

131
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,041
- Thank you.
- Our last number

132
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,691
is one of my aunt's favorites.
So, this is for you.

133
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,927
Aunt Fishy.

134
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,568
Rags! Get down, Rags.

135
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,801
Okay, then. Ready, Mrs. Pinkins?

136
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,966
Hit it.

137
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
Joy to the world The Lord has come

138
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,220
Let earth...

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,243
That's not the right lyric.

140
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,769
I'm sorry, Mitzi. But I think it is.

141
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,005
From the top, please.

142
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,567
I'm not going to play to the wrong lyric.

143
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,966
Don't play it, Mitzi.

144
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,606
Mitzi's right.

145
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,580
- It's not the right lyric.
- Of course, it's the lyric.

146
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,044
Joy to the world, the Lord has come.

147
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,523
No, it's not the Lord has come
like God reached orgasm. Please...

148
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,441
What?

149
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,567
Mitzi!

150
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,881
Well, so, Merry Christmas, everyone.

151
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,168
I think that ends our little program.

152
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,486
Thank you so much.
You've been a wonderful audience.

153
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,090
We will be back next year.

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,846
But, will they?

155
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,139
You don't have to worry about that
after tonight, that's for sure.

156
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,764
You don't have to say it like you're never

157
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,120
going to see me again, Charlotte.
I'm not dying.

158
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,809
No. But, we are.

159
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,841
Hey, Tinkerbell.

160
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,331
Aware of the growing distance
between her parents,

161
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,561
Eleanor Cooper found herself
drawn to public displays of affection.

162
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,245
She remembered a time in her life
she had not been so guarded.

163
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,965
This is quite fun.

164
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,249
If you show me yours, I'll show you mine.

165
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,885
Okay?

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,650
She remembered a moment
she'd wished she could forget,

167
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,528
the day a stolen kiss caught her eye.

168
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,049
She recognized that kiss.

169
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,129
It was her fiancé's.

170
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,524
Eleanor was shattered.

171
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,010
Alas, she could never climb the wall
that built up around her heart.

172
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,846
Still, Eleanor secretly
searched out strangers' faces,

173
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,765
for the moment they flickered
with unguarded emotion.

174
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,408
Can I have a Dirty Martini,
shaken over ice, please?

175
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,841
I'd be honored to buy you a drink.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,321
- I can pay for my drink. Thank you.
- Not you.

177
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,046
Thanks.

178
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,009
I'll have a Dirty Martini,
shaken over ice.

179
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,164
Put the presents
for the kids in the trunk.

180
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,879
And I'll get your tip, next time.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,081
No problem.

182
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,442
And take the Internet, it's faster.

183
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,966
You got it, Aunt Fishy.

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,322
My nephew called me that.

185
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,489
He and wife are going to Africa
and I'm babysitting the kids.

186
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,966
I'm your nephew. Can you remember my name?

187
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,086
Sam.

188
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,561
Yes. I'm Sam, that's great.

189
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,004
I know your name.

190
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,963
I'm not a zombie.

191
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,820
You better step on it.

192
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,445
You're going to miss your plane.

193
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,808
Aunt Fishy, that was 30 years ago.

194
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,201
Really?

195
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,250
Well, how was the trip?

196
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,561
We didn't go.

197
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,162
But you were dying to go.

198
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,280
And, you and Charlotte,
saved your money for years.

199
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,004
We had a rough year, so we postponed it.

200
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,442
Oh, Sammy. And then you never went.

201
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,160
Weren't you supposed to go,
again, this year?

202
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,769
Yes, we were.

203
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,610
Who can say what ends a marriage?

204
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,201
Perhaps, it's unreasonable to ask
human beings to grow at exactly

205
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,886
the same rate, for 40 years,
six months and three days.

206
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,880
But the canceled trip was the last straw.

207
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,481
And Sam was moving out.

208
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,320
You seem out of sorts.
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,760
As Hank Cooper waited for his 17th
job interview in the past month,

210
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,009
he wondered how long he could keep up

211
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,488
the lie that he was still
taking family portraits at Sears.

212
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,700
Big smiles, guys.

213
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,740
You're going to have this picture
for the rest of your lives.

214
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,206
It's going on a wall. All right,
right here. Ready?

215
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,040
Yes.

216
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:58,059
He missed his job helping
unhappy families appear happy.

217
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,082
Love the sweaters, right? Chipper.

218
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,460
Yes. And that's beautiful.

219
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,890
It was his superpower.

220
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,682
Unexpectedly, he thought of a woman
he saw just once and never again.

221
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,730
Then, he thought of the automated
voice that had replaced him.

222
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,884
Merry Christmas. Toes on the line. Cheese.

223
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,365
Did that voice have children?

224
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,761
Did they now have unaffordable gifts
on their Christmas lists, too?

225
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,486
Dear Santa, please
bring me a blue bicycle.

226
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,687
I'll be waking up at my father's,
but opening presents at my mom's.

227
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,162
Hank thought of the unbridled
joy he had, Christmas mornings.

228
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,570
Mister Cooper?

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,402
Determined, Hank entered
the office, with his left foot.

230
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,884
He'd read, this was lucky.

231
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,340
I want to thank you for taking
the time to speak with me, today.

232
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,460
I really appreciate it.

233
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,539
I know that you're not actually
hiring anyone, till the new year,

234
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,971
but just know that...

235
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm ready to work now.

236
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,250
You know, I could
start today, if you needed it.

237
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,206
I take pride in my work.

238
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,202
I take a lot of pride in my work. I...

239
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,802
At my last job, if a family took a bad
picture, I insisted on taking another,

240
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,126
because I care. I care. I just...

241
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,366
I hated the idea of anyone
sending out a bad holiday card.

242
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,801
You know, you don't get another shot
at that, for a whole year.

243
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,730
You know how many
relatives are going to see that?

244
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,769
Who's going to care about that now, Bob?

245
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,166
Who's going to care about that?

246
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,279
Dude, you are way too
intense, for Staples.

247
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,525
So what your deal? What do you do?

248
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,328
I am a writer.

249
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,100
Wow. All right.

250
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,220
What do you write?

251
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,607
Are you familiar with the Pottery Barn
Catalog, Outdoor Furniture Edition?

252
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,441
All weather wicker.

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,331
You know my work?

254
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,539
I write plays, actually.
I don't know why... Yeah.

255
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,403
- Wow. That's cool.
- Yeah.

256
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,323
My last play was almost produced.

257
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,169
And then...

258
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,370
my lead actor, slash, ventriloquist,

259
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,565
left for a paying job.

260
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,283
He was a Republican, naturally.

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,365
Republican ventriloquist.

262
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,409
Oh, no. No.

263
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,607
You're way too cute to be a Republican.

264
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,168
Well, the good news is
I'm not a ventriloquist.

265
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,368
Just tell me you're not one
of those churchy Republicans,

266
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,205
who believes in Fox News,
but not evolution.

267
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,482
Okay. If man evolved
from monkeys and apes,

268
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,530
why are there still, monkeys and apes?

269
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,524
It's funny because my dog asked me
the same thing about wolves yesterday.

270
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,085
All right.

271
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,961
- Look, you believe in God, right?
- Which one?

272
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,923
Any one, just pick one.

273
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,009
They all need too much validation, for me.

274
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,245
It's all, "Love me most or go to hell."

275
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,362
I have a hard time believing
I'm less needy than God.

276
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,401
Yeah, I have a hard time believing
you are too.

277
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,486
- So you don't believe in much, do you?
- You know what I believe in?

278
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,808
I believe in the sound
of Nina Simone's voice.

279
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,761
I feel like that is the closest
I'll ever come to believing in God.

280
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,642
- I haven't heard her.
- Wow.

281
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,250
- Sorry.
- It'll make you a convert.

282
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,339
What are you doing
in an airport bar, anyway?

283
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,010
Shouldn't you be with
your people in denying science,

284
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,320
or wherever you're from?

285
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,247
I'm just trying to get home,
but everything's snowed in.

286
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Isn't that, what you're doing here?

287
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,450
No, I flew in to see my family.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,700
I have to be there at 5:00.

289
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,201
I'm just here to kill an hour or six.

290
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,086
All right.

291
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,240
Hey...

292
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,001
I hope Eleanor's plane wasn't delayed.

293
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,050
And something's up with Hank.

294
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,691
He always does that weird piglet snort,
whenever he's trying to hide something.

295
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,980
People snort, Charlotte.

296
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,401
No. This is not a universal snort, like...

297
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,480
It's not. It's a kind of a... It's...

298
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,925
It's specific like...

299
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,921
It's...

300
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,681
Merry Christmas, anyway. All right.

301
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,606
Oh, my goodness, look.

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,324
Oh, I've got a surprise for you, Madison.

303
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,603
This is genuine, "guess what," look...

304
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,084
- Gingerbread house.
- Yes.

305
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,299
Maybe I should bake a peppermint cake.

306
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,380
- Why?
- Because it's Christmas, Sam.

307
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,323
For God's sake, it's Christmas.

308
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,019
You can't cook this away, Charlotte.

309
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,819
People are going to look back
on tonight and realize

310
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,762
it was all a performance.
We should have, at least,

311
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,410
warned them before they came.

312
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,205
No, but I want them to wanna come,
that's the whole point.

313
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,528
This is the only time of the year
when we're all together.

314
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,282
And it's our last chance to feel
like a family before we tell them.

315
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,500
I want the kids to have the memory
of one last perfect Christmas.

316
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,619
And I know that you think
that I'm ridiculous...

317
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,420
No, I don't think you're being ridiculous.

318
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,727
Under the circumstances, yeah,
you are being a little ridiculous.

319
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,650
...Comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

320
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,242
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

321
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,681
We clearly have a major
difference of opinion

322
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,740
and I can understand why you are wrong.

323
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,500
If you treat them
like they're not resilient,

324
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,980
they're going to be not resilient.

325
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,923
Hank is still reeling from the divorce...

326
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,019
and you know... I'm sorry, okay, go ahead.

327
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,361
No, you go ahead.
I'll listen. I feel like a fraud.

328
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,900
The whole thing feels wrong.
I'm going to tell them the truth.

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,220
- We'll all be together.
- Wait a minute.

330
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,579
No, we made an agreement.

331
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,500
You cannot break an agreement,
mid-agreement.

332
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,460
- I disagree.
- No, you agreed to the agreement.

333
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,500
You agreed to one last Christmas
and then you can just move out.

334
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,203
You want to leave,
you can just go ahead and leave.

335
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,560
You're the one who chose not to go.

336
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,380
You don't care enough about
the marriage to make...

337
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,768
Will the parents of
the lost child in aisle seven

338
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,287
please come up to the front and claim her?

339
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,171
You're such a dick.

340
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,770
Oh, my God.

341
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,564
Bo was on a mission.

342
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,324
He had to find the perfect gift
that would bring back his brother,

343
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,086
who had become an alien
since his parents' divorce.

344
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,968
That gift had to have healing powers
and it had to be cheap.

345
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,605
He even sacrificed
his one-on-one with Santa.

346
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,220
Nothing about this mission was easy.

347
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,527
But, Bo would not be thwarted.

348
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,449
This is a while misunderstanding.

349
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,931
Look, I'm somebody's mother.

350
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,779
I have three kids. They're teenagers.

351
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,961
They're teenagers.

352
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,969
Already, they don't take me seriously.

353
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,410
My husband's an ethics professor.

354
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,171
He'll never forgive me.

355
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,726
My entire family is coming over at 5:00
for Christmas dinner, which I have to cook.

356
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,086
Please. Don't you have any compassion?

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,082
- So, it's all a misunderstanding?
- Yes.

358
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,810
Okay. So, clear it up.

359
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,085
How'd the jewels get in your mouth?

360
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,204
- Right. This way.
- I though it was a lozenge.

361
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,603
Shortly after his mother moved out,

362
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,730
Charlie felt as unclaimed
as a lost Christmas package,

363
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,968
lying in the back corner
of the post office.

364
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,567
In spite of this, he arrived at the mall,
vowing he would kiss Lauren Hesselberg,

365
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,047
once and for all, or die trying.

366
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,080
Unnerved, he began to watch himself.

367
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,250
He told himself to coolly say,
"What's up, Lauren? What's up?"

368
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,445
Hey, Lauren.

369
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,766
Hey, Charlie.

370
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,046
What you doing here?

371
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,605
I work here.

372
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,885
Of course.

373
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,940
When, at last, he stood in front of her,

374
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,645
a clear directive repeated
itself in his mind,

375
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,369
"Don't look at her boobs.

376
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,000
"Do not look at her boobs."

377
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,002
I love the way Stewart does a little
food dance when his meal arrives.

378
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,486
And how Sarah still puts
lipstick on for Hal.

379
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,290
I like the way Paula Anderson rests her
breasts on the table, as if they were tired.

380
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,000
We were so sad to see you go, Ruby.
I'm gonna miss you.

381
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,728
- Take care, okay? Bye guys.
- Merry Christmas.

382
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,044
You're going somewhere?

383
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,480
It's my last day.

384
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,525
- What?
- Yeah.

385
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,243
You tell the lady with the lipstick
on her teeth and you don't tell me?

386
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,681
I don't... I didn't know how to tell you.

387
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,099
It's like that movie you gave me,
Born Yesterday, right,

388
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,645
when Billie Dawn walks out on Harry Brock.

389
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,080
There's a better kind of life
than the one I got.

390
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,768
You told me, right here, you said,

391
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,643
"Starting over, you could
be the hero of your own life."

392
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,644
You can be a hero, here.

393
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,927
Where are you going?

394
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,931
Hot Coffee, Mississippi.

395
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,180
I found it on a map
when I was 14 years old.

396
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,362
It seems like the perfect place
for a waitress.

397
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,019
Look, I don't understand. I'm confused.

398
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,124
You've never even been there. It's
the worst idea I've ever heard of.

399
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,242
But I... I want to start over. I need...

400
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,259
I need a change.

401
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,760
No. Leaving doesn't change anything.

402
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,529
Everything just comes with you.

403
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,925
Hot Coffee, Mississippi?

404
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,201
That's a place? It's like
a line from a sitcom.

405
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,320
Bucky.

406
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,819
You're a bird watcher.
You watch us all from a distance.

407
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,651
- We're just characters that amuse you.
- Not true.

408
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,339
You love everybody at arm's length,
keep it up and you'll end up alone, Ruby.

409
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,124
That's a terrible thing to say to me.

410
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,611
Well, it's a terrible thing to watch.

411
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,925
It's very cowardly.

412
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,641
So, in other words,
you think that I'm a coward.

413
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,330
No. Not in other words,
those are the words.

414
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,641
You think you can run away,
hiding in Hot Chocolate?

415
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,131
You're a coward.

416
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,721
You can pay up front.

417
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,884
You tell everybody at the restaurant
you're leaving and you don't tell me.

418
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,559
May I ask you something?

419
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,205
Is this something that they teach you
at the Police Academy?

420
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,249
Or have you always been a robot?

421
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,500
I can understand that you
need professional distance,

422
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,170
from a hardened criminal.

423
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,285
But, when there's a poor
downtrodden housewife,

424
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,210
sobbing in the back of your car,
on Christmas, one has to wonder.

425
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,368
I'm guessing it's something
they teach you.

426
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,244
No one's born that way.

427
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,280
Though Officer Williams never engaged
with suspects in the back of his car,

428
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,607
Emma unknowingly pierced his armor.

429
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,325
I'm not a robot.

430
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,126
What?

431
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,407
I have feelings, just like everyone else.

432
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,980
Would you like to talk about it?

433
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,490
I'm not talking to you.

434
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,563
- Take me to your leader.
- Shut up.

435
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,040
Listen.

436
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,368
You landed in a pot of jam, arresting me.

437
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,805
I've been a doctor for 20 years.

438
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,047
People pay me a lot
to listen to their problems.

439
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,365
You're a head-shrinker?

440
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,180
What Emma did not know
was that Officer Williams

441
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,805
had once sought out counseling,

442
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,527
but couldn't get over the fact
that he would have to talk.

443
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,561
And we're off, with Rudolph,
right here, to see Santa.

444
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,608
And Donner, and Vixen...

445
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,563
And Blitzen and Nixon...

446
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,243
Look at this. It's beautiful.

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,481
Silent Night reminded Charlotte
of a part of herself that now felt

448
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,522
inescapably out of her grasp.

449
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,800
She caroled to deflect the fact that
she missed that person...

450
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,609
as much as Sam did.

451
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,088
All is bright

452
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,844
Brown young virgin

453
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,611
Mother and child...

454
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,800
What?

455
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,126
Really? You think it's a song about
a brown young virgin?

456
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,560
- And her mother and her child.
- Oh, my God.

457
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,420
I didn't write the song, Charlotte.

458
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,884
Look, Sam, I was a music teacher.

459
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,931
Round. That's what it is.
She's a round young virgin.

460
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,042
Yeah, it's much better. Very Christmassy.

461
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,420
Don't worry. We're going.

462
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,420
Off we go. Next stop, where?

463
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,127
To see the one, the only, Santa.

464
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,249
And, Santa's army of helpers.

465
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,329
- Right.
- It's Santa's brothers.

466
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,164
Anta, Janta, Mylanta...

467
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,288
Oh, man, look at that. They...

468
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,050
I love moments where people
are so unchecked, so unselfconscious.

469
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,730
I know. It's ridiculous.
I like watching people.

470
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,363
I just love that moment
when a face floods with feeling.

471
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,001
Oh, I get it. I do.

472
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,760
All right.

473
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,080
Hit the pool?

474
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,324
Yeah. Oh, God.

475
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,481
Where'd you go? Bailey?

476
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,247
Bailey? Oh, thank God.

477
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,619
I thought you were gone.
That is very effective camo.

478
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,881
All right.

479
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,810
Did you always want to join the army?

480
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,401
It's a long story.

481
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,246
Father in the military?

482
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,250
Short story, really.

483
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,125
It was the right thing to do.

484
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,684
Hey, I admire it.

485
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,565
I can't imagine putting my life
on the line for anything.

486
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,161
What if I was wrong?

487
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,442
That certainty, that's amazing.

488
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,844
- Thank you.
- In like a...

489
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,040
corporate-loving, government-trusting,
gung-ho kind of way.

490
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,779
As opposed to your mistrusting,

491
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,565
sideline-hugging, passive sort of way.

492
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,080
- Right.
- Yeah.

493
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,644
How does your family
feel about you leaving?

494
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,241
They're happy I'm finally getting
my life together.

495
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,363
Yeah. They haven't seen me
since I looked like...

496
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,361
this.

497
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,361
Oh, wow!

498
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,779
That's an extreme transformation!

499
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,339
That's incredible. Can I keep this?

500
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,169
I'm going to need to keep this. Wow!

501
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,887
How long have you felt robotic?

502
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,401
I don't.

503
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,122
I see, so you believe you're
in touch with your feelings then?

504
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,208
- Yes.
- Both of them?

505
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,810
Apparently...

506
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,125
I...

507
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,211
have trouble expressing myself
in relationships.

508
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,921
- How old are you?
- I just turned 40.

509
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,041
And, how's your sex life?

510
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,619
How's your sex life?

511
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,099
I have sex with people, okay? But...

512
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,929
But you don't connect emotionally?

513
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,204
And what's your biggest fear?

514
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,449
That I'll end up alone.

515
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,290
And gay.

516
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,286
What?

517
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,488
You're 40, you're single.

518
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,684
- "People" sleep with you?
- Are you serious?

519
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,964
- Are you gay?
- No!

520
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,445
Only in bed.

521
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,040
You all right, Grandpa?

522
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,567
Yes, yes, exceptional. Never better.

523
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,000
How did it go?

524
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,803
Exceptional. Never better.

525
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,526
That bad?

526
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,170
Yeah, what the hell am I going to do?

527
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,410
I got to find a job by the new year.

528
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,923
You don't have to find a job
by the new year,

529
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,339
that's an arbitrary deadline.

530
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,885
You can find it January 11th,
March 17th, it makes no difference.

531
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,440
I'll lend you the money.

532
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,685
I don't want to be that guy.

533
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,201
I like that guy, he's a very fine guy.

534
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,082
Well, then, what shall we get Charlotte?

535
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,840
Poinsettias or poinsettias?

536
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,445
How about poinsettias?

537
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,319
Good idea.

538
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,730
I got it, I'll take care of it.

539
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,080
That's all right. No, no, I got it.

540
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,660
- I got it.
- I got it!

541
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,603
I got the god damned flowers!

542
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,700
You get the flowers.

543
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,006
$8.99.

544
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,730
I'll get that back for you.

545
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,807
Hank, you don't have to hide this
from your family.

546
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,964
They're your family.

547
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,969
I don't want to ruin Christmas for Mom.

548
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,209
Well, then tell Angie. She will
understand if the alimony is late.

549
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,807
No, I was a failure at marriage.
I refuse to be a failure at divorce.

550
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,019
You're not a failure. Some marriages
have a shelf life, that's all.

551
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,929
But you and Angie were never happy.

552
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,724
Angie was always looking over
her shoulder for what she didn't have.

553
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,365
FOMO.

554
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,922
- FOMO?
- Fear of missing out.

555
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,380
We fought about it all the time.

556
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,579
Look, I understand. There's history there,

557
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,220
you were high school sweethearts.

558
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,651
No, that...

559
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,326
That's not true.

560
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,888
We were not sweethearts.
That is family fiction.

561
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,569
We were lab partners.

562
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,084
We dissected rats together.

563
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,127
Then, out of nowhere...

564
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,883
band practice at Travis Howard's
house, Angie pounced on me...

565
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,443
while My Sharona was playing.

566
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,619
I got as far as... And then, boom! Done.

567
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,299
I became a dad, same day I failed Biology.

568
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,140
Listen, don't let this one moment
define your entire life.

569
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,980
I'm telling you this from the heart now.

570
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,820
Angie talks while she chews
with her mouth wide open!

571
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,206
It's like a fireman's hose.

572
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,885
It speaks of her character.

573
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,980
She's worse than my Aunt Edna.

574
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,260
Look, Hank, I had kids young,
just like you did.

575
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,965
I had to raise them while I was
still raising myself.

576
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,846
Trust me, this is one small chapter
in your great, big life.

577
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,485
Go out and get some!

578
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,728
- Just get some?
- Get some.

579
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,003
It's... The thing is...

580
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,326
Yes?

581
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,485
You've only been with Angie?

582
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,130
Yes, that is the thing.

583
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,168
This is solvable.
This is a solvable problem.

584
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,420
Doesn't it suck how we can
want to run from our families,

585
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,045
but impress them at the same time?

586
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,844
I just disappoint mine.

587
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,125
I think the build up to facing their
disappointment is actually the worst part.

588
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,083
"Anticappointment," I call it.

589
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,686
I can't face the anticappointment.

590
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,400
Is that why you're avoiding them?

591
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,739
I just hate the holidays.

592
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,780
I hate having to reduce
everything I'm doing

593
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,688
down to a sound byte and then defend it.

594
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,599
And I just...

595
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,007
I hate reverting back to how
everyone saw me.

596
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,603
- Maybe you should join the army.
- Yeah.

597
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,166
Are you scared?

598
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,927
No.

599
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,561
Here.

600
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,199
Take that.

601
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,523
How about a little Nina Simone?

602
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,601
Even though he knew he would
never see her again,

603
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,489
Joe would always remember
this amazing moment,

604
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,121
that only happened in his mind.

605
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,800
You know what, Madison?

606
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,539
Guess what, you can really see
the North Pole from up here.

607
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,050
Did you know that?

608
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,807
This is your daddy's favorite place
in the whole wide world!

609
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,420
Three for the red lane, please.

610
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,099
You know, or maybe what we could do is

611
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,340
we could join Aunt Fishy for
a nice cup of hot cocoa.

612
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,659
What a wonderful view.
This was so much fun. Let's go.

613
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,699
Oh, come on. We're not shooting
her out of a cannon.

614
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,860
You used to love those.

615
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,610
Where is your sense of adventure?

616
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,579
- Buried in a good book?
- No!

617
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,081
I am not, you are...
That's just ridiculous!

618
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,088
Come on, Madison.
Let's just go. We're gonna show him.

619
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,603
Nice and easy does it, right, sweetheart?

620
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,320
Every time I go home, I'm told it's so
okay that I am not in a relationship.

621
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,971
It's so okay.

622
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,925
So, how come you're not?

623
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,126
How come you're not?

624
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,840
Who says I'm not?

625
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,847
I'm not.

626
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,201
Yeah, I just wanted to see
your reaction, if you thought I was.

627
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,246
- Okay.
- Are you?

628
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,083
I don't know. Sort of.

629
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,804
He couldn't get away for the holidays.

630
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,206
Prison?

631
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,405
He's with his wife.

632
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,686
Yeah.

633
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,570
Yeah, that's not the kind of thing you'd
want to share with mom and dad, huh?

634
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,125
No, I don't like to brag.

635
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,364
Wait, look.

636
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,284
I don't believe in marriage, okay?
Love fades.

637
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,840
Yeah, so?

638
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,405
Every time a face floods,
that's over a new relationship.

639
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,099
- Right?
- No.

640
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,327
Don't do that. Don't throw me up to me.

641
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,403
Do you even know any
happily married people?

642
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,567
Yeah, my parents.

643
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,570
I mean, you know what I'm worried about,

644
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,460
is that I'm never going to find
what they have.

645
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,925
I'm worried that I will.

646
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,679
The second we left the house,
my parents' marriage imploded.

647
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,289
They fight all the time now.

648
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,606
So do mine.

649
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,001
- You just said they were happy.
- Passionate.

650
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,804
- Ugly.
- Honest.

651
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,367
Heartbreaking.

652
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,922
- So, who was he?
- What?

653
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,980
This guy that messed with your head.
I mean it's got to be somebody right?

654
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,969
Otherwise, you wouldn't settle
for a married guy.

655
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,403
You think he's going to leave
his wife for you?

656
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,567
Nope. That was never on the table.

657
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,322
And, besides, we live in different states.

658
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,400
That's good.

659
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,530
Wouldn't want to go
wasting your life, right?

660
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,128
You want to know what's a waste of a life?

661
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,646
A know it all with
a freshly shaved mullet,

662
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,059
who slaps on a uniform and thinks
it gives him the moral high ground.

663
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,766
When, really, he's just risking
his life to please his dad.

664
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,686
Best of luck.

665
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,726
Does your mother know?

666
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,730
She knew before I did.

667
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,161
How do you know?

668
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,001
Listen, if it's hard to talk about,

669
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,086
maybe a little role-play can free you up.

670
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,487
I could play your mom and you be you.

671
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,760
Hi, sweetie!

672
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,610
Hi, Mom.

673
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,561
Stop. You're not doing you right.

674
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,246
- What?
- You're not a robot yet.

675
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,369
You're still a little kid.

676
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,402
I'll be you, you be Mom.

677
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,369
Hi, Mom. It was career day at school.

678
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,099
And Odell said that he wanted to be
a podiatrist like his dad.

679
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,329
And I said, I wanted to be...

680
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,125
Percy, don't gesture so much
when you talk.

681
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,980
Well, Kenisha said that she wanted to...

682
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,003
Percy, stop tilting your head.

683
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,804
Percy, stand with your legs apart.

684
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:36,123
Percy, don't smile so big.

685
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,403
I said that I wanted to be...

686
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,286
An explorer.

687
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,601
And now you wear a "Do not enter"
sign across your chest.

688
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,166
You couldn't be a gay man, so you
became a stereotype of a man.

689
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,443
Oh, it's so sad.

690
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,300
The things we do in our childhood,

691
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,050
just to fit in, make us stand apart
as adults.

692
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,521
Cold, hard truth is, when I was asked
what I wanted to be when I grew up,

693
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,887
I never said, "alone."

694
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,043
You feel alone with three teenagers?

695
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,539
Oh, them. No. I lied.
I don't have any kids.

696
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,722
- I don't even have a husband.
- What?

697
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,860
Yeah. I knew you'd think, "She's alone,

698
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,610
"she's not getting any younger.
Of course, she'd swallow a brooch."

699
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,059
I opened up to you and you lied to me.

700
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,780
No, I lied before you opened up.

701
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,340
I would never lie to you now.

702
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,806
The conversation part
of this arrest is over.

703
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,005
What?

704
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,603
That scream you made,
coming down the hill.

705
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,083
Is that the Whitehead kid?

706
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,244
The one we used to call Schnozzle?

707
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,487
Quick, quick, what was his name?

708
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,568
- Skippy.
- Don't say, "Skippy."

709
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,771
Oh, here.

710
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,684
Hey. Think you can drop me at the mall?

711
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,519
- Get in.
- All right.

712
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,086
Thanks.

713
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,619
Seriously, what's his name?
I can't remember.

714
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,925
Schnozington.

715
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,326
Get in the back, Rags.

716
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,780
Does your mom know you're out hitchhiking?

717
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,009
No, she took my keys away when
she caught me with pot in the car.

718
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,159
Well...

719
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,925
What?

720
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,530
It's not like we never
got stoned, Charlotte.

721
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:52,900
- We grew up in the '60s.
- You grew up in the '60s?

722
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,206
Cool!

723
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,940
- Hear that, Charlotte?
- What?

724
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:57,724
Schnozzle Whitehead thinks we're cool.

725
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,041
Wait. What did you call me?

726
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:07,099
Yeah we used to... It was groovy.

727
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:08,724
We knocked around. We went to concerts.

728
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,251
Charlotte met Bob Dylan.

729
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,260
Are you serious? What was he like?

730
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,059
No, I only met him
for a couple of seconds.

731
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,128
Till security dragged you off of him.

732
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:18,681
- Were you guys hippies?
- Yeah!

733
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,260
- No.
- What do you mean, "No"?

734
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,260
Oh, my God!

735
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,820
She used to speak at rallies,

736
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,967
in front of anybody.
You should have heard her.

737
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,179
No, it's just that I liked
how loud my voice sounded

738
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,780
over the microphone. It's nothing at all.

739
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,248
Oh, no. You were fearless,
man, you had passion.

740
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,807
I don't remember much of that at all.

741
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:41,449
You don't remember that day?

742
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,045
No.

743
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:47,681
Really?

744
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:52,963
That was a long time ago, when...

745
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,125
That was our...

746
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,530
first time, huh?

747
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:05,449
Your idea to go up in the woods.

748
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,168
That was not. I followed you, I did.

749
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,922
Oh, no I followed you.

750
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:13,690
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

751
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,085
Yeah, neither could your dog.

752
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,731
Who could blame him?

753
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,889
You can just let me out here.

754
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,445
If you want.

755
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,641
Right here is good, actually.

756
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,405
Look, I crossed the line.

757
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,340
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

758
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,565
I came on a little strong.

759
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,219
No, I shouldn't have said that.
That was below the belt.

760
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,766
I wouldn't let it go. It's on me.
All right?

761
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,041
It's true. It is your fault.

762
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,840
You're a total hussy.

763
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,170
Look, sometimes things happen...

764
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,523
when you're not even looking for it.

765
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,164
- He tell you that?
- Yeah.

766
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Great.

767
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,619
I would love to have fallen for
someone as presentable as you.

768
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:52,721
Okay? Trust me.

769
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,161
No. You just want to fall for me
because you know I'm leaving.

770
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,884
Do you always speak in country lyrics?

771
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,090
Well, it's been...

772
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,210
- Exhausting.
- Yeah.

773
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,684
- Have a good...
- Yeah, you too.

774
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,003
I'll think good thoughts
for you in the new year.

775
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,085
Oh, wow! You sound exactly like my mom.

776
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,240
Cool.

777
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,969
I have four sisters, so...

778
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,480
I can sound like anyone's mom.

779
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:28,170
Oh, well, mine would love you.

780
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,400
Anyway, bye.

781
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,967
Yup.

782
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,768
- Come with me.
- What?

783
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,699
Look, I know you don't know me, you're
not even sure if you like me, but...

784
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,130
be my boyfriend.

785
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,719
Listen, I can't deal with that look
on their faces again.

786
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,967
Okay? Just be my boyfriend for one night.

787
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,889
- Oh, no way.
- What are you going to do?

788
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,081
There's no flights until morning.

789
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,940
Look at this, you're just going to
spend Christmas by yourself,

790
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,780
eating dinner at Wetzel's Pretzels?

791
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,739
- All right. Okay, stop!
- That's crazy. You're being deployed.

792
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,699
You deserve a crazy, pull out all
the stops, home-cooked meal

793
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,369
and I can guarantee you that.

794
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,844
You would make my parents so happy.

795
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:21,360
I mean, really, isn't it
the Christian thing to do?

796
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,445
Okay, well, fine, but...

797
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,090
It involves a tiny white lie, yes.

798
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,606
But, a lie that provides comfort.

799
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:34,842
And it's really perfect because
you are going to war.

800
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,659
And, you know, that's a win-win.

801
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,920
I'm just...

802
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,407
Sorry.

803
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,967
Wow.

804
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:49,168
That is, kind of, a beautiful moment.

805
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,083
Look, hey...

806
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,128
All we would have to figure out
is how long we've been together.

807
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,844
And what your name is.

808
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,090
I just got you...

809
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,603
It's Christmas, so, I got you a mistletoe!

810
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,289
It's lame, whatever, I'm stupid.

811
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:21,163
Never having French-kissed before,
Charlie felt Lauren's tongue in his mouth

812
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,010
and he thought she was having
an epileptic seizure.

813
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,485
When he realized she wasn't,
his heart began to soar.

814
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,606
Francis, the mall cop, contemplated
breaking up the young couple,

815
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,610
not because they were kissing, but
because they were doing it so badly.

816
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:42,931
But before he could, not knowing why,

817
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,047
every kiss Francis had under
a mistletoe flashed before his eyes

818
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,490
like a Christmas gift.

819
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:05,539
Get out! Get out of here!

820
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:06,721
Sorry.

821
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:14,963
What's your problem, Lauren?
You're not such a dog.

822
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,380
What are you doing hanging out
with this pus-face here?

823
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,083
Shut up, Brady.

824
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,619
You're going to let your girlfriend
talk to me like that?

825
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,041
Blisters, pussy?

826
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,443
Mommy ever teach you about deodorant?

827
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,800
He doesn't smell that bad, okay?

828
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,500
You smell a little bit, but not that bad.

829
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:33,619
I smell?

830
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:35,324
I can smell you halfway across the mall.

831
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,260
You leave my brother alone!

832
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,123
Oh, yeah? Make me.

833
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,686
Yes!

834
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:49,601
Run!

835
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,809
This was the story Bo would tell
his friends for years.

836
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,523
Now, what really happened.

837
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,690
His mission to rescue his brother
abruptly terminated,

838
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,603
Bo sat empty handed,

839
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,487
contemplating the cataclysmic
consequences of his failure.

840
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:34,440
Okay, we met where?

841
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:37,202
- Airport bar.
- Too trashy.

842
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,567
Okay, how about where I do volunteer work?

843
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,728
- Okay, where do you volunteer?
- I don't. But, I've always wanted to.

844
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,126
Now I don't have to.

845
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,681
Yeah, I don't think just talking
about volunteering counts.

846
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:48,219
Pretty sure it does.

847
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,606
Okay, how come you never mentioned me?

848
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:50,800
You're a Republican.

849
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,240
When I first saw him, I thought...

850
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:56,847
this is never going to work.

851
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,603
But, he was brave.

852
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,849
She was...

853
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,240
plucky.

854
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,407
He uses words like, "plucky."

855
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,641
That laugh.

856
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,483
First time I heard it, I was floored.

857
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:20,250
He was open in a way
that I never could be.

858
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,900
I wasn't even put off by his faith.

859
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,480
I actually thought it was kinda hot.

860
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,887
The whole time she talked
about "evolution,"

861
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,170
I wondered...

862
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,724
what it would be like to touch her neck.

863
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:42,570
You have a great neck.

864
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,684
I like the way he touches his lower
lip when he's feeling vulnerable.

865
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,619
- I don't do that.
- Like this.

866
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:54,244
- I don't do that.
- Yeah.

867
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,407
I wondered what it would be like
to kiss that lip.

868
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,170
- Really?
- No.

869
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,050
But, that's what I'm going to say
to my mom and she's gonna eat it up.

870
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,766
- All right.
- That's so good.

871
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,166
Before I saw her, I...

872
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,768
didn't believe in love at first sight.

873
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:13,800
Thought it was bullshit.

874
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,210
And then I saw this...

875
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:21,568
reckless girl who had forgotten
how beautiful she was,

876
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,731
and I thought,

877
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,809
I thought if I could wake up every day
and look into that face,

878
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:31,050
I could get through anything.

879
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,041
And you...

880
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,809
were standing right next to her.

881
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,650
I thought you were having dinner
with your daughters?

882
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,485
- You're going to ruin your appetite.
- I'm trying to.

883
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:42,923
Cranberries get on my nerves.

884
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,739
I didn't want our last conversation

885
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,525
to be remembered as our last conversation.

886
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,240
Order whatever you want.

887
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,840
It's on the house.
It's my Christmas gift to you.

888
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,048
When I was younger, I worked
in a restaurant for a while.

889
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,762
And if an ugly person came in, I would
often give him a free dessert.

890
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,326
And I thought of myself as being
really special for...

891
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,364
treating the uglies well.

892
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,969
It's not what I'm doing.

893
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,559
I'm happy to hear it.

894
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,639
I'll get you some pie.

895
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,764
Ruby? Listen...

896
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:48,800
You're not a coward.

897
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,570
You're the opposite of a coward.

898
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:53,809
You're brave and you're beautiful
and generous and big hearted.

899
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,240
Can we have a minute's privacy
here, please?

900
00:55:58,039 --> 00:55:59,201
Thank you.

901
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,570
All that sadness.

902
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,650
That feeling like you've landed
in the wrong life.

903
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,219
Everybody feels that way, Ruby.

904
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,099
It's all just going to become an anecdote.

905
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,407
You don't know that yet, Ruby, but...

906
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:14,760
you're grand...

907
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:16,724
You're like a grand piano...

908
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:20,804
around a bunch of little
toy pianos and uprights...

909
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,719
Thank you. But...

910
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:24,923
you're the grand piano.

911
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,849
And for a brief moment,
time was their friend,

912
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:32,847
as Ruby saw Bucky the way he felt inside.

913
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,963
Do you know why I came here every day?

914
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:39,364
Twice a day, sometimes.

915
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,047
So I could see you.

916
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,286
Just to see you...

917
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:47,925
So I could be around you.

918
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,329
Now I have to say goodbye again.

919
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,887
I have a fear that I am an impostor.

920
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:08,721
My first play got a lot of attention.

921
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,891
So, basically I peaked at 19.

922
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,449
I also have a fear of silence.

923
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:24,405
- I know.
- Okay, yeah.

924
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,166
I'm dyslexic,

925
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,525
so, when I was growing up,
I thought I was just stupid.

926
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,686
I had a sister.

927
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,882
She was born with a weak heart.

928
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,641
So...

929
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,641
Sometimes I think I might be unlovable.

930
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,728
I hear myself trying so hard to be funny.

931
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,204
I think you're funny, 'cause you're sad.

932
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,650
Percy? I confess.

933
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,360
Okay, I did it. I took the brooch.

934
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
I did.

935
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,007
I know.

936
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:57,166
For my sister.

937
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,920
I was just being small and petty.

938
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,329
I'm always measuring out how much love
and attention I'm getting

939
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:09,041
and then giving back just
exactly what I think I got.

940
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:12,688
Like I think I'm gonna be gypped
in some way.

941
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,690
What makes a person behave like that,
can you tell me?

942
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:20,360
A grown person.

943
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:22,641
And the three kids?

944
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,880
It wasn't a lie.

945
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,880
It was a wish.

946
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:33,128
As she heard herself say it aloud,

947
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,927
Emma remembered the moment
she began to feel unremarkable.

948
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:47,699
It was the first time she felt
jealous of her sister,

949
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,809
who she always loved and looked up to,
until she couldn't live up to.

950
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,041
Emma had told herself it was
just an accident,

951
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,728
and yet somehow today,
Emma knew it wasn't.

952
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,570
So, my mom has one sister,
Emma, she's always late.

953
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,440
Their dad is Bucky.

954
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,320
And my dad's aunt will be there,
Aunt Fishy.

955
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,608
Don't ask. Nobody knows
why we call her that.

956
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,565
And your brother is Hank,

957
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,202
and his kids are Charlie, Madison
and Bo Joshua, Maddie and BJ.

958
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,800
BJ.

959
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,648
What kind of a parent is gonna
name their kid BJ?

960
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,405
They're gonna see right through me.

961
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,489
Oh, no, they're gonna love you.

962
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,126
Just don't mention gun control,
women's rights, or religion.

963
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,420
Why don't you just tell them I don't
speak English?

964
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,780
No, I just don't want them to think
I'm dating some narrow minded birther.

965
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,451
The whole point of you coming home
with me is so I don't disappoint them.

966
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:55,539
No, don't take it personally.

967
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:57,130
They are liberally judgmental.

968
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,300
Look, we have a plan,
let's just stick to it.

969
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,820
How come you begged me to
come home with you,

970
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,648
if I'm such
a narrow-minded disappointment?

971
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,490
- No, you misunderstood me...
- Maybe you misunderstood you.

972
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,139
Of course, you're so open-minded,
how is that even possible?

973
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:09,240
- Right?
- Hey,

974
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:12,802
calm down, man up,
and let's lie to my parents.

975
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:15,400
- Okay?
- Damn, lying comes easy to you.

976
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:02,766
Sorry.

977
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,003
Charlotte, come with me.

978
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,360
Sam...

979
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:13,563
If we just got away from everything,
all the distractions,

980
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:15,483
the kids, we might have a shot.

981
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,963
I'm giving this one last try here.

982
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,884
If we can't find ourselves here...

983
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,125
how're we going to find ourselves

984
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,340
on some worn out dream
we had of a trip to Africa.

985
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,920
It's so much more than a trip and
you know that.

986
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,601
For 30 years I've given us a pass,

987
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,246
because you promised, once I retired,
you would do this for us.

988
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,965
And moving out is for us?

989
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,460
No the trip is for us, because
we've become invisible to each other.

990
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:41,891
Now? You want to go now?

991
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,523
What, with everything that's
going on with the kids?

992
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:46,420
They're not kids anymore!

993
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,521
That doesn't stop!

994
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,724
Don't turn your back on me, Charlotte.

995
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,606
I am going to make the dump salad.

996
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,244
The problem was, they both were right.

997
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,960
But the fight about the trip
wasn't about the trip.

998
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:04,889
It was about the thousand microscopic
hurts that accumulate over 40 years.

999
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,963
You don't want to get into this,
well, we are getting into this.

1000
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,521
Yes, you are a wonderful mother.

1001
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:13,244
But what happened to us?

1002
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:17,007
We used to slow dance in the living
room when the kids went to sleep.

1003
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:18,539
What happened to that couple?

1004
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:19,980
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

1005
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,003
There ought to be a whole
separate language for you.

1006
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,771
Wait, where's the pepper? Did I put
the pepper in the mash potatoes here?

1007
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,619
Dad called, he said
he's bringing a friend,

1008
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:30,369
probably an old student, I don't know.

1009
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,260
No, Rags!

1010
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,362
Oh, my God! Rags!

1011
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:36,820
- Rags.
- Get down, Rags.

1012
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,523
Good boy.

1013
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:40,648
- Go on.
- Go on, go on, Rags.

1014
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,971
Why are you laughing?

1015
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,889
I don't understand how we're going to
have Christmas without mashed potatoes.

1016
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,204
Charlotte, it's funny.

1017
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,085
My God.

1018
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,739
When did we become Alfred & Dizzy Ludwig?

1019
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,045
Who are you talking about?

1020
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,043
The dullest, most lifeless couple
my parents knew.

1021
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,443
I'm not apologizing
for 40 years of a marriage.

1022
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,400
We raised a spectacular family.

1023
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:13,206
- We made a beautiful home...
- And now you're afraid to leave it.

1024
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,059
Stop saying I'm afraid like I'm afraid.

1025
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:16,286
You are terrified.

1026
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,300
You're terrified to be alone
with me without a kid between us.

1027
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,420
Look, Mom.

1028
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,420
You're terrified, if you take your
eyes off those kids for one second,

1029
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:24,760
something will happen on your watch.

1030
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,842
I have known you for most of my life
and clearly you have no idea who I am.

1031
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:31,121
You're right.

1032
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:34,920
We lost track of each other,
raising the kids.

1033
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,891
And then Lizzy died.

1034
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,650
And we stepped back.

1035
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,699
And we kept stepping back,

1036
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,246
until that was comfortable,
until that was us.

1037
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,371
Why do you just accept that?

1038
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,849
Did you ever consider

1039
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,371
that this trip is not my dream?

1040
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:57,880
It's an old dream.

1041
01:04:58,519 --> 01:04:59,760
I was in my 20s.

1042
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:02,885
It has no meaning for me anymore.

1043
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:04,320
Then do it for me.

1044
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:07,925
Where did you go?

1045
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,804
You got so small.

1046
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,900
I'm in love with a girl
that doesn't even exist anymore.

1047
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,047
I exist.

1048
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,860
If you want to go on a trip with a memory,

1049
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,219
then be my guest. Go ahead.

1050
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,139
- Well, I'm going.
- That's fine, go.

1051
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:22,240
You just go.

1052
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:25,809
One day, for God's sakes,
that's all I asked for,

1053
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:29,927
was one day, all you had to do
was hang in for another 12 hours

1054
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,579
and then we'd be done, but, no,
you have to ruin this day for me too.

1055
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,887
Well, you know what,
you can just leave now!

1056
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,246
- Just leave...
- Hi.

1057
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,920
- Merry Christmas.
- Happy...

1058
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,849
Merry Christmas.

1059
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:47,601
Mom, Dad, this is Joe.

1060
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:49,681
Hi.

1061
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,201
- Well
- We're engaged.

1062
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,920
Oh, God.

1063
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,420
What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about, engaged?

1064
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,126
A boyfriend is one thing, but engaged
is a completely different story.

1065
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,460
I made a mistake.

1066
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:28,539
You think?

1067
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,340
When I agreed to come here with you,
this whole thing is way too insane.

1068
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,300
Well, now it is. I mean, engaged?

1069
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,900
You probably don't believe
in global warming,

1070
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,367
okay? I could never marry you.
I'm sorry, but, please.

1071
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,530
Why? 'Cause I'm not already married?

1072
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:42,483
Oh, that's nice.

1073
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,820
You know what? I've wasted enough time.

1074
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,900
Merry Christmas.

1075
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,800
No, Joe, wait. I'm sorry, Joe, one sec...

1076
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,246
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1077
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,405
Hi, honey. Congratulations.

1078
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:12,240
Where's Joe?

1079
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,291
- Oh.
- Honey?

1080
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,010
Mom, please, just don't make that face.

1081
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,400
I swear to God, if I look up and you're
making that face I'm gonna lose it.

1082
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:26,900
But I'm not making a face.

1083
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,239
Actually, Charlotte, you are.

1084
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,460
Sam this is my everyday face.

1085
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,244
- You're going like this.
- No, I'm...

1086
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,128
I am not.

1087
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,166
Okay, I'll be a Sphinx, right?

1088
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,340
See? Hi, honey.

1089
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,059
Oh, God, there it is!

1090
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:46,500
- What?
- Now, Buttons, calm down.

1091
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:48,284
Calm down? Really, Dad, calm down?

1092
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,606
Nothing makes people less calm
than being told to calm down.

1093
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:52,130
And now you're making that face.

1094
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:55,199
Dad, you're just as bad as Mom.

1095
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,139
Honey-bunny.

1096
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:01,242
Oh, God, please, stop mothering me.

1097
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,420
But I am your mother and I feel for you.

1098
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:05,248
No, you feel sorry for me.

1099
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,045
And you make me feel that I'm a person
that people should feel sorry for.

1100
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,579
But you know, hey,

1101
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:13,331
it wouldn't be Christmas without Eleanor
coming home to disappoint everyone.

1102
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,045
You're not a disappointment.

1103
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:16,340
Right, okay.

1104
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,203
Well, let me just give you
your Christmas present early.

1105
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,845
Mom, Dad,

1106
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,682
Joe is actually...

1107
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,682
...a smoker. He is a chain-smoker.

1108
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,640
That's right.

1109
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:32,739
Just can't seem to quit.

1110
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,204
- It's tough.
- Oh, well...

1111
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,130
You know what, this calls for a toast.

1112
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:38,488
- Yeah.
- Bubbly, bubbly.

1113
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,324
- I'm an alcoholic.
- Wow.

1114
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,761
- I'm just kidding.
- Yeah.

1115
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,680
Quite a kidder.

1116
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,604
Yeah, just can't help it.

1117
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:51,121
- Try.
- Hey.

1118
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,939
We're here.

1119
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:54,460
- Oh, Mom?
- Yeah, what?

1120
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,180
Just don't mention anything
about the engagement, okay?

1121
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:57,739
'Cause we haven't told Joe's parents yet.

1122
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,966
- That's fine, that's good.
- Okay.

1123
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,481
Charlie, what happened to your face?

1124
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,007
Oh, he...

1125
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,485
Oh, my God.

1126
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,005
Everyone, this is Joe.

1127
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:15,926
And, yes... And Joe and your
Aunt Eleanor are engaged.

1128
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,340
- Charlotte!
- What? Oh, my God.

1129
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,248
- Mom.
- It just slipped out, I don't know.

1130
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,045
I'm sorry, I don't know what...

1131
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,530
Right hand, orange,

1132
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,260
- and left hand, blue.
- Okay, yes.

1133
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,260
I got a right on orange.

1134
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,203
I thought we just said it ten seconds ago.

1135
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:53,090
Angels We Have Heard On High

1136
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,364
Sweetly swinging o'er the plains

1137
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,609
And the mountains in reply

1138
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:02,770
Echoing their joyous strains.

1139
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,966
Gloria

1140
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:14,007
In Excelsis Deo

1141
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:18,123
children, go where I send thee

1142
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:21,127
How shall I send thee?

1143
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,161
I'm gonna send thee three by three

1144
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:26,247
Three for the Hebrew children

1145
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,319
Two for Paul and Silas

1146
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,086
One for the itty-bitty baby

1147
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:36,641
Born, born, born in Bethlehem

1148
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,260
Hava nagila, hava nagila

1149
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:48,762
Hava nagila ve-nis'mecha

1150
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:56,809
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

1151
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,963
Let your heart be light

1152
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,579
Hang a shining star

1153
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:15,164
Upon the highest bow

1154
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:19,764
And have yourself

1155
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:26,564
A merry little Christmas

1156
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,800
Now

1157
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,170
Anyway, Merry Christmas.

1158
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,484
- Kiss her, Grandpa.
- Oh, my goodness.

1159
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:44,560
Oh, dear.

1160
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:46,845
- You're suppose to kiss me.
- Oh, okay.

1161
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,130
What are we doing here?

1162
01:11:58,079 --> 01:11:59,365
Is this where you left your car?

1163
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:03,011
- Yes?
- Merry Christmas.

1164
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,050
Thanks for the ride.

1165
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,127
If I ask you a question,

1166
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,360
would you answer me honestly?

1167
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:18,041
Try me.

1168
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,001
Are you really a psychiatrist?

1169
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,846
Of course, I am, sort of.
I'm a life coach.

1170
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,164
But you said you were a doctor.

1171
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,600
Well...

1172
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,689
You heard of Dr. Seuss?

1173
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,001
I'm Dr. Newport.

1174
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:39,480
- Wow.
- Officer Williams?

1175
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:42,320
Can I give you a hug?

1176
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:44,480
No.

1177
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,166
All right, then.

1178
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,001
A word of advice?

1179
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,128
- Certainly. If I were you...
- For you, not from you.

1180
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,961
Of course.

1181
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,963
You should buy your sister
the most expensive gift you can find.

1182
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:05,845
Try and be be the person
you want to become.

1183
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,929
Emma was filled with a tiny distant
memory she wasn't sure even happened,

1184
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,247
when her world was still open to
the possibility of magic.

1185
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,420
- Yeah.
- Carrots.

1186
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,966
Everybody make sure
you try those potatoes.

1187
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,407
Single perfect form, you be...

1188
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,645
Oh, Dad?

1189
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:50,380
I've been thinking about
our family a lot today.

1190
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:52,641
And I have something that I'd like to say.

1191
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,961
I want to tell you...

1192
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,925
No! Please, no.

1193
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:02,525
...how happy I am

1194
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,841
that we're all here together.

1195
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:07,041
Well, hear, hear.

1196
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,447
We don't spend much time
under the same roof,

1197
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,123
but no matter what happens...

1198
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:16,280
we are family.

1199
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,483
Oh, God, look at Bo's shiny, little face.

1200
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,047
Well, I think that what Grandpa is...

1201
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:28,845
trying to say is...

1202
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:32,844
that celebrations like this

1203
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
they just kind of...

1204
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,286
remind us of...

1205
01:14:38,359 --> 01:14:39,360
how...

1206
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,211
- Irreplaceable.
- Irreplaceable...

1207
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:43,929
So, just...

1208
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:46,260
But you know what, that is enough said
on that front, right?

1209
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:49,180
Let's just toast to
celebrations, everyone.

1210
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:50,645
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1211
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,845
- Okay.
- Cheers.

1212
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:54,081
I'm hungry.

1213
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,561
I know. I hate to say it,
but Emma's not here yet.

1214
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,121
I think we should wait.

1215
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:02,286
I think it's important for us
to wait for just a few minutes.

1216
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,440
Maybe the storm has knocked
out some traffic signals.

1217
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:07,041
Yeah, but she's always late.

1218
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:08,320
- Let's just dig in!
- Yes.

1219
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:10,323
- Go ahead. It's Christmas, right?
- Yes.

1220
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,364
Aren't we going to say grace?

1221
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,979
Well, just let me finish,
for one second, Joe.

1222
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,444
Dad, would you like to say grace?

1223
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,539
Not really.

1224
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,643
Well, maybe you'd like to listen to Bo say
grace. Bo, would you like to give thanks?

1225
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,806
No, thanks.

1226
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:25,208
- Okay.
- You know what, I'll do it.

1227
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,331
Oh. All right.

1228
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,323
Dear Lord, or whoever is listening,

1229
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:42,001
thank you for this beautiful meal when
there are so many who have so little.

1230
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:45,640
And although I'm not with
my own family tonight,

1231
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:50,125
I'm grateful to be sharing Christmas
with such a thoughtful,

1232
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,326
loving family...

1233
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,859
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ!

1234
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,371
Holy...

1235
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,005
It's Rags.

1236
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,886
Mother of God, what are you
feeding that animal?

1237
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,001
Oh, Rags.

1238
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:12,380
It's okay. At least, dinner smells good.

1239
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:13,500
- Right?
- Fabulous.

1240
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,761
Let's dig in.

1241
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,720
What's the matter?

1242
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,100
The pepper?

1243
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,362
- Is that what it is?
- It needs more potato.

1244
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,210
I can't believe you're getting
married, El.

1245
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:29,460
Congratulations.

1246
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,323
Yeah, congratulations.

1247
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,805
I just can't believe it.

1248
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:35,359
Stop saying that.

1249
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,819
It's just...

1250
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,685
Joe, do you really know
what you're getting into?

1251
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,291
Yeah, I've never been more certain.

1252
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,681
Actually, I got down on one knee
when I proposed.

1253
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,289
She had her doubts, but I didn't.

1254
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,760
Yeah, I knew it, the minute I met her.

1255
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:53,569
Kiss her.

1256
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:55,810
- Come on.
- Kiss!

1257
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:57,380
Go ahead.

1258
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:58,970
- Give her a kiss.
- Come on.

1259
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:08,247
That is a kiss.

1260
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,060
When Emma entered the dining room,

1261
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,208
she remembered to be the person
she wanted to become.

1262
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,404
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1263
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,819
You're finally here.
We've been missing you.

1264
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,809
But when confronted by family,

1265
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,640
she forgot.

1266
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,368
Good, you started without me.

1267
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,371
Don't get up.

1268
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:36,140
I'm so sorry. Dad and Eleanor
both brought guests.

1269
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,402
Oh, can I sit here near you, Madison?

1270
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,922
I'd like to sit next to the prettiest
girl at the table, is that okay?

1271
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,681
- You're such a...
- Madison?

1272
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:54,500
As Aunt Fishy slept, she dreamt
of dancing at the Mocamba,

1273
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,619
Christmas of '46,

1274
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,802
knowing for certain, she could get
any man in the place,

1275
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:03,448
never considering she would be
anything but young.

1276
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,286
The night had become so haunted
by ghosts of Christmases past

1277
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,927
that Rags began to stress-eat.

1278
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,641
I think it's time to go around the table

1279
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,048
and tell each other our
wish for the new year, right?

1280
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:33,288
Oh, God.

1281
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,841
What?

1282
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:39,006
What? I mean, everybody loves
this game and we play it every year.

1283
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:40,729
Everybody hates this game.

1284
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,842
And no one has the nerve to tell you.

1285
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:46,130
- Emma.
- Does anyone enjoy this?

1286
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:51,846
I'd just like to say, it's so wonderful
to see my daughters together.

1287
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:54,500
I remember when Charlotte wouldn't even

1288
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,364
be in the Christmas play,
unless they let Emma in too.

1289
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,619
They would sneak down and eat
the cookies Effie made for Santa

1290
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,961
and they thought we didn't know
about it, but we did.

1291
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,841
Dad, you're so right.

1292
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,680
You're my sister,

1293
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,524
- and I love you
- Okay.

1294
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,086
Mash potatoes?

1295
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,243
Did you get the B-I-K-E-S for the K-I-D-S?

1296
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:41,006
No. I thought we could go with
something hand-made this year.

1297
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:43,380
Hank, we agreed on the bikes.

1298
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,890
Right, I just...

1299
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,180
Hand-made gifts are from the soul, right?

1300
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:51,011
They can't ride a soul to school,
they wanted bikes.

1301
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,320
Kids want bikes.

1302
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:02,287
Sam,

1303
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:07,448
that was the best dinner
I ever had in my entire mouth.

1304
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,007
I'm so glad to hear that, Aunt Fishy.

1305
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:11,930
How was the trip, dear?

1306
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,760
Fantastic.

1307
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,725
Rags knew he was eating his emotions,
but could not stop himself.

1308
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,088
Could you pass the green beans?

1309
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,161
Yeah, sure.

1310
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,140
You know what,
here let me get them for you.

1311
01:20:35,239 --> 01:20:36,240
It's okay. I got it.

1312
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,979
It's all right, I'm holding it.

1313
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:40,685
I can get my own green beans, it's fine.

1314
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,140
Can I, please, just get
my own green beans?

1315
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,500
Yes, just trying to be helpful.

1316
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,779
You know what would have been helpful,

1317
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,619
is if you would have done
what you said you're gonna do.

1318
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,739
Now I have two helmets
sitting under my tree.

1319
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,579
This is exactly why I left.

1320
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,899
- This is why you left?
- Yes.

1321
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,699
Seems like you had a whole
lot more reasons than that,

1322
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,140
'cause you left so fast
there was a cartoon swoosh cloud

1323
01:20:57,239 --> 01:20:59,527
- in the doorway.
- I should have left a long time ago.

1324
01:21:00,199 --> 01:21:01,280
Stop fighting!

1325
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,363
Why can't you stop fighting?

1326
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,688
Why won't you stop?

1327
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,779
All right, everybody,
let's just stop it, okay?

1328
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,609
Just shut up and eat.

1329
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,260
I mean, we all...

1330
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:13,726
We love each other and it's Christmas.

1331
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,320
It's the most wonderful time of the year!

1332
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:20,083
Storm took out the power lines.

1333
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,970
Stop it. No.

1334
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:26,122
Madison, don't be scared, all right?

1335
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:29,970
Bucky! Bucky!

1336
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:33,440
Dad?

1337
01:21:58,279 --> 01:21:59,884
We're setting up a CAT scan immediately.

1338
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:02,500
I can only imagine how shaken up
you all must be.

1339
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,170
It's quite the Christmas present.

1340
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,520
Thank you, Doctor.

1341
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:16,360
Hank...

1342
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,761
FOMO.

1343
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:24,319
You have to wait back here.

1344
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,405
Wait!

1345
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:02,408
What the hell
are you doing with your life?

1346
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,682
You're sleeping with that oily doctor
when you're engaged?

1347
01:23:07,239 --> 01:23:08,365
Dr. Morrissey?

1348
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,859
That's... Mom, I really don't know
where you got that,

1349
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,460
but you're having a rough night
so I'm going to let it slide.

1350
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,300
But, honestly, Mom, that's ridiculous.

1351
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:17,420
You know something, you always talk
too loudly when you're lying.

1352
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,600
I do not.

1353
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:20,407
That's not even...

1354
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:29,320
Fine.

1355
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,204
I knew you wouldn't understand.

1356
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,284
In fact, I knew you would react
exactly like this.

1357
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,570
And... Oh, perfect. There's the face.

1358
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,010
Did I do something wrong?

1359
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,128
Was I too preoccupied with Lucy?

1360
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,939
Did I make you feel
like you don't deserve more?

1361
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:49,609
Please, stop, this isn't about you.

1362
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,859
Stop treating me like I'm something
that's broken.

1363
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,644
Okay? You can't fix me.

1364
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,604
Just go fix yourself.

1365
01:23:56,039 --> 01:23:57,041
This is who I am.

1366
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,445
You need to accept that I'm never going
to be the person that you want me to be.

1367
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,847
You are the person I want you to be,

1368
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,046
- except...
- Except.

1369
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:06,527
Yeah, except you

1370
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,480
deserve more. I think you could build
a life with this Joe.

1371
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,881
Oh, Mom.

1372
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:16,041
Joe is a prop.

1373
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:20,045
Joe is a stranger I picked up
in an airport bar.

1374
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:22,770
He is something I invented,

1375
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,685
so that I didn't have to face your face.

1376
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:31,849
- Eleanor.
- Just...

1377
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,371
This could happen to anyone, Madison.

1378
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,889
There was a lot of yelling going on,
I'm surprised...

1379
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,689
it doesn't happen more often.

1380
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,810
In your defense,

1381
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:48,649
it was probably

1382
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:51,485
the dump salad.

1383
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:53,970
There's a reason it's called that.

1384
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:03,801
I tried, Madison. Damn it, I tried.

1385
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,489
What? She doesn't love me anymore.

1386
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,320
Forty years.

1387
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,921
Gone.

1388
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:29,765
Thank you, Tinkerbell.

1389
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,007
I don't even think I kissed
him hello tonight.

1390
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,340
You can kiss him tomorrow, because
he's gonna be all right, really, Emma.

1391
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,060
That's right, Charlotte. Everything's
always balloons and Jello.

1392
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,845
Wow, I realize that

1393
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:47,685
we haven't been close but I guess
I just didn't really know how much...

1394
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,886
you don't like me.

1395
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,448
It's not that I don't like you,

1396
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,806
it's just that I love you more
when I'm not with you.

1397
01:25:56,119 --> 01:25:58,009
It's like we're allergic to each other.

1398
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,730
But hey, we were branded from birth.

1399
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,020
I'm the coward. Dad always said
you're the brave one.

1400
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:05,724
No, Dad didn't say that at all.

1401
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,167
Dad said you're the brave one
and I'm the nice one.

1402
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:10,880
No. I'm the smart one,
you're the brave one.

1403
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,126
No, please...

1404
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,609
I'm the coward.

1405
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,609
No, I'm the coward.

1406
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,340
- No, I am, that's what Dad said.
- For God's sake! I'm the coward.

1407
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:20,725
No. Don't even kid yourself.

1408
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,020
Dad said that you're the brave one
and I'm the nice one.

1409
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:25,020
I am the coward!

1410
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:27,220
You are the brave one
and you're the smart one.

1411
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:28,400
- I'm the coward.
- Ladies!

1412
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:31,163
Yes, of course. Sorry.

1413
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,570
Tell me what happened to us?

1414
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,604
- You got the happy gene. I didn't.
- That's not true.

1415
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:43,320
No.

1416
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,881
You could be happy licking an envelope.

1417
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:48,845
But, hey, I'd be happy too,
if I had everything.

1418
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,739
Everything? You think I've had everything?

1419
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,619
If you ever just asked me once, how
I am, you'd know that my life is just

1420
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,979
as screwed up as your life.

1421
01:26:57,079 --> 01:26:58,844
Charlotte, look at me.

1422
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,886
I am a fully grown woman.

1423
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:04,605
You sat me at the kids table!

1424
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,965
You have no idea what that feels like,
and you never will, you have a family,

1425
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,801
I am alone.

1426
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,006
Don't I count as family?

1427
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,048
Don't my kids count as family?

1428
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,283
They're your family too, goddammit!

1429
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:19,685
- They are your family.
- Ladies!

1430
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:21,365
- Out!
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1431
01:27:40,279 --> 01:27:43,722
Despite his broken heart,
Sam asked Madison for a dance,

1432
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:47,500
determined to erase the image
of the 2nd floor men's room of

1433
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,220
the First Butler Hospital

1434
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:51,606
from the memory of her 5th Christmas eve.

1435
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,007
Miss Newport, I have some news.

1436
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:01,643
So, your father had a small stroke.

1437
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,967
He's stabilized now
and he's gonna be fine.

1438
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:06,880
You can see him later, but right
now we'd like him to rest.

1439
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,320
- You can see him when he wakes up.
- But he's okay?

1440
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,739
His vitals are fine, he's just resting.

1441
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,979
I'll check back in with you later.

1442
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:16,207
- Good, great.
- Thank you.

1443
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:18,400
He's sleeping right now.

1444
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,764
Get outta town.
Your doctor is "married guy"?

1445
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,680
No.

1446
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,010
Yeah, I met him a couple of years ago when
I brought my grandpa in for a check up.

1447
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,171
A little agey, isn't he?

1448
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,199
Well, let him down easy.

1449
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:42,484
I mean, even a married guy doesn't deserve
to get dumped on Christmas, right?

1450
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:47,480
Seriously?

1451
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,291
You are not this person.

1452
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,121
- Kinda look like her, though, don't I?
- No.

1453
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,484
- You don't even know me.
- What?

1454
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,761
After today?

1455
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:02,765
Lying really does come easy to you.

1456
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,890
Okay, how about this for the truth?

1457
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:09,765
I've known you for eight hours,
and you are leaving in five.

1458
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,368
I'm sorry about your Grandpa, hon,
but he's gonna be okay. I promise.

1459
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:17,605
Be careful over there, okay?

1460
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,640
Yeah, you too.

1461
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:26,609
Lucky me. I get to see you at Christmas.

1462
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,847
- Wanna see what I got you?
- Yeah.

1463
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:43,490
The first Noel the angels did say

1464
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,447
Was to certain poor shepherds...

1465
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:55,530
Sorry, sorry.

1466
01:29:56,359 --> 01:29:58,567
Sorry, no.

1467
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:02,685
Sorry.

1468
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,761
Sorry.

1469
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,202
Sorry!

1470
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:16,480
Excuse me.

1471
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:21,002
Wait. No. Hold the elevator!

1472
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,046
That was a good one.

1473
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,170
You would've loved to have seen you.

1474
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:40,240
You didn't leave.

1475
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:44,323
I couldn't. We're too good a story.

1476
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,289
You picked me up in a bar.

1477
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:49,690
You came on to me.

1478
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,340
You stalked me in an airport.

1479
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:53,260
You begged me to go home with you.

1480
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:54,770
I couldn't get rid of you.

1481
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:58,128
Yeah, we finally agree on something.

1482
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,961
We're together just to say goodbye,
you know.

1483
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:05,487
I know.

1484
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,523
You're like Clarence,

1485
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,881
sent down to save my wonderful life.

1486
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,244
Merry Christmas.

1487
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,680
Merry...

1488
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:36,890
...Christmas.

1489
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,640
Hey, Charlie.

1490
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,247
- Lauren?
- I got your text.

1491
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,328
My...

1492
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,167
Oh, yeah, no, of course. Right, my text.

1493
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:12,220
I text girls all the time.
That's what I do, you know.

1494
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:15,060
I didn't think you were gonna come.

1495
01:32:15,159 --> 01:32:17,500
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Oh, no. It's no big deal.

1496
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,967
We're Jewish, so, we were
just getting Chinese food, so...

1497
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,810
Take your coat off and everything,
these are my parents right there.

1498
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,247
- Well...
- Maybe we should...

1499
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:39,408
- give them a little privacy.
- Yes, that's probably a good idea.

1500
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,162
Bo, come here.

1501
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,779
Why don't we go over here for little bit?

1502
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,211
Come over here, honey.

1503
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:51,203
- Stop staring.
- I can't stop.

1504
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:58,282
Last year, the 3rd grade class picture
came out all squinty.

1505
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,204
They're interviewing Bud Bartlett, but

1506
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,962
he doesn't care about getting a good shot.

1507
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,291
I could talk to the principal and...

1508
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:12,881
Bo told me tonight.

1509
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,042
I actually have to go, I'm sorry.

1510
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,320
I promised my boyfriend
that I'd meet his family.

1511
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,764
Yeah, you should get going.

1512
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,250
And, Angie, I...

1513
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,363
I want you to be happy.

1514
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,402
Oh, God, what is that?

1515
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,721
There goes the tree.

1516
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,500
Should we intervene? They need a referee?

1517
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,965
- It's disturbing.
- It's not safe.

1518
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,324
Can I tell you something, without
knowing anything about you?

1519
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:28,645
I think you need Jello.

1520
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,923
You have his smile.

1521
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,640
I got lucky.

1522
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:53,726
You know, I think that your hands
were the first thing I loved about you.

1523
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,885
I'm gonna miss them.

1524
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:05,841
I think, at first, I held on so tight
to the kids, because

1525
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:10,091
of all that we went through
and how much I loved them.

1526
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:12,280
But now...

1527
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:16,122
I think I'm holding on because...

1528
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,525
I don't know who I am, if I don't.

1529
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,449
My love for them...

1530
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,568
it's so huge.
I kinda got lost in it, you know?

1531
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,007
And a part of me, like you said...

1532
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:36,002
- A part of me got small.
- No.

1533
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:37,280
You're not small.

1534
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,006
I didn't even agree
with me when I said it.

1535
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,689
- You're beautiful and ridiculous.
- No.

1536
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,490
And as passionate as you always were.

1537
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:50,690
- It's about different things now.
- Yeah.

1538
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,646
We had a great run, Charlotte.

1539
01:35:56,359 --> 01:35:59,283
- Nobody can say we didn't try.
- No, we tried.

1540
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:09,260
- Let's go on the trip.
- You don't have to.

1541
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:11,840
No, look at me, honey,
I want to go with you.

1542
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,841
Really?

1543
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:19,448
That's incredible.

1544
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,648
Oh, Charlotte...

1545
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,962
I don't really know
if we should go to Africa.

1546
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,420
- What?
- Bo said Hank got laid off.

1547
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,648
Oh, my God, I knew it.

1548
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,119
The tell tale snort.

1549
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:35,560
That snort.

1550
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,159
But, I can...

1551
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:41,060
take you out to a really amazing dinner.

1552
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:45,659
We could go to some fancy
Ethiopian place with native dress.

1553
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,899
You can take me to IHOP, for all I care.

1554
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,001
Yeah, me too.

1555
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,199
Oh, my...

1556
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:01,524
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

1557
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,085
Good for them.

1558
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:26,845
Why waste a moment?
We're here for such a short time.

1559
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:56,250
I need a last minute gift that
doesn't involve teddy bears,

1560
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,930
balloons or pictures
of children with big eyes.

1561
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,765
You can never go wrong with chocolate.

1562
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:03,121
No.

1563
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:08,247
Get me the most expensive thing
that you have.

1564
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,569
You shouldn't have done this.
I feel so ridiculous.

1565
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,206
Here we go.

1566
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,520
Emma, no!

1567
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,220
No, look...

1568
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:24,320
What?

1569
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:28,521
That's the most expensive thing they had.

1570
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,684
I really like it.

1571
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,650
'Cause what says Christmas
better than a shower seat?

1572
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,961
Exactly. Well said.

1573
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:38,840
I could really use that shower seat.

1574
01:38:41,319 --> 01:38:43,845
Merry Christmas. To you, Mom.

1575
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:45,690
To family.

1576
01:38:47,239 --> 01:38:50,926
Bucky woke up with an unexpected
craving for lime Jello.

1577
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,368
As everyone sat around the table,

1578
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,420
the past, present and future
were coming together

1579
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,408
for one elusive night.

1580
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:33,563
Fate was kind, playing
that particular muzak just then.

1581
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:39,500
Excuse me, Madison.

1582
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,966
Might I steal this man away from you?

1583
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:43,280
Oh, yeah?

1584
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,081
- Can I?
- Mom.

1585
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:47,260
Sam and Charlotte relished
in the closeness

1586
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:51,126
brought on by the time well spent
on the trip not yet taken.

1587
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:56,564
I still got it.

1588
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:09,480
I've never seen that.

1589
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:10,720
Are they are really doing this?

1590
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,048
Eleanor let go of her past enough
to be in the present.

1591
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,539
Instead of trying to present
the perfect picture,

1592
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,449
Hank celebrated this moment
un-photoshopped.

1593
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:31,567
- Do you want to dance?
- Me?

1594
01:40:32,199 --> 01:40:35,043
Hank and Ruby took
their first step on the right foot.

1595
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:40,050
All the more meaningful, because
Bucky had led them to it.

1596
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,444
And Charlie would always remember
his first kiss.

1597
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,359
His sloppy, awkward, but very first kiss.

1598
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,020
You look pretty, Emma.
Do you want to dance?

1599
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:25,280
Gosh, I would love to dance.

1600
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,443
I would really love to dance.

1601
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:31,087
Emma finally recognized she was
already part of a large family.

1602
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,659
As Bucky stood, taking them in,
his family unaware of him,

1603
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,284
this thought entered his head,

1604
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:41,528
which he shared with a large
Haitian orderly.

1605
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:43,240
Such a fuss...

1606
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:48,207
when everything we want is right
in front of us the whole time.

1607
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:52,601
And at last, everyone
appreciated that very sentiment.

1608
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,570
Why is it they can never remember that?

1609
01:41:56,159 --> 01:42:00,926
Or maybe the point is, even
just for a moment, they do.

1610
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:08,402
Well, that's my tale.

1611
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:13,807
Sometimes, I wonder about all
the families sharing dinner together.

1612
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,520
Each house,

1613
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:17,966
each family,

1614
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,762
each one with stories of their own.

1615
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:26,210
I don't know who chooses
our families for us.

1616
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,451
Or if there's a reason
we land where we do.

1617
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,881
But my family will be home soon.

1618
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,324
Loyal and affectionate, but untrainable.

1619
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:38,042
Perfectly imperfect.

1620
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:39,730
They're only human.

1621
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:42,565
And that's enough for me.

1622
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:46,125
Merry Christmas to all. Woof!
