2
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,500
Okay, Ellie, I got her.

3
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,400
The Christmas rock.

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,900
Just got her
out of storage.

5
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
I wanted to surprise Peaches.

6
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,099
Where is our sweet
little angel? Huh?

7
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,599
Incoming!

8
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,500
There's your
sweet little angel.

9
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,599
Sorry, Dad.

10
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah!
It's on!

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,099
You guys need
to chill out.

12
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,299
Peaches.

13
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,200
The Christmas rock!

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,299
I love it! I love it!
I love it! I love it! I love it!

15
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,400
No, no, no, don't.
Too late.

16
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm stuck.

17
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,599
This is the same Christmas rock I had
when I was a kid.

18
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,900
It's an heirloom that's been in our
family for generations.

19
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,099
Tonight when Santa comes by
with his presents,

20
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,900
he'll see this rock and know that
a very special little girl lives here.

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,000
♪ Oh, Christmas rock,
oh, Christmas rock

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,400
♪ You're 30 tons of granite
And every... ♪

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
You know you're singing
to a rock, right?

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,800
It's a Christmas
tradition for the kids.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,900
Don't sabers have
Christmas traditions?

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,699
Oh, yeah!

27
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,699
Every year my dad would bring home
the biggest, fattest gazelles he could find

28
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,300
and then we'd
all rip into their...

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
...our presents.

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,099
And we'd play games
with the gazelles

31
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,800
and dance with them
and not eat them. The end.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,300
Merry Christmas,
my mammals.

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,900
Wow!
That's some crazy rock.

34
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,300
Step away from the stone.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,900
Why?
You'll break it.

36
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,000
Sid can't break a rock.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't tempt him.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,199
Uncle Sid, we need this
so that Santa can find us tonight.

39
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,699
What, this?
Oh, pfft.

40
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,699
He could go right past it.

41
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,699
You need something
bigger, taller, sparklier.

42
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,800
Something with a pizzazz.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,500
Um, a tree!

44
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,599
A Christmas tree?

45
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,099
Do you know
how ridiculous that sounds?

46
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,800
There's millions of
trees out there, Sid.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,599
How would anyone
notice this one?

48
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, we could
decorate it.

49
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,800
Crash, Eddie.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,300
Sweet!

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
And,  voila!

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
It does look pretty good.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,199
Ah, it'll never catch on.

54
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,500
It's beautiful.

55
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,800
Hmm. It needs a certain
razzle-dazzle on top.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Something that says Sid.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,699
And just like that,
a tradition is born.

58
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,699
Hey!

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,500
Seriously, what did
you think was gonna...

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,800
Yep. That says
Sid, all right.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,699
Okay, okay. Let's just
keep it together.

62
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,699
It really is about
the spirit of Christmas, isn't it?

63
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,399
You're about to be
a spirit of Christmas, Sid!

64
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,600
Manny, please.
I'm so sorry.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,199
You know what, Sid,
I'm the least of your worries.

66
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,000
You gotta answer to Santa.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,300
Santa? Santa Claus?

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,500
He is never gonna
forgive this.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,899
You just got
yourself on Santa's...

70
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,899
Uh, ah,
Santa's Naughty List.

71
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,800
Santa has a Naughty List?

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,300
Yeah! Yeah!

73
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,399
And if you're not good,
then he puts your name on it.

74
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,800
We're never good.

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,100
Then why start now?

76
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,800
Well, if your name's
on the Naughty List,

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
you don't get Christmas.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But no! Why me?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,699
Besides the fact
that it's my fault.

80
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,899
The Naughty List?
Where did you come up with that?

81
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:13,899
Relax. Sid's gullible
but he's not that gullible.

82
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,199
He knows this Santa
stuff is just for kids.

83
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,800
What? You don't
believe in Santa?

84
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Um, I, well...

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
Of course, he believes.

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,699
That's the magic
of Christmas.

87
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,699
If anyone deserves to be on the
naughty List, Dad, it's you!

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,500
She sure told you,
didn't she?

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,600
Well, too bad,
I'm a grown-up.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,899
Grown-ups don't believe
in the Naughty List.

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,199
I'm not getting Christmas.

92
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't cry, Sid.

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Why not?

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,699
Your tears are
freezing solid.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,199
Why am I on
Santa's Naughty List?

96
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,600
Why? Why?

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,800
My guess, because he doesn't
have a loser list.

98
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Well, thanks for
trying to cheer me up.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,100
I still feel terrible.

100
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
Pull it together,
Uncle Sid.

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,899
We've got work to do.

102
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,100
But I'm still sulking.

103
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,500
No time.
We're going to the Pole.

104
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,399
The North one?

105
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,800
Yep. We're gonna
find Santa

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
so I can prove to my dad
that he's real.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,100
And we're gonna
get you off that list.

108
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,300
And us, too!

109
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,000
We may be naughty
but we still want Christmas.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,300
Peaches, honey,
you can't come with us.

111
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,199
This is a very
dangerous journey.

112
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,199
The North Pole is a desolate land
of ice and snow.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,500
This isn't exactly Miami.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,600
Come on, Uncle Sid,

115
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I want us all to have
Christmas together.

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,100
Hmm. I don't know.

117
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,800
It's wildly irresponsible and impulsive
but let's do it!

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Northward, ho!

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
- Ho ho ho!
- Ho ho ho!

120
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Uh, guys, let's
follow the northern lights.

121
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,600
North. Get it?

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Northward ho!
Santa ho!

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,500
Ho ho ho!

124
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,500

Huh. I think we just
marched off the Earth.

132
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,899
No, it's a white-out.

133
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,600
We'll be safe
as long as we all...

134
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,000
stay together.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,699
Peaches, where are you?

136
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,199
Uncle Sid?
Peaches?

137
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,600
Huh?

138
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,500
Eddie? Where are you, Eddie?
Oh, wait. I'm Eddie.

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,700
Okay, everyone, grab hold of your
buddy and follow me.

140
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,200
I have an excellent
sense of direction.

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,399
Wait.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,399
Bless you.
Thank you.

143
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Ha! Did you see
what I just did there?

144
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,600
You're a reindeer.

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,500
Yeah, I know.

146
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,299
You can fly!

147
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,100
I know!

148
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,000
You're amazing!
I know!

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,399
Check it out, Sauerkraut.
I can hover, roll and zing.

150
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,299
Zing?
Zing! Bam!

151
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,299
What's your name?

152
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,200
My name is, um,
uh, Prancer.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,299
Prancer?

154
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,200
It's a family name.

155
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh, don't listen to them.

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,100
You saved our lives
and we'll never forget you.

157
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,600
Have a merry Christmas.

158
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you sure you
don't need my help?

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,899
Oh, no thank you.
You've done more than enough.

160
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,399
Look, we'll take
it from here.

161
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,799
The reindeer
comes with us.

162
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,399
Uh, what do you think?

163
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,399
You want an honest answer
or a Christmas answer?

164
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,399
Uh, Christmas answer.

165
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,299
It's gorgeous.

166
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,799
Manny?

167
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,000
Have you seen Peaches?
I can't find her anywhere.

168
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
And Sid, Crash and
Eddie are gone, too!

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,700
Last I saw them,
they were trying to figure out

170
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,200
how to get off
Santa's Naughty List.

171
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,399
What Naughty List?
I made it up!

172
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,500
We gotta find them.

173
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,700
Diego, can you pick
up Sid's scent?

174
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,600
I can but it makes
my eyes burn.

175
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
- Do it!
- Do it!

176
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,000
Got it.

177
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,200
So, Prancer, how long will it
take us to get to the, uh, North Pole?

178
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,399
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You can't walk to the North Pole.

179
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,799
It's too far.

180
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,700
But I can fly you there.
No sweat, on Air Prancer.

181
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, oh, no,
we couldn't.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,899
No, no, no, no.
My family raised me

183
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,100
to be good to strangers and there's
really no one stranger than you guys.

184
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Huh?

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,500
Shotgun!

186
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,700
We've run into
a little turbulence, folks.

187
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,600
Please fasten
your seatbelts.

188
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm not too heavy, am I?

189
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,299
No, no. You're light
as a feather.

190
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,500
A 788 pound feather.

191
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,299
Do you come
equipped with barf bags?

192
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Peaches! Peaches!

193
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,200
Manny, where's Diego?

194
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,299
Diego! Buddy, are you okay?

195
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Glad you didn't kiss me?

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Are you sure this is North?

197
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I don't know. I...

198
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm all scrambled.

199
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,899
Wait, tracks!

200
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,600
Uh, Diego?

201
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,200
The geomagnetic whatever,

202
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,100
it's messing with
my sense of direction.

203
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, well,
that's just great!

204
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,000
We're completely lost,
my little girl is missing and...

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,700
Manny, honey,
everything's gonna be fine.

206
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,799
How?

207
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,700
Just believe in
the magic of Christmas.

208
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,299
Oh, this is silly.

209
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,799
Just try it.
It's not gonna work.

210
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,399
Do it for Peaches.

211
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,299
I believe.

212
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,500
Manny, look!
The northern lights!

213
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,700
North. Get it?

214
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,799
Um, that was just
a coincidence, right?

215
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,399
Who cares?
I'll take it. Let's go.

216
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,200
We must be getting close.

217
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,200

00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,899
Don't, just don't.

221
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:22,000
Halt!
None shall pass.

222
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,299
Oh. Oh, hi, little guy.
So, who are you?

223
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,000
We are the Santourage.

224
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:32,799
We keep intruders out so Santa can
do his work without interruption.

225
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,200
I knew he was real!
You've gotta let us see him.

226
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
It is forbidden!

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,799
Turn back, I command you.
Bye!

228
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,200

You and what army?

229
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,000

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,700
Come on, Prancer.
We have to keep trying.

358
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,599
You're the only flying
reindeer we've got.

359
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,700
Unless you know
10 others.

360
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
You're right.
I can't do this alone.

361
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,799
Wait, where you going?

362
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Perfect.

363
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
Wow! Heck of a day,
eh, Santa?

364
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,400
Come on! Ho ho ho.

365
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,099
Oh. Still on the
Naughty List, huh?

366
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,299
Okay, so we traveled
about 30 feet so far.

367
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,900
If we keep up this pace, we should make
it around the world in what?

368
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's say just under
8000 years?

369
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,599
Bah, humbug!

370
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,400
Hey, guys!
Manny's right!

371
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,900
Nothing's impossible
if you pull together.

372
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,000
Meet my family.

373
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,200
Dasher, Dancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner...

374
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,299
Whoa!

375
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,599
...and Blitzen.

376
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,700
Blitzen?

377
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,400
And I thought
Prancer was bad!

378
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,900
Nice name.

379
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,099
It suits you.

380
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,900
Thanks, Prancer.

381
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,400
I thought I was
such a hotshot,

382
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
but sometimes you
gotta have a little help.

383
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,799
That's what this herd
has taught me...

384
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,400
Stay.

385
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,200
...among other things.

386
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,700
Now, let's do this.

387
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Ha-ha! Yeah!

388
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,599
Hey, Manfred, nice job!

389
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,500
I got Christmas!

390
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,700
See what happens
when you believe, Dad?

391
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,200
I gotta say, I'm kinda digging
the holiday magic.

392
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Merry Christmas, you two.

393
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,400
Ho ho ho!

394
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,500
All right! Whoo-hoo!

395
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Yeah!

396
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,599
Merry Christmas!
