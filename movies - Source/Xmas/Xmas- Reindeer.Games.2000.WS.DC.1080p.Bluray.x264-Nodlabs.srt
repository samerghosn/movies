is a criminal,

he's not a killer.

368

OK, where you got
the buffet down here,

815
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,174
that used to be Bangs's office.

816
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:13,154
And he kept the safe in there.

817
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:16,385
And that safe
had all the money

818
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:17,983
that he was skimming in there.

819
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:20,961

the Powwow Safe.

00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,636
The guy had thousands in there.

824
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:32,196

the money moves.

If they recognize him,

849
00:42:35,394 --> 00:42:37,632
they'll remember him
when the job goes down.

850
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:39,470
They won't recognize me.
Trust me.

851

852
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:46,046

You can either
get me in there,

858
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:56,418
I can take a look around
and case the joint,

859
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:57,584
check out security,

860
00:42:57,584 --> 00:42:59,628
and I can tell you if
I can work with this map

861
00:42:59,628 --> 00:43:01,526

shoot me right now.

01:09:32,515 --> 01:09:34,416
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ.

1425
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:38,617
What the flap
did you do to him?

1426
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:40,625
Bastard. Get out!

1427
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:41,921
Get out!

1428
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:44,259
Just get out.

1429
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:45,558
Oh, my God.

1430
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:47,896
Nick, are you all right?

1431
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:48,899
Hmm.

1432
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:50,492
Let me see.

1433
01:09:50,492 --> 01:09:52,094
Let me see.

1434
01:09:52,094 --> 01:09:53,798
Aah!

1435
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:55,465
Oh, God.

1436
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:56,872
Come here.

1437
01:09:56,872 --> 01:09:58,740
Come here.

1438
01:09:59,979 --> 01:10:01,469
Had some...

1439
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:03,845
p-points to make.

1440
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:05,043
Shh, baby.

1441
01:10:05,043 --> 01:10:08,110
We're going to get you
out of these wet clothes.

1442
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:09,279
OK?

1443
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:10,413
- Uhh.
- Oh, God.

1444
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:11,548
Aah!

1445
01:10:11,548 --> 01:10:12,648
Oh, God.

1446
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,127
OK.

1447
01:10:16,362 --> 01:10:17,112
OK.

1448
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:19,625
OK.

1449
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,375
OK.

1450
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:22,725
Come here.

1451
01:10:22,725 --> 01:10:23,734
Come here.

1452
01:10:23,734 --> 01:10:24,735
Rudy:
Jesus.

1453
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:26,863
There you go. OK.

1454
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:28,430
Ohh. Ohh.

1455
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:31,409
All I wanted to do was
to make it back to Sidnaw,

1456
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:32,910
just have some of
Mama's gravy, you know,

1457
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:36,346
and some of Aunt Lisbeth's
cranberry cakes.

1458
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:39,943
She makes them with...
with real cranberries.

1459
01:10:39,943 --> 01:10:41,486
It's really good.

1460
01:10:41,486 --> 01:10:42,816
Uhh. Uhh.

1461
01:10:42,816 --> 01:10:44,447
We'll get there, baby.

1462
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:46,321
- Jesus.
- We'll get there.

1463
01:10:46,321 --> 01:10:47,321
Shh.

1464
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:49,592
Just rest.

1465
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:50,856
OK?

1466
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:56,333
Uhh.

1467
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:58,563
You saved my life, Nick.

1468
01:10:58,563 --> 01:10:59,570
Huh?

1469
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,734
You could've run, but you didn't.

1470
01:11:03,734 --> 01:11:05,368
You saved me.

1471
01:11:05,368 --> 01:11:06,469
<i>You saved me.</i>

1472
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:10,482
I saved you because
I love you, Nick.

1473
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,182
Why did you save me?

1474
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:14,480
Be...

1475
01:11:15,922 --> 01:11:17,822
The guy I was in with,

1476
01:11:17,822 --> 01:11:20,188
Rudy the car thief...

1477
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,788
sometimes I read him
your letters.

1478
01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:28,300
I mean, I know they were
private, but...

1479
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,359
you know...

1480
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:31,926
he'd...

1481
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:34,530
I'd read them to him,
and he'd...

1482
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,904
get this look on his face.

1483
01:11:37,243 --> 01:11:38,403
I swear,

1484
01:11:38,403 --> 01:11:41,447
I think he imagined
you were writing to him.

1485
01:11:41,447 --> 01:11:44,005
And I know sometimes,

1486
01:11:44,005 --> 01:11:45,516
I think he...

1487
01:11:46,586 --> 01:11:50,613
he fell in love with you, too.

1488
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:54,751
You gave a couple
of guys hope, Ashley.

1489
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:57,694
Oh, it was a good thing.

1490
01:11:57,694 --> 01:11:59,925
We're going to get
out of this...

1491
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:02,934
together, I promise you.

1492
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:04,128
I promise you.

1493
01:12:39,705 --> 01:12:40,705
Ash?

1494
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:44,366
We're going to need one.

1495
01:12:44,366 --> 01:12:45,934
<i>Ashley:
What?</i>

1496
01:12:47,146 --> 01:12:49,046
A gun.

1497
01:12:49,046 --> 01:12:52,983
We got to find a way
to get me a gun.

1498
01:12:52,983 --> 01:12:53,984
What?

1499
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:56,878
And I'll need to be
inside the casino

1500
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:57,980
when it happens.

1501
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:01,515
I can't just be outside
drawing some map.

1502
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:05,189
Nick, what are you talking about?

1503
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:07,129
We need to find a way to
make me a part of this.

1504
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:09,225
A part of what?

1505
01:13:09,225 --> 01:13:10,234
A part of them?

1506
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:11,964
Look, Ash,

1507
01:13:11,964 --> 01:13:14,268
if we're helping them
with the robbery,

1508
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:16,604
we got to be doing more
than walking away

1509
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:17,802
like that's winning,

1510
01:13:17,802 --> 01:13:19,640
like that's some kind of
Christmas flaping bonus.

1511
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:23,777
You mean take the money?

1512
01:13:23,777 --> 01:13:26,648
Yeah. Take the money.

1513
01:13:26,648 --> 01:13:29,153
Look, you want him out
of your life for good?

1514
01:13:29,153 --> 01:13:31,782
<i>Rudy: Want a real new year
to look forward to?</i>

1515
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,519
If we're going to do this,

1516
01:13:33,519 --> 01:13:36,721
then we ought to do it.

1517
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,094
It's Christmas, Ash.

1518
01:13:39,094 --> 01:13:40,530
I think we deserve a present.

1519
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:09,492
Start singing, Nick.

1520
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,591
# I have no gifts to bring #

1521
01:14:12,591 --> 01:14:14,132
<i>Rudy:
# Ba rump bum bum bum #</i>

1522
01:14:14,132 --> 01:14:15,497
[Rudy Laughs]

1523
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:17,627
<i># A gift to give... #</i>

1524
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:19,432
You want it?
Let's go!

1525
01:14:19,432 --> 01:14:21,063
<i>Merlin:
Yeah. You want to keep playing, huh?</i>

1526
01:14:21,063 --> 01:14:22,368
Come on, let's get it on!

1527
01:14:22,368 --> 01:14:23,931
- Let me go!
- Calm down.

1528
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:25,341
<i>Merlin:
You want to keep playing?</i>

1529
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:28,141
I got a toy for you.

1530
01:14:28,141 --> 01:14:29,442
<i>Merlin:
Let me get my toy.</i>

1531
01:14:29,442 --> 01:14:31,608
Yes. Let's play!

1532
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:32,810
<i>- Hey, man. Hey.
- Merlin: Shut up!</i>

1533
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,910
Now you get
your pussy ass over here

1534
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,579
and do what the flap
you're told!

1535
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,958
Now when you're spoke to,
you listen and answer.

1536
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:59,644
It was a joke, anyways.

1537
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:04,209
Uh, ahem. All right.

1538
01:15:05,451 --> 01:15:08,818
What you want to do, um...

1539
01:15:10,323 --> 01:15:11,813
is get to the top level up here.

1540
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:13,358
<i>Rudy:
OK? And you do that</i>

1541
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:15,826
<i>through this door
on the western wall.</i>

1542
01:15:15,826 --> 01:15:17,624
<i>Um...</i>

1543
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:20,293
<i>when you...</i>

1544
01:15:20,293 --> 01:15:22,527
You want to get
to the security,

1545
01:15:22,527 --> 01:15:23,534
and then from the security,

1546
01:15:23,534 --> 01:15:24,797
you get down
into the cashier cage,

1547
01:15:24,797 --> 01:15:26,235
and then you go into
the count room.

1548
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,237
Now, there'll be
a guard in there,

1549
01:15:27,237 --> 01:15:28,534
but he doesn't have a gun.

1550
01:15:28,534 --> 01:15:31,975
<i>Rudy: Uh, the door's
accessed by a keypad.</i>

1551
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,638
<i>The cashier will know the code.</i>

1552
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:35,874
What about the Powwow Safe?

1553
01:15:35,874 --> 01:15:37,108
That's upstairs.

1554
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:38,741
You'll want to get to that.

1555
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:40,786
We're going to get
to the Powwow Safe.

1556
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:41,979
That's good.
We're going to get there.

1557
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:43,817
<i>Rudy:
What you want to do is,</i>

1558
01:15:43,817 --> 01:15:44,913
<i>you got to get a guy
in the cage</i>

1559
01:15:44,913 --> 01:15:47,289
and a guy on the floor

1560
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:48,691
<i>Rudy:
and somebody up top.</i>

1561
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:49,819
<i>Then you need a sweeper
on the side,</i>

1562
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:53,092
a lookout out front,

1563
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:55,224
and somebody
watching the back.

1564
01:15:55,224 --> 01:15:57,394
So, that's... how many?
That's 6.

1565
01:15:58,604 --> 01:16:01,539
We got 5,
keeping Ashley outside.

1566
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:04,842
And you need 6.

1567
01:16:06,245 --> 01:16:07,177
No.

1568
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:11,582
Look, man,
I'm not making this shooot up.

1569
01:16:11,582 --> 01:16:13,346
You know?
You go in there with 5 guys,

1570
01:16:13,346 --> 01:16:14,613
you're going to either
leave an exit unguarded

1571
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:15,745
or an alarm unguarded.

1572
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:16,495
No.

1573
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:18,914
I know what I'm
talking about. You...

1574
01:16:18,914 --> 01:16:21,357
Raise your hand if you've
ever done a robbery before.

1575
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,292
<i>Rudy:
Anyone? Anyone?</i>

1576
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:29,096
<i>Whoever has done
a robbery raise your hand. OK.</i>

1577
01:16:29,096 --> 01:16:30,100
I have.

1578
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,202
You need 6, Gabriel.

1579
01:16:36,202 --> 01:16:37,640
<i>Ashley:
You do.</i>

1580
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,541
What are you going
to do about it?

1581
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,283
<i>Gabriel:
All right.</i>

1582
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,019
I want a drawing
of that security level...

1583
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:54,253
Every door, every guard,
every ashtray.

1584
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:57,521
Yeah. All right.

1585
01:16:57,521 --> 01:16:59,564
So, 6 guys... that's 6 guns.

1586
01:16:59,564 --> 01:17:02,066
[Laughs]

1587
01:17:02,066 --> 01:17:03,066
No way.

1588
01:17:03,066 --> 01:17:04,830
Well, what am I going to do?

1589
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:05,893
I'm no threat
without a gun.

1590
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:07,666
No, you're not.

1591
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:11,039
What's the matter, Gabriel?

1592
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,039
Huh?

1593
01:17:13,012 --> 01:17:15,742
Isn't this what
you wanted him for?

1594
01:17:15,742 --> 01:17:18,579
<i>Ashley:
Areas of expertise?</i>

1595
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:19,583
No guns.

1596
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:22,177
Well, you know, fine.
It's up to you.

1597
01:17:22,177 --> 01:17:23,516
But what you got
to figure out, then,

1598
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:25,022
is how you're going to get
up to that security level

1599
01:17:25,022 --> 01:17:26,854
without anybody knowing
anything's wrong.

1600
