00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:45,436
How about you unlock this door.

3
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,740
And we can have the most
wonderful time of the year.

4
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,991
You're never getting
out of this jail cell.

5
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,980
Hmm.

6
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,784
You're playing hard to get.

7
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,356
You like the anticipation

8
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,860
before you get the presents.

9
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,528
Right?

10
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,608
How long do you think
it's gonna be

11
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,978
before daddy comes to get me?

12
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,548
- Never.
- Hmm.

13
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,984
See, we hit him.
And he's hurt.

14
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,354
And sooner or later,
he's gotta go get help,

15
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,022
and when he does,
he's gonna slip up.

16
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,959
And I'm gonna be there
to nail him.

17
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,430
The only place
that you two are going...

18
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,733
Is to the chair.

19
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,088
<i>Confirm 187
in Woodridge mall parking lot.</i>

20
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,591
<i>CSU currently processing scene.</i>

21
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,959
<i>Sheriff Mitchell arriving now.</i>

22
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,995
Here ya go, chief.

23
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:28,600
What is it?

24
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,000
It's an eggnog latte.

25
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:31,836
It's festive.

26
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:35,973
Okay, what've we got?

27
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,576
Dead guy.

28
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,779
Yeah, your years of police
training served you well then.

29
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,548
Well, we're calling in
for prints and fibers but...

30
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,884
Anything?

31
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,519
Kinda hard to get prints
in the snow.

32
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,620
- Car?
- Yep.

33
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,057
<i>That's it, right over there
in the parking lot.</i>

34
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,824
<i>- Got the keys on him?
- No.</i>

35
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,127
So do we have a cause of death?

36
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,531
Well, I'm not a doctor but...

37
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,100
There's the body.

38
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,735
And his head is that.

39
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:06,737
Jesus...

40
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:12,576
Is there anything else?

41
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,646
Actually, yeah. Dave!

42
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,913
Yes, deputy Fullard?

43
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,115
Thanks.

44
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,420
Want me to run it up?

45
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,990
Yeah. See if we can pull
some DNA off this.

46
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,524
Hey, can you run
that up, please?

47
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,160
- Yes sir.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,981
Listen, sheriff,
what are you thinking?

49
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,197
Nothing good.

50
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,603
You're not really him.

51
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,182
There you are!

52
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,536
<i>Tell me!</i>

53
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,639
<i>You seem to have the answers
for everything.</i>

54
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,810
<i>Why don't you do
what you always promised?</i>

55
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,846
<i>Don't punish me for working!</i>

56
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,480
<i>I got you everything!</i>

57
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:24,216
<i>What do you want?</i>

58
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,891
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

59
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,737
<i>I never see you.
You're never home for dinner.</i>

60
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,975
<i>She waited for you
and I've had it!</i>

61
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,180
If this is happening...

62
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,949
If this is what you want...

63
00:06:58,617 --> 00:06:59,985
We should do what?

64
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,552
We need to tell her!

65
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,654
Hey, sweetheart.

66
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,990
Felt sure you were
never getting up.

67
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,226
Yeah, well, I decided
to grace you with my presence.

68
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,862
It's Christmas, after all.

69
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,307
I need to be moving.

70
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,545
Okay.

71
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:26,545
<i>Coming up to eight o'clock and we're
just getting a travel report...</i>

72
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:32,117
<i>woodridge mall, due
to a police investigation</i>

73
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,817
<i>in the mall parking lot...</i>

74
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,786
What?

75
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,088
Doesn't matter.

76
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,191
Come on, you got something
to say, just say it.

77
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,927
This is bullshit.

78
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,127
- Jen!
- What?

79
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,297
I don't like that
kind of language.

80
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,564
Mom, what is this?

81
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,266
It's... complicated.

82
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,168
It's divorce, mom.
I know what it is.

83
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,105
- Frank and i...
- Frank?!

84
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:56,707
You've stopped
calling him dad already?

85
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,845
We feel that it would be easier
to just get through Christmas

86
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,880
- and then we can...
- Just split?

87
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:07,786
We all want a nice family
Christmas together.

88
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:08,752
Right?

89
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:08,752
<i>Insisting the mall is open,</i>

90
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:13,625
<i>despite the ongoing
police investigation there.</i>

91
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,728
We're only doing this
because we love you, sweetheart.

92
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,798
It's a lie, mom.

93
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,266
It's not even a good one.

94
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,235
I'm gonna be late.

95
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,670
Jennifer...

96
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,923
No Santa.

97
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,826
So I guess that means no work
for you too, huh?

98
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,962
Guess so.

99
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,231
That's what I should ask Santa
for: All play and no work.

100
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,067
I have no idea what
I want for Christmas.

101
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,336
Uh, a boyfriend
with a huge cock.

102
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:34,405
Hasn't he stiffed you
enough on that one?

103
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,841
A girl can dream, can't I?

104
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,375
Dream about what, babe?

105
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,278
About what I
really want for Christmas.

106
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:43,682
- Is it perfume?
- Yeah, it's perfume, Joe.

107
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,283
I thought you guys
weren't doing the mall.

108
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,251
Well, Lancelot had
to see his maiden.

109
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,153
You're so weird.

110
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,389
- Good weird?
- There is no good weird.

111
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,104
David's on his way up.
Hey, did you guys see the lot?

112
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,126
- No.
- Police everywhere.

113
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,394
- Why?
- Dead guy.

114
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,962
Who?

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,833
- No way.
- -Yeah.

116
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,836
Probably got drunk
and broke his neck or something.

117
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,437
Holy shooot!

118
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,839
Don't!

119
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,741
- Jen starts as an elf tomorrow.
- Sweet.

120
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,344
My mom thought it would
take my mind off things.

121
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,778
Hey, I thought that was my job.

122
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,816
Hey. What's happening?

123
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,817
Jen's impending job as an elf.

124
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:21,086
The kids love me.

125
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,486
They shouldn't.

126
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,490
The kids shouldn't love me?

127
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,792
No, no.
Not... not you, babe.

128
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,960
Christmas.

129
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,495
Why can't kids love Christmas?

130
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,864
- Yeah, man, what gives?
- They're being lied to.

131
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,033
Seems like a pretty
harmless lie.

132
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,836
Really? Sitting on some fat
guy's lap all day, huh?

133
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,405
Sounds like a pedophile's
dream to me.

134
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,042
Please don't make Christmas anymore
depressing than it already is.

135
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:48,011
That's why we should totally
have our party on Christmas Eve!

136
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,248
- Party?
- Yeah. It's, uh...

137
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,517
- It's called drum fest.
- Drum fest?

138
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,486
Yeah, it's a drumming competition
happening down at Phil's bar.

139
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,520
This is really lame.

140
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,990
I have training for
the swim meet that night.

141
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,390
Besides, we're not gonna get in.

142
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,993
You can miss one day
of training.

143
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,894
Phil is calling it
a private affair.

144
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,976
The bar's closed to anyone
who doesn't have a ticket.

145
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,465
But I don't have a ticket.

146
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,533
There aren't actually
any tickets.

147
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,369
He just wants to call it
a ticket-only affair.

148
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,937
Oh, that reminds me.

149
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,509
I need a lead groupie, you know,
just to tell me how great I am.

150
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,778
- Oh, how could a girl say no?
- Me, too.

151
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,880
You don't even play the drums.

152
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,482
Well, no, but I have a pretty
sick iTunes playlist

153
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,152
and maybe I'll let you
hear it if...

154
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,254
If what?
I lose my phone?

155
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:33,423
We're having an annual boyfriend
review on January 1st, Joe,

156
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,360
and you seriously
need to up your game.

157
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,797
Babe?

158
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,536
- She'll be back.
- Sure, man.

159
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:46,837
Sure.

160
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,389
You want me to close the mall?

161
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,356
Morning, Bob.

162
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,197
I'm considering it.

163
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,965
- Considering?
- Yeah.

164
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,966
Is the killer in the mall?

165
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,067
No.

166
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,236
Then why close it?

167
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,972
Bob, this is a serious situation
and I'm trying to prevent...

168
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,274
How long you been
in this town, sheriff?

169
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,411
Thirty years.

170
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,246
We like to keep things
simple here in Woodridge.

171
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,250
Simply put,
a man's been murdered.

172
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,985
Yeah, and I hope you catch
the son of a bitch.

173
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,956
But we do not want
to start a panic now, do we?

174
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:40,591
So you want me
to conduct this manhunt

175
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,059
with one hand tied
behind my back?

176
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,394
I want you to do your job,
sheriff.

177
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,232
As always, Bob,
your leadership is inspiring.

178
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,239
Have a productive day, sheriff.

179
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:55,606
Asshole.

180
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:08,986
<i>Wrpt Woodridge,
for all you couples looking</i>

181
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,522
<i>to have some hot fun
together tonight...</i>

182
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,494
- Jesus.
- shooot.

183
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,331
What, uh, seems to be
the problem, officer?

184
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,970
Yeah, I'm looking
for "old romantic 1980."

185
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,971
Is that you?

186
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:28,639
What?

187
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,140
Yeah, man, we met online.

188
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,509
Chat room.

189
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:33,510
Are you serious?

190
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,280
No, dipshit.
I'm joking.

191
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,149
You two shouldn't be out here.

192
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,619
It ain't illegal.

193
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,154
What's that?
Call her parents?

194
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,691
Uh, what he means, sir, is we're
not doing anybody any harm.

195
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,052
And where do your parents
think you are?

196
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,595
It's Christmas.

197
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,397
You're a few days
out there, kid.

198
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,331
All right, look.

199
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,336
I'm heading out to Mcdermott's
place, checking on a call.

200
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,270
I'll be about an hour.

201
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,438
Okay.

202
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,708
"So you'll be gone
when I get back," okay.

203
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,644
Okay.

204
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,679
Have a good evening, sir.

205
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,980
Yeah.

206
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,418
shooot. That was close.

207
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,955
- Yeah.
- Think he's gone already?

208
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,057
- Give him a chance, Troy.
- Okay.

209
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,259
Maybe we should go.

210
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,022
You heard him.
He's gonna be back in an hour.

211
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,433
Come on, look, I'll let you
drive my car a bit.

212
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,036
It's your dad's car, Troy.

213
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,304
Well, I'll let you
play with my gears.

214
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,106
It's an automatic.

215
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,610
What was that?

216
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:43,648
- What?
- There was a noise.

217
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:47,719
- Babe, please.
- Don't, "babe, please" me.

218
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,755
I'm taking you on your word that you're not
still fully hung up on your ex-girlfriend.

219
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,758
- Jen?
- Yeah, Jen.

220
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,427
Sweetheart, she means
nothing to me.

221
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,399
There. Underneath the car.

222
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,668
It's probably just a raccoon.

223
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:05,769
Do you still wanna do this?

224
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,339
I don't know.

225
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,640
Babe, you're the only one for me.
There's nobody else.

226
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,312
Mmm. Say more things
like that.

227
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,749
The worst that could happen
is you get pregnant.

228
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,683
I'm on birth control, you moron.

229
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,719
Well, then what else
could go wrong?

230
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,554
I have no idea why I love you.

231
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,490
Baby, you...

232
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,631
shooot!

233
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,335
Get us out of here!

234
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,570
It won't start.
There's no battery!

235
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,672
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

236
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,511
- Get out!
- My door is jammed!

237
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,649
No!

238
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,883
- Sheriff.
- Fullard.

239
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:02,653
It's a mess.

240
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:06,190
- Who?
- Two kids. Teenagers.

241
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,125
What happened?

242
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,295
Be a couple days before the
fire inspector gets back to us.

243
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,565
Kathy says you saw them before.
Called something in.

244
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,267
Didn't you recognize them?

245
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:20,137
They're just kids.
I... I don't know...

246
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,739
Come on, it's a small town.

247
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:25,643
Look, sheriff, I haven't
been here as long as...

248
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,411
Some people.

249
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,882
Anything back on the DNA?

250
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,352
Sent to the state
lab last night.

251
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:36,712
You know we're not gonna be
first priority though.

252
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,221
We might be.

253
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,593
You don't think this is
connected to that?

254
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:44,761
Completely different mos?

255
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,034
I don't know what
I'm thinking right now.

256
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,739
Only I was looking forward
to a quiet holiday season.

257
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,176
Still haven't done my shopping.

258
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,846
I don't two mur... three murders
dragging us into overtime.

259
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,955
Look, it might be a coincidence.

260
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,324
No such thing.

261
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,787
Who could that be?

262
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,327
Can I help you?

263
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,729
Mrs. Frenchen?

264
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,698
Yes?

265
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,734
I'm in need of a good lawyer
and you came highly recommended.

266
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,003
Could you open the door?

267
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,506
I'm afraid I just
specialize in divorce.

268
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,609
Well, then you're exactly
the person I'm looking for.

269
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,548
You see, Santa, he told me he wouldn't
buy me a bear trap for Christmas.

270
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,518
I reckon that's grounds
for divorce, right?

271
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,319
You can come
by my office next week.

272
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,082
I'd be happy to take a look
at what you need.

273
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,460
I'm afraid there's a real bad time
limit on what I need you for.

274
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:28,932
Who are you?

275
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,869
Why, I'm Mrs.
Claus, of course.

276
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,565
Tell me what you think
about my elf hair.

277
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,969
So, Santa asked you
to sit on his lap?

278
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:06,903
Please. If that asshole
hits on me again,

279
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,538
I'm gonna pepper spray his ass.

280
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Is Lisa coming?

281
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,675
Swim practice.

282
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,576
That's dedication.

283
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,413
She's gonna be selected
for the Olympic squad

284
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,781
and we're still gonna be
stuck here in this mall.

285
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,884
Speak for yourself. If they start
giving out gold medals for blow jobs...

286
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,653
I'm going to Reicher's
bar later.

287
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,655
- Do you wanna come?
- You're not gonna get served.

288
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,991
Please! I have boobs.
Boys are dumb.

289
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,826
- Hmm. No debate here.

290
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,461
Hey, Jen, your break's finished.

291
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,930
Hey, Jen...

292
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,066
If you hate it so much,

293
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,074
why'd you come back?

294
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:39,002
It's either that or join in
on my family's awkward silences

295
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,605
it's definitely happening then?

296
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,840
The divorce?
God, I hope so.

297
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,810
At least then we won't
have to play happy family.

298
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,013
What's that?

299
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,049
Oh, Joe and David wanted me
to hand these out.

300
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:55,920
Well, aren't you
a good girlfriend?

301
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,622
It's an annual tradition.

302
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,659
- Being a good girlfriend?
- I'm an amazing girlfriend.

303
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,560
He's so flaping lucky.

304
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,930
And, no, the party is
an annual tradition.

305
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,731
It's a stupid tradition.

306
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,034
- Says the girl who's
dressed like an elf.

307
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,971
Did you, um,
did you hear about Troy?

308
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:15,772
No.

309
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,142
He... died last night,

310
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,944
in an accident
with Michelle Weaver.

311
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,779
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

312
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,117
Did you guys... um...

313
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,587
Did you guys, like, do it?

314
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,557
No, we... we only went out
for, like, three weeks.

315
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,626
It's fine. In three weeks, I totally
would have fucked him, like, 30 times.

316
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,162
Well, I didn't really
like him that much.

317
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,663
Who said anything
about liking him?

318
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,499
Well, what kind of accident?

319
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,434
- I don't really know.
- I hope his family's okay.

320
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,577
<i>Confirmation from the fire
department on two dead.</i>

321
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,413
<i>Looks like it was deliberate.</i>

322
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,516
<i>Traces of gas have been
found at the scene.</i>

323
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:06,089
What?

324
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,724
Uh...

325
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,461
Come on.
Spit it out, Fullard.

326
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,497
Manny was speaking
with the fire inspector.

327
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,598
It's early, but he thinks
it was deliberate.

328
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,934
Found traces
of gas on the ground

329
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,069
and the starter cables were cut.

330
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,105
shooot.

331
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,875
It might not be related
to the Santa Claus at the mall.

332
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,109
Oh, come on.

333
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,999
What are you thinking?

334
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:32,817
Like a serial killer?

335
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:36,653
Hey, I don't want anyone speaking
those words out loud, you got it?

336
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,023
- Then what?
- I don't know.

337
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,760
Let's just take it easy
and compile evidence.

338
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,729
Better yet, a suspect list.

339
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:47,443
Wait, shouldn't they
have the same mo?

340
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,900
They do.
They're all dead.

341
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,535
Uh, mayor's office called.

342
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,570
They're worried about
Christmas being ruined.

343
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,207
Kathy, can you get NYPD homicide
on the line, please?

344
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,576
He's been on line two
for five minutes.

345
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,898
You know he called you
the Grinch?

346
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,614
You gotta be flaping kidding me.

347
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,517
I got three murders in two nights and he's
worried about people not spending enough?

348
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:07,852
Kathy!

349
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,752
Line two!

350
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,121
He hung up!

351
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:13,123
Okay, I'll get him back.

352
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,661
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

353
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,498
I think the mayor's just worried
that one of the victims is a voter.

354
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,199
Doesn't wanna lose too many.

355
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,167
Kathy! Get me the bureau!

356
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:31,909
Feds?

357
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,878
Yeah, we're out of our depth
on this one.

358
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,884
- What do you need?
- A drink.

359
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,123
I'm okay.

360
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,105
Told Joe to flap right off,
you know what I mean?

361
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,806
- Oh my god!
- All right.

362
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,208
Cheers ladies!

363
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,613
Okay.

364
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,375
This one's totally going
on my Facebook wall.

365
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,551
Don't tag me.

366
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,185
My boyfriend thinks
I'm babysitting.

367
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,022
Yeah. My mom thinks
I'm studying.

368
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,991
Hey, beautiful lady!

369
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:24,228
- Hey, lady!
- Oh god.

370
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,864
- Hey, sexy lady! Whoo!
- Great.

371
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,999
The last thing I want
right now is to be hit on.

372
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,335
Funny, that's the first
thing that I want.

373
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,673
Why don't we go to the sun house?
I have the key.

374
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,240
We'd have the whole place
to ourselves.

375
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:39,209
What's there?

376
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,944
More alcohol.

377
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,813
Hey, hot mama!

378
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,815
Sure.

379
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,616
Probably a small cock anyway.

380
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,333
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

381
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,124
Let's not stay here alone.

382
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,888
Maybe we should have sacrificed
Courtney to those guys.

383
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,733
Wow. Remind me why
we're friends again?

384
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,746
Hello?

385
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,719
Are you okay?

386
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:24,855
Honey, honey.

387
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,222
Are you okay?

388
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,938
Oh my god! Oh, my god!

389
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,740
Please, no!

390
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,308
No!

391
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,222
But baby, I wanna play!

392
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,724
Let's not be greedy,
Mrs. Claus.

393
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,798
Four birds.
Four birds.

394
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,432
'Tis more than enough
for one day.

395
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,211
So, Santa Claus?

396
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,249
And Mrs. Claus?

397
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,958
Do you know why
they didn't hurt you?

398
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,431
One sec, okay?

399
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:21,838
Talk to me.

400
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,340
Four dead girls.

401
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,344
- Girls?
- Yeah, teenagers.

402
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,880
- Underage.
- shooot.

403
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,317
She say anything?

404
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:37,354
Yeah, something about two freaks

405
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,490
dressed up as
Mr. and Mrs. Claus.

406
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,157
At least the mayor's
gonna love that.

407
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:44,086
Never mind the press. We need
to start running with it.

408
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,190
Get as much as you can on them.

409
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,398
Mayor's on the line.
He wants to talk to you.

410
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,301
That was fast. Jesus.

411
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,171
Get on the horn, right now.

412
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,905
Get the mall to pull
their Santa Claus off.

413
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,007
What?

414
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,942
Before some yahoo
blows his flaping brains out.

415
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,045
No, we've got
media blackout on this.

416
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,380
Oh, really?

417
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,516
Twitter and Facebook disagree.

418
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,125
Pigs.

419
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,433
Why don't we call
your parents now, okay?

420
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,240
Or I can.

421
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,967
Santa Claus?

422
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,435
He's dressed as
flaping Santa Claus?

423
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,104
Yes.

424
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,873
God damn it.

425
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,407
I'm gonna put a curfew in place.

426
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,843
- Excuse me?
- A curfew.

427
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,618
There's no evidence these two
are related, is there?

428
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:11,448
With all due respect, Mr. mayor,

429
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,282
you're not a law
enforcement officer.

430
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,420
No, I'm the mayor, and somebody
has to run this town.

431
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,590
Do you have any idea what will
happen to Christmas sales

432
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,291
if you close that mall?

433
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,961
If people keep dying, there
won't be any customers left.

434
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:29,132
You get your ass out there and
you find this guy and this girl

435
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,969
and you lock 'em up
and you throw away the key.

436
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,872
In the meantime,
you let me run this town.

437
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,273
- Bob! We have to come to...
- That's enough!

438
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,912
I was selected on a platform of decency
and promoting family values in Woodridge.

439
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:45,048
These murders are
flaping that image up.

440
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,483
Aren't you going to
a strip club this week?

441
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,354
Yeah, because I put money
in the local economy.

442
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:54,258
I support local business and I
get to see the voters up close.

443
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,626
Very close up, I'm sure.

444
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:58,528
Yeah.

445
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,298
I am particularly looking
forward to...

446
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,400
Seeing my niece.

447
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,568
Who's all grown up now.

448
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,404
Just starting at vixens.

449
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:12,509
Excuse me.
I have an investigation to run.

450
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,243
And I've got a town to run.

451
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:17,047
And you will not pull Santa
out of that mall.

452
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,182
You will double his security.

453
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:20,183
Is that clear?

454
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,519
Good.

455
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,694
<i>Dispatch, this is unit 215.</i>

456
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,397
<i>The feds have arrived.
It looks like the cavalry</i>

457
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,965
<i>made it just before
the snow drifts</i>

458
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,134
<i>completely cut the roads off.</i>

459
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,170
<i>Copy that, 215.</i>

460
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,172
<i>I guess we'll have to make some
room in the office.</i>

461
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,273
<i>10-4.</i>

462
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,042
<i>- So how many?
- Seven.</i>

463
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:50,146
The four girls, a young
couple, and Santa.

464
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,315
Missing a number.

465
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,449
Excuse me?

466
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,286
One, two and four.

467
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,388
shooot, are you saying there could
be three more bodies out there?

468
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,258
It's highly possible.

469
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,326
Perhaps a remote
or isolated location.

470
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,288
Might just be that we
haven't found them yet.

471
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:08,037
These descriptions
of the killers are accurate?

472
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:09,700
Oh, they're accurate.

473
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,403
Those are from
the CCTV last night.

474
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,539
Not saying they're
easy to swallow.

475
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,246
Okay, the lady.
We figure mid-twenties.

476
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:26,516
She's Mrs. Claus, for lack
of a better explanation.

477
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,551
The guy? Well, Santa.

478
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:30,519
Is he as big as Santa?

479
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,390
About 30 to 40
years of age, we figure.

480
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,692
Ex-military?
Former cop?

481
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,527
Somebody who has the ability
to move quickly.

482
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:38,769
And take multiple victims down.

483
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,064
Yeah. This Mrs. Claus
is just for show.

484
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,067
She's like, um,
letting off a stun grenade.

485
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,470
This guy's the real deal.

486
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:48,404
Okay.

487
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,375
Well, we can't release any information
on the killer to the press.

488
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,309
What?

489
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,711
If he doesn't know we're onto
him, he'll keep using the suit.

490
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:57,780
May be a good way to spot him.

491
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,017
Oh, so just look for a guy
in a Santa suit at Christmas?

492
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,685
To be honest, I don't think
this guy cares.

493
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,186
Why do you say that?

494
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,189
'Cause he let a girl
live to tell a tale.

495
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,458
He wants people to know.

496
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,559
You don't have to pander
to that.

497
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,063
Yeah, but that may make him keep killing
until he gets the recognition he wants.

498
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:16,432
Let's have a tight control on
information out to the public here.

499
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,167
This is a small town.

500
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:18,167
Come on, guys.
People are talking already.

501
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,239
Either way, you need to find who
the victims were on the third day

502
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,540
because there seems to be
a piece of this puzzle missing.

503
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:27,344
- And we'll need your men on it.
- Oh, great.

504
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,778
Go door to door if you have to.

505
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,414
- It's a big town.
- You said it was a small town.

506
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,750
I suggest you get every
available man on it.

507
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,991
Find out if anyone has gone
missing in the last few days.

508
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,726
I don't suppose you guys
want to lend a hand, do ya?

509
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,261
"Many hands make light work,"
isn't that what they say?

510
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:49,231
Between the training experience
myself and the other agents have,

511
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,434
us doing grunt work would
be a poor use of our time.

512
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,569
I'm sure your deputies
are more than capable.

513
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:56,306
We'll stay here
and review the evidence.

514
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,406
Okay, okay.

515
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,809
What else do you need?

516
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,078
How about a connection
between the victims.

517
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,846
We need to understand
how he's choosing them.

518
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:06,849
He's targeting them at night.
We know that much, at least.

519
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,451
Nah, there's something else.

520
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,287
They didn't know each other.
None of them did.

521
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,689
And I can't establish any other
connection between them.

522
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,825
Hey, hey. We're not here
to step on anyone's toes.

523
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,561
Neither am I! I'm just trying
to catch this flaping guy!

524
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:22,465
Guys, the clock's ticking.
This guy's killing every day.

525
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:26,782
I'll double the patrols
at night.

526
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:30,500
The curfew'll go into effect.

527
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,243
Remember sheriff, you called us.

528
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:45,474
Klein.

529
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,545
Yeah, I'm at the Frenchen
residence.

530
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,750
We've got three dead bodies.

531
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,418
Yup.

532
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,789
The mom, Mrs. Frenchen,
the daughter...

533
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:01,757
And I found their dog as well.

534
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,893
I haven't touched anything.

535
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:07,963
Okay. I'll be here.

536
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:27,751
This is probably just another small
town nut looking for attention.

537
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,887
The sooner these cases stop
getting media coverage,

538
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,356
the sooner the crazies
will realize there's no point

539
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,918
in trying to get this type
of attention.

540
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,360
My money's on a lone gunman.

541
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:38,862
I'm going with postal worker.

542
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,976
Postal worker would have
shot the place up.

543
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,699
flap, then maybe it actually
is Santa Claus.

544
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,967
Is anyone betting on that?

545
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:47,771
If it was Santa Claus, where did
he park his sleigh and reindeer?

546
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,639
Maybe he's gone green
and drives a Prius?

547
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:49,972
My wife drives one of those.

548
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,809
Oh, yeah? Can she account
for her whereabouts recently?

549
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,344
Yeah. I know where
yours has been.

550
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,079
I'm getting coffee. Anyone?

551
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,081
No, thanks.

552
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:10,927
<i>Where the fire ripped through
the county snow plow yard</i>

553
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,362
<i>destroying nearly all of the
county's plows...</i>

554
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,532
Hello?

555
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:20,369
Okay. Just stay there.

556
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,938
Don't touch anything.
I'm gonna get the guys.

557
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,641
Who are they?

558
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:30,646
Show me.
Three of them?

559
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,952
Right. We're on our way.

560
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:36,985
We're gonna...

561
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,016
Help me!

562
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,179
Woodridge is a town
gripped with fear.

563
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,947
With the latest massacre
of five FBI agents,

564
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,949
there is now a feeling
amongst the residents

565
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,820
<i>that the Sheriff Department is
overwhelmed by the situation,</i>

566
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,023
<i>prompting many people to leave
this town during the holiday.</i>

567
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:50,860
<i>After all, if the FBI
aren't safe, then who is?</i>

568
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,018
Yes, I understand.

569
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:18,454
Certainly, certainly.

570
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,690
All right.

571
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,028
Whoever they were,
they move quick.

572
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,766
Agent Klein managed to get off one
shot, so he may have been hit.

573
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,668
Well, we're checking the blood
now but, to be fair,

574
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,505
there's a lot of it,
so it's gonna take a while.

575
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
He's hit?

576
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,974
Possibly.

577
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:41,677
We've taken blood samples
from the deceased agents

578
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,847
and we're cross-matching that against
all the blood we found on the scene.

579
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,780
If there's anything
extra, we know it's from

580
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,518
the perp and it's
likely he's been hit.

581
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,838
Okay, Fullard, let's get the bloodhounds
down here on the chance he's been hit.

582
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,623
He's local.

583
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,259
The feds have a net set up
around town, so he's here.

584
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,494
Also, Jim, he, um...

585
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:00,996
He removed their fingers.

586
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:02,965
Fingers?

587
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,168
Yep. From each
and everyone of them.

588
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,237
- Even the bird.
- The bird?

589
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,938
Bird. Yeah.

590
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:10,940
The woman.

591
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,242
Oh, right. I keep
forgetting you're a Brit.

592
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,411
Let's let the fuckers bleed
to death for this.

593
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,081
The same finger?

594
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,050
Yeah. The, uh,
wedding band finger.

595
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,518
We're gonna need some more FBI
guys down here.

596
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,688
How is he picking them?
That's what I wanna know.

597
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,726
There's no way he could know which
agents the FBI would send there.

598
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,894
It's totally at random.
They could be from anywhere.

599
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,730
No, it's the opportunity.

600
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:36,231
Could've been these five.

601
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,034
Could've been the goddamn
cleaning staff.

602
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,768
But he is escalating
the numbers.

603
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,237
Till he gets to how many?

604
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,773
Maybe the number doesn't matter.

605
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,809
Maybe they're getting close
to something.

606
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,246
Fullard, photograph all
the notes these guys had.

607
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,681
Maybe they were on to something.

608
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,717
Yeah, well, the press
is gonna want a release.

609
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:55,851
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,954
But if they were wanted
by the cops,

611
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,923
why risk everything
by coming back in here.

612
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,858
No, we were all out there.
All of us.

613
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,960
Hunting him down.

614
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:06,728
Streets would've
been full of cops.

615
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,664
But this place was quiet.

616
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:09,932
Exactly.

617
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,068
Anything else?

618
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,431
I'll let you know when I get
the results of the blood tests.

619
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,007
Happy hunting, Jim.

620
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,208
Thanks.

621
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,164
Yeah, there is actually
something else.

622
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,349
Farmer Peterson's raging mad.

623
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:27,983
About what?

624
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:29,952
Says his geese were killed.

625
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:33,188
Is this guy for real?
Take a flaping number.

626
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,025
That's what I thought.

627
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:22,105
So what are you gonna do
about my geese?

628
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,639
I came out here, there they are.

629
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,974
What are you gonna do about it?

630
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,876
- Yeah. Mr. Peterson..
- That's your job.

631
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:26,876
- Mr. Peterson, yeah...
- what are you gonna do about this?

632
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,911
I know how you came out and all
your geese were found dead...

633
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,813
No, not all my geese.
Are ya blind? Look.

634
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,215
There's six of them dead. Six.

635
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,153
Hey, did you say six?

636
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,018
Nice try, Joe!

637
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:45,387
Asshole.

638
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,528
We're checking the CCTV
from the mall,

639
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,831
but it looks like a lot
of cameras aren't working.

640
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,268
There's a lot of places to hide
inside there when the place is open

641
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,338
and a lot of exits
to slip out when it's closed.

642
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,141
But I've got men questioning all
the staff who were left in there.

643
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,076
Something will turn up.

644
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,244
We'll find this guy.

645
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,248
So, sheriff, what are you saying?
No one here's safe?

646
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:48,951
Look, Lucy, panicking is
exactly what this guy wants.

647
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,153
Well, who do the fingers
belong to?

648
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,923
Uh, that information is not releasable
to the public at the moment.

649
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,025
So you know?

650
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,827
Whatever the reason, this guy's
reaching out to your daughter.

651
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,797
Why would he?
What would he want with me?

652
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,266
I don't know.

653
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:05,333
The letter... do you
recognize the handwriting?

654
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,336
Why would we know him?

655
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:09,972
Lucy, I'm just asking.

656
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,574
Anything you know could help.

657
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:15,110
This is the first time he's
reached out to anyone by name.

658
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,001
We're looking for a connection
and Jennifer may be it.

659
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:22,251
Are you saying they're
targeting my family?

660
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,219
Do you know of anyone with a
grudge against you?

661
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,353
Particularly at Christmas?

662
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:26,454
- No.
- No.

663
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:31,827
I'm putting a unit on your house
and Jen till we catch him.

664
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:35,197
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

665
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:37,934
Do we know why he's doing this?

666
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,402
Not yet, but we're
getting closer.

667
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,237
He left Courtney alive.

668
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,240
Have you seen anything strange
in the last few days?

669
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:46,541
Phone calls?

670
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,543
No.

671
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,880
- What about the name?
- St. Nick?

672
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:53,916
I assumed it was just a bad
Santa Claus joke.

673
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,384
Joke?

674
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,487
Yeah, sometimes
these killers like to...

675
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:01,056
Like to hide out in the open.

676
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,925
And it may be someone you know,
so don't go walking around alone

677
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,628
until we nab this creep
and his accomplice.

678
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,197
Jen, time's a factor here.

679
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,134
Would you be willing
to do a polygraph test?

680
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,570
That's enough!

681
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:15,498
This may be the quickest
way to find out if

682
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,472
she knows anything that
she hasn't said yet.

683
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:19,407
- I'm calling Rihann Frenchen.
- You can't, Lucy.

684
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,210
I can call a lawyer
anytime I want.

685
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,079
She's not even under arrest,
for Christ's sake.

686
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,380
She's the victim here.

687
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:27,016
You can't call Rihann Frenchen.

688
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,083
And why the hell not?

689
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:32,034
Because her whole family
has been murdered.

690
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,393
We're leaving.

691
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:38,661
- Come on, Jennifer.
- We're not finished...

692
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:39,896
Come on!

693
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,170
That went well.

694
00:46:49,405 --> 00:46:50,672
Yeah, keep an eye on them.

695
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:52,507
Well, you don't think
they're suspect?

696
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,110
No, but I got a connection now.

697
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:57,012
Jen worked at the grotto
at the mall.

698
00:46:57,213 --> 00:46:58,280
First victim.

699
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,416
No, she hasn't worked there
long enough.

700
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,652
I've known Jen my whole life.
I don't think she's involved.

701
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,253
Then maybe someone
connected with her.

702
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:10,126
- Fullard?
- Uh, yeah.

703
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:11,293
You with me here?

704
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,195
Yeah. Sorry, I just, uh...

705
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,403
I think it's a weak connection.

706
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,998
Yeah but it's some connection.

707
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,268
The second victim, Troy,
her ex-boyfriend.

708
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,472
And now David Frenchen's
daughter.

709
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,608
That's too much
coincidence for me.

710
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,476
Add to that the fact her best
friend, Courtney,

711
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,445
was the only girl left alive
at the bar attack.

712
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:32,949
Um... did you get my message?

713
00:47:33,215 --> 00:47:34,717
Mm, no, I've been a little busy.

714
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:36,217
Farmer Peterson called.

715
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,221
- And?
- Geese have been poisoned.

716
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:41,724
Is this like the time the
government salted his corn

717
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,425
because he turned in
a UFO report?

718
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,195
Jim. There were six of them.

719
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,463
- Six?
- Yeah.

720
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,365
Oh.

721
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,168
- Good.
- How's that good?

722
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:55,338
Could've been six dead bodies.

723
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,039
Oh. True.

724
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,474
- Did he see anything?
- No.

725
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,063
Hello?

726
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:29,431
Is someone there?

727
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,791
<i>Front door, open.</i>

728
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,695
Hello?

729
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,298
Mom?

730
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:39,568
Dad?

731
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:47,809
Whoever's there better
show themselves.

732
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,679
Courtney?

733
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:52,213
Hey.

734
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:55,317
Is it okay if I...

735
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,289
I didn't wanna be alone.
Even in daylight.

736
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:03,525
Yeah. It's okay.
You okay?

737
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,563
Aren't you working today?

738
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,431
Shopping mall's closed.

739
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,635
What is it?

740
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,172
Lisa.

741
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:18,606
She didn't come home last night.

742
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:19,641
Her parents are worried.

743
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:21,943
Oh, god.

744
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,280
- Did she call you?
- No.

745
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:29,318
- We have to stick together.
- Together?

746
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:31,920
Court, this psycho
is targeting everyone.

747
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,423
Jen, I was with four friends
in a busy bar

748
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,393
and that didn't stop anything.

749
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,960
- We have to do something.
- What?

750
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,764
Let's not wait to be a victim.

751
00:51:43,632 --> 00:51:45,900
Okay. But... but how?

752
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:46,902
I don't know.

753
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:49,838
You saw these guys.

754
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:53,809
Maybe there's some connection
that we're not making

755
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,710
that not even
the sheriff can see.

756
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:59,882
Everyone so far has had a connection
with either me or my family.

757
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:01,951
Well, what do you wanna do?

758
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:03,619
I don't know.

759
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,356
What do we know about Woodridge?

760
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,326
Woodridge.
It's just a sleepy town.

761
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,427
No, no, there's something,
I know there is.

762
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,264
- We should look into it.
- Are you sure?

763
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,735
I'm not gonna be a victim again.

764
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,449
Look, I can assure you we are doing
everything we can to catch the perpetrator.

765
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,552
While the manhunt and
investigation are still ongoing,

766
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:39,288
I can't give you any information
that would jeopardize that.

767
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,289
Deputy, what about the reports
of the missing girl?

768
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,891
Could it possibly be the work
of this crazed killer?

769
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:47,630
I can't comment on anything that
will compromise this investigation.

770
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:50,666
And you guys aren't making it any better
by trying to create panic out there.

771
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,402
Deputy, don't you think your inaction
may have cost them their lives?

772
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,498
Look, me and the team are
working around the clock...

773
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:56,672
didn't put a curfew in place.

774
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,226
The mayor is saying
it should have been

775
00:52:58,237 --> 00:53:00,153
implemented the moment the
first body was found.

776
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,844
Did that come
out of the mayor's mouth?

777
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,813
Sure did.
Care to comment?

778
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,382
We'll see about that.

779
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,349
Don't... sheriff?

780
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,331
They're like jackals in there.

781
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,465
You got some flaping nerve!

782
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,670
You useless sack of shooot!

783
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,706
You've been nothing but a hindrance
in this entire investigation!

784
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,418
If I catch this asshole,
you best hope I don't

785
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:36,744
try to indict your
ass for obstruction!

786
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,079
- Jim!
- You wouldn't dare.

787
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,981
- Try me.
- -Jim!

788
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,483
I want you gone
by the end of the day!

789
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:44,585
- Listen, mayor...
- Can it!

790
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,724
Sheriff Mitchell
is relieved of his duties.

791
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,458
You are temporary sheriff.

792
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,061
And you have a drinking problem.

793
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,996
And it just will not do anymore.

794
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:58,867
I no longer have any faith in your
ability to perform your duties.

795
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,601
Now, I'm outta here.

796
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:04,639
I'm going to my son's
bachelor party

797
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,976
and by the time I'm back,
I want you gone!

798
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,612
Prick.

799
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,018
- No handcuffs.
- Okay.

800
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:20,489
Nice flaping shot.

801
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,862
So...

802
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,467
So what happened
to Peterson today?

803
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:34,369
Ah, something was vandalized.

804
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:35,903
Vandalized?

805
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,740
Yeah, some milking machines
or some shooot like that.

806
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,579
Peterson's an asshole.

807
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:47,750
He's almost as popular as I am.

808
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,719
Come on, let's go get a coffee.

809
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,590
Yeah.

810
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:00,061
The sheriff's department has issued
an urgent plea to the public

811
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,143
for help with their
investigations into the killings.

812
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,465
If you have any information
you think may help,

813
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,501
contact Woodridge pd
immediately.

814
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:01,554
What?

815
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:03,692
Lisa swan's parents
are freaking out, Jim.

816
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,494
Did we get a unit
over to the pool?

817
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:06,594
I went myself.

818
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,463
Turns out she was
the last one...

819
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,068
Turns out she was the last one there,
to do some extra swim practice,

820
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,137
which isn't unusual,
but then nothing.

821
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,905
CCTV?

822
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,007
Disabled.

823
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:20,742
Anything else?

824
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,079
Yeah, we found swans
in the pool.

825
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,148
- What?
- Little toy swans.

826
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:28,016
Oh. Good.

827
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:29,784
How's that good?

828
00:56:30,853 --> 00:56:31,893
Could've been bodies, Sam.

829
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,125
Hey, what do you want me
to tell Lisa swan's parents?

830
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,596
Where did this come from?

831
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,197
Sam!

832
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,103
What?

833
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,378
Hey, does anybody else
know about this red box?

834
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,954
Jim, we should get
bomb squad on this.

835
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,259
It's not his style.

836
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:57,572
What the hell is that?

837
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,311
I told you I'd
keep the mall open.

838
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,179
Hey, this is on me.

839
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:36,972
So do you want me
to be naughty or nice?

840
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,208
I've always liked naughty girls.

841
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,710
What do you want for Christmas?

842
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,280
I want you.
Unwrapped.

843
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,454
And I wanna find these crazies
that are killing our taxpayers.

844
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:57,425
Well, it's your lucky day.

845
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,994
Why is that?

846
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,434
Because Santa Claus
is coming to town!

847
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:11,139
Oh, this is not gonna be good
for the local economy.

848
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,380
Have fun, baby!

849
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,193
Merry Christmas, everyone!

850
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,436
What the flap?

851
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,849
Dispatch. I need a unit right
away over to vixens strip club.

852
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,349
Multiple 1-8-7s.

853
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:57,952
It isn't... it's not live.

854
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,293
Ah, flap.

855
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:09,864
What do we do now?

856
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,202
Call the coroner.

857
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:17,338
Tell him to bring
a lot of body bags.

858
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:23,811
Jen, I don't know.
We've been at it for hours

859
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,280
and we still haven't
found anything.

860
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,018
- There's plenty of murders just...
- nothing this gruesome.

861
01:01:31,853 --> 01:01:33,155
shooot.

862
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:34,356
I don't know.

863
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,891
Have you tried searching
your parents?

864
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,460
My parents?

865
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,262
Yeah, I mean,
they're whiter than white,

866
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:42,864
but we all know our parents
are just as fucked up as we are.

867
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,231
Hey, it's worth a shot.

868
01:01:54,876 --> 01:01:55,876
Is that your mom?

869
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,012
Yeah.

870
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,248
Who's that guy?

871
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:09,224
<i>A state of emergency has now been
declared in northeast New York</i>

872
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:13,929
<i>as a record nine feet of snow has
effectively buried some towns and roads.</i>

873
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:18,199
<i>St. Lawrence, Jefferson and Lewis counties
are still the most badly affected.</i>

874
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:23,237
<i>With many towns in Lewis now
completely inaccessible, even by air.</i>

875
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,375
<i>This, of course, means that residents
in the community of Woodridge</i>

876
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,210
<i>are effectively on their own</i>

877
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:33,014
<i>trapped in extreme weather in this
town with the Christmas killer</i>

878
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:38,119
<i>still at large after
slaughtering five FBI agents.</i>

879
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:41,155
<i>With the weather not likely
to improve for several days,</i>

880
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,391
<i>it's difficult not to feel sorry
for those who are trapped...</i>

881
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:47,362
There's a storm coming.

882
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,864
Ah, for Christ's sakes, Fullard.

883
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,333
No need to get so melodramatic
about the whole issue.

884
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:55,402
Um, I mean there's
an actual storm coming.

885
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:58,440
You know, bad weather, falling
trees, blizzards, et cetera?

886
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,474
I think that's really gonna
delay the new feds.

887
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,010
Great.

888
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:04,880
They get anything back from the
lab on the DNA for that apple?

889
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:08,449
Pear? No, we didn't really
pull anything off the swab.

890
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,771
Didn't get any fingerprints
that were any good either.

891
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:14,255
Say again?

892
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,257
I mean, like,
the swab wasn't very good.

893
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,393
And the fingerprints...

894
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:20,362
We don't have the kind of
database to do...

895
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:22,063
No, no, no, no.
Not that part.

896
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:24,666
Did you say pear?

897
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,202
- Yeah.
- I thought it was an apple.

898
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,204
Well, so did I, but it's a pear.

899
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:33,007
Why?

900
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,576
Pear?

901
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,146
Pear... pear tree.

902
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:42,483
- Uh... what was his name?
- Who?

903
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:46,153
The mall Santa... the guy...
The Santa at the mall.

904
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,023
- Come on, come on.
- I got it. Got it here.

905
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:50,025
- Uh...
- Come on.

906
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:52,360
- James.
- James? James what?

907
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,460
- Partridge.
- Ja...

908
01:03:57,632 --> 01:04:00,668
Wake everybody up.
I've got it.

909
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,269
Got what?

910
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,407
How the son of a bitch
is targeting people.

911
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,358
Sheriff, they're, uh, coming in
but the storm...

912
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:25,059
Yeah, yeah.

913
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,329
We've been looking
at this all wrong.

914
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:30,699
We've been expecting the number
of murders to match the day,

915
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,601
with a link to Jennifer
and her family.

916
01:04:35,036 --> 01:04:36,271
But there's more to it
than that.

917
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:38,072
Sheriff, what are you
talking about?

918
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,356
"On the first day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me...

919
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:44,244
- A partridge in a pear tree."
- Oh shooot.

920
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:47,114
"On the second day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me,

921
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,751
two turtle doves."
Turtle dove point.

922
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,588
"Three French hens"...
The Frenchens.

923
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:54,655
Three of them.

924
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,590
What is it?

925
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,726
Uh, the song. I can't
remember the... the, uh...

926
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,663
- The lines...
- "Four calling birds."

927
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,164
"Four calling birds."

928
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,134
<i>"Birds," the British term
for girls.</i>

929
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,534
<i>Four birds. Four women.</i>

930
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,536
Which is why they left
Courtney alive.

931
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,108
Oh flap!

932
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:15,476
"Five golden rings."

933
01:05:17,278 --> 01:05:18,713
The FBI guys.

934
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,148
- Peterson's geese!
- "Six geese a-laying."

935
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:27,188
"Seven swans a-swimming."

936
01:05:29,324 --> 01:05:31,259
Then something doesn't match up
here, 'cause last I checked,

937
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,228
we didn't have eight
milk maids killed.

938
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:36,297
No, I'm wrong.
Peterson's farm.

939
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:40,335
There's a spot at the back.
Eight milk maid machines.

940
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,503
Completely destroyed.

941
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,605
Umm... "Nine ladies dancing!"

942
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:45,572
<i>The strippers at the ViXen club.</i>

943
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,641
Uh... "Ten lords a leaping."

944
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,277
The mayor's son's bachelor party.
Ten of them dead.

945
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,414
This is good, good, good. Umm...

946
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,215
It's not over yet though, Jim.

947
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,217
There's twelve days
of Christmas.

948
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,786
There's still two lines left
in that song.

949
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,755
Yeah, I know.
But he's local.

950
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:02,824
- He has to be.
- Yeah but how can you be sure?

951
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:05,059
Peterson's geese.

952
01:06:05,327 --> 01:06:07,362
Uh... swans in a swimming pool,

953
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:11,733
five FBI agents show up for
their fingers to be hacked off.

954
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,835
Yeah. He's local.

955
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:18,139
Or he knows somebody who is.

956
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,141
You have to have access
to Peterson's farm

957
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,110
to get in twice
without being spotted.

958
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:26,913
Which is right next
to Jen's old house.

959
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:28,833
The swimming pool is...

960
01:06:28,844 --> 01:06:30,351
I'll be right back, sheriff.
I gotta check something.

961
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,519
Yeah, yeah.
The swimming pool...

962
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,621
Swimming pool... swimming pool.

963
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:37,858
Kathy!

964
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,262
Let's get some
Christmas music in here.

965
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,164
Did he just say Christmas music?

966
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,467
<i>Front door, open.</i>

967
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:53,141
Hey! Have you eaten yet?

968
01:06:58,813 --> 01:06:59,813
Jen?

969
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,451
Who's sergeant Nicholas Conway?

970
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:09,757
Oh, god.

971
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:17,664
Mom?

972
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,835
You know that frank and I
love you very much.

973
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,706
Mom, I need to know.
What is this?

974
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,541
When I was younger...

975
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,646
Before I met your... frank...

976
01:07:37,418 --> 01:07:38,418
I was married.

977
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,456
To who?

978
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,391
Nick Conway.

979
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:48,396
He was a very popular guy and...
He was in the British military.

980
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:50,465
Handsome.

981
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,900
He, um...

982
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,802
He came back from the Gulf war.

983
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:59,940
Kosovo, places I've never
even heard of and, uh...

984
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,510
He changed, Jen. He...

985
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,748
He became... mean.

986
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,317
Nasty.

987
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,251
I was terrified.

988
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,920
I...

989
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,722
I tried to make
a happy life with him.

990
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,725
He used to say he was like
a bullet in a chamber

991
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,360
and the trigger had been pulled.

992
01:08:21,596 --> 01:08:22,796
What did he do?

993
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,368
On Christmas Eve...

994
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,270
He, um...

995
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:32,974
He attacked me.

996
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,444
- Tried to murder me.
- God.

997
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,579
- He came at me with a knife.
- Jesus!

998
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:40,414
The police...

999
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:43,217
They arrested him.

1000
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,985
I-I had to leave him.

1001
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:46,787
Mom?

1002
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:48,488
I'm sorry.

1003
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:52,894
I divorced him.

1004
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:58,565
And Mrs. Frenchen?
She represented you.

1005
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:02,670
That's why you always refer
to her as your lawyer

1006
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,538
even though she only did
divorce cases?

1007
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:05,541
That's right.

1008
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,948
And this happened
at Christmas, didn't it?

1009
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,747
Served divorce papers
on Christmas day.

1010
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,585
He said that I had
broken up the family.

1011
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:18,920
Christ!

1012
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,488
He went off the deep end.

1013
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,792
They, uh, took him to a mental
institution to get help.

1014
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:26,560
And he escaped?

1015
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,729
No. That's just it.

1016
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,567
The mental institution burned
down three years ago.

1017
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:34,002
Nick Conway died.

1018
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,006
- At least I...
- You thought he died?

1019
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,609
They found all of his teeth
in the ashes.

1020
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,444
I mean, they wrote a death
certificate

1021
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:47,981
based on all of his teeth
and a burnt corpse.

1022
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:49,951
Well, clearly,
he didn't die, mom.

1023
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:51,586
He's out!

1024
01:09:52,387 --> 01:09:53,621
He's out.

1025
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:57,391
Wait...

1026
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,726
That's not it, is it?

1027
01:10:01,462 --> 01:10:03,965
I'm sorry, Jen.
I should've told you the truth.

1028
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:05,565
What truth?

1029
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:08,368
Wait...

1030
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,838
You said he said you'd
broken up the family.

1031
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,676
But if it were just
the two of you,

1032
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,743
that's not a family,
that's a marriage.

1033
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:19,079
God.

1034
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,551
When I left him...

1035
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,953
- I was pregnant.
- No.

1036
01:10:27,088 --> 01:10:29,090
- Nick Conway is...
- No!

1037
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,792
I'm sorry, Jen.
I should've told you sooner.

1038
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,762
So my biological father
is a raving lunatic?!

1039
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,733
Jen, you're not your father's daughter!
You're nothing like him!

1040
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,902
He's killing people, mom,
so what does he want?!

1041
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,810
If he wants the same thing
as when he was committed,

1042
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:47,475
he wants us
to be a family again.

1043
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:52,939
Well, clearly we're not that
dissimilar after all.

1044
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,900
<i>Front door, open.</i>

1045
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,609
Why didn't you say anything?

1046
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,145
You know why.
He's dead.

1047
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:27,981
Then there's no harm
in telling anyone,

1048
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,617
if that's what you believe.

1049
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,787
He's dead.
They found all his teeth.

1050
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,521
Was it conclusive?

1051
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:39,127
They found enough teeth and blood for the
coroner to say his death was very probable.

1052
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,461
Probable.

1053
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,130
Lucy, they never found a body.

1054
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:46,701
Sam, please.

1055
01:11:47,502 --> 01:11:49,703
Do you think I wanted to believe
this shooot is happening?

1056
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:52,506
Last time I saw this guy
in action he killed...

1057
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:57,677
He killed my best friend
in cold blood for no reason.

1058
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,779
I know.

1059
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:02,550
We just put all this stuff
behind us.

1060
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:03,751
Does frank know?

1061
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,686
- What would I tell him?
- The truth, Lucy.

1062
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:10,690
It's not your fault
this guy lost his mind.

1063
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,092
And what would I tell Jen?

1064
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,729
That her father's a psychopath?

1065
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,096
At least she'd be prepared.

1066
01:12:16,099 --> 01:12:16,997
For this?

1067
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,533
It could be him.

1068
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,034
He's dead.

1069
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:24,704
If that's what you believe,
then why not tell the sheriff?

1070
01:12:25,573 --> 01:12:26,673
Because...

1071
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,976
I'm not so sure I believe that.

1072
01:12:31,212 --> 01:12:33,146
- You should tell the sheriff.
- No!

1073
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:35,182
- Why?
- Think of Jennifer.

1074
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,018
I am thinking of Jennifer!

1075
01:12:41,122 --> 01:12:42,556
If it is Nick Conway...

1076
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,961
Then we know exactly what direction
that attack is gonna come from

1077
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:49,564
and that's more than we've
got to go on right now.

1078
01:12:50,865 --> 01:12:53,234
There was a girl with him,
too, right?

1079
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,235
Yeah.

1080
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:58,139
But we don't know
who she is yet.

1081
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:00,574
I might.

1082
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:03,077
What?

1083
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:05,746
How?

1084
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:07,481
If it is him...

1085
01:13:09,484 --> 01:13:11,118
Then the girl could be
the only other body

1086
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,154
that was unaccounted for
in the wreckage.

1087
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:14,988
Who is she?

1088
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,057
Criminally insane and guilty

1089
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,493
- of three counts of murder.
- Jesus, Lucy.

1090
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:22,697
All right.

1091
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:25,945
I have to go
check something out.

1092
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,238
There's a patrol car outside.

1093
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,020
Got nothing to worry about.

1094
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:36,711
Sam, I've messed it all up.

1095
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:37,878
Not yet.

1096
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,047
We still got time
to get through this.

1097
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,117
Wait here.
Wait by the phone.

1098
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,309
<i>The change in the storm front
over northeast New York</i>

1099
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,579
<i>means the roads could be
accessible in the next 24 hours,</i>

1100
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:14,314
<i>but after yet another massacre,</i>

1101
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:17,051
<i>one has to wonder
for the residents of Woodridge,</i>

1102
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:20,020
<i>will 24 hours be too late?</i>

1103
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,672
<i>Woodridge police department.</i>

1104
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:39,914
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

1105
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:44,811
Hi, sheriff.

1106
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,181
It's Lucy, uh, Jen's mom.

1107
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:51,152
Listen.

1108
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,287
I think I know who's been
doing all of this.

1109
01:14:55,756 --> 01:14:58,292
I think it's Jen's
biological father.

1110
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:03,264
And she didn't know and
she's out there all alone...

1111
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,145
Frank?

1112
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,381
The phone's gone dead.

1113
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:27,921
The storm probably took out
the local cell phone tower.

1114
01:15:34,762 --> 01:15:36,130
<i>Front door, open.</i>

1115
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,931
Oh, god.

1116
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:39,265
Jen?

1117
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:52,246
Hello?

1118
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:06,092
Frank?!

1119
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:08,328
- <i>Front door, open.</i>

1120
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:16,804
Frank?!

1121
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:02,248
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

1122
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:05,752
- Frank!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1123
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:07,854
Frank!
Oh, no, no, no.

1124
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:10,890
Frank isn't joining us
for the rest of his life.

1125
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,827
You need a new husband!

1126
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,729
Please, Nick.

1127
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,430
Oh, I'm just kidding!

1128
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,899
I'm not gonna hurt you,
sweetheart.

1129
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,167
You're the mother of my child!

1130
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,970
What do you want?

1131
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,039
Well, just to get the family
back together over the holidays!

1132
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,409
Hey! There she is!

1133
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:46,793
All we're missing is mistletoe!

1134
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,131
You...

1135
01:17:51,032 --> 01:17:53,868
Are gonna love what
I got you for Christmas.

1136
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:55,336
Is it a bear trap?

1137
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,371
Well, why don't we wait and see?

1138
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:00,507
Let's get frank down here
and get this party started!

1139
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:23,831
Still nothing?

1140
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:25,131
No.

1141
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:30,037
Let's just try and
enjoy this night, okay?

1142
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,305
Yeah, it's okay, Jen.
Nothing to worry about.

1143
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:42,817
<i>Dispatch to 3-9-2.
Please check in.</i>

1144
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,921
3-9-2,<i> this is dispatch.</i>
<i>Check in, please.</i>

1145
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:49,556
<i>3-9-2, come in.</i>

1146
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,326
<i>Bobby, you there?</i>

1147
01:19:12,213 --> 01:19:13,948
Sheriff, pipers piping.

1148
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:17,217
<i>- Dispatch to 2-7-4.</i>
- Copy that.

1149
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,154
<i>2-7-4, please proceed to mount
drive and check on officer Davies.</i>

1150
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:23,122
<i>We just got a message
from the house,</i>

1151
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,426
<i>but the phone line is now dead
and Davies isn't checking in.</i>

1152
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,493
Understood.

1153
01:19:30,364 --> 01:19:33,466
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house.</i>

1154
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:37,238
<i>Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.</i>

1155
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:40,373
<i>The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,</i>

1156
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,877
<i>in the hopes that Saint
Nicholas would soon be there.</i>

1157
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,413
<i>The children were nestled,
all snug in their beds,</i>

1158
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:51,284
<i>while visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads."</i>

1159
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,622
Ten, nine, eight...

1160
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:03,130
<i>"And mamma in her
handkerchief and I in my cap,</i>

1161
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:06,634
<i>had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap."</i>

1162
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:08,601
Seven, six...

1163
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:11,438
<i>"When out on the lawn
there rose such a clatter,</i>

1164
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,140
<i>I sprang from the bed
to see what was the matter.</i>

1165
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,110
<i>Away to the window I flew
like a flash,</i>

1166
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:20,346
<i>tore open the shutters
and threw out the sash.</i>

1167
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:22,917
<i>The moon on the breast
of the new fallen snow,</i>

1168
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,653
<i>gave the luster of mid-day
to the objects below.</i>

1169
01:20:26,453 --> 01:20:29,355
<i>When what to my wandering eye
should appear,</i>

1170
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:32,626
<i>but a miniature sleigh
and eight tiny reindeer."</i>

1171
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,560
<i>Five, four...</i>

1172
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:38,399
<i>"With a little old driver,
so lively and quick,</i>

1173
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,435
<i>I knew in a moment,
it must be Saint Nick.</i>

1174
01:20:43,003 --> 01:20:45,672
<i>He spoke not a word,
but went straight to his work</i>

1175
01:20:46,373 --> 01:20:49,275
<i>and filled all the stockings
and then turned with a jerk.</i>

1176
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,947
<i>And laying his finger
aside of his nose,</i>

1177
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,181
<i>and giving a nod,
up the chimney he rose."</i>

1178
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,016
<i>Three, two...</i>

1179
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,720
<i>"He sprung to his sleigh
and to his team gave a whistle,</i>

1180
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,957
<i>and away they all flew,
like the down of a thistle.</i>

1181
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,594
<i>But I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight,</i>

1182
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,698
<i>'happy Christmas to all,</i>

1183
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,734
<i>and to all,
a bloody good night!'"</i>

1184
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,636
- one! Merry Christmas!

1185
01:21:28,315 --> 01:21:29,315
Mom?

1186
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,484
Lisa?

1187
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,020
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1188
01:21:34,288 --> 01:21:36,155
Now... who's been naughty?

1189
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,027
Holy shooot!

1190
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,600
Joe!

1191
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:47,734
Let's go! Let's go!

1192
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,487
- Lucy?
- She's not here.

1193
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:07,488
Why would he take her?

1194
01:22:09,556 --> 01:22:10,757
Eleventh day.

1195
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,626
This is the twelfth.

1196
01:22:14,561 --> 01:22:16,462
"Twelve drummers drumming."

1197
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:19,666
"Twelve drummers... drumming."

1198
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:32,746
shooot!

1199
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:37,484
- They killed Joe.
- We need to move.

1200
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:40,119
We're not leaving
without mom and Lisa.

1201
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,654
No, we're all
getting outta here.

1202
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:43,556
- David.
- I'm not leaving you!

1203
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,198
They can't take the person
I love away from me.

1204
01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:47,828
I'm gonna try to
draw them outside.

1205
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,328
Courtney, no.

1206
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,298
We can't be victims again, Jen.

1207
01:22:54,101 --> 01:22:56,235
Hey! Jingle whore!

1208
01:22:56,703 --> 01:22:59,305
You want some?
Well, come get some!

1209
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,340
I'm coming too!

1210
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,244
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1211
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,824
Come on!
We have to go! Please!

1212
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:23,162
Come on, get up!

1213
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,265
I can't move!

1214
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:27,467
Come on! We need to get out...

1215
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,720
flap you! Go to hell!

1216
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:52,626
I like a girl with some spunk!

1217
01:23:53,694 --> 01:23:55,328
- No! No! No!
- Stop!

1218
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:00,634
There she is.

1219
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:01,768
Let them go.

1220
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,737
- Go!
- Hey! Get away from her...

1221
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,738
Stop!

1222
01:24:05,506 --> 01:24:06,573
Please.

1223
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:08,141
No one else.

1224
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:12,712
What father could ignore the pleas
of his beautiful baby girl?

1225
01:24:12,846 --> 01:24:15,215
If you let them go,
you can take me.

1226
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,550
Ha!

1227
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,185
There's the Christmas spirit
I been looking for.

1228
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:20,686
Please.

1229
01:24:21,788 --> 01:24:22,788
Look at you.

1230
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:24,757
All grown up.

1231
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:27,226
My beautiful baby girl.

1232
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:30,430
You turned into a full-blown
true blue hero.

1233
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:32,765
I'm not a hero.

1234
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,467
Neither am I.

1235
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:37,470
But that's what they call you
when you kill for uncle Sam.

1236
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,940
Oh, don't worry, I didn't kill
anybody that cared about Christmas,

1237
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,708
and that applies
to the people here, too.

1238
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:46,279
But you... you could be
the real deal.

1239
01:24:46,282 --> 01:24:48,681
A true hero
and not even know it.

1240
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,851
I could never kill anyone.

1241
01:24:54,488 --> 01:24:55,488
We'll see.

1242
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,225
Because you and I
are gonna play a game.

1243
01:25:00,627 --> 01:25:02,868
And then we'll see how far
the apple falls from the tree.

1244
01:25:06,533 --> 01:25:07,634
You like it?

1245
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,737
It's an IED.

1246
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:16,342
Absolutely amazing what you can buy
at a hardware store these days. Hmm?

1247
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:17,543
Why are you doing this?

1248
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:20,980
For your protection.

1249
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:24,417
From what?

1250
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,253
From people that don't
believe in anything.

1251
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,256
You could do better
than that, Jennifer.

1252
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:30,823
You gotta fight
for what's right!

1253
01:25:30,826 --> 01:25:32,259
No, you know what
you have to do?

1254
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:33,894
You've got to kill
for what's right.

1255
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,494
And I know you can.

1256
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:37,516
You only let the light
to show the way.

1257
01:25:37,864 --> 01:25:39,533
- Me?
- Yeah.

1258
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,400
Because you and I...

1259
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,270
We're the same.

1260
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:45,905
You and me, kiddo.

1261
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:49,342
And I got you a brand new mommy.

1262
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:51,444
You're gonna love her.

1263
01:26:02,024 --> 01:26:03,657
Come on, get some!

1264
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:04,757
Yummy.

1265
01:26:06,793 --> 01:26:08,862
I'm not gonna love her or you.

1266
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:11,864
And don't pretend you love me,

1267
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,400
because you would never
kill my friend if you did.

1268
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:16,036
How dare you!

1269
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:18,438
Love never dies, Jennifer.

1270
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:21,841
They're gonna catch you
and they're gonna kill you.

1271
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,679
No. No, baby.

1272
01:26:27,614 --> 01:26:28,614
No, they're not.

1273
01:26:29,283 --> 01:26:30,417
But you know what?

1274
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,418
If you want me dead...

1275
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,587
Here, all you have to do is
do it yourself.

1276
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:36,489
- What?
- There you go.

1277
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:37,658
There you go, baby.

1278
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,059
The power's in your hands.

1279
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,461
Just pull the trigger.
Go for it.

1280
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,029
- Pull the trigger.

1281
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,599
I can't kill anyone.

1282
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,003
Oh. Maybe you have to.

1283
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:53,873
Cause if you don't,
I might pull this trigger.

1284
01:26:54,775 --> 01:26:56,136
And you wanna guess
what that does?

1285
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,478
Hmm?

1286
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,960
Now, be a good girl
and put the gun up

1287
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:02,448
or I might blow mom away.

1288
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:07,820
Attagirl.
Raise it up.

1289
01:27:08,922 --> 01:27:11,591
Come on. Come on.

1290
01:27:11,592 --> 01:27:12,658
That's it.

1291
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:15,595
Come on. Come on.

1292
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,731
That's it. Go!

1293
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:19,734
Come on!

1294
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:22,735
Come on baby girl.
That's it.

1295
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,604
Come on. Do it!

1296
01:27:29,676 --> 01:27:33,046
You see?

1297
01:27:34,414 --> 01:27:35,895
You and I are not
all that dissimilar.

1298
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,819
You only lack the motivation.

1299
01:27:40,654 --> 01:27:41,954
Get away from her.

1300
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,657
You're insane!

1301
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,025
Call me dad.

1302
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:47,828
Hey, look.

1303
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,396
Whoa. Hold it tight.

1304
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:52,099
Hold it tight.
There we go.

1305
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,502
Or you'll kill all of us.

1306
01:28:02,643 --> 01:28:03,844
Do you love her?

1307
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:05,979
What?

1308
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,118
It's Christmas, David!

1309
01:28:14,588 --> 01:28:17,858
Do... you... love her?

1310
01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:19,760
Yeah.

1311
01:28:20,494 --> 01:28:21,494
Yeah, I do.

1312
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:24,831
That's nice, isn't it?

1313
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:29,002
Every father wants to hear that
his little baby girl is loved.

1314
01:28:30,537 --> 01:28:31,537
They really do.

1315
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:35,574
You know what the only problem
with it all is?

1316
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:39,110
He doesn't ever really want
to hear it from another guy.

1317
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,149
Oh, well.

1318
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,729
Don't you flaping move!

1319
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:03,069
- Where is he?
- flap you!

1320
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,541
- Call for backup!
- Sheriff, we don't have time for that.

1321
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,009
We don't have time to wait.

1322
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,644
Call it in!

1323
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,212
We've got one suspect
in custody.

1324
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:15,114
I need backup and EMR right now
immediately down to Phil's bar.

1325
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,987
We have company, Jennifer.

1326
01:29:22,989 --> 01:29:24,957
Okay, listen, baby.

1327
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,926
I'm gonna make things real
interesting, 'cause time is short.

1328
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:30,529
In ten seconds, both of those
IED vests are gonna explode.

1329
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,966
But, you can pick
who lives and who dies.

1330
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:38,471
- Eight seconds.
- I can't.

1331
01:29:38,474 --> 01:29:40,474
Of course you can. If you
do nothing, both will die.

1332
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:41,675
Where's the sense in that?

1333
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:43,777
- No!
- Come on.

1334
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,613
Four, three, two...

1335
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,686
You see?

1336
01:29:53,689 --> 01:29:55,154
There you are.

1337
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,091
Yes. You can kill.

1338
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,061
Attagirl.

1339
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:03,697
You can kill.

1340
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,800
You just need
the right motivation.

1341
01:30:07,167 --> 01:30:09,536
When someone takes something
from you that you love,

1342
01:30:10,837 --> 01:30:12,072
you'll kill to protect it.

1343
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,809
Just. Like. Me.

1344
01:30:22,015 --> 01:30:23,115
You're safe now, Jennifer.

1345
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:24,917
We got it from here.

1346
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:29,288
Don't you listen to him.
You're not safe.

1347
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,759
He's just gonna lock me up
and I'll escape

1348
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,561
and then I'll find you...
Both of you!

1349
01:30:37,564 --> 01:30:39,198
So what's my baby girl gonna do?

1350
01:30:43,904 --> 01:30:45,805
Close your eyes.

1351
01:30:45,806 --> 01:30:46,872
No!

1352
01:30:55,181 --> 01:30:56,181
It was a stun grenade.

1353
01:30:57,885 --> 01:30:58,885
You're safe. You're safe.

1354
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:01,555
He's gone.

1355
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:16,869
<i>The horrific Christmas killings that
rocked the sleepy town of Woodridge</i>

1356
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:19,605
came to a terrifying
conclusion this morning,

1357
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:23,076
with an early hours massacre
at an event in Phil's bar,

1358
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:25,912
<i>the main drinking establishment
in this now infamous town.</i>

1359
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:29,882
A series of bizarre murders
and vandalism that crescendoed

1360
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:33,052
over the last 12 days finally
climaxed with a deadly assault

1361
01:31:33,055 --> 01:31:35,188
on the patrons of a music event.

1362
01:31:36,122 --> 01:31:38,345
Details are still
emerging, but we do know

1363
01:31:38,356 --> 01:31:40,694
that so many people were
killed and injured,

1364
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:44,363
that extra emergency personnel had to be
brought in from neighboring counties,

1365
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:48,601
<i>with victims still being taken
to hospital well into daylight.</i>

1366
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:52,271
One suspect is believed to be in
police custody while the other,

1367
01:31:52,672 --> 01:31:55,207
army veteran, Nick Conway,
is still at large.

1368
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,811
Local police chief, sheriff
Mitchell, issued a warning

1369
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:00,646
<i>to the public not
to approach Conway,</i>

1370
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:02,849
<i>but to instead call 911
immediately,</i>

1371
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:05,118
<i>as he's still considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

1372
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:08,622
It's doubtful that the residents
of this small town

1373
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:10,356
will be able
to forget what happened

1374
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:13,059
over these terrifying
12 days of Christmas.

1375
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:31,778
How about you unlock this door?

1376
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:36,216
And we can have the most
wonderful time of the year.

1377
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:40,052
You're never getting
out of this jail cell.

1378
01:32:41,154 --> 01:32:42,255
Hmm.

1379
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,259
You're playing hard to get.

1380
01:32:48,762 --> 01:32:51,264
You like the anticipation...

1381
01:32:52,432 --> 01:32:55,100
Before you get the presents.

1382
01:32:55,802 --> 01:32:56,802
Right?

1383
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:08,747
How long do you think
it's gonna be

1384
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:12,284
before daddy comes to get me?

1385
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:15,454
- Never.
- Hmm.

1386
01:33:15,457 --> 01:33:18,323
See, we hit him, and he's hurt.

1387
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:22,362
And sooner or later,
he's gotta go get help

1388
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:24,329
and when he does
he's gonna slip up.

1389
01:33:25,332 --> 01:33:27,100
And I'm gonna be there
to nail him.

1390
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:31,371
The only place that you two are
going...

1391
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:33,872
Is to the chair.

1392
01:33:38,445 --> 01:33:40,246
You're gonna pay
for everything you did.

1393
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,796
You'd better watch out.
