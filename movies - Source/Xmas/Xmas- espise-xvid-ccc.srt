00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:35,406
Big truck's
comin' up through here.

3
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:38,654
Ah, it'd be a mess
of potholes come spring.

4
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:41,362
Yeah.

5
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,152
Is someone new
moving into town?

6
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,901
Haven't heard anything yet.

7
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,146
(male #1) I just want more hay.

8
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:03,771
You what?

9
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,436
I want more hay.

10
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:06,603
Oh, who's this?

11
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:09,852
Look at this.

12
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:11,268
Whoa!

13
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:13,142
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the Reed brothers.

14
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:14,350
I've been looking for you boys.

15
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:16,016
Do my eyes deceive me?

16
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,183
(male #2) You know, I
heard you were mayor,

17
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:19,806
but it turns out
you're the handyman.

18
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,472
Funny, you can't trust
a rumor mill, can you?

19
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,138
Mitch Bright.

20
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,678
Well, when you're
the mayor of a small town,

21
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:31,677
you got to wear
a lot of different hats.

22
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,635
You building a new edition?

23
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,468
You're funny.

24
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:39,758
We're building a platform
for the town Christmas display.

25
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,465
You might remember it, huh?

26
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:45,131
I don't know, we just
Figured after Eve decades,

27
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:48,505
the mother of God deserved
a proper place to kneel.

28
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:49,671
It's only right.

29
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,504
All the statues and everything?
Yeah, right.

30
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,004
I remember that.

31
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,503
So how you guys doing?

32
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,419
Good.
Wow.

33
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,334
How long has it been?

34
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,584
I'm thinking.

35
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,666
What brings you to town, Mitch?
Some hotshot attorney...

36
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:07,374
Oh, he's loaded now.

37
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:08,540
Who struck it rich.

38
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,581
Yeah, I've made some
good investments, you know,

39
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,455
but I miss the old town.

40
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,453
Thought maybe I'd come back
and check out the old place,

41
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:17,370
you know, see some
of my old friends.

42
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,994
Hey, how's Kristen doing?

43
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,410
Here it comes.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,367
She's good.

45
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:26,616
Our kids are good too.
Mean anything by it.

46
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,406
I... you know,
I was just being polite.

47
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:33,364
Look, we're not in high school
anymore, Dan.

48
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,655
Look, I got to run.

49
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,029
I've got a big moving van
with all my stuff in it,

50
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,987
gonna take a look
at the old house.

51
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,486
I'm sure I'll be seeing
you boys around though.

52
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:43,028
Oh, yes, you will.

53
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,985
All right.

54
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,443
Moving van?

55
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,358
Isn't exactly a home
for the holidays.

56
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:55,481
Hey, you want me to follow him?

57
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:03,229
Pretty good, huh?

58
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,853
Not bad.

59
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,270
Not a winning time, but...

60
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,561
Want me to time you?

61
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:10,434
No, I don't want
to hold you up.

62
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,101
I can wait.

63
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,392
I'm just taking it easy today.

64
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,016
Christmas Cup is coming up.

65
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,724
You entering?
Of course.

66
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:22,597
Me too.
Good luck.

67
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,469
I'm gonna be the angel!

68
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,342
You already are an angel.

69
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:35,842
In the Christmas program, Dad.

70
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,383
That means I get lines.

71
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,424
Wow, lines.

72
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:40,799
All the other kids
just have to sing,

73
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,006
but I get to say stuff
too, and wear a costume.

74
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:47,422
Oh, I am so glad you're home.

75
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,421
Can you help set the table?

76
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:55,877
I have people
who do that for me.

77
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:57,418
What happened?

78
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:58,876
What do you mean?

79
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:00,958
You only joke about your lack
of actual power

80
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,916
when you've had
a run-in at work.

81
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,624
Is that true?

82
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:09,705
Hmm, well, nothing happened.

83
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,913
Okay.

84
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:21,326
Mitch Bright
stopped by town today.

85
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:23,284
High school Mitch Bright?

86
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:24,617
Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,574
Is he the rich guy?

88
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,156
When I was waiting
for you at school,

89
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,447
all the other teachers
were talking about it.

90
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,405
Somebody saw him
in a big moving van.

91
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,195
I thought you
were supposed to be

92
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:39,862
your mother's
teacher assistant?

93
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,444
She won't let me
grade the papers.

94
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:42,860
Ooh.

95
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,234
So he had a big moving van?

96
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:45,443
Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:46,859
Hey, where's Cody?

98
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,442
Cody, dinner's ready!

99
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,775
He says he's home
for the holidays.

100
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,606
Yeah, but his family
hasn't been here in years.

101
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,105
Yeah, I know.

102
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,437
Seems highly suspect.

103
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,186
Well, you think we should
invite him for dinner?

104
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:04,519
Oh, no, I don't think we can
feed him in the manner to which

105
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:05,977
he has become accustomed.

106
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:07,560
Oh, come on.

107
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:10,475
Yes, you do.

108
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:13,308
Cody!
Oh, hi honey, sorry.

109
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,599
Okay.

110
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,307
All right.

111
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:20,889
Hey, what's wrong with you?

112
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,679
All the girls are reading
these vampire books.

113
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:25,720
I don't get it.

114
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,469
He wants the girls
to be in love with him instead.

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,468
Okay, all right.

116
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:32,010
Listen, your mom
read all those books.

117
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:33,634
I know exactly how you feel.

118
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:37,425
Mm, can we please End
something to thank God for?

119
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,798
Yes.
I get to be the angel.

120
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,339
It's gonna be the best
Christmas ever.

121
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,963
[music]

122
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,458
That was fast.

123
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,207
Thanks for lettin' me drive.

124
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,873
Yeah.

125
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,998
That's the last time.

126
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:23,075
So who's that guy you were
talking about last night?

127
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:24,325
Mitch Bright.

128
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:27,490
Just a guy
from back in the day.

129
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,655
We didn't get along
too well unfortunately.

130
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,987
You had a high school rival?

131
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,279
Yeah, why?

132
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:39,028
What's so unusual about that?

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,194
Just seems like
everybody likes you.

134
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:45,734
You need to go to some
city council meetings.

135
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,816
So what did you
guys compete over?

136
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,190
Oh, everything.

137
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:56,188
Football, basketball, skiing,
running, class offices,

138
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,354
parking spaces...mom.

139
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,312
Mom?

140
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,019
I won that one.

141
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,269
Really?

142
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,225
Your mom was
the girl in high school.

143
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:14,391
Still is.

144
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:18,722
Now you're lucky if you made
it this far without a rival,

145
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,804
without someone to push you
and try to beat you

146
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,887
at what you're good at.

147
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,053
I didn't say that.

148
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,594
Really?

149
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,759
Somebody's giving you trouble?

150
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:36,299
My situation's a lot
different than yours.

151
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,424
Yours seems a lot easier.

152
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,048
Of course.

153
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,297
Of course yours is worse.

154
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,379
How is yours worse?

155
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,004
Mine's a girl.

156
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,085
Okay.

157
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,959
Morning.

158
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,917
Good morning.

159
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,749
Can I get a cafe American
with soy, please?

160
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,581
Sure.

161
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:06,038
Hey, now Josie, how's business?

162
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,038
I can't complain.

163
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,455
Customers are loyal.

164
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:12,245
What do you think it
would take to make it better?

165
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,619
More customers, I guess.

166
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,244
Exactly.

167
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,701
You know, I have some ideas
on how I think

168
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,200
I can make that happen.

169
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,825
You interested?

170
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:23,241
Sure.

171
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:24,366
Good.

173
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:33,862
Man, Christmas
is an awesome time of year,

174
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:35,195
am I right?

175
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,028
Hey, Santa.

176
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,653
No, really.
I mean, think about it,

177
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:40,651
this is the only time of year

178
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,317
the entire world has this like
shared experience of peace

179
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:49,273
and hope for the future and
strangers are loving each other.

in the air, man, it's something.

00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,060
It's been a great week, man.

184
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,226
Are you kidding me?

185
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:08,101
We had two ice Fishermen
and the snow machine tool.

186
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:15,098
Kristen invited Mitch to our
Christmas party Sunday night.

187
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:18,222
She said it was
the Christian thing to do.

188
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,929
Man, why does Kristen
always have to be right?

189
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,429
Yeah.

190
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:27,010
I know he's got an angle.

191
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:32,716
Now why would he come back
here after so many years?

192
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,465
What's he after?

193
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:38,215
I don't know.

194
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,922
Maybe he's just weary
of his city life

195
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:44,254
and he wants to return
to the simple town of his youth.

196
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:47,295
Or he's still mad at ya
after all the times you beat him

197
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,128
in high school.

198
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:51,335
And so after festering
for 20 years,

199
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,959
he's returned
to exact his revenge.

200
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,916
[laughing]

201
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,707
Yeah, you know, could
you back to singing?

202
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,165
Because you're
a lot less annoying.

203
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:03,956
Thanks for the help.

204
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,205
[singing]

205
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:11,244
(Mitch Bright)
Well, it's getting late.

206
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,119
You know I wasn't arguing
about your policies.

207
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,785
It's... well, it's
more your approach.

208
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,700
I don't know what you mean.

209
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,741
I think the mistake that
you're making is assuming

210
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,616
that you're every man.

211
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,614
I Fund your ideals to be wildly
conservative compared

212
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:29,905
to the rest of the country.

213
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,070
This is coming from the guy
that went to Berkeley

214
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:33,820
and lived in San Francisco
for 10 years,

215
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,319
'cause when I think every man,
I think San Francisco.

216
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:43,108
When's the last time
you left Alaska?

217
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,525
I don't know, Mitch.

218
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,565
I've been so busy building
bomb shelters

219
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,148
and publishing
conspiracy papers

220
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,189
that I haven't had time
to get out.

221
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,813
Look, just 'cause we're
the 49th state doesn't make us

222
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,312
a third world.

223
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,978
Look, there is a surprising
amount of hocus-pocus here.

224
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:01,018
Oh, you mean... what,
Native religion?

225
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,643
No, I mean Christianity.

226
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,851
Well, it seems I recall you
competing with Dan

227
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,309
for president of the youth group
back in the day.

228
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,432
Well, there isn't much I
wouldn't compete with Dan about,

229
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,473
So, that was an act?

230
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:14,889
No, not an act.

231
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,138
Look, if you had an opportunity
to travel the world as I have,

232
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,345
you would know that
American culture is not limited

233
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:23,136
to this small town bubble
that you live in.

234
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:29,301
America is vast and diverse
and loving, peaceful, tolerant.

235
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,508
Yeah, no, I'm just... 
I'm trying to understand

236
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:35,132
what you're implying.

237
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:37,465
I would be willing to wager
that a majority of the people

238
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:41,296
in this town Find your
religious piety annoying.

239
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,588
Annoying?

240
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,045
Yes.

241
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,128
And they reelect me because?

242
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,419
Well, you ran unopposed
in the last two elections, Dan.

243
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:51,210
Because he's doing
such a good job.

244
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:52,667
Yes.

245
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:56,707
I'm sure he is
in a very small town way.

246
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,081
I don't agree with you, Mitch.

247
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:01,123
Just because God's out of vogue
in the big city doesn't mean

248
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:04,038
we throw him away like last
summer's fashion magazine.

249
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,412
Maybe you wouldn't.

250
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:07,287
Maybe a lot of your
close friends

251
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,120
that were here tonight wouldn't.

252
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:14,243
But I guess there's
no way to prove it, is there?

253
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:19,366
You know, maybe I would
make a good mayor someday.

254
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:20,866
You might.

255
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,198
Yeah, I kinda like that.

256
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,530
Mayor Mitch Bright.
Has a ring to it.

257
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:26,989
Good night!

258
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,197
Good night.

259
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:36,527
Hey!

260
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:38,526
Hey, sweetie.

261
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,900
Can I come in?

262
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:41,151
Yeah!

263
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,441
I didn't know
if you're closed or...

264
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,149
The second time in today.

265
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,273
I'm unforgettable.

266
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:49,147
Coffee, black?

267
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,564
Yup.

268
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:52,104
Unless you got another color.

269
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:53,688
No, that's it.

270
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,521
Okay, I'll take it.

271
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:57,436
I was thinking about Christmas.

272
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,436
Yeah, they have it every year.

273
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,809
Yeah, but this year
Makayla is the angel.

274
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:09,140
Aw, she'll be such a doll.

275
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,222
Anyway...

276
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,387
You ought to come.

277
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,803
Yeah.

278
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,969
I mean, I'll be there.

279
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,218
I know the angel.

280
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,340
So maybe she could magically
make a chair appear next to me.

281
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,963
Yeah, I'll probably come.

282
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:46,585
Well...Merry Christmas.

283
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:49,126
Merry Christmas to you.

284
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,293
See ya.

285
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,498
(Dan Reed) I don't know.

286
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:59,706
I just thought the algebra was,
you know, always tricky.

287
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,205
Yeah.

288
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:02,371
MorninG Mayor.

289
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:04,121
Your son's getting
faster every day.

290
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:05,496
That's what I like to hear.

291
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:06,870
How you doing Coach?

292
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,412
Good, good.
Thanks to you.

293
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,160
I hope this town
keeps re-electing you

294
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,993
as long you'll have us.

295
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,242
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

296
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,158
So, how are plans goin'
for the Christmas Cup race?

297
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:21,240
We have got a great turnout
and I... are you gonna enter?

298
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,656
Yeah, maybe so.

299
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:25,197
I'm not in my son's age group,
so he can't show me up.

300
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,655
I've been there.

301
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:28,738
I understand that.
See you later.

302
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:31,153
Hey, Dad, can we go?

303
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:32,903
I'll be late for school.

304
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:35,527
Oh, yeah, school, sure.

305
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,275
(female #1) Dan, got a minute?

306
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:45,148
Yeah.

307
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,564
I got my mayor's hat
on all day today.

308
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,980
What's up?

309
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:50,355
Have you already started
the new paint

310
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,105
for the nativity statues?

311
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,561
Mm, yeah, they
should be ready any time now.

312
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:57,643
We can put 'em up
this weekend, I think.

313
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,102
Actually, we can't.

314
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:01,185
A formal complaint has been
Filed about the town

315
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,100
Christmas decorations.

316
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,683
A complaint about Christmas?

317
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,682
It says that because the town
is spending money

318
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:08,182
on Christian imagery
being placed

319
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:09,848
on government property,

320
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:11,930
we're in violation
of the establishment clause.

321
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,763
The complaint seeks
a preliminary injunction

322
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:17,179
preventing us frorn Finishing
the display until the judge

323
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,137
rules on the complaint.

324
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,594
Who filed this complaint?
The Grinch?

325
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,759
Mitch Bright.

326
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:26,883
What's your assessment?

327
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,092
Does he have a case?

328
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:30,216
Potentially.

329
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,256
These decorations have been
part of the town tradition

330
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:35,588
for over 50 years.

331
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:37,338
We've never had a problem before.
A complaint before.

332
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:41,837
When's the ruling?

333
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,336
In 20 days.

334
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,043
Unless you want to End
a compromise before then.

335
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,209
No, I don't want to compromise.

336
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,334
We should bring
before the city council, Dan.

337
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,082
They need to know.

338
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:56,040
(Greg Reed) Okay, so you're telling
me Mitch Bright comes back here

339
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,997
after 20 years, and he's
bringin' his tolerance

340
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,663
and he's bringing
his open mindedness,

341
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:02,121
like they do, right?

342
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:04,953
And the first thing he does is
get a load of our nativity scene

343
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,994
that we've had for 50 years
and he's like, "Oh, gee,

344
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:08,619
"we got to sue somebody
because, you know,

345
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:10,743
"what if some child innocently
gets a glimpse

346
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:12,118
"of the baby Jesus?

347
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:14,492
"And hey, if we get rid of all
these Merry Christmas speakers,

348
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,116
"I'll tell you what
we should do next.

349
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,491
"Why stop there?

350
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:19,573
"Let's go after those,
I don't know, people that say,

351
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,239
"'God bless you'
after you sneeze.

352
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:22,364
"Why not?

353
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,363
"Because what if I'm
an atheist, and it's like, hey,

354
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,821
I want to get sick without
divine intervention, right?"

355
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:28,529
Well, let me tell you
something brother,

356
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,111
see, 'cause we're Christians.

357
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,069
Christians
happen to have started

358
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,026
the United States of America.

359
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,067
And if they think that they're
gonna take this without a iight

360
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,108
with the Reed brothers, they
are wrong and they better

361
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,773
get prepared and they
better put a helmet on,

362
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:45,397
'cause it's my country too.

363
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,980
Yeah, you took that better
than I thought you would.

364
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:49,397
Hi, folks!

365
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,896
Looks like our 1 o'clock
flight tour's here.

366
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:53,270
Hey!

367
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,269
Well good to have you!
Harland, they made it!

368
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,810
All right, okay.

369
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:58,227
Hey, jump in!

370
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,351
Harland, set up
'em up, will you,

371
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,184
in the back if you don't mind?

372
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:03,725
How are we gonna
put a stop to this guy?

373
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:06,599
We're gonna handle this like
we do any other civil suit.

374
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,348
Have a meeting, have
a discussion, take a vote,

375
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,638
like always.

376
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:13,180
It's gonna be that easy?

377
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:15,012
Calm and orderly.

378
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:16,304
Let's go.

379
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,303
(male # 2) The platform
was your idea, Dan.

380
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,802
You got us into this.

381
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:22,093
We voted unanimously
to spend the money on it.

382
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,759
We voted.

383
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:25,592
So did we do something
wrong or didn't we?

384
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:27,508
It's gonna cost a pile
of money to iight this case

385
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,007
and come spring,
we're gonna need to HII

386
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:30,340
a whole bunch of new pot holes.

387
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,131
And we need to spend
more money on snow removal.

388
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:33,797
We went cheap
on the rock salt this year.

389
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,213
That's true.
I know.

390
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,713
You know, Mitch Bright
has a lot of money,

391
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,129
and he could take this
all the way

392
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,254
to the Supreme Court.

393
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,252
(male #2) And that kind of
case could bankrupt the town.

394
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,710
Okay, look, can we
back up from the Supreme Court?

395
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,251
Willa has the legal
under control.

396
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,584
It's not gonna cost us anything.

397
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,166
It's wasting her time.

398
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,332
So do we need to take down the banner outside?
Further decoration, so no.

399
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:57,331
Yeah, no, we're not
taking down the banner.

400
00:18:58,621 --> 00:18:59,830
We could replace
it with something.

401
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:01,121
It's old anyway.

402
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,161
Whoa, so now we just
replace anything that's old?

403
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,327
Look, it's old because it's
a town tradition

404
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,533
I assume you all have enjoyed
all these years as an indication

405
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,075
of Christmas, right?

406
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:17,615
I sold a baby Jesus
out of it once when I was a kid.

407
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,863
Got coal in my stocking
that year, too, as I recall.

408
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,196
My mother wasn't fond
of practical jokes.

409
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,153
Look, Mitch Bright has
a personal vendetta against me.

410
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,236
He has since we were teenagers.

411
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,777
I mean, you all know that.

412
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:32,776
It's just... he's trying
to prove a point.

413
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:35,401
He wants to irritate me,
and it's childish, all right?

414
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,483
And I'm not... no,
we are not gonna cave in.

415
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,898
If this is personal between
you and him, work it out.

416
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:43,356
Don't drag
the whole town into it.

417
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:44,730
Okay fine, that's fair.
I understand.

418
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,189
Mitch Bright actually has
some good ideas

419
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,438
that I really think
have some merits.

420
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,896
Like what kind of good ideas?

421
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,311
Some business ideas, and I
think we should listen to him.

422
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,311
I don't think we should
just push him out.

423
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,394
We were headed for the best
Christmas season yet,

424
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,976
and we don't need some big
hub-bub to quelch

425
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,309
a holiday cheer.

426
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,017
And holiday spending.

427
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,682
Well, you have my word.

428
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:09,722
I will have a little chat
with Mitch.

429
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,803
Do you wait for me
to come to the trails?

430
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,385
I'm just training.

431
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,802
Same as you.

432
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,842
So, you're dad's not here?

433
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:25,300
No, he's busy.

434
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,965
Do want to ski together?

435
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,298
You mean race?

436
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,839
If you want.

437
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,380
No, it's what you want
because you have

438
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,838
some weird thing
about wanting to beat me.

439
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,545
You're best skier
on the school's team.

440
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:39,045
Of course I want to beat you.

441
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,002
That's how I get better.

442
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,085
You think I'm the best?

443
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,168
Never mind.

444
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,040
(Mitch Bright) There are cruise
ships passing our harbor every day.

445
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:56,872
All we need to do is come
up with a way to make 'em stop.

446
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,163
We have a glacier
right at our doorstep,

447
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:02,412
yet there's only one company
that offers excursions.

448
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,661
Reed's Alaska Adventures.

449
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,451
Well, good morning, Dan.

450
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,117
We were just talking about ways
to bring you more business.

451
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,575
I want to talk to you
about your court filing.

452
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:19,073
Maybe you could drop by my
of lice when you're done here.

453
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:21,072
Well actually, Dan,

454
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,905
this is my of lice,
it's my meeting.

455
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,820
So why don't you
pull up a chair?

456
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:32,068
Do you really care
about city hall decorations?

457
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:35,900
Or is this about me?

458
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,979
You really think
that highly of yourself?

459
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:52,352
I don't think you really
have a problem with Christmas.

460
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,394
Oh, you'd be wrong about that.

461
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:55,851
Really?

462
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:58,184
Because I do have
a problem with Christmas,

463
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:03,349
as I do with Jesus and God
and all the rest of the garbage

464
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:05,514
you Christians have been jamming
down my throat

465
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,056
since I was a kid.

466
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:08,972
You think you have
all the answers

467
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:12,262
and all the virtues
of the world, don't you?

468
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:15,261
See, I think you're no
different than anybody else.

469
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:19,967
As a matter of fact,
you're probably even worse.

470
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,091
You so-called Christians who
are celebrating the birth

471
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,132
of their savior
are the same people cussing me

472
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:29,215
over a parking spot
at the mall.

473
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:30,880
Why?

474
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:34,629
Because Jesus is coming,
so we better rush on down

475
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,753
to get ourselves a good deal
on a flat screen TV

476
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:38,087
before they run out.

477
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:40,002
That's not Christmas.

478
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:45,042
Christmas or not, I End that
most of you followers

479
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:48,666
are the most
unforgiving, unloving,

480
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:51,415
even bigoted people
I've ever seen.

481
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:53,123
If we're already
done on name calling,

482
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,080
this conversation is over.

483
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:57,121
No, you know what?

484
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,538
I'm sorry.

485
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:01,245
All right, I'm sorry that you've
had such bad experiences

486
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,327
with Christians, but that
doesn't mean that you can ruin

487
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:06,326
Christmas
for everybody else here.

488
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:08,076
I'm still the mayor.

489
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,658
I'm not gonna let you
hold this town hostage.

490
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:13,907
And as the mayor,
you are bound to follow

491
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,240
the letter of the law,
my friend.

492
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,738
Trust me,
I'm an expert on this.

493
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,154
You cannot preach
your religion, Dan.

494
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:22,904
Yeah, but I'm still a citizen.

495
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:25,237
And as a citizen, I have a first
amendment right to express

496
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,152
my own beliefs.

497
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:31,443
But you do not have the right
to spend the taxpayer's money

498
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,066
to propagate them.

499
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,441
The only money I've spent
is to take better care

500
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:37,024
of town property.

501
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,940
Town property,
which establishes a religion,

502
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:43,188
which is unconstitutional.

503
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:47,020
Congress shall pass no law

504
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,978
respecting
the establishment of religion.

505
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:56,767
Or prohibits
the free exercise thereof.

506
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:58,100
Bravo.

507
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:03,681
You don't have a monopoly
on the law or this town.

508
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,931
You don't have the right to tell
people how to live

509
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:08,179
and how to worship.
With me, fine.

510
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:15,760
You want to run for mayor
of this town, try to change it?

511
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,677
You go ahead and try it.

512
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:20,217
Is that a dare, Dan?

513
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:22,466
'Cause you sound scared.

514
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:25,048
You're already campaigning.

515
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,673
You don't think it's obvious why
you come down from the hill

516
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,297
in your fancy little shoes

517
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:29,964
and try to pander
to the common people

518
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:32,838
who you think might
follow your ideas?

519
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:35,503
I think you got it all wrong.

520
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:39,210
I think it's quite apparent
why I'm here every morning.

521
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,792
Free wireless.

522
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,875
You want a iight?

523
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,541
You got one.

524
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,576
Joe!

525
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,657
What are you doing?

526
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:12,032
Who told you to do this?

527
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:14,906
We've got the full support
of the city council, Dan.

528
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:16,989
Besides, we needed
a new one anyway.

529
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:19,072
And there's nothing wrong
with being more inclusive.

530
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:20,945
Season's greetings?

531
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:22,445
Yeah.

532
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:24,152
It works for everybody.

533
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,733
Happy winter, Joe.

534
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,442
Merry snow falling day,

535
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:37,856
but don't put that on a sign,
you might offend somebody.

536
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:45,187
[music]

537
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:15,301
Hey, what's goin' on?

538
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:19,341
Nothinljust thinking.

539
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:22,424
Thinking about what?

540
00:26:25,632 --> 00:26:27,547
My life.

541
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,628
Could I have done more?

542
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,919
Done more about what?

543
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:44,500
Had a... you know,
a job, a real job.

544
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,081
Honey, you have two real jobs.

545
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:50,997
Mitch is getting to you.

546
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,704
Nah, he's just bringing
up some old stuff.

547
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:56,828
Well, if it means you
would have ended up like him,

548
00:26:57,161 --> 00:27:00,994
then the answer's a big,
fat no on all the above.

549
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:07,991
Yeah, but would I have ended
up like him if I'd gone out

550
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,615
and seen the world?

551
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,115
You mean, would you have
become rich and glamorous?

552
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,530
Ohh, so you think
he's rich and glamorous?

553
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:22,445
He's rich and glamorous
and miserable and alone.

554
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,441
I just wonder if I
would have lost my faith.

555
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,857
Oh, sweetheart.

556
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,313
I don't think you could ever
lose something

557
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:42,438
that's such an important part
of who you are.

558
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:59,307
Hey, guys.

559
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,805
Hey.

560
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,722
Hey, coach.

561
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,262
So, what's the genius
up to now?

562
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,844
He says he can bring
in the owner of the cruise line

563
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:12,760
and make Trapper Falls
a regular excursion stop.

564
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,593
What do you think, Mayor?

565
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:19,966
I think it's all talk until
somebody actually shows up.

566
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:21,798
It wouldn't hurt your
business though, would it?

567
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,131
We'll see.

568
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,338
Here we go.

569
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,796
Thank you, gentlemen.

570
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:29,962
Thank you.

571
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,712
Happy holidays.

572
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,836
What?
Greg.

573
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:35,460
Thank you, Josie.

574
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:38,959
I'm pretty happy.

575
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,626
You are too, aren't you?

576
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:41,958
You happy?

577
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:43,416
Here we go.

578
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,832
Hey, anybody not happy?

579
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,374
I mean, it's,
"Happy Holidays," right?

580
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:47,956
Not, "Unhappy Holidays."

581
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,330
But I got to say, there's really
only one holiday that makes me

582
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,120
happy in December.

583
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:57,620
What could it be?

584
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,285
Any suggestions?

585
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:01,868
Boxing Day, right?

586
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,368
Make you happy?

587
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,033
Not me 'cause I don't
know what it's for.

588
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,865
Oh, let me see,
we got Pearl Harbor Day.

589
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:11,239
Doesn't get more
uplifting than, you know,

590
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:14,238
getting attacked by an enemy
and goin' into war, right?

591
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:15,905
But that isn't it.

592
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,279
I think it's Christmas.
Christmas!

593
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:21,903
Christmas is the only holiday
in December that makes me

594
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:27,442
wanna get up and shout
from the rooftops

595
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:29,233
and celebrate it.

596
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,399
It makes me happy.

597
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:34,773
I believe in Christmas, and I
especially believe in the one

598
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,271
that Christmas is named after.

599
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:41,563
So I'm gonna tell you something,
you don't be afraid to say

600
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:45,353
exactly what you believe 'cause
I know what it is, Josie.

601
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,852
You stand for what you believe.

602
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:49,892
I think we need to say
exactly what it is,

603
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:52,975
and so if you're gonna spend
a little time celebrating

604
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,890
all the holidays, don't forget
the most miraculous,

605
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,598
holy day there ever was.

606
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:02,180
So here's to you,
Trapper Falls.

607
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:03,679
I got a special gift.

608
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,887
Listen, Merry Christmas.

609
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,093
Merry Christmas, Mitch.

610
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:16,883
Sound familiar?

611
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:20,715
Ahh, hat felt good.

612
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:26,088
We wonder why you're not married.
What?

613
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:29,504
(Dan Reed)
You're a heck of a catch.

614
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:36,293
One, two.

615
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,417
One, two!

616
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,291
[music]

617
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:02,866
I'm okay.
Keep going.

618
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,033
It's your best time ever.

619
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:05,782
You're hurt.
I am not.

620
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,573
Ski then.

621
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,026
Hey, Monica, I'm looking
for that form...

622
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,816
Hey, Mitch.

623
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,482
What could we do for you today?

624
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:32,773
I'm good.

625
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:37,729
Just brushing up on my
Trapper Falls election process.

626
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,812
Decided to officially throw
my hat in the ring today.

627
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:44,103
Oh, by the way, tell your
brother I said thanks a lot

628
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,935
for the outburst out at
the coffee shop this morning.

629
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:49,892
Got me a ton of signatures
on my petition.

630
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,849
So...

631
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:57,931
So if there isn't anything else,
I'm gonna wrangle up some more

632
00:31:58,222 --> 00:32:02,679
signatures and pick up some
more campaign buttons.

633
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:06,761
That Mary,
she's a cutie, isn't she?

634
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:10,677
[whistling]

635
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:16,799
So, do you think he's got
enough supporters to win?

636
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:20,215
I heard he's got
two million signatures.

637
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,047
There are only
4,000 people in town.

638
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:27,087
So do you think he
really wants to be mayor?

639
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,795
You know, it's possible
that he's trying to divide

640
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:31,419
the whole town
over this Christmas thing

641
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:34,293
just to see who's with me.

642
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:35,959
What are you going to do?

643
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,792
Come here.

644
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:40,125
I'm gonna do what I always do

645
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,832
and what I think
you should do too.

646
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:47,496
And that is stand by
what I believe in, okay?

647
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:48,955
'Kay.

648
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,829
(Makayla Reed)
Glory to God in the highest.

649
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,702
On earth, peace
and good will to men.

650
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,161
Glory to God in the highest.

651
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,702
On earth, peace
and good will to men.

652
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:01,908
[singing]
Hark, the herald angels sing,

653
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,907
[singing]
glory to the newborn king.

654
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:10,488
[singing]
Peace on earth and mercy mild...

655
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,030
Hey kid, how are you, honey?

656
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,529
Is your daddy here tonight?

657
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:15,778
My Uncle Greg is with me.

658
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,861
Oh, your Uncle Greg should
know that you're in breach

659
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,110
of the preliminary injunction.

660
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:24,484
You can't have a religious
display on this site.

661
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,650
Are you saying
I can't stay here and sing?

662
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:27,857
I'm sorry, sweetie.

663
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,732
No, you can't.

664
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:31,314
This is government property.

665
00:33:31,564 --> 00:33:33,605
But I'm not
government property.

666
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:35,480
That's right.

667
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:41,311
No, no, you're not, honey,
but you need to come down now.

668
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,894
Yeah, she can't do this.
You know that.

669
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:44,269
She has to come down.

670
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,726
You know, Mitch,
as far as I know,

671
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:47,726
she's allowed to stand there
and sing anything she wants to.

672
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:49,475
And if she wants to do
it dressed like an angel,

673
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,516
there's really not a heck
of a lot of you can do about it.

674
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:53,515
I don't know how you missed
this one in lawyer school,

675
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:55,223
but what I understand,
the first amendment

676
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:57,097
applies to Christians too.

677
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,888
Yeah, honey, come down now.
Hey, I'm serious.

678
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,887
Hey, honey, please come down.

679
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:03,553
Get your hands off me!

680
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:06,094
Hey, back off!

681
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:07,760
Now you all saw that.

682
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:09,009
That was assault.

683
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:10,676
Are you serious?

684
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,508
Buddy, you're a bigger wuss now
than you were in high school.

685
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:15,507
Thank you.

686
00:34:15,758 --> 00:34:22,005
[singing] Hark, the herald
angels sing, Glory to...

687
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,796
Hello?
Yeah, this is Mitch Bright.

688
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:28,087
Greg, what were you thinking?

689
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:29,794
It was my idea, Mom.

690
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,710
Yes, I just drove
the getaway car.

691
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,460
Apparently not fast enough.

692
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:34,959
Dan!
Stand up for what we believe in.

693
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:39,957
I know, I was just
hoping that maybe

694
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,789
you'd make it to 17 or 18

695
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,372
before I got a call
from the police.

696
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:46,788
You know, I can tolerate
snarky bumper stickers

697
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,871
and letters to the editor,
but the fact is Mitch Bright

698
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,620
called the cops on a child.

699
00:34:50,912 --> 00:34:52,869
We're lucky they
let this thing drop.

700
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:56,284
They could've pressed
for them to arrest Greg.

701
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:58,700
This iight has gone far enough.

702
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,116
We need a solution.

703
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,907
I'll call Willa, see if we
can't get some folks together

704
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:05,449
to talk about it.

705
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:06,989
Well, count me in.
I don't think so.

706
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,571
You and Gabriel
here are grounded.

707
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:12,862
You can't ground me.

708
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,860
I'll go in your place
to make sure nobody jumps

709
00:35:17,153 --> 00:35:21,318
up on any chairs
or causes a disturbance.

710
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,566
[music]

711
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:37,103
Well, in cases similar to ours,

712
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:41,019
the rulings have gone to
the plaintiff when the nativity

713
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:44,185
is the only element
of the display.

714
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,143
But what are we supposed to do?

715
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:47,891
I mean, are we supposed
to put up... you know,

716
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:50,724
we put up a menorah and then
we put up the Kwanza.

717
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,557
I don't even know
what that symbol is.

718
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:54,472
I mean, where does it end?

719
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:56,389
The point is the person
bringing the complaint

720
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,097
hates all religion.

721
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,762
He hates God.

722
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:02,303
He doesn't want equal
representation of religion;

723
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:03,928
He wants none.
Down to these God haters?

724
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:12,717
I mean, is this what
we teach our children?

725
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,424
At the first sign of a threat,

726
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,756
then we cave on our traditions
and beliefs?

727
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,338
In this case, our tradition
is technically in violation

728
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,421
of the establishment clause.

729
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:25,295
Screw the establishment clause.

730
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:26,711
Yes, I'm sorry, she's right.

731
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:28,377
There's where we want
to teach our children.

732
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,043
Disrespect for our
country and authority?

733
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:32,834
So what do you think
we should do about this,

734
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,125
'cause this is an injustice.

735
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,832
(Willa) What is justice?

736
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:39,998
We gain back
our Christmas decorations

737
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,747
at the cost of our souls?

738
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,830
(Kristen Reed) Reverend Tiller,
what are you thinking?

739
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,954
The nativity's
become too important.

740
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:52,660
Lovely as they are,
they're statues made of wood.

741
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:56,701
And we best not
make them idols.

742
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,825
Oh, good, you're
not doing anything.

743
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:01,574
Yes, I am.

744
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:02,824
Uncle Greg's
helping me rehearse

745
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:04,198
for the Christmas program.

746
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,656
You can be the audience.

747
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:07,363
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're supposed to be

748
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:10,362
at cross country which is why
I got trapped babysitting.

749
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,821
I'm not a baby.

750
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,361
Well, you're my baby.
You're my baby.

751
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,651
It's a practice run
for the Christmas Cup, so...

752
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:21,525
I'm not entering.

753
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:22,692
What?

754
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:24,191
No one's gonna miss me.

755
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,107
[door bell ringing]

756
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,523
Does your dad know about this?

757
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:30,147
Dad's too worried about
the people trying to rename it

758
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:33,188
the Holiday Cup to even notice.

759
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:40,311
Hi, is Cody here?

760
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:42,351
Cody!

761
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:45,142
It's a girl.

762
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:55,763
How come you're
not at practice?

763
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:57,513
I'm not entering the Cup.

764
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:58,762
Why not?

765
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:00,720
(Greg Reed) Hey, don't let
all the heat out, boy.

766
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,219
Invite her in!

767
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:04,177
Maybe she doesn't
want to come in.

768
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:05,926
I'll come in.

769
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,800
Hey!

770
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,466
Hi, I'm Makayla.

771
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:13,882
Tonight, I'm playing
the part of the angel.

772
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,631
Sienna, playing Sienna.

773
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,172
Our audience just doubled.

774
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,254
Come sit down,
we're doing a show.

775
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:21,713
No!

776
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:23,461
Kayla, she doesn't want
to stay for the show.

777
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:25,003
Did you ask her?

778
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:27,252
It's the same,
boring old program

779
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,835
we go to over and over
every year.

780
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:32,667
I'm sorry, did you say,

781
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:36,457
"The same boring, old program"?

782
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:46,703
I am offended that you
could ever believe to End

783
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:51,910
performers like Makayla
and myself could ever deliver.

784
00:38:56,284 --> 00:38:59,200
You're gonna change
the story, then?

785
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:00,740
I don't have to change
the story.

786
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:02,157
Don't you get it?

787
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,156
The Christmas story is
the greatest story of all time.

788
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:08,779
The Christmas story is
none like any other.

789
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:11,403
It's got it all.
It's got intrigue.

790
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:13,695
It's got scandal.
It's got surprise.

791
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:16,610
So I'll tell you
what, Mr. know-it-all,

792
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,567
why don't you two sit there,
hang on to your long johns,

793
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:24,648
and observe the masters at work.

794
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,065
[singing] Me, me,
me, me, me, me, me.

795
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:29,730
[singing]
You, you, you, you, you.

796
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,605
[laughing]

797
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,562
Okay, action.

798
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:38,102
In a world where there was no
television or Xbox or texting,

799
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:42,267
one girl is about to experience
the greatest challenge

800
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:43,684
of her life.

801
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:46,724
Look at me, I'm just a girl
trying not to step anywhere

802
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,265
onto scorpions 'cause I
have no socks to...

803
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,765
Do not be afraid.

804
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,056
[screaming]

805
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,055
You have found favor with God.

806
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,512
You will give birth to a child
and call his name Jesus.

807
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:57,679
Is that right?

808
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,345
Well, what in the world
would she say?

809
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:01,594
Um, actually, I'm not really
good with this because

810
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:05,093
you see, I'm suddenly, like,
pregnant without explanation,

811
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:07,800
which means my fiance can try
to, like, oflicially stone me,

812
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,716
which completely
ruins my makeup.

813
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:12,465
And my BFFs will, like,
never speak to me again.

814
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:15,298
So I really don't see
that as God's favorite.

815
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:16,838
[laughing]

816
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,380
She didn't say that.

817
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:20,295
No, that's what everybody
today would have said.

818
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,711
What she actually said was,

819
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:27,127
"Let it be done to me
as thou hath said,"

820
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:30,834
because it's really always
spoke with an English accent.

821
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,583
Of course, if she did say
that, it was a little,

822
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:39,414
little bit more like,
"Go ahead.

823
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:41,580
Make my baby."

824
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,079
[giggling]

825
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,579
You don't have to stay.

826
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:46,619
I'm good.

827
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,036
Act two.

828
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:49,493
Matter of fact,
we're missing somebody.

829
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:52,617
I know, Joseph.

830
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,158
Stand right here, perfectly.

831
00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:58,074
Try to look handsome for once.

832
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:02,031
Anna, forgive me
for looking at this so simply.

833
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:04,113
I teach elementary
kids after all,

834
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:08,654
but Christmas starts
with a capital.

835
00:41:08,904 --> 00:41:11,902
The "C" comes
from a name, Christ.

836
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:15,359
Christ the Lord is the center
of Christmas, not our rights,

837
00:41:15,651 --> 00:41:16,568
not our tradition.

838
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:19,983
None of that matters if it
starts to detract us

839
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:23,981
from the one whose birth
we celebrate, right?

840
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:25,690
(Dan Reed) Right.

841
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:28,314
And forgive me, Dan, but I
don't think this is something

842
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:31,188
city hall can do.

843
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,812
But it is something
that we as Christians can do,

844
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:36,310
something we have to do.

845
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:40,518
If we spent less time worrying
about our rights and more time

846
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,600
worrying about others' needs,

847
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:48,473
then I think we might
actually be doing Christmas.

848
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:53,388
And once they arrive,
what happens?

849
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,262
They meet up with crazy people.

850
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,637
Joe, what do you twos want?

851
00:41:57,887 --> 00:41:59,760
Well, like the hundreds
of other people here,

852
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,718
WE want a room.

853
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:06,550
Please, I'm having
a baby right now!

854
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:08,424
Yeah, like I
haven't heard that.

855
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:12,132
I'll tell you what, you
twos can go into the barn.

856
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:13,922
And they do.

857
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:19,545
Mary is rushed
off to have her baby,

858
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:22,128
but she does it offstage
since it's kind of icky.

859
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:25,585
And she possibly did it alone
because it would've made Joseph

860
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,458
ceremonially unclean, which
makes Mary not only a saint,

861
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,498
but he's kind of reachin'
action figuree status in my book.

862
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:35,915
Come here.

863
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:37,372
[whispering]

864
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,705
Cynical audience is
getting out of hand.

865
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,704
Let's show 'em.
Come on.

866
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:43,912
[whistling]

867
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:45,578
[gasping]

868
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:52,784
Look, God of the universe
decides to enter our domain

869
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:56,574
in the most fragile form.

870
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,073
Can I have him?

871
00:42:58,324 --> 00:42:59,656
There's the baby.

872
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:00,905
Aw.

873
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:03,280
That a human can take.

874
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:05,696
Wow.

875
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:11,943
Here, I'm gonna let you
be Mary for a little bit.

876
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:15,275
(Reverend Tiller) When God, the Father,
sent his Son to redeem the earth

877
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:16,692
it was a gift.

878
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:19,025
Some people welcomed it
with great joy,

879
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:20,982
others spit upon it.

880
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:25,647
Two thousand years later,
nothing has changed.

881
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,771
We give the gift with love, with humility, and with grace.
To that gift is not our concern.

882
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:38,351
How we respond
to the people is God's concern.

883
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,808
(Dan Reed) Are we supposed to
just let people like Mitch.

884
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,057
No, we're not saying
we roll over.

885
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:50,555
We just prove him wrong
by action, not argument.

886
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:53,553
I don't know what that means.

887
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:55,720
I don't either.

888
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,511
However, what does this
Christmas with a capital 'C'

889
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:01,259
look like?

890
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:03,592
Like Philippians 2.

891
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:06,466
Jesus did not consider equality
with God

892
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:08,507
something that could be grasped.

893
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:10,756
He made himself nothing.
On the very nature of a servant.

894
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:19,628
Hmm.

895
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:23,502
(Greg Reed) The people
expected a political Messiah.

896
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:27,500
Bet they didn't have
popcorn back then.

897
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,625
But what did they get?

898
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:35,290
God, instead of coming
down... shh, angels don't laugh.

899
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:41,745
Instead of God coming down miraculously...
he humbled himself

900
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:52,742
and he became God with us.

901
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:58,781
And he began to heal humanity
by loving them.

902
00:45:04,654 --> 00:45:05,987
The end.

903
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,570
Take your bow, son.

904
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,276
And so, Makayla,
playing the angel.

905
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:15,025
Joseph,
pathetically playing Joseph,

906
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:17,149
and me as the donkey.

907
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:18,649
Thank you.

908
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,148
Take your bows.
Take your bows.

909
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,690
You were wonderful, angel.

910
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,606
And you were wonderful... no.

911
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:34,477
So how's your knee?

912
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,435
It's okay.

913
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:39,559
You have to swear you
won't tell anybody about this,

914
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,850
you know, at school.

915
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:43,765
What?
The play?

916
00:45:45,015 --> 00:45:46,930
I'm serious.

917
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:49,971
I'll make you a deal.

918
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:53,303
I don't tell anyone at school,
you race the Christmas Cup.

919
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:55,719
It's a deal.

920
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,800
Sienna.

921
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,633
Is that why you came out here?

922
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:05,550
Make me race?

923
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:10,547
No, I came to see
the Christmas show.

924
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:15,379
Up a bit.

925
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:17,212
I got to go down.

926
00:46:17,504 --> 00:46:19,211
Isaac, you're on.

927
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:22,627
Can you get this?

928
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:26,292
It looks so good,
you guys, I love it!

929
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,207
All right!

930
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:37,622
I guess anybody can hang
a banner these days.

931
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:39,703
[knocking]

932
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,160
Merry Christmas.

933
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,117
(Josie) Who wants to buy an
angel for a kid whose parents

934
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,783
are in prison?

935
00:46:58,697 --> 00:47:01,072
All right, that's good.

936
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,236
Missed a spot.

937
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:08,485
No, I didn't.

938
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:09,860
Yeah, you did.

939
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:11,817
Did I?

940
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:16,025
Hot chocolate!

941
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:18,732
Complementary hot chocolate
with a capital 'C.'

942
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:20,564
I could give you
a shot of whipped cream.

943
00:47:20,814 --> 00:47:23,605
(female #3) I don't
know about that.

944
00:47:25,729 --> 00:47:26,896
Hi, Josie.

945
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:28,895
Hi.

946
00:47:29,186 --> 00:47:30,936
Oh, last time I was in here,
I kind of accidentally

947
00:47:31,186 --> 00:47:33,352
stepped on your chair
with my muddy boots

948
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,017
and made a big scene.

949
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,726
I remember.

950
00:47:36,975 --> 00:47:38,850
Sorry.

951
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,639
Came here to make it up to you.

952
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,385
I'm good.

953
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:04,382
You were way faster
the day we raced.

954
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,881
The deal is that
I enter the Cup.

955
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:08,964
I don't have to win it.

956
00:48:09,214 --> 00:48:11,089
With that attitude you won't.

957
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:13,546
Thanks, Coach.

958
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:20,419
(Kristen Reed) Whoa, whoa.

959
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:22,167
Wow, looks like you
could use some help.

960
00:48:22,501 --> 00:48:23,584
What you doing?

961
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,251
I have a really good idea.

962
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:26,458
I want to make cookies

963
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:28,458
for the Christmas
with a capital 'C' mission.

964
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:30,456
Ah, that is a great idea.

965
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,539
How about if I help you?

966
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:33,705
There we go.

967
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:35,580
I'll need your
help to deliver them.

968
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,704
Can you drive me?

969
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,162
Yeah, sure.

970
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:39,536
Who are they for?

971
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,869
Mitch Bright.

972
00:48:43,744 --> 00:48:45,243
Everybody's been doing
nice things

973
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,325
for everybody all over town,

974
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:51,949
but nobody's done anything
for him as far as I can tell.

975
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,698
Well, maybe they just figure
he really doesn't need

976
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,406
any help or want it.

977
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,487
But everybody wants cookies.

978
00:49:09,568 --> 00:49:10,526
Come on, Mom!

979
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,192
Why are you waiting?

980
00:49:12,484 --> 00:49:13,400
You go on ahead, angel.

981
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,524
I'll just wait
for you here, okay?

982
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:27,936
[knocking]

983
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:35,392
I guess he's not home.

984
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,473
Makayla.

985
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:02,258
Hey, the important thing
is that you did it, right?

986
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:06,214
He was supposed to know
he's a blessing from heaven.

987
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:07,465
Do you think he'll get it?

988
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:09,297
Sure, honey.

989
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:15,336
Hey, he'll take one bite
and of course he'll know, okay?

990
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:36,204
[laughing] I know.

991
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:38,037
Where have you been?

992
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:41,369
Honestly, I have been
trying to call you forever.

993
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,701
Oh, we just went
out on a little mission, huh?

994
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:45,451
Everything okay?

995
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:49,116
The judge is coming tomorrow.

996
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:50,948
Is that good or bad?

997
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,656
I don't know.

998
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:55,780
By the way, good.

999
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,529
Ah, told ya.

1000
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:08,400
How many Christmas cookies
did you have tonight?

1001
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,442
Only about seven.

1002
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,441
All right, let's
get you in bed, kiddo.

1003
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,190
Come on.

1004
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,438
That's it.
That's it.

1005
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:22,687
What?

1006
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,978
Mitch, he would never win.

1007
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:28,477
Why do you say that?

1008
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,351
Because he makes people grumpy.

1009
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:37,557
I think he makes people
because he's grumpy.

1010
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:40,139
Why though?

1011
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,264
I don't know why.

1012
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:46,179
That's a good question.

1013
00:51:48,595 --> 00:51:49,762
Let's pray, okay?

1014
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,594
I guess we should pray for him.

1015
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:53,427
Right.

1016
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:54,843
Why don't you start?

1017
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:58,091
Okay.

1018
00:51:58,342 --> 00:52:01,383
Dear Lord,
thank you for this day.

1019
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:04,465
Please be with Mitch
and make him nice.

1020
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:07,381
And let Daddy stay as Mayor.

1021
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,296
In Jesus' name, amen.

1022
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,670
Amen.

1023
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,628
All right.

1024
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,668
Night.

1025
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:19,793
Night, I love you.

1026
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:24,958
(female #4) Perhaps you all can
show me what will be placed here.

1027
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:29,206
Well, there they are.

1028
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:31,913
Can you bring
them out a little?

1029
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:33,663
Yeah, sure.

1030
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:37,703
Okay.

1031
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:42,535
There she is.

1032
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,409
They're beautiful.

1033
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,658
Someone made these?

1034
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:48,991
(Dan Reed) Over 50 years ago.

1035
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,156
They were carved by a man
who worked in a lumber mill

1036
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:54,614
and donated to the town.

1037
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,196
Are there any other
elements to the display?

1038
00:52:57,529 --> 00:52:58,737
Oh, yeah.

1039
00:52:58,987 --> 00:53:02,277
Some animals, a couple
sheep, and a donkey.

1040
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:04,735
Well, let's have
a talk, shall we?

1041
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:09,442
I assume you've studied
the case law related

1042
00:53:09,692 --> 00:53:12,024
to the establishment clause?

1043
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,065
We have.

1044
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:18,105
She's been all over it
with a fine-toothed comb.

1045
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:22,353
Well, on the record, I have
to tell you that if the creche

1046
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:25,394
is the only element
of the holiday display

1047
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:28,018
and it is owned
by the local government

1048
00:53:28,268 --> 00:53:30,517
and displayed
on government property...

1049
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:33,808
Then you must rule against it.

1050
00:53:34,058 --> 00:53:36,182
Yes.

1051
00:53:36,515 --> 00:53:39,306
Off the record, I'll tell you
that I don't personally

1052
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:42,471
want to make a ruling
against Jesus and Mary,

1053
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,345
especially at Christmastime.

1054
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:47,387
Thank God.

1055
00:53:48,178 --> 00:53:51,260
So, what are you saying?

1056
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,301
Well, there are
three options to consider.

1057
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:59,091
I mean, you could add to this
as a holiday display and include

1058
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:01,757
elements of a nonreligious
nature or elements

1059
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,631
that are of other faiths.

1060
00:54:04,964 --> 00:54:08,254
Or the city can donate
or sell them,

1061
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:12,128
the statues and the platform,
to a private individual

1062
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:14,585
who can display them
in another place,

1063
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,084
either on private property

1064
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:19,500
or with permission
in a public setting

1065
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,458
where there is
equal opportunity for others

1066
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,624
to put up their own
holiday displays.

1067
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:25,332
And the third?

1068
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:27,039
Don't display them at all.

1069
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:30,247
But if you ask me,
that would be a shame.

1070
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:32,412
With all due respect,
your Honor,

1071
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:34,620
all three of those are ruining
our town's traditions

1072
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:36,786
that we've had over 50 years.

1073
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,160
Or you could look at it
as creating a new tradition.

1074
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,533
I mean, moving the Christ child
to another place of honor.

1075
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:53,446
Perhaps you are more
concerned about yours.

1076
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,904
And this is
my advice on the case,

1077
00:54:56,154 --> 00:54:58,570
if you want to push for an official
ruling, will have to come down.

1078
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:03,735
Otherwise, let me know what
you choose to do, okay?

1079
00:55:03,985 --> 00:55:05,235
Thank you, your Honor.

1080
00:55:05,526 --> 00:55:06,525
Yes, thank you.

1081
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:07,899
Thank you, your Honor.

1082
00:55:08,234 --> 00:55:09,733
Merry Christmas.

1083
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:13,439
(Dan Reed) Merry Christmas.

1084
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:16,480
Big cruise ships
comin' up through here,

1085
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,479
people tramplin' all over.

1086
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:19,979
You know,
he says it's gonna bring

1087
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,895
a bunch of money into town.

1088
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:24,186
'Cause Alaska cruises,
you know, they got a lot

1089
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:26,477
of retired people, you know,
old people, you know,

1090
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:31,350
goin' on those shoestring budget
transportation tours together.

1091
00:55:31,684 --> 00:55:34,391
Bunch of old, widowed ladies.

1092
00:55:36,515 --> 00:55:39,555
Old, widowed ladies?

1093
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:42,304
You got another one of those?

1094
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:45,720
[laughing]

1095
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:53,134
Coach.

1096
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,383
Mayor.

1097
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:56,758
Wow, nice button.

1098
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:58,549
He's gonna bring
the cruise line order

1099
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:00,214
to the race on Saturday.

1100
00:56:00,464 --> 00:56:01,340
Isn't that great?

1101
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:03,756
Yeah, that's great.

1102
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,087
See you inside, Coach.

1103
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:09,086
You know, I can help you
tear this thing down.

1104
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:12,586
I don't believe you would
actually help me

1105
00:56:12,877 --> 00:56:14,668
even if I planned
on takin' it down.

1106
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:16,917
Oh, I could hire somebody.

1107
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,667
It's not goin' anywhere.

1108
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,832
Now you heard what
the judge said, Dan.

1109
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:25,747
There's nothin' religious
about a bunch of planks of wood.

1110
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:27,539
Look, if you want
to let it sit here empty,

1111
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,163
that's fine with me.

1112
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:31,121
I told you that you
were in the minority,

1113
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:32,578
but you wouldn't listen.

1114
00:56:32,871 --> 00:56:35,535
Guess we'll Fund out come
spring election, huh?

1115
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:14,272
(Kristen Reed) I got cocoa.

1116
00:57:14,522 --> 00:57:15,938
Mom, look at how long mine is.

1117
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:18,229
No, no, no, no no!

1118
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:22,310
You always get the railroads,
and I want to be the tycoon.

1119
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:27,059
Why don't you send some
more marshmallows our way, huh?

1120
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:31,516
(Greg Reed) Danny boy,
wife's talking to ya.

1121
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:35,265
(Cody Reed) He's still
mad 'cause he lost.

1122
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:37,223
Hey, hey, let's
do a midnight run.

1123
00:57:37,556 --> 00:57:39,972
Me, you, and Cody,
we'll take the nativity,

1124
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:41,388
we'll stick it in the church.

1125
00:57:41,637 --> 00:57:43,887
No, no, no, let's
take it to the park.

1126
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,427
That'd make you happy.

1127
00:57:45,677 --> 00:57:47,427
The Grinch ruined Christmas.

1128
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,135
It doesn't make you mad?

1129
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:51,300
(Kristen Reed)
He didn't ruin my Christmas.

1130
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,300
Mine's okay.

1131
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,258
(Makayla Reed) I mean, I'd
be a little grinchy too

1132
00:57:55,508 --> 00:57:56,799
if all I had in my house

1133
00:57:57,132 --> 00:57:59,131
was a little couch
and a suitcase.

1134
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,048
What do you mean?

1135
00:58:01,297 --> 00:58:02,297
Yeah.

1136
00:58:02,588 --> 00:58:06,462
We're still talking about Mitch Bright, right?
You talking about?

1137
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,086
Remember when we
delivered the cookies?

1138
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:11,418
Well, when I looked
in the window,

1139
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:14,334
all I saw was a little couch
and a suitcase.

1140
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:18,875
Wait a minute,
in that whole big house?

1141
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:23,081
What about his
grandmother's antiques?

1142
00:58:23,414 --> 00:58:25,289
And the moving van?

1143
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,664
Wait a minute.

1144
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:30,454
Are you tellin' me that the van
was taking antiques

1145
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:32,369
away from his house?

1146
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,743
Hang on, hang on,
let me try to figure this out.

1147
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:36,701
I knew something was wrong.

1148
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:41,116
Okay, so Mitch Bright
comes to town,

1149
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,532
he sells or loses
everything he has.

1150
00:58:43,865 --> 00:58:47,157
He puts on this big show about
how rich, how successful he is,

1151
00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:48,572
how he's gonna save the town.

1152
00:58:48,864 --> 00:58:50,114
He's gonna run for mayor.

1153
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:53,862
He puts the whole town
on edge over Christmas.

1154
00:58:54,154 --> 00:58:56,237
(Cody Reed)
Now that really makes sense.

1155
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:00,734
I think this makes for a very
interesting story, don't you?

1156
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:02,318
But what is it?

1157
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:04,734
(Kristen Reed) Well maybe
it's none of our business.

1158
00:59:04,984 --> 00:59:06,233
Who wants more popcorn?

1159
00:59:06,482 --> 00:59:07,398
(Makayla Reed) Me!

1160
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:08,898
Cody ate all mine.

1161
00:59:09,232 --> 00:59:10,565
You know what this
means, don't you?

1162
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:12,189
Road trip.

1163
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:13,356
Oh, I know that look.

1164
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:16,355
You Reed brothers
are scheming again.

1165
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:17,812
You know what, honey?

1166
00:59:18,103 --> 00:59:19,562
Greg and I are gonna pay
a little visit

1167
00:59:19,895 --> 00:59:21,227
to Mitch Brights law Hrm.

1168
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:22,727
I'm gonna call Harland.

1169
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,143
I'll have him get
the plane ready.

1170
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:25,726
All right.

1171
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:29,350
Your roll, Donald Trump.

1172
00:59:38,763 --> 00:59:42,095
Now, I mean, would it kill
you to let me be left seat once?

1173
00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:44,469
It might.
And we show up to this of lice,

1174
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,176
you let me do the talking.

1175
00:59:49,426 --> 00:59:50,842
You sure this is a good idea?

1176
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,675
'Cause I'm usually
game for anything.

1177
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:54,132
I know.

1178
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,673
I hope so.

1179
00:59:57,006 --> 00:59:59,422
I gotta take a wiz.

1180
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:05,128
You're friends of Mitch Bright?

1181
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,295
We went to high school
with him.

1182
01:00:07,628 --> 01:00:08,752
We're in town.

1183
01:00:09,003 --> 01:00:10,293
Thought we'd
stop by and say hey.

1184
01:00:10,627 --> 01:00:11,793
Well, sorry
to keep you waiting.

1185
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:13,792
He doesn't work here anymore.

1186
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,833
Oh.

1187
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:19,040
Well, maybe you could tell us
what Hrm he went to or give us

1188
01:00:19,373 --> 01:00:20,582
an address where we
could look him up?

1189
01:00:20,832 --> 01:00:22,206
No.

1190
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:23,664
No.

1191
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,204
What, is it cloak and dagger
or is he big trouble?

1192
01:00:29,454 --> 01:00:31,577
No, sorry, the Firm's
just protective.

1193
01:00:33,993 --> 01:00:37,200
Mitch was never
anything but nice to me.

1194
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,283
He gave me a shot
at a few cases a while back

1195
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:42,366
and he helped me
get on good track here.

1196
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,864
And all I know is is that he
ended up investing in something

1197
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:49,404
he shouldn't have.

1198
01:00:49,738 --> 01:00:52,821
It went south.

1199
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:59,651
He ended up losing everything,
including his job here.

1200
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:04,191
Then, of course, nobody
ever talks about it.

1201
01:01:04,483 --> 01:01:05,982
I don't know where he went

1202
01:01:06,315 --> 01:01:08,065
or if he has any family
or friends to go to.

1203
01:01:08,356 --> 01:01:13,522
Well, his family's gone,
but he has... you know,

1204
01:01:13,813 --> 01:01:15,312
he has friends.

1205
01:01:15,562 --> 01:01:17,312
Like you guys?

1206
01:01:17,603 --> 01:01:18,769
Yeah.

1207
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:20,935
Yeah, right.

1208
01:01:21,185 --> 01:01:25,226
When you see him,
you give him this.

1209
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:28,974
Just tell him it's from an old
friend or do it anonymously.

1210
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:30,974
I don't think that we could...

1211
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:33,431
No, please.
To take it, but he needs it.

1212
01:01:37,638 --> 01:01:40,512
He really helped me
out a lot back then.

1213
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:44,135
I just want to help him.

1214
01:01:45,177 --> 01:01:48,218
Well, that's all I know,
so I better get back to work.

1215
01:01:48,468 --> 01:01:49,592
Good luck to both of you.

1216
01:01:49,883 --> 01:01:51,758
Yeah, thanks for...

1217
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,007
Good luck and Merry Christmas.

1218
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:57,339
Merry Christmas to you.

1219
01:02:00,755 --> 01:02:05,169
So he's ruined, he comes
back to town hiding the fact.

1220
01:02:05,461 --> 01:02:07,752
What do you think
he's trying to do?

1221
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:09,793
Get a life back.

1222
01:02:10,043 --> 01:02:11,959
Not a very good strategy
to run for mayor

1223
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:13,833
while lying to everybody.

1224
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,458
Yeah.

1225
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,415
You know, I think this
whole cruise line thing

1226
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:21,414
is just to get back in the game.

1227
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:26,413
Maybe people will forgive him
when they End out the truth.

1228
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,661
Or we could run him
out of here on a rail.

1229
01:02:29,994 --> 01:02:32,744
Yeah, that'd show him
the real spirit of Christmas.

1230
01:02:33,077 --> 01:02:34,242
It'd sure feel good.

1231
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:36,325
Yeah.

1232
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,158
Hey, Dad.

1233
01:02:39,408 --> 01:02:40,407
Hey, pal.
What's up?

1234
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:42,240
Can you help me with these?

1235
01:02:42,531 --> 01:02:43,532
Sure.

1236
01:02:43,865 --> 01:02:46,155
Sure.
See you guys.

1237
01:02:46,447 --> 01:02:47,363
See you.

1238
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:50,279
Ah, grab this thing, will you?

1239
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,236
What's up, man?

1240
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,194
You know that girl
I was telling you about?

1241
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:59,026
Uh, not sure.

1242
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:02,316
You know, she's
always trying to beat me.

1243
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:03,690
We talked about it.

1244
01:03:03,983 --> 01:03:05,149
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1245
01:03:05,399 --> 01:03:06,731
What happened?

1246
01:03:07,065 --> 01:03:10,730
Well, see, we were racing.

1247
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:12,187
Yeah.

1248
01:03:12,437 --> 01:03:16,770
She was winning,
but then she fell and hurt.

1249
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:19,560
I thought it was my fault.

1250
01:03:19,893 --> 01:03:22,351
That's why I wasn't
going to enter the Cup.

1251
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:27,182
She bribed me to race.

1252
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,098
Does this make
any sense to you?

1253
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,265
Not really.

1254
01:03:31,598 --> 01:03:32,722
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1255
01:03:32,972 --> 01:03:34,097
I forgot something.

1256
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:37,387
So what did you do
when she hurt herself?

1257
01:03:37,637 --> 01:03:39,928
I helped her back, of course.

1258
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:42,178
I mean, I'm not a jerk.

1259
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:44,135
Aw, you helped her all
the way back to school.

1260
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:46,342
Oh, that was nice.

1261
01:03:46,592 --> 01:03:49,591
I'm sure she really
appreciated that.

1262
01:03:49,924 --> 01:03:52,132
She usually pretty fast?

1263
01:03:52,382 --> 01:03:53,840
Yeah, she's good.

1264
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:55,298
Faster than you.

1265
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:56,881
At least that day.

1266
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:58,213
Yeah.

1267
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:00,046
Careful, that's hot.

1268
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:03,753
How are you at losing?

1269
01:04:04,003 --> 01:04:06,169
I try to be a good sport,
you know,

1270
01:04:06,502 --> 01:04:09,210
but it makes me mad
when I lose.

1271
01:04:09,543 --> 01:04:11,917
[laughing]

1272
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:15,166
I wonder where
he got that from.

1273
01:04:15,499 --> 01:04:16,456
Seems like somebody's
listening in

1274
01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:18,331
on our conversation.

1275
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:21,746
You guys are so slow sometimes.

1276
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,120
We do things at our own speed.

1277
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:28,077
It's called man time.

1278
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,743
I'm getting to it.

1279
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:35,575
Look, I don't think it's
the race she's trying to win.

1280
01:04:37,324 --> 01:04:39,240
I think it's you.

1281
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:42,323
She's always bothering me.

1282
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:48,529
Look, you have to get
past the competition.

1283
01:04:48,778 --> 01:04:50,112
You have to see the person.

1284
01:04:50,445 --> 01:04:51,611
She's just a young girl.

1285
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:53,652
She got all this stuff
going on inside of her.

1286
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:57,692
She doesn't know how
to express it, right?

1287
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:02,690
Is that what you're doing?

1288
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,065
Seeing the person there?

1289
01:05:05,356 --> 01:05:07,564
What do you mean?

1290
01:05:07,855 --> 01:05:11,187
With Mitch.

1291
01:05:11,437 --> 01:05:12,937
You've been doing all this
investigating, you know,

1292
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:19,143
so I was just wondering if
you had him Figured out too.

1293
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:22,267
I don't know.

1294
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,432
Look, you race tomorrow.

1295
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,015
Do the best you can.

1296
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:32,930
Win or lose, you have
worked so hard for this.

1297
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:38,053
You just go out there
and give it everything you have.

1298
01:05:38,386 --> 01:05:40,011
All right?
You owe that to yourself.

1299
01:05:40,344 --> 01:05:43,135
Yes, sir.

1300
01:05:43,384 --> 01:05:48,133
Is she... is she cute?

1301
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:49,882
Yeah.

1302
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:53,047
[laughing] That's my boy.

1303
01:05:53,298 --> 01:05:56,214
[cheering]

1304
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:08,709
Hey, Dan, I haven't seen
Mitch and his big guest yet,

1305
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:10,042
have you?

1306
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,500
No.

1307
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,749
He's coming, isn't he?
Right?

1308
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:15,748
Mitch promised he would.

1309
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,581
I guess we'll see.

1310
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:21,912
Sure hope he makes it 'cause
you remember, like you said,

1311
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:25,119
be good for my business.

1312
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:29,410
[cheering]

1313
01:06:29,702 --> 01:06:31,493
Loser takes the winner
for moose burgers.

1314
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:34,117
I've already got
the money in my pocket.

1315
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,283
All right, let's race.

1316
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,656
On your mark.

1317
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,072
Go!

1318
01:06:43,364 --> 01:06:47,112
[cheering]

1319
01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:53,776
[music]

1320
01:07:41,134 --> 01:07:42,218
Come on, Cody!

1321
01:07:42,468 --> 01:07:45,259
You're doing great!

1322
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:49,548
Cody!

1323
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:51,173
Cody!

1324
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,089
Still my best time ever.

1325
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:56,047
Still owe me a moose burger.

1326
01:07:56,297 --> 01:07:59,129
Nice!

1327
01:08:01,627 --> 01:08:03,793
(Dan Reed) Here we go.
Watch your step, please.

1328
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:04,960
Thanks so much.

1329
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:06,417
Thanks for coming.
Appreciate it.

1330
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:07,834
Hope you got some good photos.

1331
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:08,958
Reed brothers.

1332
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,416
Thanks, guys.

1333
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,124
Thanks for coming.
Appreciate it.

1334
01:08:12,457 --> 01:08:13,457
Thanks, guys.

1335
01:08:13,707 --> 01:08:14,831
Whoo!

1336
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:15,997
Wow, they had
great weather, right?

1337
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:18,038
Oh man, we got 20, 30 shots.

1338
01:08:18,371 --> 01:08:21,121
Hey, Mitch.

1339
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:25,911
I know everybody in town's
talking about today.

1340
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:30,326
My Contact
from the cruise ship canceled.

1341
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:32,284
I'm not saying the deal's done.

1342
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:37,115
I just... I don't know,
Christmas Eve or something.

1343
01:08:37,365 --> 01:08:38,823
Oh yeah.

1344
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:40,989
No, we got you Mitch.

1345
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,322
He's probably
at home with his family.

1346
01:08:43,655 --> 01:08:46,320
I just thought it would only
be right that I come down

1347
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:49,361
and tell you myself.

1348
01:08:49,652 --> 01:08:56,150
You know, when I was a little
kid growing up in this town,

1349
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:59,149
I was always
jealous of you two.

1350
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:06,314
Never told you that before.

1351
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:19,184
You got to give him that money.

1352
01:09:20,684 --> 01:09:24,890
Let's get her cleaned up.

1353
01:09:25,181 --> 01:09:27,015
Come on.

1354
01:09:27,389 --> 01:09:29,639
Come on.

1355
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:32,429
[music]

1356
01:09:42,217 --> 01:09:43,425
Hi.

1357
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:44,841
Been such a pleasant day.

1358
01:09:45,175 --> 01:09:46,673
Not one mention
of Mitch Bright all day.

1359
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,132
Are you ready?

1360
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:50,756
Yeah.

1361
01:09:58,753 --> 01:10:00,336
[music]

1362
01:10:16,331 --> 01:10:21,203
[laughing] I love it.

1363
01:10:21,578 --> 01:10:23,661
I bring you good tidings
of great joy

1364
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:27,118
that shall be unto all people.

1365
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:30,366
I bring you good news
of great joy

1366
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:34,949
that shall be unto all people.

1367
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:37,281
Today in the town of David,
a savior is born,

1368
01:10:37,614 --> 01:10:38,780
Christ the Lord.

1369
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,947
Go End this baby.

1370
01:10:40,197 --> 01:10:41,946
You will End him wrapped
in swaddling cloth

1371
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,445
and laying in a manger.

1372
01:10:51,277 --> 01:10:52,859
[music]

1373
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:09,936
[knocking on door]

1374
01:11:25,431 --> 01:11:31,512
I have something for you.

1375
01:11:31,761 --> 01:11:34,053
It's from an old friend.

1376
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:38,260
He asked me
not to tell you who.

1377
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:42,716
How did he know
where to End me?

1378
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,924
You know who it's from?

1379
01:11:45,216 --> 01:11:47,423
Yeah, it's the exact amount
of money I lent him

1380
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:49,548
over 2 years ago.

1381
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:54,004
He was working as a clerk and he
and his wife were having a baby.

1382
01:11:54,254 --> 01:11:58,044
Don't you have
a church service to go to?

1383
01:11:58,336 --> 01:12:03,126
It's over by now.

1384
01:12:03,459 --> 01:12:07,292
This was more important
for me tonight.

1385
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:13,414
Mitch, is there
anything else you need?

1386
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:18,370
No, I mean, why would I?

1387
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:20,953
[Makayla singing]
Joy to the world.

1388
01:12:21,244 --> 01:12:22,994
The Lord has come.

1389
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:24,577
What is that?

1390
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:28,076
[singing]
Let earth receive her king.

1391
01:12:28,326 --> 01:12:34,198
Let every heart
prepare him room.

1392
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,614
And heaven and nature sing.

1393
01:12:36,906 --> 01:12:38,946
Let heaven and nature sing.

1394
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:45,944
Let heaven and heaven
and nature sing.

1395
01:12:49,568 --> 01:12:52,317
Thought we'd End you here.

1396
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:55,024
I wasn't expecting visitors.

1397
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:57,857
Well, we weren't
expecting to come.

1398
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,355
But a little angel told us that
you didn't get a proper welcome

1399
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:03,605
when you came to town.

1400
01:13:03,938 --> 01:13:05,937
We thought we'd better
take care of that.

1401
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:07,395
Did you get my cookies?

1402
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:09,061
Yes I did, honey.

1403
01:13:09,311 --> 01:13:11,018
Thank you.
They were delicious.

1404
01:13:11,269 --> 01:13:12,185
We brought you some more.

1405
01:13:12,477 --> 01:13:15,142
Can we come in?

1406
01:13:19,099 --> 01:13:20,724
[music]

1407
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:31,928
Hey, Mitchell boy!

1408
01:13:32,262 --> 01:13:33,927
Hope you don't mind,
but we brought

1409
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,927
the Christmas Eve pageant
up here.

1410
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,259
These are not
Christmas presents, all right?

1411
01:13:39,508 --> 01:13:41,466
These is a housewarming gifts
because who doesn't celebrate

1412
01:13:41,758 --> 01:13:43,466
a warm house?

1413
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:45,340
Can we bring 'em in?

1414
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:48,255
All right, let's move.

1415
01:13:52,004 --> 01:13:53,629
[music]

1416
01:14:09,123 --> 01:14:11,830
Well, I don't know about
you guys, but I am freezing.

1417
01:14:12,163 --> 01:14:16,871
And a lot of pie made
it up here tonight.

1418
01:14:32,864 --> 01:14:35,114
Come on in!

1419
01:14:41,737 --> 01:14:45,028
Ta-da!

1420
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:50,692
All right.

1421
01:14:58,231 --> 01:14:59,981
Got a beautiful place
here, brother.

1422
01:15:00,272 --> 01:15:03,229
Beautiful place.

1423
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:05,395
Merry Christmas.

1424
01:15:05,687 --> 01:15:07,936
Enjoy.

1425
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:14,975
Now, does Mary go
on the right or the left?

1426
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:16,141
She goes left.

1427
01:15:16,432 --> 01:15:17,599
You sure?

1428
01:15:17,849 --> 01:15:18,973
That's it.

1429
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,140
We're just taking them down.

1430
01:15:20,473 --> 01:15:21,889
All right, all right.

1431
01:15:22,139 --> 01:15:23,389
Hang on one sec.

1432
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,721
Hang on, hang on.

1433
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:27,346
Hey, iookie iookie.

1434
01:15:27,595 --> 01:15:29,720
I know you.

1435
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:31,928
Hello, Mitch.

1436
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,594
How are you?

1437
01:15:34,885 --> 01:15:36,634
You know we got a right
to put these out, right?

1438
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,966
We bought it from the town.

1439
01:15:39,258 --> 01:15:41,965
Got permission to put
it up in a public place.

1440
01:15:42,215 --> 01:15:43,216
I'm not ashamed
of Jesus, Mitch.

1441
01:15:43,507 --> 01:15:46,090
Never gonna be.

1442
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:48,255
Freedom of religion.

1443
01:15:48,546 --> 01:15:52,712
It's what makes
America great, right?

1444
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:53,961
Amen, brother.

1445
01:15:54,211 --> 01:15:56,044
That's right.

1446
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:00,751
That's a copy of the order
to drop the complaint

1447
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:03,083
and the injunction.

1448
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,957
Couple of crazy Christians
changed my mind.

1449
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,914
They can do that.

1450
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:11,413
What's this one?

1451
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:14,579
E-mail from
a cruise line contact.

1452
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,745
Says he's sorry
he missed the plane.

1453
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:20,994
Wants to come up in January
with some of his partners.

1454
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,951
So I'm thinking this town
needs to beef up their

1455
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:25,117
chamber of commerce ASAP
and you're going to need

1456
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:27,783
somebody who knows
what he's doing.

1457
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:30,782
I know the right man
for the job.

1458
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:32,906
Will you help us?

1459
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,196
[laughing]

1460
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:37,779
Well, that would
mean I'd have to set aside

1461
01:16:38,029 --> 01:16:40,570
my campaign for mayor.

1462
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,861
Oh, please.

1463
01:16:42,153 --> 01:16:43,569
I'm up in per-election
polls, you know.

1464
01:16:43,818 --> 01:16:45,110
I don't think so.

1465
01:16:45,443 --> 01:16:48,692
I hear there's a city council
position opening up.

1466
01:16:54,315 --> 01:16:56,481
Peace on earth.

1467
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:59,980
Goodwill to men.

1468
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:02,521
Merry Christmas.

1469
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:03,853
Merry Christmas to you.

1470
01:17:04,103 --> 01:17:06,519
Merry Christmas.

1471
01:17:06,852 --> 01:17:09,310
You want to help us out?

1472
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:11,934
Ho ho, got to go!
Thank you.

1473
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:14,725
Some things never change.

1474
01:17:14,974 --> 01:17:16,015
You know what?

1475
01:17:16,307 --> 01:17:18,723
Let's go with... get one
of the kings, will you?

1476
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:20,098
I want... yeah.

1477
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:23,596
Come on, come on.
It's in your allowance.

1478
01:17:23,846 --> 01:17:25,638
You know what?

1479
01:17:26,137 --> 01:17:27,720
Oh, come on!

1480
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:28,845
I'll help.

1481
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:30,302
Merry Christmas!

1482
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:31,677
Merry Christmas.

1483
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:32,968
Come on, Code.
You know what?

1484
01:17:33,301 --> 01:17:34,426
Why don't you take Mary?

1485
01:17:34,718 --> 01:17:35,842
There you go.

1486
01:17:36,175 --> 01:17:37,050
That's it.
Thanks, Cody.

1487
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,758
There you go, Mitch.
Mitch, meet Mary.

1488
01:17:39,091 --> 01:17:39,966
We're together again.

1489
01:17:40,216 --> 01:17:42,090
(Greg Reed) That's the big lady.
Take care of her. Thank you.

1490
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,589
All right, watch the ear.
Thanks, son.

1491
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:48,921
Came off 2 years ago.

1492
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:51,879
[music]

1493
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:39,486
I remember when people
used to say things like,

1494
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:41,070
"Merry Christmas" to each other.

1495
01:18:41,403 --> 01:18:43,110
Everybody said,
"Merry Christmas!

1496
01:18:43,443 --> 01:18:46,901
Hey, Merry Christmas
to you, Mr. Lowenstein."

1497
01:18:47,234 --> 01:18:48,900
[audience laughing]

1498
01:18:49,233 --> 01:18:50,358
You know why?

1499
01:18:50,608 --> 01:18:51,732
'Cause it wasn't
about a religion.

1500
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:53,315
It was about something
as a culture we thought

1501
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:54,981
was so valuable that we would
all do it together,

1502
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,313
even if I disagreed with
the religion behind it.

1503
01:18:57,605 --> 01:18:59,688
Because it was good
for all, instead of just me.

1504
01:19:00,021 --> 01:19:00,895
But what do people say now?

1505
01:19:01,145 --> 01:19:03,478
"Happy Holidays."

1506
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:04,936
See, I just say,
"Happy Holidays"

1507
01:19:05,186 --> 01:19:06,102
because I won't say Christmas

1508
01:19:06,352 --> 01:19:07,477
because you don't
believe in Christmas

1509
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,892
because I don't
want to offend you...

1510
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:13,933
Q it's called Christmas Q

1511
01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:23,679
®Well, I went
to the coffee shop Q.

1512
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:25,804
Q to get myself a mocha Q

1513
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,552
®The lady at the counter
said Happy Holidays Q.

1514
01:19:29,802 --> 01:19:33,259
Q I said Thanks lady
I am pretty happy Q.

1515
01:19:33,509 --> 01:19:37,425
Q but there's only one holiday
that makes me feel that way Q.

1516
01:19:37,716 --> 01:19:41,423
Q And it's called Christmas
what more can I say? Q.

1517
01:19:41,714 --> 01:19:45,213
Q it's about the birth of Christ
and you can't take that away Q

1518
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:49,129
you can call it something else
but that's not what it'll be Q.

1519
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:53,960
M it's called Christmas
with a capital C Q.

1520
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:05,622
Q God's got a law and we
pretty much destroyed it Q.

1521
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:09,455
IX! We're gonna get judged
there's no way to avoid it IX!

1522
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:13,078
Q But Jesus came down
to take the punishment for me Q.

1523
01:20:13,328 --> 01:20:17,160
Q He did it for you too
so now maybe you can see Q.

1524
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:19,659
Q why it's called Christmas Q.

1525
01:20:19,992 --> 01:20:21,534
Q What more can I say? Q.

1526
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:25,032
Q it's about the birth of Christ
and you can't take that away Q

1527
01:20:25,282 --> 01:20:29,323
you can call it something else
but that's not what it'll be Q.

1528
01:20:29,656 --> 01:20:35,946
M it's called Christmas
with a capital C Q.

1529
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,693
Q it's called Christmas Q.

1530
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:45,775
(Greg Reed) Oh yes, we want
to say, "Happy Holidays"

1531
01:20:46,067 --> 01:20:47,358
because we don't want
to leave anybody out, really?

1532
01:20:47,608 --> 01:20:49,065
How come there's a ton
of holidays in February?

1533
01:20:49,357 --> 01:20:50,524
Nobody ever says,
"Happy Holidays"

1534
01:20:50,815 --> 01:20:51,690
in February, do they?

1535
01:20:52,023 --> 01:20:53,773
They say what it is:
"Happy Valentines."

1536
01:20:54,106 --> 01:20:55,647
Ooh, you believe in love?

1537
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,771
Q it's called Christmas Q.

1538
01:20:58,104 --> 01:20:59,437
But nobody wants
to say, "Christmas."

1539
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:00,978
Everything else but Christmas.

1540
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:02,519
Why? I know why.
You do too.

1541
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:05,144
It's because it's got Christ
in it and after 2000 years,

1542
01:21:05,435 --> 01:21:05,518
he's still intimidating people.

1543
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,560
M it's called Christmas
with a capital "C" IXIXI
