1
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,753
"Hark the Herald Angels Sing"

2
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,674
"Glory to the new born king!"

3
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:54,679
"Peace on earth and mercy mild,"

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,724
"God and sinners reconciled."

5
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,602
"Joyful all ye nations rise,"

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,773
"Join the triumphs of the skies,"

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,485
"With angelic hosts proclaim,"

8
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,489
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,827
"Hark the herald angels sing,"

10
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,747
"Glory to the new born king!"

11
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,978
Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.

12
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,981
This must be distinctly understood
or nothing wonderful can come of

13
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,941
the story l'm going to relate.

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,944
The registry of burial was
signed by Scrooge

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,280
and Scrooge's name was good
on the London Exchange

16
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,325
for anything he chose
to put his hand to.

17
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,535
Ah, Mr. Scrooge.

18
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,703
Your servant, sir.

19
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,497
Are you off home to keep Christmas?

20
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,373
l am not in the habit of
keeping Christmas, Sir.

21
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,708
Then why are you leaving so early?

22
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,878
Because, Sir, Christmas is in habit of
keeping men from doing business.

23
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,881
Come it's the nature of things
that ants toil and grasshoppers

24
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,049
sing and play, Mr. Scrooge.

25
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,551
An ant is what it is, and
a grasshopper is what it is,

26
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,095
and Christmas, Sir,
is a humbug, good day.

27
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,932
Ha ha ha ha ha.

28
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,107
Mr. Scrooge, Sir.
- Who are you?

29
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,109
Samuel Wilkins, Sir.

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,239
Oh yes, You owe me a little matter of
twenty-odd pounds, l believe.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,158
Well if you want to pay it, come
to my place of business.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,161
l don't conduct my affairs in the
teeth of inclement weather.

33
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,204
l - l can't pay you, Sir.

34
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,205
l'm not surprised.

35
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,873
Not unless you give me more time.

36
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,667
Did l ask you for more time
to lend you the money?

37
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,501
Oh, no, Sir!

38
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,545
Then why should you ask me
for more time to pay it back?

39
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,213
Can't take me wife to a debtors' prison.

40
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,173
Then leave her behind.

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,883
Why should she go to a
debtors' prison anyway?

42
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,052
She didn't borrow the twenty pounds,
you did.

43
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,929
Eh, ...what does your wife
got to do with it?

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,264
For that matter, what have l
got to do with it? Good afternoon.

45
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,266
But, Mr. Scrooge, it's Christmas!

46
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,144
Christmas has even less to do with it, my
dear sir, than your wife has or l have.

47
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,980
You still owe me twenty pounds and
you are not in the position to repay

48
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,149
if it was in the middle of a heat wave
on August bank holiday. Good afternoon.

49
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:20,324
"Holy infant so tender and mild,"

50
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:25,371
"Sleep in heavenly peace."

51
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,915
Be off with you!

52
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,436
Well.

53
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,439
Have l the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,317
Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years.

55
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,944
ln fact, he died seven years ago
this very day.

56
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,156
Well, we have no doubt that his
generosity is well represented

57
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,825
by his...surviving partner.

58
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,203
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

59
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,708
it is more than usually desirable that
we should make some slight provision

60
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,835
for the poor and destitute.

61
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,212
Are there no prisons?

62
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,505
Plenty of prisons.

63
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,050
And the union work houses,
are they still in operation?

64
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,092
They are.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,886
l wish l could say they were not.

66
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,431
And the Treadmill and the Poor Law,
they're still in full vigor, l presume?

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,266
Both very busy, Sir.

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,601
Oh, from what you said at first

69
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,563
l was afraid that something had happened
to stop them in their useful course.

70
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,606
l'm very glad to hear it.

71
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,108
l don't think you quite
understand us, Sir.

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,321
A few of us are endeavoring to raise a
fund to buy the poor some meat and drink

73
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,156
and means of warmth.

74
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,200
Why?

75
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,661
Because it is at Christmas time, that want
is most keenly felt.

76
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,704
and abundance rejoices.

77
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,373
Uh, what can l put you down for?

78
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,334
Ha! ... nothing.

79
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,961
You wish to be anonymous?

80
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,545
l wish to be left alone.

81
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,548
Since you ask me what l wish, Sir,
that is my answer.

82
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,009
l helped to support the establishments
l have mentioned.

83
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,221
Those who are badly off must go there.

84
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,222
Many can't go there.

85
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,932
And some would rather die.

86
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,768
lf they would rather die,
they'd better do it

87
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,937
and decrease the surplus population.

88
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,106
Besides, it's not my business.

89
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,273
lsn't it, Sir?

90
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,817
No.

91
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,944
lt is enough for a man to
understand his own business

92
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,821
without interfering with other peoples',

93
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:27,201
mine occupies me constantly.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

94
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,040
Who's that?

95
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,626
Your nephew, Uncle.

96
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,837
lt's you, is it?

97
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,338
Well, what do you want?

98
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,382
Neither to borrow money
or beg a mortgage, Uncle.

99
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,717
Only to wish you a Merry Christmas!

100
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,386
Keep Christmas in your own way
and leave me to keep it in mine.

101
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,721
But you don't keep it!

102
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,972
And let me leave it alone then.

103
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,099
Much good may it do you to keep it.

104
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,934
Much good it has ever done you.

105
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,894
lt's certainly done me no harm.

106
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,438
No, your wayward nature has done that.

107
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,981
And your marriage.

108
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,441
My marriage was the making of me.

109
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,151
The ruin of you, you mean.

110
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,945
Why don't you come and see for yourself,
if you won't take my word for it.

111
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,655
Come and dine with us tomorrow.

112
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,490
No... thank you.

113
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,326
But why? ... Why?

114
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,077
Why do you marry against my wishes?

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,496
Because l fell in love.

116
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,040
You fell in love.

117
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,543
With a woman as penniless as yourself.
Oh, good evening, Nick.

118
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,004
We've never had any quarrel
that l've ever been party to.

119
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,213
l ask nothing of you.

120
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,883
l came here in the spirit of bright good
will and l won't let you dampen it.

121
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,885
So a Merry Christmas to you
any way, Uncle.

122
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,219
Good evening.

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,430
And a Happy New Year.
- Good Evening!

124
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,433
Humbug!

125
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,066
How is Mrs. Cratchit and
all the small assorted Cratchits?

126
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,108
Very well, Sir. Thank you.

127
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,319
All chomping at the bit for
Christmas to begin, eh?

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,821
Oh yes, Sir, all very eager.

129
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,491
And the little lame boy.
Which one is he?

130
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,658
Tim, Sir.

131
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,160
That's right. How is he?

132
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,454
We're in high hopes
he's getting better, Sir.

133
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,538
Good.

134
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,040
A Merry Christmas to you.

135
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,667
Thank you, Sir, and a
Merry Christmas to you, Sir, l'm sure.

136
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,378
Thank you.

137
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,942
Come along Tim, my dear, l've got to go.

138
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,820
Did you have a lovely time
looking at all the wonderful things?

139
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,697
Yes, thank you, Ma-ma.
Did you get the big goose?

140
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,949
lt's the biggest goose you ever did see.

141
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,160
As big as you and as fat as a beagle.

142
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,661
Wait 'til your father sees it.

143
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,289
His eyes will pop right out of his
head and he'll forget all about

144
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,916
horrid old Mr. Scrooge.

145
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,171
You're not feeling too tired are you, dear?

146
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,006
Not a bit, Ma-ma!

147
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,800
lf your father was here, he'd
carry you home on his shoulder.

148
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,969
Yes, I love having a ride on his shoulder!

149
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,723
l suspect ol' Mr. Scooge will keep him
working in that cold little room

150
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,725
just as late as he possibly can.

151
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,811
Christmas Eve or no Christmas Eve,
the old Ogre.

152
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,888
You want the whole day off
tomorrow, l suppose?

153
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,225
lf quite convenient, Sir?
- lt's not convenient!

154
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,644
And it's not fair.

155
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,271
lf l stopped you half-a-crown for it,
you'd think yourself ill-used,

156
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,606
wouldn't you? Hmm!?

157
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,775
But you don't think me ill-used,
if l pay a day's wages for no work,

158
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,235
do you? Hmph!?

159
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,278
'Tis only once a year, Sir.

160
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,657
That's a poor excuse for picking a
man's pocket every 25th of December.

161
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,868
Yes, Sir. l'm sure. l'm very sorry, Sir, to
cause you such an inconvenience.

162
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,787
lt's the family more than me, Sir.

163
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,039
They put their hearts into Christmas
as it were, Sir.

164
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,167
Yes, and put their hands into my pockets
as it were, Sir.

165
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,670
l suppose you better have the whole day.

166
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,338
But be back all the earlier
the next morning.

167
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,715
l will indeed, Sir! Thank you, Sir!
lt's more than generous of you, Sir.

168
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,468
Yes, l know it is. You don't have to tell me.

169
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,222
Merry Christmas, Sir!

170
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,516
A Merry Christmas, Sir?

171
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,435
You, a clerk on fifteen shillings a week,
with a wife and a family,

172
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,313
talking about a Merry Christmas. Ha ha.

173
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,983
l'll retire to bedlam.

174
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,513
Waiter.

175
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,056
Yes.

176
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,516
More bread.

177
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,437
Take me extra, Sir.

178
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,442
No more bread.
- no, Sir.

179
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,549
Scrooge.

180
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,981
Jacob Marley.

181
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,197
Scrooge.

182
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,873
Hu - hu- humbug!

183
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,304
Oh...

184
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,890
Hum...

185
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,851
- bug.

186
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,211
Scrooge.

187
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,386
Aaaaaaaaah!

188
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,560
Who are you?!

189
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,562
Ask me who l was.

190
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:01,483
All right, all right!
Who were you then?!

191
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,322
ln life, l was your partner,

192
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,617
Jacob Marley.

193
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,411
Oh!

194
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,457
What do you want with me?!

195
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,629
Much.

196
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,755
Huh, Huh!

197
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,424
Huh, huh, huh!

198
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,634
ln that case, ...

199
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,344
can you sit down?

200
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:29,928
l can.

201
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,015
Well do it then!

202
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,654
You don't believe in me.

203
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,865
l don't.

204
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,784
Why do you doubt your senses?

205
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,787
Because a little thing affects them.

206
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,750
A slight disorder of the stomach
makes them cheat.

207
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,795
You...you ...
might be an undigested bit of beef.

208
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,299
Huh! ...a piece of cheese...

209
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,802
a fragment of an underdone potato.

210
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,348
There's more of gravy than a grave in you,

211
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,475
whatever you are.

212
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,106
Do you see that toothpick?

213
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,776
l do.

214
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,657
You're not looking at it!

215
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,327
But l see it not withstanding.

216
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,330
Oh.

217
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,792
Well then, l've...
l've just got to swallow this and...

218
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,462
and be tortured for the rest of my life
by a legion of hob goblins,

219
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,340
all of my own creation.

220
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,008
lt's all humbug, l tell you!

221
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,970
Wahahahahaohoh! ! ! !

222
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,848
Mercy! ...mercy, mercy!

223
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,894
Man of the worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?

224
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:05,065
Yes, l do, l do, l do, ... l must.

225
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,734
But why do you walk the earth?

226
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,611
And why do you come to me?

227
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,113
lt is required of every man

228
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,449
that the spirit within him should
walk abroad with his fellow men.

229
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,121
lf it goes not forth in life it is
condemned to do so after death.

230
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:26,044
lt is doomed to wander
through the world! Aaaaaah! Woe is me! ! !

231
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:31,675
And witness what it cannot share,
but might have shared on earth

232
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,177
and turned to happiness.

233
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,846
Why are you fettered?

234
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:40,934
l wear the chain l forged in life,
l made it link by link

235
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:48,900
and yard by yard. l girded it on of my own
free will and of my own free will...

236
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,903
l wore it.

237
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,657
You have my sympathy.
- Ahhhh...

238
00:17:55,658 --> 00:18:01,288
You do not know the weight and length
of strong chain you bear yourself.

239
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,791
lt was full, as heavy and as long as this,

240
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,963
seven Christmas Eve's ago and
you have labored on it since.

241
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,216
lt is a ponderous chain.
Mark me!

242
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:19,681
ln life, my spirit never roved beyond
the limits of our money changing hole.

243
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,727
Now l am doomed to wander
without rest or peace...

244
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:28,231
incessant torture and remorse.

245
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:32,235
But it was only that you were
a good man of business, Jacob.

246
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:40,452
Business! ! ! Mankind was my business!
Their common welfare was my business.

247
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:45,499
And it is at this time of the rolling
year that l suffer most.

248
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,794
Hear me!
My time is nearly gone.

249
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:54,466
l come tonight to warn you that you have
yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate.

250
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,511
A chance and hope of my procuring,
Ebenezer.

251
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,472
Thank you, Jacob.

252
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,475
You were always a good friend of mine.

253
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:08,021
You will be visited by three spirits.
- What?

254
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:12,067
Was that the chance of hope
that you mentioned, Jacob?

255
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,236
lt was.
- Oh, well...

256
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:18,615
ln that case, never-mind.
l think l'd rather not.

257
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:24,162
Without their visits you can not hope
to shun the path l tread.

258
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:30,502
Expect the first when the bell tolls One.

259
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:41,555
Look to see me... no more.

260
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,228
But look here...

261
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:54,609
that you may remember for your own sake,
What has passed between us.

262
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,744
Why do they lament?

263
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:11,626
They seek to interfere for good
in human measures.

264
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,257
And have lost their powers...forever.

265
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,738
Are you the spirit who's coming
was foretold to me?

266
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,616
l am.

267
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,161
Who and what are you?

268
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,708
l am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

269
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,628
Long past?
- No, your past.

270
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,800
And what is your business here with me?

271
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,678
Your welfare.

272
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,560
My welfare?
- Your reclamation then.

273
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:39,566
Take heed, rise, and walk with me.

274
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,955
Through the window.
- Are you afraid?

275
00:22:53,956 --> 00:23:00,920
l-but l- l am a mortal and...
l'm liable to fall.

276
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:07,177
There but a touch of my hand and
you shall be upheld in more than this.

277
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,531
Good heavens!

278
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,451
You know this place?
- Know it?!

279
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,119
l was a boy here.

280
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,747
They are but shades of the things
that have been.

281
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,083
They do not know we are here.

282
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:42,087
Look!
There's my old school.

283
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,130
How lonely and deserted it looks.

284
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,466
Not quite deserted.

285
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:50,136
A solitary boy, yourself Ebenezer,
forgotten by his friends

286
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,139
is left there still.

287
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,517
l know.

288
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:34,389
Ebenezer!
- Fan!

289
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,814
lt's Fan!

290
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,358
Oh, dear brother, l have come
to bring you home.

291
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,862
Home, home, home!

292
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,905
Home?
- Yes!

293
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,867
Home for good and all!
Home forever and ever.

294
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:57,912
Father is so much kinder than he used
to be that home is like heaven.

295
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,249
For you, perhaps,
but not for me.

296
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,919
He doesn't know me,
nor even what l look like.

297
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,883
Same as l hardly know you
now that you're quite a woman.

298
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,928
Ma-ma must have looked just
as you look now, just before she died.

299
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,432
Perhaps that is what has changed
his mind towards you.

300
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,852
He spoke to me so gently one night
when l was going to bed,

301
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,855
that l wasn't afraid to ask him, just once
more, that you might come home.

302
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,859
And he said, "Yes, you should," and sent
me in the carriage to bring you,

303
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,195
and you're never to come back here
anymore,

304
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:34,240
and you're never to be lonely again.
- Never to be lonely again.

305
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,910
Never, as long as l live!

306
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,579
Then, you must live forever, Fan.

307
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,249
Nobody else ever cared for me.
Nobody else ever will.

308
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,585
You must live forever, Fan!

309
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:50,089
Oh, dear brother, what nonsense!
Everyone loves you very much.

310
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,468
You must forgive Pa-pa
and forget the past.

311
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,094
For our dearest mother's sake.

312
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:59,641
Oh, Fan...
- There, there.

313
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,602
Bring down, Master Scrooge's box.

314
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,777
Your sister was always a delicate creature
whom a breath might have withered.

315
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,738
But she had a large heart.
- She had.

316
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,742
She died a married woman and had,
l think, children.

317
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,704
One child.
- True, your nephew.

318
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,082
She died ... giving him life.

319
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,252
As your mother died, giving you life.

320
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:31,464
For which your father never forgave you,
as if you were to blame.

321
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,240
You recall this, no doubt.

322
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,909
Recall it!
Why bless my soul!

323
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,703
lt's Old Fezziwig's!

324
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,753
l was apprenticed here.

325
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,429
Look there's Old Fezziwig and
Mrs. Fezziwig, top couple!

326
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,187
Oh, was there ever a kinder man?

327
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,025
And yet, what does this party cost him
in your mortal money?

328
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,027
Three or four pounds, at most.

329
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,362
ls that so much that he
deserves your praise?

330
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,447
Oh, but it's not that!

331
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:41,409
The happiness he gave us, his clerks and
apprentices, and everybody who knew him.

332
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,039
lt was as great as if it had...
as if it had cost a fortune.

333
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,374
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

334
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,877
Something, l think.
- No, no, no, no...

335
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,089
Just that l'd like to have a word with my
own clerk, Bob Cratchit, just now.

336
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,092
That's all.

337
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,971
Turn and see yourself in love,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

338
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,850
lt's only a shilling ring, Alice,
but one day, it'll be a gold one.

339
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,979
...when l'm rich enough.
- Oh, it's a beautiful ring!

340
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,023
But l mustn't accept it.

341
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,692
Why not?
Because it's not good enough for you?

342
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,735
Oh, no, no.

343
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,862
Oh, because l'm not rich enough
for you?

344
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,907
How foolish of you,
of course not!

345
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:24,911
But you're still so young, you may
have a change of heart one day.

346
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,204
Oh, dearest Alice,

347
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,915
if ever l have a change of heart
towards you,

348
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,918
it'll be because my heart has ceased
to beat.

349
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,295
And it makes no difference that l'm poor?

350
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:40,093
l love you because you're poor,
not proud and foolish.

351
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,304
Will you...
always feel like that?

352
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:47,600
As long as l live,
...longer...forever and ever.

353
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,895
Then, ...

354
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,855
l accept your ring.

355
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,900
Alice

356
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,321
Ebenezer

357
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,241
God Bless you, Alice,

358
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,374
From now to eternity,
we, two, are as one.

359
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,419
l've seen enough!
- Yet more awaits you.

360
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,380
l won't look!
- You shall.

361
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,549
Now see yourself in business, Ebenezer.

362
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,758
Come, come Mr. Fezziwig,

363
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,719
We are good friends, l think,
besides good men of business.

364
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,805
We're men of vision and progress.

365
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,474
Why don't you sell out while
the going's good?

366
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,435
You'll never get a better offer.

367
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,813
This is the age of the machine
and the factory and the vested interest.

368
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,524
We small traders are all history,
Mr. Fezziwig.

369
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,527
Huh, Doh-Doh's.
- Yes, l dare say we are.

370
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,822
And the offer is a very large one,
l have to admit,

371
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,533
but it's not just for money alone
that one spends a lifetime

372
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,578
building up a business, Mr. Jorkin.

373
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,913
Well, if it isn't, l'd like you to tell me
what you do spend a lifetime

374
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,915
building up a business for?

375
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:57,420
lt's to preserve a way of life that
one knew and loved.

376
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:01,591
No, l can't see my way to selling out
to the new vested interest, Mr. Jorkin.

377
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:07,096
l have to be loyal to the old ways
and die out with them, if needs must.

378
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:11,601
Well, ha ha ha. You know what they say
about time and tide, Mr. Fezziwig.

379
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,644
They wait for no one.

380
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,522
There's more in life than money, Sir.

381
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,566
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Fezziwig, Sir?

382
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,400
Uh yes, yes, my boy?

383
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,445
The foreman would appreciate a word with
you, if you could spare the time, Sir.

384
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:26,073
Uh, yes, yes, of course.
Excuse me a moment.

385
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,420
Ha ha ha, you can't teach an old dog
new tricks. Can you, Mr. Scrooge?

386
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,590
Nor teach the leopard to change its spots.

387
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:46,385
Well l - l think l know what Mr. Fezziwig
means though, Sir.

388
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,805
Oh, so you hate progress
and money too, do you?

389
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,807
Well no, l don't hate them, Sir, but ...

390
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,978
well, perhaps the machines aren't such
a good thing for mankind, after all.

391
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,315
Sage and onions, my dear fellow!
Ha! Gammon and spinach.

392
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,859
Why, suppose l told you,
you could get twice the salary

393
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,529
Old Fezziwig can afford to pay you?

394
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,864
And advancement he can't
afford to offer you...

395
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,534
as a clerk in a new company?

396
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,244
What would you say to that, eh?

397
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:14,914
Well l - l'd still say money wasn't
everything, Sir.

398
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,875
Ha, well if it ain't,
l don't know what is.

399
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,711
Come and see me one day
anyway, young fellow.

400
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,256
You're smart and you're no fool.

401
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:27,301
That's the kind of buck they're
looking for these days.

402
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:41,065
No, Spirit, not here.
- Yes, ...here.

403
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:51,033
Fan, it's Ebenezer, your brother.
Do you know me?

404
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,998
Ebenezer.

405
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:01,002
l sent for you.

406
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:04,630
Promise me...

407
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,762
Promise you what, Fan?
l'll promise you anything, dearest.

408
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,014
Only there, there isn't going
to be any need.

409
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,975
You're going to get well again, Fan.

410
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:24,150
You are! you are.
Dear God, you must!

411
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:31,157
Fan you-you-you can't die.
Fan, you mustn't die!

412
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:37,079
You're going to get well again, Fan.
Fan, you're going to get well again!

413
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,379
Fan...

414
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,659
How could you have brought me here?
Have you no mercy, no pity?

415
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,287
Ebenezer.
Brother?

416
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,874
Ebenezer?

417
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:29,256
Promise me...
you'll take care of my boy.

418
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:37,098
Promise me
you'll take care my...

419
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,490
You heard her.

420
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:58,077
Forgive me, Fan.
Forgive me.

421
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:04,417
Forgive me, Fan!
Forgive me, Fan.

422
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,648
Well, there you are, me buck.
That's where you'll start.

423
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,484
And you can work your way up as high as
the dome in St. Paul's Cathedral,

424
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,361
if you have a mind to do so.

425
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,656
Control the cash box and
you control the world.

426
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:40,077
By the way, how did Old Fezziwig take it
when you said you were leaving him?

427
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,371
He wished me luck, Sir.

428
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,707
No hard feelings, eh?
Starting with a clean slate?

429
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,542
Good.

430
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,379
And now let me introduce you to your
fellow clerk. Mr. Marley!

431
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,215
Just a moment please.

432
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,760
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, the new clerk.

433
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,763
Mr. Jacob Marley,
our wizard of the accounts.

434
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,266
Your servant, Mr. Marley.
- Your servant, Mr. Scrooge.

435
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,810
l'm sure you two gentlemen
will get along famously.

436
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,812
l'm sure we shall Mr. Jorkin, Sir.

437
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:11,317
Yes, heh heh, well l'll leave you to it.

438
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,818
Thank you.

439
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,821
The place, no doubt, seems new
and strange to you.

440
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,531
Somewhat.

441
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,868
The world is on the verge of new
and great changes, Mr. Scrooge.

442
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,705
Some of them, of necessity,
will be violent. Do you agree?

443
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:29,293
No, l think the world is becoming
a very hard and cruel place, Mr. Marley.

444
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,712
One must steel oneself to survive it.

445
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,381
Not be crushed under with
the weak and the infirm.

446
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,468
l think we have many things
in common, Mr. Scrooge.

447
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,763
l hope so, Mr. Marley.

448
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,050
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Scrooge, Sir.
- Yes?

449
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,094
Pardon the liberty, but do you know if
l'm to be kept on here, Sir?

450
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,055
What's your present salary?
- Five shillings a week, Sir.

451
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:27,101
You can stay for four shillings a week.
- Well yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.

452
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,020
lsn't that Old Fezziwig?

453
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,717
Alice.

454
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:04,263
The same Alice you swore to love
for all eternity, Ebenezer.

455
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:08,225
She is not changed by the
harshness of the world.

456
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,269
But you are.

457
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,814
Then you no longer love me?

458
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:17,985
You no longer love me.
- When have l ever said that.

459
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,905
ln words? ... Never.
- Well, in what then?

460
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,366
ln the way you have changed.
- But how have l changed towards you?

461
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,702
By changing toward the world.

462
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,831
ls it such a terrible thing for a man to
struggle for something better than he is?

463
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,209
Another idol has replaced me in your
heart. ...A golden idol.

464
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,544
lt's singular.

465
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,047
The world, that can be so brutally
cruel to the poor,

466
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,883
professes to condemn the pursuit of
wealth in the same breath.

467
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,053
You fear the world too much.
- Ha! ... with reason!

468
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,931
But, l am not changed toward you!

469
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,725
Aren't you?

470
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,104
Our promise is an old one.

471
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:59,485
lt was made when we were both poor
and content to be so.

472
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:04,490
lf you had never made that promise,
tell me...

473
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,867
would you seek me out and
try to win me now.

474
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,411
Of course, l would.

475
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,038
No.

476
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,500
lf you were free today, would you choose
a direless girl with -

477
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:20,714
with neither wealth nor social standing?
You, who now weigh everything by gain!

478
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:25,552
l bring you nothing but
repentance and regret.

479
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:31,392
That is why ...
l released you.

480
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,686
You know l'm right then?

481
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,022
l must bow to your conviction
that you are.

482
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,318
May you be happy in the life
you have chosen.

483
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,489
Thank you.
l shall be.

484
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,535
Goodbye.

485
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:10,764
Show me no more.
- But l told you.

486
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,100
These are but shadows of the
things that have been.

487
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,269
That they are what they are.

488
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,770
Do not blame me.
- Take me away!

489
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:21,108
Very well.
But we have not done yet, Ebenezer Scrooge.

490
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,695
We do, but turn, another page.

491
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,372
And as your business prospered,
Ebenezer Scrooge,

492
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,333
a golden idol took possession
of your heart ...

493
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,879
as Alice said it would.

494
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,383
May we hear those figures, Mr. Snedrig?
At your pleasure.

495
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,052
Certainly, Mr. Groper.

496
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,554
Well, gentlemen,
after seventeen years of existence,

497
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,599
the Amalgamated Mercantile Society's
books show the startling figures

498
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,602
of a liability of three thousand-
two hundred pounds,

499
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,103
eight shillings and 10 pence.

500
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:03,484
And a total asset of eleven pounds,
eight shillings, and 10 pence.

501
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,529
Well at least the 10 pences
cancel each other out.

502
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,823
How much of this is the
company's capital?

503
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,492
All of it, Mr. Rosebed.

504
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,869
ln short, Sir, you're not only a bankrupt,

505
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,789
you're an embezzler of
the company's funds.

506
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:22,169
l also beat my wife and skewer innocent
babies when in my cups.

507
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,213
Take a very cool attitude,
if l may say so, Sir.

508
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,548
So do Mr. Scrooge and Mr. Marley.

509
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,759
They're not facing prosecution
for the capital offense.

510
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,553
Oh, but gentlemen it could
have been any one of you.

511
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,598
We're all cut-throats under
this fancy linen, Mr. Snedrig.

512
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,101
l must ask you to speak
for yourself, Mr. Jorkin!

513
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,561
And what would you gain
to prosecute me?

514
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,564
All you would get out of it is
about eleven pounds odd.

515
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,274
And to pack me off to Botany Bay,

516
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,653
would be poor compensation for the panic
that would arise among the share holders.

517
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,656
Panic, Sir?
- Yes, panic.

518
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,658
Would any of you gentlemen care to deny

519
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,702
that if this juicy little scandal
leaked out now

520
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,663
the annual shareholders meeting

521
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,999
would resemble an orchestra
of scorched cats.

522
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,669
Result...
bankruptcy all around.

523
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,713
Strike that speech out of the minutes!
- Yes, Sir.

524
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,717
Mr. Jorkin doesn't exaggerate the
imprudence of allowing his ...

525
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,221
misdemeanors to be made public.

526
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,765
Are you in sympathy with Mr. Jorkin
by any chance, Mr. Scrooge?

527
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,767
Not, l confess, with his methods.

528
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,770
Mr. Marley and l have a proposition
to make to the representatives

529
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:25,107
of the company which might solve
some of the difficulties

530
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,152
to our general advantage.
- The devil you have!

531
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,820
You want to watch these two fellows,
you know.

532
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:33,157
They'd skin Jack Ketch alive and
he'd never know they'd done it.

533
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,826
Can we hear the proposition?

534
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,829
Shall l be Spokesman?

535
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,416
Mr. Marley and myself

536
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:46,628
are prepared to make good
out of our own private resources,

537
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,381
the sum of money appropriated
by Mr. Jorkin.

538
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,550
reprieved, reprieved!

539
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,552
Curfew shall not ring tonight,
Mr. Snedrig.

540
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,887
Order, order!

541
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,889
ln return,

542
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,893
we wish to be allowed the option of buying
up further shares in the company.

543
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,439
To a maximum of fifty-one percent
of the total.

544
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,940
ln short gentleman,

545
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,320
if you wish to save the fair name of the
company by accepting their generous offer,

546
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:12,946
They become the company.

547
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,491
Fifty-one percent!? Never, never!
Out of question!

548
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,536
and also out of order, Mr. Scrooge!

549
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,656
Pardon me...

550
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:58,158
if you can find the grace to,

551
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,662
l've just come from Mr. Marley's
with a message for Mr. Scrooge.

552
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,705
Well, can l give it to him?

553
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,832
Well please your great kind self, dear.

554
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,667
l'm to say ...

555
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:11,338
that Mr. Marley ain't expected to live
through the night,

556
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,549
and that if Mr. Scrooge wants
to take his leave of him,

557
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,221
he should nip along smartly or there won't
be no Mr. Marley to take leave of

558
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,224
as we know the use of the word.

559
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,768
He's breathing very queer

560
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,105
when he does breathe at all.

561
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,608
Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge.
- l'm busy!

562
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,819
lt's about Mr. Marley,
he's dying, Sir.

563
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,655
Well what can l do about it?
lf he's dying, he's dying.

564
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,824
Well, the message was for you
to go at once, Sir.

565
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,201
lt is now a quarter to five.

566
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,703
The business of the office
is not yet finished,

567
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,372
l shall go when the office is closed.
At seven o'clock.

568
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,292
Yes, Sir.

569
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,840
He'll come at Seven.

570
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:59,845
l'll try and get Mr. Marley to hold out
'til then, l'm sure.

571
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,764
Much obliged.
Good night to ya.

572
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,146
And a Merry Christmas

573
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,940
if it ain't out of keepin'
with the situation.

574
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,776
Thank you, the same to you.

575
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:58,111
l hope you'll find Mr. Marley well, Sir.
- l should think that's highly unlikely.

576
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,655
Yes, l suppose so, Sir, but ..

577
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,492
seems odd to think of the place
without him, Sir.

578
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:06,787
Why should it be anymore odd
than it was with him, hmm?

579
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,039
We've all got to die, Cratchit.

580
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,168
l suppose you will want the whole day
off tomorrow, as usual.

581
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,754
lf quite convenient, Sir?

582
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,839
Every Christmas you say the same thing.

583
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,508
And every Christmas, it's

584
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:23,011
just as inconvenient as it was
the Christmas before. Goodnight.

585
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,261
Ours is a highly competitive
profession, Sir.

586
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,222
ls he dead yet?

587
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,891
l'll have another look, if you'd like?
- No, don't bother.

588
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,811
l'll see for myself.

589
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,365
Goodnight, Sir.

590
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,919
Oh, oh Jacob.

591
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,506
Well have they...have they
seen to you properly?

592
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,886
Last rights and all that, hmm?

593
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:51,391
There's uh... there's nothing
l can do, hmm?

594
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,854
Oh?

595
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:59,441
What ... particularly?

596
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,614
While...
- Huh??

597
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,657
...there's still time...

598
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,785
Time? ...
Time for what?

599
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,663
We...

600
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,958
We were wrong.
- Huh?

601
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,003
Wrong.
- Wrong?

602
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,172
Oh ...

603
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,633
Well we - we can't be right
all the time.

604
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,676
Nobody's perfect.

605
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,180
We've been no worse
than the next man.

606
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,308
Or better, if it comes to that.

607
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,060
You mustn't reproach yourself, Jacob.

608
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,605
We are wrong.
- What?

609
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:46,112
Save ... yourself.

610
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,657
What? Save myself?

611
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:53,203
Save myself from what?
Hmm?

612
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,665
Speak up...

613
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,811
ls he dead?

614
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,399
Yes.

615
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,943
Just like you said.

616
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,779
l always know.

617
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,464
One shadow more.
- No!

618
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,801
No more.
l cannot bear it.

619
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:54,222
Jacob Marley worked at your side
for eighteen years.

620
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,891
He was the only friend you ever had.

621
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:01,813
But what did you feel when
you signed the registrar at his burial

622
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:07,235
and took his money, his house,
and his few lean sticks of furniture?

623
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,113
Did you feel a little pity for him?

624
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,949
Look at your face, Ebenezer.

625
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:20,081
A face of a wrenching, grasping,
scraping, covetous old sinner.

626
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:27,881
No,... no,... no, no, no,... no.

627
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,293
Come in, come in, Ebenezer Scrooge.

628
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:08,171
l await you.

629
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,340
Yes, l'm - l'm coming.

630
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:14,010
Come in! ... Come in!

631
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,887
l'm coming.

632
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:43,331
Ebenezer, come in!

633
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,585
Come in, come in!
And know me better, man.

634
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:52,173
l am the Spirit of Christmas Present.
Look upon me.

635
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,510
You've never seen the like of
me before. ... Have you?

636
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,512
Never.

637
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:00,890
And l wish the pleasure had been
indefinitely postponed.

638
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,100
So, ...

639
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,894
is your heart still unmoved
towards us, then?

640
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,398
l'm too old! l'm beyond hope!

641
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:12,569
Go and redeem some younger,
more promising creature, and

642
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,114
leave me to keep Christmas
in my own way.

643
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,949
Mortal!

644
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,162
We spirits of Christmas do not live
only one day of our year.

645
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,914
We live the whole 365.

646
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,251
So is it true of the child
born in Bethlehem.

647
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,628
He does not live in men's hearts only
one day of the year,

648
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,672
but in all the days of the year.

649
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:35,341
You have chosen not to seek him
in your heart.

650
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,635
Therefore, you shall come with me

651
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:41,181
and seek him in the hearts
of men of good will.

652
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:45,143
Come.
Touch my robe.

653
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,532
"Hark! The herald angels sing,"

654
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,786
"Glory to the newborn King!"
- What place is this?

655
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:06,790
A place where miners live, who
labor in the bowels of the earth.

656
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:10,668
But they know me.
Come.

657
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,174
"Joyful, all ye nations, rise,"

658
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:20,220
"Join the triumph of the skies;"

659
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:24,390
"With angelic hosts, proclaim,"

660
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,394
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

661
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,565
"Hark! The herald angels sing,"

662
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,319
"Glory to the newborn King!"

663
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:49,165
Why, it's Cratchit!
lt's Bob Cratchit!

664
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,841
He's coming mother!
Father's here with tiny Tim!

665
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,510
Here, Martha.
You hide,

666
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,345
and we'll tell him you've been held up
and who knows when you'll be here.

667
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:06,182
Yes! Go hide! !
- Oh, goodness! Where?

668
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,436
Behind the scullery door, quickly, Martha!

669
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,945
Hi.

670
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,951
A Merry Christmas.

671
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:32,625
Why, ...
Where's our Martha?

672
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,627
Oh, she's not coming.

673
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,131
Not coming?
Not coming on Christmas day?

674
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,009
Yes l am, Father!

675
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,303
l can't bear to let them tease you.

676
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:44,804
Why, bless your heart.

677
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,348
lt never would have been Christmas,
if they'd kept you late.

678
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,726
ls the pudding still singing
in the copper, Peter?

679
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:53,563
Yes, come and hear it.
You come, too, Mary and Belinda!

680
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,940
You come along as well, Martha.

681
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,567
Come and hear the pudding
singing in the copper.

682
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,903
l'll come in a minute.
- All right.

683
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,154
Sit you down before the fire,

684
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,867
We had such a deal of work
to finish up last night,

685
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,285
that l never did think l'd get away.

686
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,287
We had to clear away this morning,

687
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,289
and then l ran all the way so's
to be here in time.

688
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,833
How did little Tim behave in church?

689
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,710
As good as gold and better.

690
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,838
Sometimes he gets thoughtful sitting
by himself so much

691
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,341
and thinks the strangest things
you ever heard.

692
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,675
He told me,

693
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,012
he wasn't going to feel shy if people
looked at him because he was a cripple,

694
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,348
as it might be pleasant to them,
being in church,

695
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:30,725
to remember upon Christmas day,

696
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,811
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

697
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,357
He's growing strong and hearty though,
Martha, my dear.

698
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,400
lsn't he, my love?

699
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:50,370
Spirit, ... tell me...
will tiny Tim live?

700
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,957
l see a vacant seat in the
poor chimney corner,

701
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:57,126
and a crutch without an owner,
carefully preserved.

702
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,963
lf these shadows remain unaltered
by the Future,

703
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:02,465
none other of my way
shall find him there.

704
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,885
Oh, no!... No!

705
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,471
Kind Spirit, ...

706
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,016
say that he will be spared.
Why?

707
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:16,896
lf he be like to die, he better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

708
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,945
Well, my little cock sparrow,

709
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:27,281
here's your own stool by the fire
all ready for you.

710
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,576
There's such a goose, Martha!

711
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:34,080
l'm sure of it.
- And the pudding! Oh, the pudding!

712
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,874
lt shant be easy 'til it's eaten.

713
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,293
l confess, l've had my doubts about
the quantity of flour.

714
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:43,965
lt'll be a perfect pudding my love.
A perfect pudding.

715
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,676
Won't it, Martha, my dear?
Eh, Tim?

716
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:50,263
lt'll be the finest pudding in the
whole of London this Christmas,

717
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:55,518
and the goose'll be the finest goose.
- And ours'll be the finest Christmas.

718
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:00,106
Here's the punch, all steaming hot.
Oh, good!

719
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:04,027
No, no, no, take your turn,
one and all, if you please.

720
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,238
There's enough for one toast now
and another after that.

721
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,741
Thank you!
There! Bravo! There's bounty for you!

722
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,285
l declare l'd like to know how many
families of our acquaintance

723
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,620
could boast two rounds
of the best gin punch!

724
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,164
None! No one!

725
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,458
Now, has everybody got his drink?
- Yes! Yes!

726
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,793
Good. But before l give the toast,

727
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,755
l have a piece of momentous
information for all,

728
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,798
and Master Peter, in particular.

729
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,592
Master Peter?

730
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,511
Why, that's you, Peter!
What is it, Father? Yeah, what is it?

731
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,849
Master Peter, now grown to full estate
and dignity as son of the house,

732
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,729
and looking every inch the grand fellow
he is, in one of my own collars,

733
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,566
l have waited for this great moment,

734
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,902
to advise him that l have my eye
on a situation for him

735
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:50,448
which will bring him, if obtained,
full 5 and 6 pence weekly!

736
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,619
YA! ! You'll be quite the independent
gentleman now, Peter!

737
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,954
What next? l wonder.

738
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,582
Then a toast my love, my dearies.

739
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,917
To a Merry Christmas!

740
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,628
God bless us.
- God bless us!

741
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,881
God bless us, ...
every one.

742
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,010
l give you Mr. Scrooge,

743
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,637
the founder of the feast.

744
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,014
Oh no, Father!
He doesn't deserve it!

745
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:19,852
l wish l had him here now, l'd give him
a piece of my mind to feast himself upon.

746
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,896
My dear, the children ... Christmas Day!

747
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,440
Could only be on Christmas day
that l would drink the health

748
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,568
of such a hard, stingy,
unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge.

749
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,072
You know he is, Robert, nobody knows it
better than you do, poor fellow.

750
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,992
My dear,
Christmas day.

751
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:40,540
l'll drink his health for your sake
and the day"s, ... not for his.

752
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,459
Long life to him. A Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year.

753
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,004
He'll be very happy
and very merry, no doubt.

754
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,016
He said that Christmas was
"humbug", and he believed it, too.

755
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,184
l told you so.

756
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,187
Well, a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year to the poor old man.

757
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,231
He wouldn't let me wish it
to him personally,

758
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,567
but here it is, never the less,
Uncle Scrooge!

759
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,819
Yes, to Scrooge!
Uncle Scrooge!

760
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,238
Well, l don't know that our drinking
to him will do him much good.

761
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,616
Or do l. l hate him!
- Oh, l forbid it! l'm sorry for him.

762
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,077
l couldn't feel angry with him,
if l tried.

763
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,788
Who suffers worse from his humors?
Himself always.

764
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,249
Look at the way he's taken it in his head
to disown us without a shilling,

765
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,627
and won't even come to dinner with us.
And what's the consequence?

766
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,797
He's only cheated himself out of
a highly indigestible dinner.

767
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:33,968
lt was a wonderful dinner!
- Yes, it was a wonderful dinner.

768
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,636
Well l'm really glad you think so, Miss,

769
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:39,182
because l personally haven't very much
faith in these newlywed housekeepers.

770
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:40,349
Have you, Tupper?

771
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,686
Alas, as a bachelor,
l'm a wretched outcast,

772
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:48,232
with no right to express an opinion on
such a tender and delicate subject.

773
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:53,237
Have l, ... dear,
distant, unmovable, Miss Flora?

774
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:57,283
Now, you really are quite incorrigible,
Mr. Tupper.

775
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,870
Quite beyond hope.

776
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:21,891
...and have not charity, l am become
as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

777
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,519
And though l have the gift of prophecy
and understand all mysteries

778
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,521
and all knowledge,

779
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,566
and though l have all faith so
that l can remove mountains,

780
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,527
and have not charity,
l am nothing.

781
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,530
Do you feel more rested now,
my dear?

782
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:40,451
l do, bless your dear gentle heart.

783
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,954
Alice...

784
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,413
Do you know, me darlin',

785
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,582
l never thought there was
anyone like you

786
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,585
left in the whole wide world.

787
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,630
Cut me throat, rip me liver,
if l'm tellin' a lie.

788
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:56,467
This is the happiest Christmas
l ever had!

789
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,185
Alice?

790
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,063
Alice!?

791
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,902
Spirit, are these people real
or are they shadows?

792
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,738
They're real, we are the shadows.

793
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,407
Both of us?

794
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:22,535
Did you not cut yourself off
from your fellow beings,

795
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,955
when you lost the love of
that gentle creature?

796
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,133
Where are you taking me now.

797
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,969
My time with you, Ebenezer,
is almost done.

798
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:44,849
Will you profit by what l have shown
you of the good in most men's hearts?

799
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:49,186
l don't know.
How can l promise?

800
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,856
lf it's too hard a lesson
for you to learn,

801
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:56,277
then learn this lesson.

802
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:01,240
Spirit, are these yours?

803
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,908
They are man's.

804
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,495
They cling to me for protection
from their fetters.

805
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,374
This boy is lgnorance.
This girl is Want.

806
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:14,962
Beware of them both, but most of all,
beware of this boy.

807
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,424
But have they no refuge,
no resource?

808
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:22,803
Are there no prisons? ...
Are there no workhouses?

809
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:35,566
Are there no prisons?
Are there no workhouses?

810
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,960
l am in the presence of the
Spirit of Christmas yet to come.

811
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,798
And you are going to show me
shadows of things that have

812
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,093
not yet happened, but will happen?

813
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:06,138
Spirit of the Future, l fear you more
than any other specter that l've seen.

814
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:10,142
But even in my fear, l must tell you,
l am too old!

815
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,686
l cannot change.
l can't.

816
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,565
lt is not that l am impenitent;
it's just that l -

817
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:23,072
Oh, wouldn't it be better
if l just went home to bed?

818
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,117
No?

819
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,080
Lead me, then.

820
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:51,684
He shall cover thee with His feathers,
and under His wings thou shalt trust:

821
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:55,020
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

822
01:02:55,021 --> 01:03:01,026
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by
night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;

823
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:05,656
A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand at thy right hand;

824
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,033
but it shall not come nigh thee.

825
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:13,914
For He shall give his angels charge over
thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

826
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:18,085
Because he hath set his love upon me,
therefore will l deliver him :

827
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:22,089
l will set him on high,
because he hath known my name.

828
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,426
Because thou hast made the LORD,
which is my refuge,

829
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,053
even the most High, thy habitation;

830
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,306
There shall no evil befall thee,

831
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,975
neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

832
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:36,479
He shall call upon me,
and l will answer him :

833
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,067
l will be with him in trouble;
l will deliver him, and honor him.

834
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,570
Shall l stop reading?

835
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:49,533
No, no ...
it's only the color. lt hurts my eyes.

836
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,578
They're better now.

837
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,872
lt makes them weak, by candlelight.

838
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:59,084
And l wouldn't show your father weak
eyes, when he comes home, for the world.

839
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,088
lt must be near his time.
- Past it, rather.

840
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,925
But he seems to be walking
a little slower than he used ...

841
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:07,635
these last few evenings.

842
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:11,639
Why l've known him walk, with tiny Tim
on his shoulder, very fast, indeed.

843
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,266
So have l ... Often.

844
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,143
So have l.
- So have l.

845
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:21,649
But then, he was very light to carry and his
father loved him, so it was no trouble.

846
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,568
No trouble.

847
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,081
l'm a little late, my dear.
Please forgive me.

848
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,750
You must be cold and tired.
Sit near the fire.

849
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:45,756
No, no, l'm ... very content, my dear.
very content.

850
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,801
l went to see the place
where he will rest.

851
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:54,139
lt's sheltered by green trees, my dear,
and very quiet and still.

852
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,809
lt was strange,
but as l stood there,

853
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:02,106
l felt his hand slip in mine, as if he was
standing beside me and comforting me.

854
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,358
l felt very peaceful, my dear.

855
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:09,863
He was telling me, you see,
in his own little way, that he's happy.

856
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,907
Truly happy now,...

857
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:16,745
and that we must cease to grieve
for him, and try to be happy, too.

858
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:25,504
Oh Tim, ...
my Tiny Tim.

859
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:30,801
Poor Robert, Oh Robert, ...
poor Robert.

860
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,457
Hello, Joe.
Huh.

861
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,917
Hi, Joe.
Hey.

862
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,127
Well, come on.

863
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:09,089
No, let the laundress go first.
- No, no, dear, you was here first.

864
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,093
After you, l'm sure.

865
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:16,138
Oh look, Old Joe, it's a chance, ...

866
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,807
if the chow lady, the laundress,
and the undertaker

867
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,810
haven't all met here at the
same time without meaning it!

868
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,812
Well, you couldn't have met
in a better place.

869
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,189
Let's go in the parlor.

870
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,233
You were made free of it
long ago, eh?

871
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,861
And the other two aren't strangers, heh...

872
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:34,740
Uh,...wait a minute just 'til l
shut the door to the shop, eh?

873
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:39,745
Just shut the door of the shop.
Oh! How it screeks!

874
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,206
There's not a rusted piece of metal
in the place like its own hinges.

875
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:46,752
And, l'm sure, there are no old
bones here like mine.

876
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,089
We're all suitable to our
callin's, eh?

877
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,257
We're all well matched.

878
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:57,012
Come into the parlor.
Come into the parlor.

879
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,306
Who goes first?

880
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,810
What odds, now, that all met at the once.

881
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:06,146
Everyone's got a right to take care
of themselves, he always did.

882
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,024
Oh, that's true enough, no one more so.

883
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,694
Why then, don't stand staring
as if you was afraid, woman.

884
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,696
Who's the wiser?

885
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,698
We're not gonna pick holes
in each other's coats, l suppose.

886
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,908
No, indeed!
No, we hope not!

887
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:21,745
Very well then, who's the worse for
the loss of a few things like these?

888
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,707
Not a dead man, l suppose.
- No indeed.

889
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,875
lf he wanted to keep 'em
after he was dead,

890
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,420
why wasn't he amiable in his lifetime?

891
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:32,756
lf he had been, he'd have had somebody
with him when he was struck with death.

892
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,426
lnstead of lying, gasping out his
last air alone be himself.

893
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:38,929
There never was a truer word spoken.
T'was a judgment on him.

894
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,931
l wish it was a little heavier one.

895
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,435
And it would been, if l could of laid me
hands on anything else.

896
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,478
We knew pretty well
we was helping ourselves,

897
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,981
before we come here, l believe.

898
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,358
lt's no sin.
Open the bundle, Joe.

899
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,529
No, no, l'll go first.
Just to show we all got trust in one another.

900
01:07:55,530 --> 01:08:00,409
lt's very polite of you,
l do grant, l'm sure.

901
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:10,043
Watch, fob, seal, pencil case,
sleeve buttons, broach.

902
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:15,090
Yes, ... 8 shillings, this lot, and l
wouldn't give you another 6 pence.

903
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:20,095
Not if l was boiled for life
for not doing it.

904
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,431
Who's next?

905
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,641
Always a lady, dear.

906
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:28,145
l shall have to insist you
all stop and watch mine,

907
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:32,524
now that we're all so open
and above with each other.

908
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:36,695
2 sheets, 2 towels, shirt,
teaspoons, 2 silver,

909
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:41,700
sugar tongs, boots assorted, four.

910
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,744
Yeah, 17 and 6.

911
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:47,706
l always give too much to a lady,
it's a weakness of mine.

912
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:50,417
That's how l come to ruin myself.

913
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:53,253
lf you ask for another penny

914
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,757
might leave an open question,
l'd regret me liberality.

915
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:58,717
Knock off half a crown.

916
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,762
Now open my bundle, Joe.

917
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,347
Come on, what's in it?

918
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,807
Aaaah...
- Eh?

919
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:08,769
You wait and see.
- ya.

920
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,814
Bed curtains.

921
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,858
Bed curtains?
- Uh huh, bed curtains.

922
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,862
What'd you? You would say
you took these down,

923
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,866
rings and all, and, ...
him lying there?

924
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,285
Yes l do, why not?

925
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,872
You was born to make
a fortune, ma'am, and you, ...

926
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,541
you certainly will.

927
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:33,043
l certainly won't hold back my hand
when l can get something in it

928
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,587
for sake of such a man as he was,
l promise you Joe.

929
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,757
These his blankets, too?
- Who's else do ya think?

930
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:42,594
He ain't likely to take cold
without 'em, l daresay.

931
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,429
He didn't die of anything catching,
did he?

932
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,265
Oh, don't you be afraid of it!

933
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:47,641
l wasn't too fond of his company

934
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,477
l'd loiter about him for
such things, if he did.

935
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,646
And you can look through that
'til your eyes ache

936
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,940
and you won't find a hole in it.

937
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,526
lt's the best one he had,
and a fine one, too.

938
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,529
They'd have wasted it,
if it hadn't been for me.

939
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,531
What you mean, wasted it?

940
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,367
Well they'd have buried him
in this, of course.

941
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,702
But l took it off of him, again.

942
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,538
As if calico ain't good enough
for burying.

943
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,665
Anyway, it's just as becoming
to the body.

944
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:15,043
He couldn't have looked uglier than
what he did in this one.

945
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,546
lt's poetic justice.

946
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:20,757
He frightened near everybody away
from him when he was alive.

947
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:24,970
And now he benefits us when he's dead.

948
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:33,478
No, l don't know much
about it either way.

949
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,480
l only know he's dead.
- When did he die?

950
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,107
Last night, l believe.

951
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,151
What was the matter with him?
l thought he'd never die.

952
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,862
So did he, l daresay.

953
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:42,863
What's he done with all his money?

954
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,699
Left it to his company, where else?

955
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,868
He didn't leave it to me, ...
that's all l know.

956
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,913
Well, funeral won't cost much,
that's certain.

957
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,707
Pawn my soul, l can't think of
anyone who'll go to it.

958
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,668
l don't mind going,...
if the lunch were provided.

959
01:10:56,836 --> 01:11:01,089
But l must be fed, ...
or else l stay at home.

960
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,597
l know those men.

961
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:12,142
They're men of business,
very wealthy, very important.

962
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:16,104
Who's funeral were they talking about?

963
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,608
Strange.

964
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,819
My usual place is over there,
under the clock.

965
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,365
l ought to be there this time of day.

966
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:30,243
But l'm not....
l'm not!

967
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:54,935
Before l draw nearer to that stone,
answer me one question.

968
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:58,146
Are these the shadows of
things that must be?

969
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,317
Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?

970
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:13,036
l know that men's deeds
foreshadow certain ends,

971
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:17,874
but if the deeds be departed from,
surely the ends will change!

972
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,920
Tell me it is so with what
you show me now.

973
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,329
No Spirit, no, no, no!

974
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,709
Tell me l'm not already dead.
Tell me l'm not already dead!

975
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:04,755
Tell me l'm not already dead.

976
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:07,716
Hear me, Spirit,
l'm not the man l was.

977
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,760
Believe me, l'm not the man l was!

978
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,554
Why show me all this
if l'm beyond all hope?

979
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,265
Oh, pity me, Spirit, pity me!
And help me!

980
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,602
Help me to sponge away the
writing on the stone if l repent.

981
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,812
And l do repent, l do repent!

982
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,814
l'll make good, the wrongs
l've done my fellow man.

983
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,817
And, l'll - l'll change!
l'm not the man l was.

984
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,819
l'm not the man l was!

985
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,031
Believe me. Believe me!
l'm not the man l was!

986
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:38,830
Believe me!
l'm not the man l was.

987
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:42,834
l'm not the man l was!

988
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,871
Good morning, Sir.

989
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,541
Tell me, ... what day is it?

990
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,875
What day?

991
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,044
Why it's Christmas Day, of course, Sir.

992
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:30,549
Christmas Day, Christmas Day!
Then l haven't missed it.

993
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,094
The spirits must have done
everything in one night.

994
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,596
But of course, they can do
anything, can't they?

995
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:40,475
Of course, they can!

996
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:50,652
Are you quite yourself, Sir?
- What?

997
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:55,532
l don't know.
No, l don't think so.

998
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,702
l hope not!
- What!?

999
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,329
The curtains are still here.
They're still here!

1000
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,915
You didn't,... you didn't tear
them down and sell them.

1001
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,711
They're here. Everything's here!

1002
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,922
l'm here!

1003
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:15,552
and the shadows of things that
would be, can still be dispelled,

1004
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:20,724
and they will be.
l know they will be, l know.

1005
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,767
l don't know what to do!

1006
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,270
l'm as light as a feather! Ha ha ha...

1007
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:28,273
l'm as happy as a ...
l'm as happy as an angel!

1008
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,775
l'm as ... merry as a school boy!

1009
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:35,697
l'm as giddy...
as a drunken man, l never...

1010
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,826
A Merry Christmas, Ebenezer!

1011
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:43,288
you old humbug!

1012
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,833
And a Happy New Year!
... as if you deserved it!

1013
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:49,419
Aaah! !
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Dilbur!

1014
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,880
Same to you, Sir.
- Well thank you, thank you, thank you.

1015
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,216
And many, many of them ...
- Aaaaaah!

1016
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:57,761
Aaah! Likewise! ...

1017
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,056
Look, Mrs. Dilbur!

1018
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,767
there in the corner is where
the Spirit of Christmas Present sat.

1019
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,936
And there's the door where
Jacob Marley's ghost came through.

1020
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:07,938
And there's the window where l saw
the wandering spirit.

1021
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,899
lt's right! lt's true!
lt all happened! Oh l ...

1022
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,943
I don't know what day of the
month it is ...

1023
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:15,111
l don't know how long
l've been amongst the spirits, l ...

1024
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,989
l don't know anything.
l never did know anything.

1025
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,951
But now l know
that l don't know anything!

1026
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:24,663
l don't know anything.
l never did know anything.

1027
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:28,333
But now l know that l don't know
all the Christmas morning.

1028
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:32,212
l must stand on my head.
l must stand on my head!

1029
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:37,050
Aaaah! ! Aaaah, aah, ahahh! ! ! !
Come back, come back!

1030
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:40,887
Aaaah! ! Aaaaah!
Come back, come back, Mrs. Dilbur!

1031
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:45,934
Aaaah! ! Aaaah, aah, ahahh! ! ! !
Shhh, please, please, Mrs. Dilbur.

1032
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,146
l am not mad.

1033
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,648
Even if l do this.
Aaah! !

1034
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,650
Don't be violent, Mr. Scrooge, Sir.

1035
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:56,611
You'll force me to scream
for the beetle!

1036
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,154
The beetle, madam, ha!

1037
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:01,324
A fig for the beetle.

1038
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,868
A guinea?

1039
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,329
What for?

1040
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,331
l'll give you one guess.

1041
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:12,544
To keep me mouth shut?
- Hmm?

1042
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,755
To keep your mouth shut.
Oh no,!

1043
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:20,593
No, no, no, Mrs. Dilbur.
lt's for a Christmas present.

1044
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:24,639
A Christmas present?

1045
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:29,185
For me?

1046
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,814
Of course, for you!

1047
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,775
A Merry Merry Christmas.

1048
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:40,697
Dear Mrs. Dilbur, oh...
how much do l pay you?

1049
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,825
2 shillings a week.
- What? 2 shillings?

1050
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,869
lt's forthwith raised to 10!

1051
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,829
10 shillings a week, here!

1052
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,332
You're sure, you don't
want to see a doctor?

1053
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,500
A doctor? Certainly not!
Nor the undertaker! Ha!

1054
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:56,379
Now off you go and enjoy yourself.
Like a good girl.

1055
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,215
Bob's your uncle! Ha ha

1056
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:06,765
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge!
ln keeping with the situation!

1057
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:15,648
Oh, the bells, the merry merry bells!

1058
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,866
Oh, what a beautiful morning.

1059
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:30,330
Hello there! Hello you!
You boy! You!

1060
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,999
Who me?
- Yes, you!

1061
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,668
Do you know the butcher's
in the next street but one?

1062
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,171
l should hope so.

1063
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,882
lntelligent boy,
remarkable boy.

1064
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,884
Tell me, have they sold the prize
turkey that was hanging there?

1065
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,886
Not the little turkey, the big one?

1066
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,554
The one as big as me?!

1067
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,557
Yes!
What a delightful boy.

1068
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,435
Yes, my buck, the one as big as you.
- lt's hanging there still.

1069
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,563
ls it?!
Very well then, go and buy it.

1070
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,107
Won't occur!

1071
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,942
No, no, no, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1072
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:00,610
l'm in earnest.

1073
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,487
Tell the butcher to bring it here,
and l'll give him the name of

1074
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,114
the party he's to send it to.

1075
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:07,992
Come back with the butcher
and l'll give you a shilling.

1076
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,621
Come back in less than five minutes
and l'll give you half a crown!

1077
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:15,500
An enchanting boy.

1078
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,671
l'll send it to Bob Cratchit!

1079
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:22,340
That's what l'll do. He'll never
dream where it came from!

1080
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,883
Now let me see,
l must have a label.

1081
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,219
Label, label, label, label, label.
Label, label!

1082
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,263
Label.

1083
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:33,601
lt's twice the size of tiny Tim!

1084
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:39,774
Mr. Robert Cratchit, 2 Porter Street,
Camden Town.

1085
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,862
That's you Robert, least ways there's
no one else l know of.

1086
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:47,699
l think l know who sent it.
- Who??

1087
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,826
Mr. Scrooge.

1088
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:53,121
Oh dear, oh dear, whatever made
you think it might be him?

1089
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,332
l don't know, l just think it.

1090
01:19:56,333 --> 01:20:01,796
What would make Mr. Scrooge take
such leave of his senses suddenly?

1091
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,257
Christmas.

1092
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:27,322
"ln Scarlet Town where l was born,"

1093
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:31,409
"There was a fair maid dwelling;"

1094
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:35,914
"Made every youth cry Well-a-day,"

1095
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:40,835
"Her name was Barbara Allen."

1096
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,339
"All in the merry month of May,"

1097
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,718
"When green buds they were swelling;"

1098
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:54,057
"Young Jimmy Grove on his deathbed lay,"

1099
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:59,437
"For love of Barb'ra Allen."

1100
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:04,275
"So slowly, slowly she came up,"

1101
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:08,863
"And slowly she came nigh him,"

1102
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:14,494
"And all she said when there she came: "

1103
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:18,498
"Young man, l think..."

1104
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,710
Uncle Ebenezer!

1105
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,423
Fred, is it too late to accept
your invitation to dinner?

1106
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:31,553
Too late? l'm delighted, delighted!
My dear, look who it is!

1107
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,483
Can you forgive a pig-headed old fool

1108
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:49,237
for having no eyes to see with,
no ears to hear with,

1109
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,657
all these years?

1110
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:00,290
Yes, you dear Uncle.

1111
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:03,710
You've made Fred so happy.

1112
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,007
Oh, bless you!

1113
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:10,883
Dennis, ... polka.

1114
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:36,492
Bravo, Uncle Scrooge!
Bravo!

1115
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:40,997
Come on everybody.
Everybody!

1116
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:48,231
Cratchit!
You're late.

1117
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:49,732
Sir.

1118
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,735
What do you mean by coming
in here this time of day, hmm?

1119
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,320
l'm very sorry, Sir.

1120
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,281
l am behind my time, Sir.

1121
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,909
You are indeed!

1122
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,121
Step this way, Mr. Cratchit, please.

1123
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:07,291
lt's only once a year, Sir.
lt won't be repeated.

1124
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:11,295
l was making rather
merry yesterday, Sir.

1125
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,173
l'm sure you were.

1126
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,676
Well we won't beat about
the bush, my friend.

1127
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,345
l'm not going to stand this sort
of thing any longer.

1128
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:25,268
Which leaves me no alternative
but to raise your salary.

1129
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:43,286
Oh, l haven't taken leave
of my senses, Bob.

1130
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:45,455
l've come to them.

1131
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:47,123
From now on,

1132
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:50,877
l want to try to help you
to raise that family of yours.

1133
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,463
lf you'll let me.

1134
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:56,924
Well, we'll talk it over later, Bob,

1135
01:24:56,925 --> 01:25:01,053
over a bowl of hot punch, hmm?

1136
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:07,727
Meanwhile, you just go and
put some coal on that fire.

1137
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:11,397
You go straight out and
buy a new coal scuttle.

1138
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:16,444
Yes, you do that before
you dot another 'i', Bob Cratchit!

1139
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,456
Oh, l don't deserve to be so happy.

1140
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:33,002
But l can't help it.

1141
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:37,673
l just can't help it.

1142
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:41,469
Scrooge was better than his word.

1143
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,679
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1144
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,682
and as good a man as the
good old city ever knew.

1145
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:50,728
Or any other good old city, town,
or borough in the good old world.

1146
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:54,732
And to tiny Tim, who lived
and got well again,

1147
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:59,737
he became a second father.
- Uncle Scrooge!

1148
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:03,783
And it was always said that he knew
how to keep Christmas well,

1149
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,285
if any man alive possessed
the knowledge.

1150
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,789
May that be truly said of us,
and all of us.

1151
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,208
And so,
as tiny Tim observed,

1152
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:16,128
God bless us, ...
every one.

1153
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:29,934
"Sleep in heavenly peace,"
"Sleep in heavenly peace."
