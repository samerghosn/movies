<i>And yet, no one seems to wonder</i>

got started in the first place.</i>

All the way from the top!
Dispatch for one of your cadets!

21
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,198
It's for him, sir.

[sips] Mmm-mmm-mmm!

26
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,299
Stop.

27
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,421
Don't tell me. Let me try to guess.

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,409
I give up. Who are you?

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,510
Sarge!

30
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,004
Drill Sarge! Have a seat.
Can I get you something to drink?

31
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,143
An espresso? A cappuccino?

32
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:10,449
Aren't you supposed to be
in equestrian training?

33
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,549
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:13,750
No worries.
I've got someone covering for me.

35
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:21,742
[groans] Dispatch
from the Postmaster General's Office!

36
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:22,842
What?

37
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,073
Sarge, is that for real?

38
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:25,989
Don't tease me now. [chuckles]

39
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:27,133
Here, hold these.

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,909
Ah, well, I was expecting this
a little bit sooner,

41
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,531
but, yup, summoned to the dragon's lair.

42
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:37,865
Go ahead and cancel
the Drill Sergeant's espresso, actually.

43
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:39,643
And, uh, here, why don't you finish
mine?

00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,819
- I'm not gonna be needing it anymore...
- [growls]

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,995

around the old place so I can forget it.

[Postmaster] Nine months.

00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:57,239
It's been nine months
since I used every ounce of my influence

50
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,324
to get you into the Royal Postal
Academy.

51
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:02,698
Actually, nine months and six days,
but who's counting?

52
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:04,323
What? No croutons?

53
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:06,157
Oh, man, come on!

54
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,490
Shall we take account
of your progress then?

55
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,161
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely.

Well, there you have it.

65
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:30,828
But, hey, we gave it the old college
try,
didn't we?

66
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,030
Guess I'll just go pack up
and head home then. Too bad.

67
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,319
Darn, oh, darn.

68
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,325
- Stay right where you are.
- No, Dad!

69
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,740
You're right. When will I grow up?

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,033
When will I stop squandering
all these opportunities,

71
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:45,239
which you so kindly forced me into,

72
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,620
and become my own man?

73
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,490
I guess I must really hanker down
and rethink my priorities.

74
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,783
All wrapped up in my silk sheets
with some caviar and a sherry...

75
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,322
You still buy the same brand, right?

76
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,658
You think I'm just going to
watch you purposely fail

77
00:03:57,758 --> 00:03:59,699
and then let you waltz right back

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,573

void of any purpose or meaning?

79
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:05,407
Well, yeah. Where else would I...

00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:09,282
Congratulations. You are now a postman.

- [gasps]
- Come again?

82
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:15,129
You are to establish
a working postal office in...

00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,082
Smeerensburg.

84
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:28,906
You've got one year.

85
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,160
What? A year? Where? Smeerensburg?

86
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,018
What is...
What's happening right now? Dad?

87
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:34,781
Six thousand letters will suffice.

88
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,406
Stamped by your own hand.

89
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,119
And listen carefully, Jesper.

90
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:41,418
If you fail to get those letters,
you're cut off.

91
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:43,658
No more fancy apartments,

92
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,699

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,992
All gone.

00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,870
You can look forward to
a cozy spot in the gutter.

95
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,572
- But...
- Six thousand letters, one year.

96
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,625
You can't cheat, bribe
or squirm your way out of this one.

97
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,319
Dad! Come on!
It's me. Let's talk about this, man.

Do you know how long it took
to press this uniform?

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,949
I don't either,
but it took somebody hours.

105
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,050
Hello?

106
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,500
Burghard! Finally, a friendly face.
Can you believe what they...

107
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:27,043
Burghard, I'm not in the coach with you.
Burghard?

108
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,033
[Drill Sergeant] Sir,
I'm all for
discipline, but Smeerensburg?

109
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,697
Isn't that a bit excessive?

110
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,033
[sighs]

111
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,415
That boy needs a wake-up call, Sergeant.
And who knows?

112
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:47,127
Someday he might even thank me for it.

113
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,242
[sarcastically] Thank you, Dad!

114
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,574
This is really wonderful, Father.
Thank you so much.

115
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:54,367
This is great, Dad.

00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:56,077
Really, really great.

00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,238

Thank you!

120
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,201
I love this terrible coach ride.

121
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,533
Thank you so much!

00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,245

You go back to the intersection.
You make a left at the dead tree.

126
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,879
You're welcome.

127
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,071
What? No. I'm not lost.

128
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,617
Trust me, you are.

129
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:39,367
[laughs] Funny! Say, nice boat!

130
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,627
Any chance you might
actually get on it today?

131
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,821
What was that?

132
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,321
New postman. Smeerensburg.

133
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,738
Which is on an island,
which is surrounded by water,

134
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,074
which I need a boat to get to,
which you have.

135
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,456
Are we starting to connect the dots?

136
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,463

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,910
Is the weather always like this?

139
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,290
Eh. We're having a bit of a heat wave.

140
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,125
Huh?

141
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,459
There she is. Smeerensburg.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,990
Charming, huh?
Why, you should see it in the spring.

143
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:40,173
That's when those grays really pop.

144
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:44,332
[Mogens whistling]

145
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:50,408
What happened here?

146
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:54,949
Oh! Uh, colorful local traditions.
Quirky folklore. That kind of thing.

147
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,500
All part of this quaint town's
vibrant culture.

148
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,250
[children giggling]

149
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,283
No, no! Why you...

Oh, you rotten vermin! [yelling]

Where is everyone?

00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,551
Everyone?

154
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,375
I thought there would be
some sort of a reception.

155
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:47,743
Oh! Right. Right, the reception.
Of course, the reception.

156
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:48,880
It's good you reminded me.

157
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,029
You just ring the bell over there and,
uh... and then the reception will start.

158
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,447
- The bell?
- Yep. Give it a go.

159
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:56,572
And they'll come out.

160
00:08:56,673 --> 00:09:01,197
Why, they'll have a band, hors d'oeuvres
and, uh... and the key to the city.

161
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:03,072
All that reception stuff.

162
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,239
Really?

163
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,743
- Out here?
- Why, of course!

164
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:11,462
Well, it's not every day they get
a brand-new postman from the big city.

00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,712
[yelps]

178
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,741
[Mogens] Isn't this nice?

179
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,411
And you thought they forgot.

180
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,000
Quick! Get me out of here! [screams]

181
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
[continues screaming]

182
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,322
- Uh...
- What's going on out here?

183
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,857
- Why is everybody just standing around?
- [Mrs. Krum] Well!

184
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,490
Look who's finally throwing in the
towel!

185
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,201
Throwing in the... Us?

186
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:25,533
Ha! That's rich!

187
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:29,279
Admit it!
You weaseled out and rang the bell!

188
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,197
[Mr. Ellingboe] An Ellingboe? Never!
It was one of you critters!

189
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,816
Don't you dare raise your voice at me!

190
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,594
- Oh, there you go!
- You rang that bell!

191
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,611
- You know you rang... Oh!
- [Magdalone growls]

192
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,389
[Mr. Ellingboe] You chicken out,
and now you want to pin it on us!

193
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,804
- [Mrs. Krum] Unbelievable!
- We were plowing the snow...

194
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:43,904
[Jesper] Oh, whoa! Hey!

195
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,481
Huh. What've you got there, children?

196
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:46,740
- Mine!
- [Jesper straining]

197
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,869
Pumpkin, show Daddy what you found.

198
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,368
[continues straining]

199
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,467
[huffs]

200
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Mine.

201
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,081
[gasping]

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,990
This is no way to treat a person!

203
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,283
Certainly not this person!

204
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,739
Just one second. Let me just...

205
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,839
A postman?

206
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,073
- Pfft. Give me a break.
- When will they learn?

207
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,947
Hey! They've sent us another postman!

208
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,831
[all laughing]

209
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,279
All right. All right.

210
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,029
You don't know who I am,
so I'm gonna let this one slide.

211
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,989
Okay? But let's just say
I'm not really a postman.

212
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:22,243
Well, I am, because it's
our family business. My father's a...

213
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,577
- Don't get me started, because it's...
- Where were we? Oh, yeah. Bell, please!

214
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:27,355
- [chuckles]
- [Jesper] Life is too short

215
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,892
- to go into details, but... [gasps]
- [villagers clamoring]

216
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,169
[exclaiming]

217
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,423
[grunts and pants]

218
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,822
[panting]

219
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:43,071
[Alva] Come to the counter.
I'll be right out.

220
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,171
All right, listen.

221
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,780
Whoever's there, I warn you,
you do not want to mess with me. Okay?

222
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,365
Holy mackerel! Oh, the smell!

223
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:54,118
Fresh out of mackerel.
Only herring and burbot today.

224
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,217
[grunts]

225
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:00,332
Oh. [retches]

226
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,750
Oh.

227
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:05,659
Uniform, cold sweat, scared stiff,
shaking in your boots.

228
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,409
All right, I'm gonna just
take a wild guess here.

229
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,119
You are the latest mailman,

230
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:14,408
and the ferryman tricked you
into ringing the Battle Bell.

231
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,822
The Battle Bell?
What kind of a town has a Battle Bell?

232
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:20,599
Can we open a window in here or
something?
I can't pretend any...

233
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,735
- [villagers clamoring]
- Welcome to Smeerensburg,

234
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,918
home of the world's finest feuds.

235
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Feuds?

236
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,235
- [object falling]
- Grudges, bickering,

237
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,666
the Krums versus the Ellingboes.

238
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,484
- So...
- [object lands heavily]

239
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,495
...are you gonna buy something,
or are you just here to chitchat?

240
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Wait.

241
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,241
Isn't this a school?
Shouldn't there be
children and a teacher?

242
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:44,161
Oh! Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you!

243
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,490
I knew I was forgetting something!
Children!

244
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:47,673
Thank you!

245
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:49,415
You're the teacher?

246
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:50,739
Okay, here's how it works.

247
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,594
I sell fish, and then the person
on the other side of the counter...

248
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:56,830
- That would be you. You buy...
- Holy moly! That's you?

249
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,950
What happened?

250
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,285
- What happened was...
- That's... That came out wrong.

251
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:02,385
I took a teaching job

252
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:05,365
at a place where people
don't send their kids to school!

253
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,782
- [splutters]
- Mingling with their
sworn enemy's spawn?

254
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,599
- [exclaims]
- Oh, no! We can't have that!

255
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:13,119
So, now I'm reduced to doing this
so I can get some money

256
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:17,378
and start fresh
somewhere far, far away from here.

257
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,666
Are you going to buy something?

258
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:22,827
Herring's on sale today.

259
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,657
[door opens]

260
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:27,740
Ah! There you are.
I wondered where you'd scurried off to!

261
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,243
Morning, Miss. Alva.

262
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,573
- [Alva] Mogens.
- Come on, sport!

263
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:33,786
I saved the best for last!

264
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:41,003
Home sweet home.

265
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,201
- Ow! What the...
- [boy laughs]

266
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:47,369
- Mail that, postman!
- Now wait a
minute, that's completely...

267
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:48,990
Go home, you loser!

268
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,911
Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm a loser,
then you're a, uh...

269
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,789
You're too far. You're gone.

270
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:56,915
[Mogens grunts]

271
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,875
[clucking]

272
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,821
Well, lots of nice, natural light,

273
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:07,779
rustic touches, central air
and panoramic views.

274
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,075
- Perfect for animal lovers.
- [clucks]

275
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:12,910
- Enjoy.
- Wait! Wait!

276
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,710
This can't be right! I...

277
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:19,321
[chuckles] Oh, I get it. Did my father
put you up to this? Good one.

278
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,908
Ha ha. You got me.

279
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:24,072
Okay, well, enough of that.
Show me where I'm really staying.

280
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,375
I'd like a hot bath
and a look at the dinner menu.

281
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,240
Here, let me help you out. [clears
throat]

282
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,743
You're a postman in Smeerensburg,

283
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:34,743
which is on an island
cut off from the world,

284
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,201
frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors,

285
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,741
and this is home now.

286
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:42,293
Are we starting to connect the dots?

287
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,125
Aah!

288
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:47,707
Ugh.

289
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,495
Almost. Hang in there.

290
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,673
[shivering]

291
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,533
[muttering]

292
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:20,634
What?

293
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,241
- [crows]
- [grunts]

294
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:24,633
[screams]

295
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:37,740
[shuddering]

296
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
[screams]

297
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,790
Hmm?

298
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:43,889
Oh.

299
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,125
[grunts]

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,210
- [screeches]
- Aah!

301
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:51,030
[sobbing] That's it!
This place is the worst!

302
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,130
I'm going home!

303
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,201
No! You can't leave, remember?

304
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,409
You'll be broke! Out in the streets!

305
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:58,409
But I hate it here!

306
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,119
It's so cold and icky!

307
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,868
And the people are mean to me.
And I miss my silk sheets.

308
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:05,030
Shut up! Stop being weak!

309
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,197
Focus! How do you get out of here?

310
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,331
You need... You need...

311
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,029
letters!

312
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,129
Ugh.

313
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,408
All right. This is a good one.
I can feel it.

314
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,869
Come to Papa, you sweet, sweet little...

315
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:20,618
Oh, come on!

316
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,128
Ugh! Pssh!

317
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,291
[retches]

318
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
[groans]

319
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,455
Fine. Go to the source, I guess.

320
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,159
Good morning, madame.

321
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,990
I'm the postman, obviously.

322
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:37,808
If you have letters you'd like me to
send,

323
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,043
you could go scurry ahead
and get them and...

324
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,409
Hello! Hi! Hi!

325
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,306
If you have your letters on you,
I'd be glad to take them off your...

326
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,405
[grunts]

327
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:53,165
Hmph!

328
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,161
Birthday cards? Distant cousin?

329
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Deceased notice?

330
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,540
Holy mother!

331
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,076
- [screaming] Any letters... or
packages?
- [playing instruments
noisily]

332
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,176
Any packages?

333
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,784
Come on, people!

334
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,779
Letters! Letters! I don't have all day!

335
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,875
- [screams]
- [thugs yell]

336
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,907
Okay, keep low. Don't panic. Don't
panic.

337
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,823
Oh, I guess that's why
they call it "snail mail."

338
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:16,923
[grunts]

339
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:19,492
All right. What's going on here?
Where are all the letters?

340
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:23,173
Oh. Folks around here only have
one thing to say to one another.

341
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,333
Ah.

342
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:28,031
And they're getting their point across
pretty well without mail.

343
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,739
- Wouldn't you say?
- Wait, wait, wait.

344
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:33,423
No letters?
But how am I supposed to get out of...

345
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:36,157
- What the...
- [boy] Hello?

346
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,740
Sir, can I get my drawing back?

347
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,292
The wind blew it away.

348
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,489
- Please?
- Not now, kid.

349
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:45,583
Can't you see I'm busy
trying to figure out how to get...

350
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,910
Well, here's a thought.

351
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,281
I'm a postman, see?

352
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:53,448
So I can't give it to you,
but I could mail it to you.

353
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,201
- [boy] How?
- Couldn't be simpler!

354
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,823
I just fold your pretty drawing,
very beautiful by the way,

355
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,570
put it in an envelope like this

356
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:04,455
and then all that's left is postage
so I can put it in the mailbox for you.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,323
- Postage?
- Yep.

358
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,407
You just toss a penny over to me
so I can stamp it,

359
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:10,880
and we're all ready to go.

360
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,449
Couldn't you just put it in?

361
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,148
Aw. Tsk.

362
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:19,615
I really, really would, but I can't.

363
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:22,449
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage.

364
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:23,548
See how it works?

365
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So what do you say?

366
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,201
I get my letter, and you get your
drawing.

367
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,451
Win-win. You want your drawing, don't
you?

368
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,268
- Um...
- If you don't, I'm gonna keep it.

369
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:32,448
- Hmm.
- I love it.

370
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:33,705
I would keep it if I was you,

371
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:36,082
so I would send this letter
back to myself if I was you.

372
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,212
[hounds growling]

373
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,569
[boy] Oh, hi, Papa!

374
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,570
This nice man says
he can mail my drawing back to me!

375
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,385
- He's lying. Children are liars.
- [boy] Can you give him a penny?

376
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,279
Oh, look at that. Wrong address. Silly
me.

377
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,176
These aren't...
You're not the Spendlebergs.

378
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:50,277
I'll see you later.

379
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,174
Thank you so much,
and no need... [mumbling]

380
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,059
- [hounds barking]
- [Jesper] Aah! The
puppies! The puppies!

381
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,664
Ah. And that must be the express mail.

382
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,276
[Jesper] All right, Smeerensburg.

383
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,661
You may have won this round,

384
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,073
but if you think I'm giving up,
think again.

385
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:05,616
I'll have my letters in no time,

386
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:08,199
and then it's bye-bye to you
and your cold and your loons

387
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:09,976
and your chickens! That's right! You
too!

388
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,076
[clucking]

389
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,420
You'll see. I give it a week.

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,079
Two, tops.

391
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,536
[wood creaking]

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
[hens clucking]

393
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,069
Is this a bad time?
I can see you're pretty swamped.

394
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,536
[sighs] Don't you have...

395
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,951
a job or something?

396
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,282
Why, sure I do.

397
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:51,569
I'm here to pick up all the outgoing
mail.

398
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,820
So, where is it?

399
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:55,198
Now, you're gonna have to help me
with the heavier bags.

400
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:56,298
Bad back, don't you know.

401
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,740
- [Jesper] Man, I hate you.
- I know.

402
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,411
So, uh, where is the mail, anyway?

403
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,160
Where do you keep it?
In a different room now or something?

404
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:06,281
What about if I walk around the room,

405
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:10,319
if I get close to the mail,
you say "warmer"?

406
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,125
And if I'm getting
farther from the mail, you say "colder"?

407
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,877
- And then...
- What's that?

408
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,199
What? Oh, the woodsman's cabin?

409
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,160
[Jesper] Yeah, does someone live there?

410
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,118
Well, sure.
Yeah, you should definitely drop by.

411
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,248
Nice fella. Loves visitors.

412
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,250

[door creaking]

415
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,701
Hello? I'm in your house
or... whatever this place is.

416
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,881
Anybody here?

417
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,998
[grunts softly]

418
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,739
Ah, come on. Really?

419
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,502
[grunting]

420
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,920
Of course. Of course this would happen.

421
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,750
Great. I'm gonna kill that boatman.

422
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What?

423
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:33,665
Toys?

424
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,208
Ah, here we go.

425
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:50,869
Now I can go home with the satisfaction
of having accomplished absolutely...

426
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,970
[grunting]

427
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:53,365

Yeehaw!

[footsteps approaching]

444
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,117
That's it! I've had it!

445
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,571
Better alive in the gutter
than hacked into pieces!

446
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:21,915
No, thank you!

447
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yah!

453
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,072
Where's this?

454
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,366
What? I don't know. How would I...

455
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,467
Wait.

456
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,125
I do know.

457
00:25:54,223 --> 00:25:56,822
Keep going down this road,
and you'll get there.

458
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,989
You can't miss it. It...
Or I can show you.

459
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:01,173
Sure. Yeah, let me just show you.

460
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,118
All right.

462
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:14,571
Excuse me. Just... Can I...

[groans]

464
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,333
Here we are.

465
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,962
Watch your step getting out of the,
uh...
What's this?

466
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,704
You're a postman, aren't you?

467
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,458
Oh, you want me to... [chuckles]

468
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,290
No, but I...

469
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,248
[clears throat] Sure thing. My pleasure.

470
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:32,993
Nothing I'd love to do more

471
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:38,161
than deliver what I'm fairly certain
can only be a severed head of some kind.

472
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,258
I mean, there's no way
that's not a severed head.

473
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,866
It's gotta... I'm holding a head
in my hand, but hey!

[grunts]

475
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:46,035
Come on! Look, I'm...

00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,779
Ah! You're right there!

477
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,656
So quiet for a disproportionately...

478
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:53,573
- I mean, strapping, uh... statuesque.
- [growls]

479
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:55,536
You have a kind of, um...

480
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,700
What? In there?

481
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,073
You must be kidding.
No way. Absolutely not.

482
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,116
I mean, first of all,
I'd love to, of course,

483
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:07,071
but, look, too bad about the fence.

484
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,616
Rats. Oh, well.

485
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:11,196
What are you gonna do? Are you...
What's happening right now?

486
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,073
Hey, listen, please. Open this!

487
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:16,407
- Why are you doing this to me?
- [hounds growling]

488
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:17,508
Oh, no.

491
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,226
Okay, you win. What do you want?
Money? My dad's got plenty of it.

492
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:27,521
You can write him a ransom note.
You can write, right?

493
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,459
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll write it for you.

494
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:32,661
Ah! He'll never know it's me!
I'll make it sound like it's from you!

495
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,160
I'll use monosyllabic words, man!
Please! Please! Please!

496
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,160
Just let me out of here!
I'm gonna get...

498
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,759

This has gotta move! Come on! Come on!

508
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,199
Open up. Open up. Open up! Come on!

Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,742
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Keep it together! Keep it together!

Where are they, boys?

517
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,615
Don't let 'em get away! Come on! Get
'em!

518
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:29,821
[gasps] Okay.

519
00:28:29,922 --> 00:28:31,779
I've done all you've asked. Can I
please...

Has he?

00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:18,250
- [pounding at door]
- Ah! He's here to finish the job!

539
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:20,212
- Oh, no!
- [girl] Mr. Postman?

540
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,039
Are you in there?

541
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,998
Go away! Go! Leave! He'll hear you!

542
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,204
We'd like to send these letters!

What? What did you just say?

546
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:39,865
Our cousin told us
if we write a letter to Mr. Klaus,

547
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:40,990
he'll make us a toy.

548
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,369
He also said to bring you a penny each.

549
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,748
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage, right?

["How You Like Me Now?" playing]

551
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,573
- Psst. Hey. Hey, you.
- Hmm?

552
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:00,673
You want a toy?

553
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,950
- [chuckles]
- Hey! Would you, uh...

554
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,049
like a brand-new toy?

555
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:11,246
Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus.

556
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,160
And you put it in the envelope,
write your name on it and bring a penny.

557
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:18,329
Can't forget the penny.

558
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,671
These better sound sad. Do they sound
sad?

559
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,250
Okay, good job.

560
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,958

All right. Remember...

00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,577
probably not an ax murderer, though...

568
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:30,915
it still is a possibility,
but most likely... no.

569
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,461
He's a good guy... deep down.

570
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,407
- [clears throat] Hello.
- [grunts]

571
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:40,118
[clears throat] Hello.
Mr... Klaus, I take it?

572
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,449
You remember me from the nice
breaking and entering last night?

573
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:45,532
[chuckles] Jesper Johanssen, postman,

574
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,198
- but we never properly...
- [grunts]

575
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,080
[gulps] Uh...

576
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:51,739
I, uh...

577
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:56,201
You see, Mr. Klaus,
it seems like word got around

578
00:32:56,301 --> 00:33:00,160
that the poor children of Smeerensburg
have started, uh...

579
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,781
completely unprompted...

580
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:04,375
writing letters asking you for...

581
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,461
toys. [coughs]

582
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,201
So I figured

583
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,823
you have the whole barn filled with toys

584
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,570
just sitting there collecting dust,
so...

585
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:15,671
[whimpers]

586
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,131
Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes.

00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:24,958

00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:35,448
- [all chirping]
- [Jesper] Oh, wow.

590
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:37,211
That is...

591
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,948
totally normal.

592
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,451
Not a symptom of any mental illness
or anything.

593
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,741
- [Klaus] Go away.
- Mr. Klaus, sir!

594
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:46,911
Those little children... [grunts]

595
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,531
...if you donate your old toys to
them...

596
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:52,825
[pants] ...well,
I'll gladly deliver them for free!

597
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,494
Mr. Klaus, wait!

598
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,366
Please! [panting]

599
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:06,788
Think of all the joy you'll bring
their miserable little lives!

600
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,708
Look, here.

601
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,202
Poor little Herlief.

602
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:13,201
He only has sticks and stones
to play with. So sad.

603
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,701
And this one,

604
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,992
little Penny... Patty.

605
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:18,992
Her doll was so old,

606
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,702
it crumbled in her arms
when she came to me.

607
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:24,541
And then Kristoff...
Little, ugly Kristoff.

608
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,333
This little...

609
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,628
Tonight, same time.

610
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:39,780
Great! What, "same time"?
You mean, dead of night?

611
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,157
- I can just take the toys now.
- No. I go with you.

612
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:44,449
There's no need
for you to come with me, really.

613
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,869
It might be against the law

614
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,867
for a noncertified postman
to ride with me.

615
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,288
I have to check the rule book.

616
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:54,284
Great. Tonight, then. I'll see you then.
Good talk. Good talk.

00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,572
Playing, I tell you.

631
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:43,989
With an Ellingboe!

632
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:47,043
- [councilman 1] An Ellingboe, no less!
- [councilman 2] In all my years!

633
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:48,782
- Did you all hear that?
- Unacceptable.

634
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:50,800
- [man] I don't know how it happened.
- [yelps]

635
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,333
I turned away for one second...

636
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,990
And then I saw it.

637
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,119
I brought her as soon as I could, sir.

638
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,449
- That's just wrong! Wrong, I say!
- Inconceivable!

639
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,619
- What are we going to do?
- Unthinkable!

640
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,322
Hmm. This is bad. Very bad.

641
00:36:05,422 --> 00:36:08,530
Worst I've ever seen, really.
What were you thinking, kid?

642
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,630
Don't you know that...

643
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:12,876
Krums and Ellingboes don't mix.

644
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,369
- But why?
- "Why?" he asks!

645
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:17,106
- See what I mean?
- [councilwoman] Why?

646
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:18,206
I don't know what to do!

647
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,130
Please help us, miss! I beg you!

648
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,083

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,420
Do you know what this is, little boy?

651
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,724
This is tradition!

652
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,907
Centuries of glorious hatred,
passed down through generations!

653
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,822
There was the hundred-day brawl of '45.

654
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,489
Which we totally won!

655
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,492
The maritime game of chicken.

656
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:52,293
The Great Mooning of '86.

657
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:53,833
[gasps]

658
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,572
So, if there's something we know...

659
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,239
...going back as far as we can
remember...

660
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:01,824
...it's that a Krum
despises an Ellingboe...

661
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:05,456
...and an Ellingboe can't stand a Krum!

662
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,867
That is why.

663
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:12,967
[gasps]

664
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:19,949
Now, I just know you didn't mean to
disrespect all of that heritage, right?

665
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:23,119
- Right.
- And it won't happen again,

666
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:24,538
will it?

667
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:27,130
Of course not.

668
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,916
Now, tell me all about
where this pretty thing came from.

669
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,625
Ugh.

670
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,577
Let me guess.
Leaving it at the gate not an option?

671
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,333
You really have a way with words,
you know?

672
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:49,081
Of course, you don't...
Of course, don't even answer that...

673
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,125
[groans]

674
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,538

Stop! Stop!

681
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,750
Aah!

00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:51,306
- [child 1] Out of the way!
- [child 3] Mine first!

692
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:52,407
I want a bicycle!

693
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,344
- Tell Mr. Klaus I want a bicycle!
- Shut up!

694
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:56,280
- Take my letter! Take my letter!
- Mine! Me!

695
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,458
Me first! Me first! A doll!

696
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:00,449
-Me! Me! Me!
- Okay! Okay! Single line! Chop-chop!

697
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,782
Fall back! All right. Everyone, in line.

698
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,201
- There you go.
- Get out! Move.

699
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,992
Letter? Good. Letter? Good.

700
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:09,213

use
a little diet cleanse. What are you
doing?

Less presents?

808

00:47:50,983 --> 00:47:51,990
<i>So we helped him.</i>

876
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,833
<i>He said he didn't like it,
but... deep down, I think he did."</i>

877
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,900
[boy 2] <i>"That's what I did today.</i>

878
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,001
<i>And yesterday,</i>

879
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:02,369
<i>instead of stealing Mrs. Runa's berries,
we picked them all up for her."</i>

880
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:03,659
- [boy 2 laughs]
- Hmm?

881
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:07,659
<i>"She came to our house later,
and she brought Mom lots of berry jam."</i>

882
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Hmph.

883
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,574
[chuckles] <i>"And then</i>
<i>Mom brought her a berry pie."</i>

884
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:13,311
- [Annelisse] <i>"Dear Mr. Klaus...</i>
- Hmph.

885
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:14,929
<i>...I've been going to class every day,</i>

886
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:17,998
<i>- and I always do my homework."</i>
- Oh, Annelisse! Thank you!

887
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,030
Hi, Mr. Postman!

888
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,820
[Annelisse] <i>"Miss. Alva</i>
<i>is the best teacher ever!"</i>

889
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,070
[boy 3] <i>"Also, I cleaned</i>
<i>my dad's old clarinet.</i>

890
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,956
<i>I hope I did a good job. He seemed
happy.</i>

891
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,619
<i>Could I get a toy please?"</i>

892
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,708
[playing clarinet solo]

893
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:41,947
[children laughing]

894
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:43,047
Huh?

895
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,166
[children laughing]

896
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:46,264
Huh?

897
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:48,000
[all yelling]

898
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,583
What?

899
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,202
[all laughing]

900
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:00,331
What the...

901
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,643
Hey, there, Chief. How're we doin'...

902
00:49:17,744 --> 00:49:20,126
- [children] Here! Me!
- What? How?

903
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:28,416
[all gasp]

904
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:31,534
Whoo! Come on, guys! Let's play!

905
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:33,204
[children laughing]

906
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:39,041
[clucking]

907
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:50,920
[Mrs. Runa chuckling]

908
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:11,833
I think it's time we send
that postman... a message.

909
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,670
You know what to do, pumpkin.

910
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:19,376
[in raspy voice] Mine...

911
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:23,822
[Jesper] And the baker now has a sale
on cakes for Ellingboes,

912
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,867
without razor blades in the dough
or anything.

913
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:30,280
Oh, and did you know
that arson is down 70%?

914
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,907
It's true. When's the last time
you saw a house burn down?

915
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:35,990
Precisely. And cookouts,
swap meets, and, uh...

916
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,090
yeah, I don't know.

917
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,001
It's like everyone's gone mad
or something.

918
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,789
A true selfless act...

919
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,791
always sparks another.

920
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,989
Well, look who's suddenly a chatterbox.
Tell me,

921
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,869
what made you squander all those words
into that nugget of wisdom?

922
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:54,248
Oh, just something...

923
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,074
someone used to say.

924
00:50:56,173 --> 00:50:57,617
Well, let me tell you something.

925
00:50:57,717 --> 00:51:01,367
I've been around long enough to know
that everyone is out to get something.

926
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:04,659
Those kids? Those kids are in it
for the toys. And the grown-ups?

927
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:06,822
Well, I don’t know what they’re after.

928
00:51:06,922 --> 00:51:09,326
but it sure is not goodwill
and peace on Earth.

929
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,750
What about you?

930
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,242
- What's in it for you?
- Me?

931
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,492
Well, you know... [sighs]

932
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:18,472
- It's different. I don't...
- [wood creaking]

933
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Look out!

934
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,954
- [Magdalone] Mine!
- [Mrs. Krum] What?

935
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,657
- Aah!
- [reindeer whinny]

936
00:51:27,757 --> 00:51:29,659
- [Mrs. Krum] I can't believe this!
- Whoa!

937
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,449
What are you doing at our ambush?

938
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,659
Your ambush? This is our ambush!

939
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,490
- Stop, stop, stop!
- I'm trying!

940
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,824
[Jesper] Stop! Stop!

941
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:38,376
[both screaming]

942
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,157
[Klaus] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

943
00:51:43,257 --> 00:51:44,990
Oh, great! Look what you've done!

944
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,168
- What we've done?
- [Mrs. Krum] Leave it to you...

945
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:48,268
Whoa!

946
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:51,916
[both screaming]

947
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,333
[wind howling]

948
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:00,833
[gasps]

949
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,833
Wow.

950
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,125
[sleigh splintering]

951
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,791
Friends of yours, I take it?

952
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:21,875
Uh...

953
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:23,751
They seem nice.

954
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:29,907
[panting]

955
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:31,007
[all gasp]

956
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:36,003
You guys are not gonna believe
what I saw last night!

957
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:41,659
A flying sleigh
pulled by magical reindeer?

958
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:42,759
Yep.

959
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,324
[chuckles]

960
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,166
[laughing]

961
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,742
Oh, look, it can laugh.

962
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:51,161
- Ho ho ho!
- Mystery solved.

963
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,061
Ho ho ho!

964
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,391
Ho ho ho!

965
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,820
Wait, wait, wait. Time out. Really?

966
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,239
- That's how you laugh?
- Right.

967
00:53:00,338 --> 00:53:01,534
Let's load up.

968
00:53:01,634 --> 00:53:03,947
Oh, no, no. You don't get off that easy.

969
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,246
- Let me hear it again.
- No.

970
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:08,619
Come on.
Just a snicker or a chuckle.

971
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,677
- Just a giggle.
- Keep it up. See what happens.

972
00:53:10,777 --> 00:53:11,777
All right. I'll stop.

973
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:15,539
Say, have you heard the one about
the one-legged man who walks into a bar?

974
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,907
Say, we're kinda running low on
inventory,
aren't we?

975
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:38,079
Yes, only a couple more trips,
and that should do it.

976
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,833
You must be...

977
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,369
looking forward to no more night shifts.

978
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:44,949
- Right?
- Right.

979
00:53:45,048 --> 00:53:47,130
Yeah. Yeah.

980
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,041
Me too.

981
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,070
Hello, Postman!

982
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,867
Oh, good, you're back.

983
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:08,989
[speaking Saami]

984
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,619
Yes, yes, yes. That's very nice,

985
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,748
but whatever it is you're saying,
I've got my own problems, you know?

986
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:19,369
I mean, we are out of toys,
and without toys, there are no letters.

987
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:20,577
And without letters...

988
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,416
Ugh! Forget it.

989
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,784
I'm running out of time! There, I said
it!

990
00:54:26,884 --> 00:54:29,414
It's almost Christmas already,
and I still...

991
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:32,780
Christmas. Christmas.

992
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,989
That’s it. Wait.

993
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:36,382
[spluttering] We gotta do... I gotta...

994
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,039
Can you please get off my porch?
You're trespassing.

995
00:54:56,833 --> 00:55:00,784
I, leader of the proud Krum...

996
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:02,657
Get on with it already.

997
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,579
Shut up, you idiot! I'm getting to it!

998
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:09,742
I, leader of the proud...

999
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,824
Oh, forget it. The mood is gone.

1000
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:13,989
You know why I'm calling this meeting.

1001
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:15,824
Yeah, I... Of course I know.

1002
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:16,923
Uh...

1003
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,320
- Midnight brawl?
- Look around, Aksel!

1004
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,576
Where is your clan?

1005
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,952
- Huh.
- I'll tell you where they are.

1006
00:55:26,052 --> 00:55:30,159
They're at block parties!
Hayrides! And cookouts!

1007
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,409
Brunches! Don't forget about the
brunches.

1008
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:36,740
[sobbing] It was a book club
that took my poor Sven!

1009
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,119
You see? The postman
and that old toy maker

1010
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:42,572
are brainwashing everyone!

1011
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,739
What're you saying?

1012
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,713
I'm saying it's time to join forces
against a common enemy.

1013
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:53,242
I'm saying we need a truce.

1014
00:55:53,342 --> 00:55:56,411
[gasps] A truce? Have you gone mad?

1015
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,949
Either we band together
to take care of this,

1016
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,869
or it's gonna be all book clubs

1017
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:03,085
- and cookouts from here on...
- [man] And brunches!

1018
00:56:03,186 --> 00:56:06,367
- Don't forget about the brunches.
- Yes, that... that too.

1019
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:11,780
So, we must join together in peace
to help stop this peace?

1020
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,164
Our ancestors demand it.

1021
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,157
For the Ellingboe bloodline!

1022
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:22,789
For the Krums' honor.

1023
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:26,420
The clans are on the warpath...

1024
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:28,788
together!

1025
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:31,989
- [all clamoring]
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1026
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,824
Mine! Mine!

1027
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:34,923
Mine!

1028
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,867
[all shouting]

1029
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:41,739
I... [sighs]

1030
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,333
This is gonna take a lot of work.

1031
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:48,291
- [birds chirping]
- [wood splintering]

1032
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,291
[grunts]

1033
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,003
[chiming]

1034
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,782
- Surprise!
- Oh!

1035
00:57:49,882 --> 00:57:50,882
Jesper?

1036
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:54,739
- Wha-what are you...
- Welcome to your new workshop!

1037
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,742
- Ta-da!
- What... What is...

1038
00:57:56,842 --> 00:57:59,039
- It'll all be explained in a minute.
- Why did you...

1039
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:00,898
- I don't want to...
- Come. Sit, sit, sit.

1040
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,157
You'll love this. I promise.

1041
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:04,257
[clears throat]

1042
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:05,882
Christmas!

1043
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,320
Christmas? What do you...

1044
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,117
Think about it! Every child in town
gets up on Christmas morning

1045
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:14,072
and finds a...

1046
00:58:14,172 --> 00:58:17,246
brand-new toy waiting for them
by the fireplace.

Oh, well. Best leave it alone, I say.

1369

a source of resentment and regret.

01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:54,658
And then he turned to me, and he said...

[chuckles] ...he'd never been
more proud of me.

Anyways, anybody can get off a boat.

1390
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,750
The real trick is gonna be
convincing
Klaus and Alva to give me an...

1391
01:18:21,582 --> 01:18:22,582
What? What's that?

1392
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:25,875
It's the clans!

1393
01:18:27,832 --> 01:18:28,962
Klaus!

1394
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,287
[man speaking Saami]

1395
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:38,875
[Klaus] Slowly.

1396
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:41,780
Slowly. Slowly.

1397
01:18:41,881 --> 01:18:42,954
A little bit...

1398
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,461
[Mrs. Krum] Well, well.

1399
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,865
Isn't this convenient?

1400
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:53,207
[gasps and speaks Saami]

1401
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,283
What're you doing here?

1402
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:57,488
Why, we were just thinking,

1403
01:18:57,588 --> 01:19:01,243
"Don't our children
also deserve a present?"

1404
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:02,573
And lookie here!

1405
01:19:02,673 --> 01:19:05,029
You've already got her favorite thing
in the world.

1406
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:07,365
A nice, big piñata!

1407
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:09,618
- [all gasp]
- Hey, you put... [grunts]

1408
01:19:09,717 --> 01:19:11,739
...one hand on those toys and I swear
I...

1409
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,243
Stand back. All right.

1410
01:19:13,342 --> 01:19:15,323
Do what you will with the toys.

1411
01:19:15,423 --> 01:19:16,867
But no one gets hurt.

1412
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:19,198
Suits us just fine.

1413
01:19:19,298 --> 01:19:20,417
[Magdalone and Olaf grumble]

1414
01:19:20,516 --> 01:19:23,949
How long until children
go back to the old ways

1415
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,831
once there are no toys to bribe them
with?

1416
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,956
How long until they
turn against each other?

1417
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:35,461
And how long until the grown-ups follow?

1418
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:37,738
[gasps]

1419
01:19:37,838 --> 01:19:39,502
- [screams]
- [Jesper screaming]

1420
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,118
Jesper?

1421
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:48,287
The postman!

1422
01:19:52,707 --> 01:19:54,247
Ha! Eat our snow, you...

1423
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,867
They're not attached.
Why aren't they attached?

1424
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:58,125
I thought they were attached.

1425
01:19:58,225 --> 01:20:01,073
I would never, in a million years,
have done what I just did

1426
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:02,689
if I didn't think these were attached.

1427
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:03,789
After them!

1428
01:20:03,889 --> 01:20:07,240
Who leaves a sleigh
unattached like... Aah!

1429
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:08,533
Destroy those toys!

1430
01:20:08,634 --> 01:20:10,865
- Stop them at any cost!
- Mine!

1431
01:20:10,966 --> 01:20:13,166
Mine! Mine!

1432
01:20:14,082 --> 01:20:15,332
- Mine!
- [Olaf chuckling]

1433
01:20:17,832 --> 01:20:19,792
[Magdalone in raspy voice] Mine...

1434
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:21,666
Mine!

1435
01:20:30,207 --> 01:20:32,530
I could really use a hand here.

1436
01:20:32,631 --> 01:20:35,198
"Use." Interesting choice of word.

1437
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,701
Really? You're gonna
go for the guilt trip now?

1438
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:39,961
Smash those toys to pieces!

1439
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:47,239
The toys!

1440
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,661
- We have to close that bag!
- What do you care?

1441
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:52,782
- I thought you were leaving.
- Great. Sure. I'll tell you what.

1442
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,819
Let's continue discussing
what a horrible person I am

1443
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,279
while I most likely break my neck
trying to save the children's toys,

1444
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,448
- why don't we?
- Get down there!

1445
01:21:01,547 --> 01:21:03,211
- Stop those toys!
- [screaming]

1446
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,125
[laughing]

1447
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:06,711
Uh... Klaus?

1448
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:08,541
Hmm.

1449
01:21:12,457 --> 01:21:13,787
[all scream]

1450
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:20,033
Nice move! How'd you know
I wouldn't get knocked off too?

1451
01:21:20,132 --> 01:21:21,819
Never mind. Don't answer that.

1452
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,920
[screams]

1453
01:21:23,582 --> 01:21:24,952
- Mine!
- [Jesper] Whoa!

1454
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:27,201
Go! Go! We're dead!
We're dead! We're dead!

1455
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:28,301
Mine!

1456
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,784
- [growls] Mine!
- [exclaims]

1457
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:33,791
[grunts]

1458
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,202
[Mr. Ellingboe] Pumpkin!

1459
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:37,461
I'm still proud of you, you hear me?

1460
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,826
[ice cracking]

1461
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:42,625
[exclaims]

1462
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,291
Mine?

1463
01:21:54,082 --> 01:21:55,832
We're losing toys!

1464
01:21:56,332 --> 01:21:57,332
[grunts]

1465
01:21:57,431 --> 01:21:58,431
[gasps]

1466
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,672
[both screaming]

1467
01:22:03,332 --> 01:22:04,332
[grunts]

1468
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,033
- [all screaming]
- [Mrs. Krum] Oh, no!

1469
01:22:07,132 --> 01:22:09,090
- Stop! Stop!
- [Mr. Ellingboe] Oh, my goodness!

1470
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,252
- Oh, no, no, no! No!
- [groans]

1471
01:22:13,082 --> 01:22:14,082
[Jesper screaming]

1472
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,750

[grunting]

1475
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,319
Jesper! Let go!

1476
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:30,036
- It's not worth it!
- Are you crazy? No!

1477
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:36,916
[panting heavily]

1478
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:39,666
[panting]

1479
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,029
See? Nothing to it. Just...

1480
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,414
[Mrs. Krum] I wouldn't be so sure.

1481
01:22:47,457 --> 01:22:48,957
Wait! No, no, no!

1482
01:22:49,457 --> 01:22:53,257
No! No, no, no! No!

1483
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:05,070
This town was built
on resentment and spite.

1484
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:08,070
And it'll stay that way
as long as a Krum...

1485
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,367
Or an Ellingboe!

1486
01:23:09,466 --> 01:23:10,466
Ugh.

1487
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:12,744
...have something to say about it.

1488
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,990
Let's go. We're done here.

1489
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,886
[Mr. Ellingboe] Well said.
Wait, does
that mean the feud is back on?

1490
01:23:18,987 --> 01:23:20,158
No more truce?

1491
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:21,670
[Mrs. Krum] First thing tomorrow.

1492
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,421
[Jesper] A true act of goodwill.

1493
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,416
What was that?

1494
01:23:27,832 --> 01:23:28,832
[grunting]

1495
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,581
A true act of goodwill...

1496
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,324
always sparks another.

1497
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,368
I think you hit your head
pretty hard, dear.

1498
01:23:39,469 --> 01:23:40,917
You should lie back down.

1499
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,909
You don't believe me? Turn around.

1500
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,010
What?

1501
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:46,829
Turn around.

1502
01:23:50,832 --> 01:23:52,073
- Mine.
- [Mrs. Krum gasps]

1503
01:23:52,173 --> 01:23:53,367
- Pumpkin!
- Honey!

1504
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:55,198
- Drop that immediately!
- Mine!

1505
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:58,055
- [Mrs. Krum] Honey! Sweetie!
- Let go and come back here right now.

1506
01:23:58,154 --> 01:24:00,350
- [Mrs. Krum] Get down from there!
- [Magdalone] Mine!

1507
01:24:00,451 --> 01:24:01,649
[Mrs. Krum] It's Mama calling.

1508
01:24:01,748 --> 01:24:04,345
- [Mr. Ellingboe] Put the boy down.
- [Mrs. Krum] Remember Mama?

1509
01:24:04,445 --> 01:24:06,363
[Mr. Ellingboe] You don't know
where he's been.

1510
01:24:06,462 --> 01:24:07,740
Klaus, I don't know what to say.

1511
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:08,841
If I hadn't...

1512
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:09,939
[thumps]

1513
01:24:11,707 --> 01:24:12,747
What's this?

1514
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:23,032
The presents in the sleigh were all
fake?

1515
01:24:23,131 --> 01:24:24,948
[Klaus] Give me a little credit.
[grunts]

1516
01:24:25,047 --> 01:24:27,159
I wasn't going to let them have the
toys.

1517
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,659
- But how did you know that...
- Kids talk, you know?

1518
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,368
And if kids happen to be talking

1519
01:24:31,469 --> 01:24:33,948
about their parents plotting to form
an angry mob,

1520
01:24:34,048 --> 01:24:35,573
then, you know, teachers listen.

1521
01:24:35,672 --> 01:24:36,876
It was a simple plan.

1522
01:24:37,457 --> 01:24:40,822
[grunts] They would destroy
the decoys and leave.

1523
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:44,029
But then you showed up
and made it complicated. As usual.

1524
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:45,744
So, all this was for nothing?

1525
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,631
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1526
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,500
Shall we then?

1527
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:17,573
He came! He came!

1528
01:25:17,673 --> 01:25:18,948
[all laughing]

1529
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,631
- Yeah!
- Mine's the big one!

1530
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,448
I told you! I told you he would come!

1531
01:25:25,547 --> 01:25:27,331
Mom! Come here, quick!

1532
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,320
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1533
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:31,698
- It's just what I wanted!
- He came! He came! He came!

1534
01:25:31,797 --> 01:25:35,541
Dad! Mom! Wake up! You have to see this!

1535
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,920

1550
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,658
It's so bright you can even see at
night.

Oh, look over there!
See the red and yellow along the rim?

[Jesper] <i>The years went by.</i>
