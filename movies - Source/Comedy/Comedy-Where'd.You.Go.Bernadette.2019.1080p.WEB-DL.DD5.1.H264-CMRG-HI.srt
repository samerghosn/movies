00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:56,975
BEE: Have you ever heard
that the brain

2
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:59,631
is like a discounting mechanism?

3
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,551
Say someone gives you a present

4
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,502
and it's a diamond necklace

5
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:05,742
and you open it and you love it.

6
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,430
You're all happy at first
and then the next day

7
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,438
it still makes you happy
but a little bit less so.

8
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,518
A year later,
you see the necklace

9
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:15,567
and you think,
"Oh, that old thing."

10
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,061
And do you know why your brain
discounts things?

11
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,079
It's for survival.

12
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,222
You need to be prepared
for new experiences

13
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:23,841
because they could
signal danger.

14
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:26,862
Wouldn't it be great
if we could reset that

15
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,920
since there aren't a lot
of saber-toothed tigers

16
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,543
jumping out at us?

17
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:31,950
Seems like a design flaw

18
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,319
that our brain's
default settings signal danger

19
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:37,134
and survival instead
of something like joy

20
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:38,370
or appreciation.

21
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,118
I think that's what happened
to my mom.

22
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,710
She got so focused
on picking up danger signals

23
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,609
that her discounting mechanism
forgot to see

24
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,646
all the good stuff in her life.

25
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:52,015
And maybe Dad had quit seeing

26
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:53,954
the diamond necklace side
of Mom.

27
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,362
(water dripping)

28
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:20,854
BERNADETTE: Do you have any idea
how strong I'm being?

29
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:22,254
How much my heart is breaking

30
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,193
'cause you want to go off
to boarding school?

31
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,610
BEE: If you didn't want me
to go away to boarding school,

32
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,747
you shouldn't have made it
sound like so much fun.

33
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,284
Ugh, yeah, right.
So it's my fault.

34
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,483
ELGIE: It's not loading
my workout. Got it.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,406
Do you guys remember
when you told me

36
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:37,823
if I got perfect grades all
the way through middle school

37
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,121
I could have anything I wanted

38
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,813
as a graduation present?

39
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:41,913
I...

40
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,663
D-Did we say that?

41
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,959
I think it was to ward off
any further talk of a pony.

42
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:48,096
BEE: Well, that's what
I wanted when I was little.

43
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:51,266
Now I want something
completely different.

44
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:54,415
You wanna know what it is?

45
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,534
I don't know. Do we?

46
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,807
(sighs) Does it entail
leaving the house?

47
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:59,680
A family trip to Antarctica!

48
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,233
We have to go
over Christmas break.

49
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,813
As in a month?

50
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:06,790
Oh, yeah. Obviously,
'cause it's their summer.

51
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,448
It's about the only time
you could go.

52
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:09,665
Yeah, 'cause ponies are cute

53
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:11,563
and maybe not as much trouble
as we thought.

54
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:13,466
What do you say there, Mom?

55
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:15,693
Isn't this a bad time

56
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,377
for you because of work?

57
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,431
We're studying Antarctica
in school.

58
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,093
I've read
all the explorers' journals,

59
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:24,230
and I'm doing my final
presentation on Shackleton.

60
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,581
And now is a good time to go

61
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,079
before another ice sheet
collapses

62
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,217
and the whole thing melts.

63
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,396
Oh, my God. I can't believe

64
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,653
neither of you are saying no.

65
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,718
I'm waiting for you.
You hate traveling.

66
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,694
I w-was waiting for you.
You have to work.

67
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:38,191
Oh, my God.
That's a "yes". We're going!

68
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,449
Wait, wait.
Is that really a "yes"?

69
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:45,514
I guess it is.

70
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,962
(chuckles) On a technicality.

71
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,126
BEE: I read once
dolphins operate

72
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:55,790
in this complicated social order

73
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,310
with alliances and enemies
and enforcers, recruiters.

74
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,614
Almost like the Mafia,
or maybe high school.

75
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:03,054
They even battle sometimes,

76
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:04,831
where they bash each other
over the heads

77
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,998
with their tails.

78
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,366
Why do all the smart creatures
organize themselves

79
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,765
in these weird
social structures?

80
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,974
Audrey does everything
at Galer Street.

81
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,925
She created
the Diversity Council.

82
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:18,125
She set up Marathon Kids.
She invented Donuts for Dads.

83
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,687
Mom once signed up to be
the kindergarten room parent,

84
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,310
but I think she got bashed
over the head

85
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,653
by the other dolphins.

86
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:26,221
Another option is a few pigs.

87
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,533
- Pigs? Really?
- Yeah.

88
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,511
In a week, they'll pull out
these blackberries

89
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,649
by the root and then some.

90
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,466
BERNADETTE:
Can I help you with something?

91
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,709
Oh, hi, Bernadette.

92
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,090
Um, I didn't know you were home.

93
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:36,329
Apparently.

94
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:37,582
AUDREY: Yeah. Um...

95
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:39,161
I hope you don't mind,
I called Tom.

96
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,550
He's a blackberry
abatement specialist.

97
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,728
- Oh.
- I was in my garden

98
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:43,906
cutting back the perennials

99
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,262
and planting some winter color

100
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,894
in preparation for the, uh,

101
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,738
the Galer Street brunch
that I'm hosting

102
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,605
for the prospective parents.

103
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,322
Have you been reading
the emails?

104
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,081
Not if I can help it.

105
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:57,261
Yeah. Well, the blackberry vines
are coming under the wall.

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,957
Not at all uncommon around here.

107
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,774
They get into the root system
like bamboo,

108
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,766
- super invasive.
- Yeah. Invasive.

109
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,182
We're just trying to figure out
what best to do about it.

110
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,283
Yeah, here.

111
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,262
It's Tom.

112
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,466
Bernadette Fox.

113
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,488
No card.

114
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:13,588
Oh.

115
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:15,533
I was in my compost pile
one morning,

116
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,326
and I was practically attacked.

117
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:18,988
Um, you know,
not just in my compost,

118
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,404
but, you know, it's gotten
into my raised vegetable beds,

119
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,461
my greenhouse, which you saw,
even my worm bins.

120
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:26,398
TOM: Yeah, I mean, to get rid of this
many, with this kind of slope...

121
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:28,255
Oh, and I don't want
to use anything toxic.

122
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:30,312
You know, no weed killers
or anything like that.

123
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,170
Right. And if you
don't wanna use the pigs,

124
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,468
I think I'd wanna go with, uh,

125
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,308
CXJ Hillside Side-Arm Thrasher.

126
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,581
I don't have one myself.
I'd have to rent one.

127
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:40,622
Okay, I'm happy to use Tom here

128
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,906
to remove all things blackberry.

129
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,447
I think we're done.

130
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,394
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

131
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,670
Thank you. And soon?

132
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:53,518
BERNADETTE: Any pigs will be
arrested for trespassing.

133
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:55,425
- (both chuckle)
- Jeez.

134
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,735
Dear Manjula,

135
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:01,805
something unexpected
has come up,

136
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:05,199
and I would love it
if you would work extra hours.

137
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,165
I don't know what time it is
right now in India, but please

138
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:13,934
uh, let me know ASAP
if you're available

139
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:17,165
because I need you
to work your Hindu magic

140
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,002
on a huge project. Period.

141
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:22,723
Okay, I'll stop being coy.

142
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:27,329
(sighs heavily)
It's a total disaster.

143
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:31,214
Apparently, Elgie and I
have promised Bee

144
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:33,122
a family trip to Antarctica.

145
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:37,646
And of the million reasons
I don't want to go,

146
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,661
the main one is
it will require me

147
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:42,689
to be surrounded by people.

148
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:47,437
Looks like even the smallest

149
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:51,596
cruise ship has 150
other passengers

150
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,382
which translates into me

151
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,965
being trapped
with 147 other humans

152
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,653
who will uniquely annoy
the hell out of me

153
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,735
with their rudeness, waste,

154
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,805
incessant yammering,
and boring small talk,

155
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,968
and creepy food requests.

156
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:12,716
Or worse, they'll turn
their curiosity toward me

157
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,105
and expect pleasantry in return.

158
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,177
Oh, I'm getting a panic attack
just thinking about it.

159
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,483
But a little...

160
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:23,855
social anxiety

161
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:26,529
never hurt anyone, am I right?

162
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:31,072
If I give you the contact info,

163
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:33,870
could you pretty please
take over

164
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,661
the paperwork,
visas, plane tickets,

165
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,670
and everything involved
with getting we three

166
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:40,620
from Seattle
to the White Continent?

167
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,095
Question mark.

168
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,473
Uh, and we'll need whatever's on

169
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,870
the recommended packing list.

170
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,937
Uh... just use
the same credit card.

171
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,098
Oh, yes, Manjula,
one very important thing.

172
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,350
I'd like a fishing vest.

173
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,218
You know, one replete
with the zippered pockets.

174
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,855
And apparently, I need some

175
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:02,733
blackberry bushes
in my yard removed.

176
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:04,942
(scoffs) The sooner the better.

177
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:06,958
Audrey, next door,
thinks nothing

178
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,879
of traipsing through my yard.

179
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,988
Who does that!
Exclamation point.

180
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:13,600
(dog barking) Ice Cream?

181
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,413
(door rattling)

182
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:19,598
Ice Cream?

183
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,377
(Ice Cream continues barking)

184
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,518
- Oh.
- (Ice Cream whining)

185
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:27,105
Ice Cream.

186
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:31,149
(Ice Cream continues whining)

187
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,494
How did you get in there?

188
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,350
- (phone ringing)
- Oh!

189
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:37,134
This is really inconvenient,
Ice Cream.

190
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,235
(grunts)

191
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,879
- You wait there!
- (Ice Cream whines)

192
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,881
(students chattering)

193
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:46,921
Ta-da!

194
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:49,261
AUDREY: Oh. Um...

195
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,361
(chuckles)

196
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,695
As much as I love

197
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,325
clip art hand prints...

198
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:54,822
- MINDY: Uh-huh.
- I think we need

199
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,014
to try to find an image

200
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:58,413
that better articulates success.

201
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,908
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, um,

202
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,572
- a coat of arms...
- Ooh.

203
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,431
With something in it.

204
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,573
- Like a calculator.
- Oh, that's good.

205
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:09,837
Right? Or, or diplomas.
Like a rainbow of diplomas.

206
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:10,937
Cute.

207
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,133
Maybe there's a sketch
of a brain,

208
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:15,566
and it has a cap
and gown on, right?

209
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,318
We, we just have to remember
we're trying to attract

210
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,801
the right kind
of kindergarten families.

211
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:23,681
- Okay.
- AUDREY: Thanks, Mindy.

212
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,042
Kyle! Kyle!

213
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,066
What? Not now.

214
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:30,164
Oh.

215
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,653
Yeah, I think they're going
to do homework.

216
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:35,182
(gasps) The brunch RSVPs
are pouring in.

217
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,559
There has not been one "no" yet.

218
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,297
- Really?
- Yes, and I'm counting on you

219
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:39,533
to bring those 12 chairs.

220
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,933
Well, I hope
I can find the time.

221
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:43,514
Yeah, it's chairs.
You'll find time.

222
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,255
Yeah.

223
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:53,996
Oh. Did you notice
our first lady of France

224
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:55,565
has her scarf look going?

225
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,902
I can't wait until she finds out
about my new job.

226
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,278
I seriously doubt she even knows
who you are. (Chuckles)

227
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,378
I know.

228
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,970
She's so awful.

229
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,738
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Hi, Lincoln.

230
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:10,793
Hey, Mom.

231
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,591
We are on a rescue mission.

232
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:13,691
What?

233
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:15,429
Ice Cream's stuck
in the confessional.

234
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,090
Oh. I almost forgot. Bernadette!

235
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,624
Bernadette.

236
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:20,722
(sighs)

237
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:22,317
Incoming gnat. What do we do?

238
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:23,576
Ice Cream needs us. Punch it.

239
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:24,750
Bernadette. Oh!

240
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,658
(yells) Oh!

241
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,038
Oh, my... Oh.

242
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,975
- SOO-LIN: What happened?
- Did you see that?

243
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,113
- No.
- Did you see that?

244
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:34,028
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my... Are you okay?

245
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,687
- Oh, God.
- Are you... What happened?

246
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:36,985
- Are you okay?
- I'm crying.

247
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,363
- Oh, God.
- I'm not all right!

248
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:40,014
Okay. Oh, my God.

249
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:41,378
(screaming) Ow! Oh!

250
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,629
Did you... Did she run over it?

251
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,974
Did she? Did you see?

252
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:46,786
- No.
- She ran over my foot.

253
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay, you hold it.

254
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,422
No way. She's my dog.

255
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,023
You hold the ladder. I'll go up.

256
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,123
Absolutely not, Bala.

257
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:01,826
It's too dangerous.

258
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:09,999
- (Ice Cream barks)
- Oh, shush, it's me.

259
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,693
- Such a drama queen.
- BEE: Mom!

260
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:13,057
Mom, are you okay?

261
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:16,494
- (thudding)
- (Bernadette grunting)

262
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:17,985
(Ice Cream whining)

263
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:24,365
- Oh!
- All right, Mom!

264
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,666
- Bee!
- Are you okay?

265
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,471
Ice Cream.

266
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,571
Hi.

267
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,342
You're the worst dog ever.

268
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,485
- (Bernadette pants)
- Hey, you okay?

269
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,308
Yeah. Oh.

270
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,576
This came for you.

271
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:44,481
(Bernadette exhales)

272
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,712
Congratulations.

273
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,801
(both chuckle)

274
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,169
BEE: I can't believe it.

275
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:05,870
BERNADETTE: Oh, you feel
the Microsoft motivation.

276
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,456
BEE: Let's synchronize
our watches.

277
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,234
Is that Lincoln's mom?

278
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:16,450
BERNADETTE: In Seattle,
all roads lead to Microsoft.

279
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:18,087
BEE (whispering): Mom,

280
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:19,841
look what she's watching.

281
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,782
(mockingly)
Indoctrination in progress.

282
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:27,038
ELGIE (on monitor): So thanks
to ongoing developments

283
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:28,590
in neural imaging, TEDsters,

284
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,881
say hello to Samantha 2.

285
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
(clears throat)

286
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,880
(muffled laughter)

287
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:46,786
MAN 1: That's real.

288
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,697
MAN 2: Wow. That's amazing.

289
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:54,573
(cheering and applause)

290
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,408
Yeah. That did that.

291
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,322
All right, thank you.

292
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,446
I know there's at least two
different species of penguins.

293
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:07,903
There are
seven different species

294
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,249
of penguins in Antarctica.

295
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,855
400,000 emperor penguins alone,

296
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:13,708
not including gentoos
and chinstraps.

297
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:15,605
BERNADETTE: You wanna know
the coolest part?

298
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:16,706
On the boat we're taking,

299
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,721
there's no assigned seating
in the dining room.

300
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:20,365
And they have
these tables for four,

301
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,734
which means
the three of us can sit down

302
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,110
and if we pile the extra chair
with our hats and gloves,

303
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,211
nobody can sit with us.

304
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,129
And penguins.

305
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:31,597
Wildly excited
about those penguins.

306
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,695
Okay, I wish I could hear more
about the penguins

307
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,153
continue this
celebration dinner,

308
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:37,049
but I've got
a video conference with Taipei,

309
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,707
all these people waiting
for me, so...

310
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:40,673
That's okay, Dad.
The clock is ticking.

311
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:43,393
Congratulations, Choatie.

312
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,856
Bye, honey.

313
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,684
BEE: Mom says
insomnia causes anxiety,

314
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:07,308
and anxiety causes insomnia.

315
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:10,125
She can't sleep, but she won't
take anything for it

316
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,982
because then
she doesn't feel like herself.

317
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,080
She says that should actually
be a selling point,

318
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:17,068
but she's grown accustomed
to the way she is.

319
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:18,568
Me too.

320
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,928
I love Mom just the way she is.

321
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,077
(softly) Manjula,
did you have any idea

322
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,975
that getting to Antarctica
requires crossing

323
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,149
the Drake Passage?

324
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,389
And did you know
that the Drake Passage

325
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,023
is the most
turbulent body of water

326
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,322
on the entire planet?

327
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:38,158
Well, I know 'cause I just spent

328
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:39,778
the last three hours
on the Internet.

329
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:43,437
Here's the thing.
Do you get seasick?

330
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:44,686
It's not just nausea.

331
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,149
It's nausea plus losing
the will to live.

332
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,729
Ugh, if it weren't for Bee,
I'd certainly cancel the trip.

333
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:52,898
But I can't let her down.
(sighs)

334
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:55,437
Could you please
get me something

335
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,740
really strong for seasickness?

336
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:00,801
And I don't mean Dramamine.
I mean strong!

337
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:04,621
BEE: Mom might hate Seattle,

338
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,924
but she loves
the downtown library.

339
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:09,581
I mean, yeah, of course,
the books and all that,

340
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,590
but also
the Rem Koolhaas design.

341
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,245
She says
it makes her heart race.

342
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:17,184
The good kind
of heart racing though.

343
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:21,441
WOMAN: Excuse me.

344
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,961
Excuse me. Uh... Bernadette Fox?

345
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:26,825
Yes?

346
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:28,065
Oh, my gosh. I knew it.

347
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:31,373
Uh, I was an architecture
student at USC,

348
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,230
and I visited Beeber Bifocal

349
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,966
every time they opened it
to the public.

350
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,590
Uh, Paul Jellinek
was my professor.

351
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,128
Uh, you know,
I can't believe this.

352
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,076
I was literally just watching

353
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:42,253
that, uh, video essay on you
two nights ago.

354
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,373
Video essay?

355
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:44,941
Yeah, about
the Twenty Mile House.

356
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,734
The twentieth anniversary.

357
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,653
I learned so much more
about you,

358
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:50,510
and I thought I knew everything.

359
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,610
How wonderful.

360
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,094
Um, could I get
a picture with you?

361
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:55,725
What a profile pic
that would be.

362
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:56,826
(chuckles)

363
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,399
That's okay.

364
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,422
Uh, you have given me
so much already.

365
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:03,558
I mean, the relationship
has been totally one-way,

366
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:05,456
and here I am, wanting more.
I'm very sorry.

367
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,448
Just, thank you. You have been
such an inspiration.

368
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,657
(exhales)

369
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:31,950
(instrumental music playing
on speakers)

370
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,326
FEMALE NARRATOR: The Architects
and Builders Association

371
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,465
of America recently polled

372
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,261
300 architectural
graduate students

373
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,596
and asked them which
architects they admire most.

374
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,134
The list is what
most would expect.

375
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,533
But tucked amongst
the Frank Lloyd Wrights,

376
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:44,908
Mies van der Rohes,

377
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,341
Frank Gehrys, and Lorenzo Pianos

378
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:50,349
is a woman
who is virtually unknown.

379
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:53,326
Bernadette Fox, one of
architecture's true enigmas,

380
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:56,110
is extraordinary
for many reasons.

381
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,932
She was a young woman
practicing solo

382
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:59,756
in a male-dominated profession.

383
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:02,541
The youngest architect ever
to win a MacArthur grant.

384
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,973
Her handmade furniture stands
in the permanent collection

385
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,630
of the American Folk Art Museum.

386
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,861
She's considered a pioneer
of the green building movement.

387
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,846
She dropped out of
architecture 20 years ago,

388
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,469
and has designed nothing since.

389
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,972
Alone, any of these attributes

390
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:19,148
would make
an architect noteworthy.

391
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,248
Taken together,
an icon was born.

392
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,573
I guess what struck us
about Bernadette

393
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,391
was the joy
that she took in tasks

394
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,397
that other students
would find beneath them.

395
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:34,575
NARRATOR: Fox was the most
junior member of a group

396
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,633
assigned to the Team Disney
Building in Burbank.

397
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,540
Her first job
was typical grunt work,

398
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,910
laying out bathrooms
in the executive wing.

399
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,116
I mean, she wanted to know
how often the executives

400
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,102
went to meetings,
at what time of day,

401
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,670
the ratio of men to women.

402
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,846
I finally asked her,
"What the hell are you doing?"

403
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:50,957
And she said,
"I need to know what problems"

404
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:52,576
"I'm solving with my design."

405
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,405
You know, I would like to say
that I recognized

406
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,005
the talent that would emerge.

407
00:17:57,105 --> 00:17:58,893
Although I did like the sweater

408
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,109
that she knitted for me.

409
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,317
I actually, I-I still have it.

410
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,416
Here, look.

411
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,516
Look at this.

412
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:06,605
Pretty interesting.

413
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:09,037
My wife wanted me to give it
to Goodwill, but I said,

414
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,393
"Mm-mm. I'm keeping it."

415
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,156
NARRATOR: Soon after, Fox met.

416
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:16,622
Elgin Branch,
a computer animator.

417
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,799
They married the next year,

418
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,501
and Fox wanted to build a house.

419
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:22,637
Bernadette was really fixated
on finding a piece of land

420
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:24,414
where she could design
something herself.

421
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:27,980
And I showed them
an abandoned factory,

422
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,221
and Bernadette looked around
and said,

423
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,980
"Oh, my God, this is perfect."

424
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,758
She was actually talking
about the building.

425
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,134
NARRATOR: Transforming this
industrial space into a home

426
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,192
consumed the next two years
of Fox's life.

427
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,597
She did something
akin to a miracle

428
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:45,868
with this very grim
and dark space.

429
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:47,724
She found a way to make...

430
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,625
Well, she found a way
to fill it with light.

431
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:53,292
DAVID WALKER: I remember
Bernadette had this idea

432
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,532
to knit together bifocal frames.

433
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,877
It was like, you know,

434
00:18:56,978 --> 00:19:00,622
chainmail with glasses
embedded in it.

435
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,239
JELLINEK:
The house is very feminine.

436
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,662
You walk into it,

437
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:05,037
you're absolutely overwhelmed

438
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,436
by the patience and the care

439
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,622
that went into making it.

440
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,413
It's like you're walking

441
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:12,526
into a giant hug.

442
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,584
What Bernadette was doing
was completely outside

443
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:16,526
of the mainstream,
I can tell you that.

444
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,304
NARRATOR: After Fox
and her husband moved

445
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:19,820
into the Beeber Bifocal house,

446
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,902
Fox was restless
for another project.

447
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:24,204
WALKER: Bernadette was gonna
build this house

448
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:28,813
using only materials
from within a 20-mile radius.

449
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:30,957
All the materials had
to be sourced locally.

450
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:34,574
A concrete factory in Gardenia
supplied sand,

451
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,673
which we mixed on site.

452
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,670
For steel, we used
a recycling yard in Glendale.

453
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:41,645
Anything found in a dump
was deemed okay,

454
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,430
even if it originated outside
the 20-mile radius.

455
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:48,204
Tree service provided wood,
which we milled on site.

456
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:49,822
NARRATOR: One day,
a convoy of trucks

457
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,116
pulled into the adjacent lot.

458
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,676
The property had been purchased
by Nigel Mills-Murray,

459
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,436
the TV magnate from England,

460
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,055
best known
for his smash game show...

461
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,424
You Catch It, You Keep It!

462
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,298
(tractor engine starts)

463
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:29,068
AUDREY: No, no, no, no, no.

464
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:31,201
Excuse me. Excuse me.

465
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,413
Yeah. I said I need you to focus

466
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:35,916
on the bushes in the front.

467
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,856
(conversing indistinctly)

468
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,828
I need a sign

469
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,814
made and installed

470
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,670
on the western side
of my property

471
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,684
facing the neighbor's house.

472
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,917
Make it eight feet wide
by five feet high.

473
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,861
Yep, you bet your bindi
that's how big I want it.

474
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,294
Bright yellow
with the lettering in black.

475
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,244
And it should read,
"Private property,

476
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,846
"no trespassing.

477
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:07,661
"Galer Street gnats
will be arrested and hauled off

478
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,696
to gnat jail."

479
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:12,288
And that's G-N-A-T.

480
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:15,362
Something annoying but
not worth being bothered over.

481
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,368
Oh, and put
the "gnat" part in red.

482
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Oh.

483
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,669
(gasps)
I absolutely love the vest!

484
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,173
Exclamation point.

485
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:30,496
Good job, Manjula.

486
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:34,656
(tablet chimes)

487
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:40,352
(groans)

488
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:46,840
(sighs)

489
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:48,032
Hey, you ready, Pablo?

490
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,944
Yes. And I asked Soo-Lin to
join us. She's the new admin.

491
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:54,604
Oh, good. Hey, we've been
dying here without you.

492
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:55,942
It's nice to meet you, Soo-Lin.

493
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,260
Well, actually, my son is,

494
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:59,393
um, in your daughter's class
at Galer Street.

495
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,381
Oh, right. Okay. Sorry, I...

496
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,661
- No. (Chuckles)
- Cool.

497
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,292
Okay. Yeah.

498
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:07,230
- Do you guys wanna take the shuttle?
- Yeah.

499
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,689
- Let's take the shuttle.
- Yeah.

500
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:09,788
- All right.
- Sure.

501
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:10,887
Let's shuttle it.

502
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:12,506
(whispers)
I don't remember anything.

503
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,636
Can I help you?

504
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,910
Oh. You have a Chihuly.

505
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,609
Chihuly?

506
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,834
Yeah. No, the chandelier.

507
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:28,992
It's by Dale Chihuly.

508
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,224
You know, the glass guy.

509
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:34,025
Oh.

510
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,414
I was gonna say we don't have

511
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:36,704
anything under that name.

512
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,144
Try Bernadette Fox.

513
00:22:38,912 --> 00:22:39,969
(clears throat)

514
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:42,943
One moment.

515
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,130
(whispers) Miss Fox is here.

516
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:51,243
Looks like this is
a two-man job.

517
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,589
Miss Fox,

518
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,861
are you aware
your prescription is for ABHR?

519
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:55,961
Mm-hmm.

520
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,901
ABHR is basically Haldol

521
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,999
with some Benadryl, Reglan,
and Ativan thrown in.

522
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:01,133
Sounds good to me.

523
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:02,924
Haldol is an antipsychotic.

524
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:04,622
It was used
in the Soviet prison system

525
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:05,759
to break prisoners' wills.

526
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,596
Yeah, I'm only
discovering it now.

527
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,421
It has some
serious side effects.

528
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,181
Tardive dyskinesia
being the worst.

529
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,292
Tardive dyskinesia
is characterized by

530
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,107
uncontrollable grimacing,
tongue protrusion,

531
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,357
lip smacking.

532
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,295
I guess a couple of hours
of that sounds like

533
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:21,152
a day at the beach
compared to seasickness.

534
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:23,776
Tardive dyskinesia
can last forever.

535
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,080
Forever?

536
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,614
That's... that's a spell.

537
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:32,310
MAN: The likelihood of tardive
dyskinesia is about four percent.

538
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,701
That increases to ten percent
in older women.

539
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,334
Of course it does.

540
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:38,670
So I spoke
to your regular doctor.

541
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,142
He wrote you a prescription

542
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,000
for a scopolamine patch
for motion sickness

543
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:43,232
and Xanax for anxiety.

544
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,917
No, I think I might have
some Xanax at home.

545
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:49,549
D-Do you have, um,

546
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,565
a... some kind
of laminated chart,

547
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,981
you know, that shows what all
the little pills look like?

548
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,365
It's just that I poured
all of my prescriptions

549
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:57,773
into this antique jelly jar.

550
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,951
I mean, the colors and shapes
are amazing together.

551
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,039
But then of course
I realized that they...

552
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:04,512
Well, you get it.

553
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,808
Right.

554
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:11,497
Fine.

555
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:15,041
Just give me the Xanax
and the patch thingy.

556
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:48,608
(snoring)

557
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:57,697
(softly) Bernadette.

558
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:03,785
Bernadette.

559
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:05,673
Hey.

560
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:07,489
Um, what are you doing?

561
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,536
BERNADETTE: Elgie.

562
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,340
Oh, they wouldn't
give me... Haldol,

563
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:16,993
so I had to wait for Xanax.

564
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:19,088
- What are you wearing?
- BERNADETTE: Uh?

565
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,248
Oh, this.

566
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,096
Yeah. Got it off the Internet.

567
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,901
Can you sit up, please?

568
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh.

569
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,125
(Bernadette clears throat)

570
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,741
You know, I've got
a lunch right now.

571
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,279
- Mm-hmm.
- Do I need to cancel it?

572
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
- Oh, God, no! No!
- No?

573
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,155
I just didn't sleep
very well last night,

574
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,256
so I just dozed off.

575
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:38,605
Go. Do. Be.

576
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,704
ELGIE: Okay.

577
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:43,373
I'll see you at home later.

578
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:45,190
Hey, do you want to go
for dinner tonight?

579
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:47,724
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
Buzz and I will pick a place.

580
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:50,175
Hey, how about just me and you?

581
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,376
- Yeah.
- (chuckles) Okay.

582
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,599
(indistinct chatter)

583
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:04,065
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Buzzy.

584
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,628
Audrey asked me
to give you this.

585
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:12,848
It's an emergency room bill.

586
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,028
Ran over her foot?

587
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:19,501
I know. If you look down there,

588
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,558
they didn't actually find
anything broken, so...

589
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,277
Obviously.
'Cause it didn't happen.

590
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,545
(sighs)

591
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,020
- (playing flute)
- Wait a second.

592
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:32,493
That's not your flute.

593
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,156
It's a Shakuhachi.

594
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:36,653
Mr. Hayes lent it to me
for World Celebration Day.

595
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:37,998
Oh, you're performing?

596
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,486
Not exactly. I'm accompanying
the first graders.

597
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,597
- Uh-huh.
- They're singing for their parents,

598
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:46,797
and Mr. Hayes got me
to put together

599
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,332
a little elephant dance
for them.

600
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,443
Elephant dance?
You little rotter.

601
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:52,941
You've, you've choreographed
a dance for the first graders?

602
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,157
That's a big deal, Bee.

603
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:55,469
Can I come?

604
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:56,846
No, you wouldn't like it.

605
00:26:56,945 --> 00:26:58,124
The words are way too cute.

606
00:26:58,223 --> 00:27:00,652
You might die of cuteness.

607
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,230
Yeah, well,
I wanna die of cuteness.

608
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,049
It's my favorite thing
to die of cuteness.

609
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,840
Can I go
to Kennedy's house tonight?

610
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:09,483
Will her mother be there?

611
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:10,584
No.

612
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:13,325
Okay. That's okay then.

613
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,265
So about this afternoon...

614
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,888
Oh, yeah. Was that one
of the gnats you were with?

615
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,012
From Galer Street?

616
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:21,670
Soo-Lin is my new admin
and apparently

617
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,446
she does have a son
in Bee's class. Yeah.

618
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,325
(scoffs) Oh, boy.

619
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,531
- What?
- (sighs deeply)

620
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:28,748
It's all over for me.

621
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,413
What is all over?

622
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:31,949
(sighs) Oh, just watch.

623
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:34,444
I mean, that one
will turn you against me.

624
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:36,333
(chuckling) Oh, come on.

625
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:39,243
Audrey and her flying monkeys
have always hated me.

626
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:41,540
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Nobody hates you, Bernadette.

627
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:42,641
(sighs)

628
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:46,528
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

629
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:50,924
I was curious about the medicine

630
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:53,133
that they wouldn't fill
for you at the pharmacy.

631
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:54,400
Oh, I know.

632
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:58,221
This doctor wrote me
a prescription.

633
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,404
It turned out to be Haldol.

634
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:00,505
Ugh.

635
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,375
I had no idea.

636
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,500
Is that for sleep?

637
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,261
Sleep? What's that?

638
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:06,604
(sighs in exasperation)

639
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,833
Honey, that's no good.

640
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,340
And how'd you get
the prescription?

641
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,703
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

642
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:14,247
No.

643
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,246
Do you wanna see a psychiatrist?

644
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:18,571
God, no.

645
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:19,672
No.

646
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:21,869
I'm just anxious about the trip.

647
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,492
Really? What specifically
are you anxious about?

648
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:26,029
(exhales heavily)

649
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,012
Uh, the Drake Passage, people,

650
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:30,892
little towels folded
into animal shapes

651
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,365
that might be left on our beds.

652
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,701
- You know how it is.
- Actually, I don't think I do.

653
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,576
Elgie, there's gonna be
a lot of people.

654
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,923
You know...

655
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:41,644
I'm not good
when exposed to people.

656
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:42,743
Yeah.

657
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:47,342
I don't know. I think maybe
we need to revisit this idea

658
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,153
of finding someone
for you to talk to.

659
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:52,032
I'm talking to you, aren't I?

660
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:55,552
(slurping)

661
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,106

(song continues playing)

680
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:18,471
See?

681
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:20,718
Mom, this is why
I don't want you

682
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,016
to come to the elephant dance.

683
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,393
(chuckles, sniffles)

684
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:27,135
Yeah. (Sniffles)

685
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,288
I just need you to know how
hard it is for me sometimes.

686
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:35,361
What's hard?

687
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,059
(sighs)

688
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,743
The banality of life.

689
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:43,627
But I retain the right
to be incredibly moved

690
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,536
by those little things
no one notices.

691
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,101
(exhales) For better and worse.

692
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:52,108
It's not gonna stop me
taking you to the South Pole.

693
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:53,517
(sighs)

694
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:55,840
(chuckling) We're not going
to the South Pole, Mom.

695
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:58,060
- We're not?
- No!

696
00:30:58,161 --> 00:31:01,612
The only place tourists go
is the Antarctic Peninsula.

697
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:04,204
Only researchers
and scientists go

698
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:05,729
as far as the South Pole.

699
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:09,355
- Oh.
- Please tell me you knew that

700
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:12,780
and you just forgot
because you're tired.

701
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:14,144
Yeah, tired.

702
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,480
And ignorant.

703
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,155
(indistinct chatter)

704
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:27,519
I'll take some more.

705
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,151
AUDREY: Lisa!
Will you excuse me?

706
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,250
Oh!

707
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,516
I'm so glad you came.

708
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:35,404
- Audrey! It's fabulous.
- Hi!

709
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:37,132
Thank you so much for coming.
Hi, Gary!

710
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,019
- GARY: Hi.
- There's food. There's drink.

711
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,478
You probably know
everybody here.

712
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:41,737
- Fabulous.
- (laughs) Okay.

713
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:58,220
Did you know that one
of our first-grade dads

714
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,596
is in Pearl Jam?

715
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:01,310
- Eddie?
- No.

716
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,893
The point is I just started

717
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,750
and all of a sudden
it's my responsibility

718
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,807
to make sure everything runs
smoothly while he's off-grid?

719
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:15,470
That's Jeff Bezos'
brother-in-law.

720
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:16,887
- Really? (Gasps softly)
- Yeah.

721
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:18,746
I'm starting to see
a lot of empty glasses.

722
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:19,846
Crusts and stuff.

723
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:24,297
(sighs)

724
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,977
Kyle has been such a big help.

725
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,036
Would you guys mind moving
to the other side of the room?

726
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:42,828
Right in here.
I'm so sorry. Yes.

727
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:45,326
I thought here would be nice.
It's kind of like a little...

728
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,063
- Okay.
- MR. HAYES: Let's all face out.

729
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,000
- AUDREY: Come on in.
- MR. HAYES: All right.

730
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,099
(music playing)

731
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,980
One, two, three, four.

732
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,935
(children singing in Swahili)

733
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:07,372
I love this song. Is it African?

734
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:09,548
- Yeah, it's a Kenyan pop song.
- Oh.

735
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:10,926
Galer Street's mission statement

736
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,684
is based on global connectitude.

737
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,752
- Connectitude? Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

738
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,869
Galer Street doesn't just
think outside the box.

739
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,565
They think outside
the dictionary.

740
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,057
(chuckles)

741
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:24,865
(children continue singing)

742
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,153
(Mr. Hayes singing along)

743
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:43,392
(all screaming)

744
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:49,121
(Audrey gasping)

745
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:51,615
MAN: Find Susie!

746
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,468
MR. HAYES: Get on the bus.
It's okay. We're all okay.

747
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:00,640
AUDREY: I'm so sorry.

748
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,009
Thank you for coming!

749
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:05,963
It's the rains, you see.
The rains here...

750
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:08,063
Do you wanna take a gift bag?
There you go.

751
00:34:37,983 --> 00:34:39,382
Oh, no!

752
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:45,005
Your hillside
just slid into my home.

753
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:46,476
During my brunch.

754
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:47,733
There were children in there!

755
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:48,833
shooot.

756
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,541
(stammers) W-Was anyone hurt?

757
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:51,980
Miraculously, no.

758
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,963
(sighs) Okay, that's good.
That's...

759
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:56,264
Good? Good?

760
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,052
My house is knee-deep
in mud, Bernadette.

761
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:00,621
The brick wall collapsed.

762
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:01,721
My yard.

763
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,052
My Japanese maples.

764
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,547
The birdbath is practically
in my living room.

765
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:07,596
I am so sorry. I...

766
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:08,896
And that sign.

767
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,713
- (sighs) The sign.
- What sign?

768
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:13,708
I'll have it taken down today.

769
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,804
Oh, well, the mudslide
took care of that for you.

770
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,543
It's on display now
for everyone to see!

771
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:18,956
- Mom, what sign?
- Oh, Bee,

772
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,974
I did something really stupid.
Stay in the car.

773
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,592
What kind of person
puts up a sign...

774
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:23,971
Look, I will pay for everything.

775
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,108
Money? That's what you think
this is about? Money?

776
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,045
- Mom, what is going on?
- BERNADETTE: Bee...

777
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:29,583
Tell her!
Tell her what's going on!

778
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:31,400
- You're obviously emotional.
- Yes, I am!

779
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,501
But you need to remember

780
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,237
that the work I had done
on the hillside

781
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:35,614
- was at your insistence.
- Oh!

782
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,512
Audrey, I used your guy,
and I had him do it

783
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:38,851
on the day you specified, so...

784
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:41,003
So none of this
is your responsibility?

785
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,307
No, I am simply making the point

786
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,079
that there's a larger context
to what happened today.

787
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,719
Wow. Okay.

788
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,068
So you think putting up
a hateful billboard

789
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:56,300
is an appropriate reaction
to having yard work done.

790
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,547
BERNADETTE: No.

791
00:35:57,648 --> 00:35:59,565
I think I'm starting
to understand all of this.

792
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,182
Audrey, don't stand there
and pretend

793
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:02,880
you haven't been playing
this game too.

794
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,737
Bernadette, j-just get out
once in a while.

795
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:06,956
B-Be in the real world
and interact with people.

796
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:08,773
Maybe that would make you
not so paranoid.

797
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:10,871
- I think we're done here.
- No, we are not done.

798
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,329
We are not,
we are not done here.

799
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:14,068
Again, I want to apologize
for the sign.

800
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:15,365
It was a little inappropriate.

801
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,708
And I intend to take
full responsibility, okay?

802
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,757
In terms of
the Galer Street School,

803
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:21,773
- in terms of money.
- So now you care about...

804
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:23,271
You don't care
about Galer Street.

805
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,748
You don't care about anything.

806
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,572
You don't care about your house.

807
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:28,108
You don't care about your yard.

808
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,206
You certainly don't care
about this neighborhood.

809
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:31,306
(Bernadette scoffs)

810
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:33,123
Do you know that
within a four-mile radius

811
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:34,820
is the house my grandmother
grew up in,

812
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,157
the house my mother grew up in,

813
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:37,536
and the house that I grew up in?

814
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:38,635
That I believe.

815
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:41,003
And you come in here
with your Microsoft money

816
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:44,043
and buy this
9,000-square-foot teardown

817
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:45,963
in the middle
of this charming neighborhood

818
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:47,824
and you think
that's gonna make you belong?

819
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:50,061
Well, you don't belong,
Bernadette,

820
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,161
and you never will.

821
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,079
Say amen to that.

822
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:56,813
(grunts, breathing heavily)

823
00:36:56,913 --> 00:36:58,829
None of the other mothers
like you, Bernadette.

824
00:36:58,929 --> 00:36:59,929
Did you know that?

825
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,067
- Really?
- AUDREY: Yeah!

826
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,284
Did you know a bunch of moms

827
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:03,623
had a mother-daughter sleepover

828
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,163
and didn't even
invite you and Bee?

829
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,949
Okay, that's it, Audrey!

830
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:09,048
(car door opens)

831
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,403
flap you
for bringing Bee into this!

832
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,708
No. Don't you do this.
We love Bee.

833
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:16,621
Bee is a terrific girl.
She-She's a wonderful student.

834
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:19,211
In fact, it just goes to show
how resilient children are

835
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:20,550
because she turned out so well.

836
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,219
- (exhales)
- If Bee were my daughter,

837
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,755
and I think I speak on behalf

838
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:25,612
of every mother at Galer Street,

839
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,873
we would never be sending
her off to boarding school.

840
00:37:28,255 --> 00:37:29,612
I want to go to boarding school.

841
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:30,751
Of course you do, sweetie.

842
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:32,012
It was my idea!

843
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,739
No, Bee, it's not worth it.

844
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,724
Of course it was your idea.
I don't blame you.

845
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:38,092
You don't know me.
And you don't know my mom.

846
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:39,532
Oh, I do. I do know your mom.

847
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,036
I know her now. Everybody does.

848
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,563
You don't even know
your own son, Audrey.

849
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,983
If you did, you'd know how
he makes fun of you at school.

850
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:49,759
Do you even notice
when he comes home stoned?

851
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:52,831
I agree with my mom.

852
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,423
flap you, Audrey.

853
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,079
Hey.

854
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:06,047
You are super cool,
you know that?

855
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,894
Like we'd ever want to be
at a sleepover with them.

856
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:12,813
(mumbles)

857
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,592
Yeah. Popularity is overrated.

858
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:19,943
(engine starts)

859
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:26,188
(soft music playing)

860
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:29,228
So we will put
these Sharpies next to it

861
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,726
and while
the restaurant revolves,

862
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:32,224
everyone can write
something on it

863
00:38:32,324 --> 00:38:33,802
and when it
comes back around later,

864
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:35,661
you'll have a card
full of birthday wishes.

865
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,217
BEE: That's so cool, Kennedy.

866
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,083
I heard if you go
to the bathroom,

867
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,023
when you come back
you can't find your table.

868
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:42,815
Let's go to the bathroom.

869
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:49,612
- Oh, hey, Kennedy.
- KENNEDY: Hi.

870
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:50,711
Bee.

871
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:52,289
BERNADETTE: Oh, hey.

872
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,507
Denver trip got canceled?

873
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:56,141
Nope. I'm on my way
to the airport.

874
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,367
I just, uh, stopped
to ask you something.

875
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,710
What?

876
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,661
Those blackberries
were the only thing

877
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,360
holding up the hillside.
You knew that.

878
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:08,364
I know you know better

879
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,668
than to denude
an entire hillside

880
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,512
during the wettest winter
on record.

881
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:16,385
(chuckles) I guess
I didn't actually.

882
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:19,211
How did you find out?

883
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:21,420
H-How did you think
I wouldn't find out?

884
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:22,655
Let me guess.

885
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,972
Your admin,
one of Audrey's mean girls,

886
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,880
is pouring poison in your ears.

887
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,264
I called it.

888
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:30,092
Keep Soo-Lin out of this.

889
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:31,885
She's the only reason
it's even feasible

890
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:33,409
for me to go away for a month.

891
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:36,362
- If you're interested in the truth...
- Mm-hmm.

892
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:38,157
I had those blackberries removed

893
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,202
in accordance
with the specifications

894
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:41,452
of Bugs Meany herself.

895
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:45,708
Stop turning everything
into a joke.

896
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:49,311
I look at you
and I have real concern.

897
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,947
You won't talk to me.
You won't go to a doctor.

898
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:55,597
- You won't...
- Dad... stop freaking out.

899
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,760
Stop freaking out?
The Griffins' house caved in.

900
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,447
(sighs)

901
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,219
Is this, um, something
we're gonna have to pay for?

902
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,958
It's force majeure.
Audrey's insurance covers it.

903
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:07,403
Why didn't you tell me, Bee?

904
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:10,753
I... I guess you haven't
been around that much.

905
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,679
Hmm.

906
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,271
Look how far
my birthday card is.

907
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,903
Take your Ritalin and shut up.

908
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:18,445
I'm sorry... Wha... Excu...
what did you just say?

909
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,900
- That's not the way that we talk to
people.
- It's okay.

910
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,356
- That's how they talk to each other.
- No, it's not okay.

911
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:24,456
Why do you care?

912
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,673
You don't even like Kennedy.

913
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:26,773
(Bernadette chuckles)

914
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:27,873
He doesn't?

915
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:28,972
(stammers) No, of cour...

916
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,925
of course I like you, Kennedy.

917
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,702
Wha... How can you say
a thing like that?

918
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:34,599
What is going on
with this family right now?

919
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,376
I just stopped by
to have a conversation.

920
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,476
No, you didn't.

921
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:39,788
You came here to yell at Mom.
Audrey already did that.

922
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,568
- BERNADETTE: Hey...
- You weren't there.

923
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:43,550
It was horrible.

924
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:45,344
(sighs)

925
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,648
Come on.

926
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:58,795
What was the question
you wanted to ask me?

927
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,894
Why can't you ever get along
with our neighbors?

928
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:05,199
Why can't you ever
get along with anyone?

929
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:07,456
It can't always be their fault.

930
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:23,262
BERNADETTE: Well, Manjula,

931
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,643
nobody can say I didn't give it

932
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:28,032
the old college try
but I just...

933
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,797
(exhales heavily)

934
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:32,449
I can't go to Antarctica.

935
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,643
Fear not. I have concocted
a gutless plan

936
00:41:41,744 --> 00:41:43,168
which should do the trick.

937
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:46,349
My dentist has been
wanting to remove

938
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,702
my wisdom teeth for years.

939
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,074
So, bear with me,

940
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:54,125
how about we call her up

941
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:56,320
and get an appointment
right before the trip?

942
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:59,467
That way, I can claim
it was an emergency

943
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,452
and I'm devastated and all that

944
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,869
and my husband and daughter
can go on the trip themselves

945
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:05,088
and nobody blames me.

946
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:06,592
(sighs) Yep.

947
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,150
Told you it was gutless.

948
00:42:12,224 --> 00:42:14,112
- Send message.
- (tablet chimes)

949
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:20,320
Bernadette!

950
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:23,851
Paul Jellinek!

951
00:42:23,952 --> 00:42:25,228
Look at you.

952
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,402
You old rotter. (Gasps)

953
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,579
My God, you haven't changed
in 20 years!

954
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,469
- (laughs)
- So good to see you!

955
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:33,740
- How was the lecture?
- It was fine. Fine.

956
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,661
It was just an excuse
to come visit you.

957
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,992
(both laugh)

958
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,608
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

959
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,784
(keyboard clacking)

960
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:47,179
(door opens)

961
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,175
Elgie, this is Dr. Kurtz.

962
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,590
Oh, hi.

963
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:53,157
Hi.

964
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,050
- Janelle Kurtz.
- Elgie Branch.

965
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,971
Thank you so much
for accommodating us.

966
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,692
We are really glad
you could come in.

967
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,150
And Hannah spoke
so highly of you

968
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,887
and all the work
that you did with Frank

969
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:04,708
to help him through
his rough patch, so...

970
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:05,989
I'll leave you two.

971
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:07,088
Okay.

972
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:08,255
- Um...
- (door opens)

973
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,476
(clicks tongue)

974
00:43:10,577 --> 00:43:12,574
What have you been doing
in Seattle for 20 years?

975
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,396
Well, I guess I just wanted
to leave LA in a snit,

976
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:17,733
you know, and when I determined

977
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:20,204
that everyone felt
sufficiently sorry for me,

978
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:22,922
unfurl my cape and swoop in
to launch my second act

979
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:24,639
and show those bastards
who the true...

980
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,019
bitch goddess
of architecture really is.

981
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,856
- (both chuckle)
- But then, yeah...

982
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:33,869
Elgie ended up loving it here,
and, yeah, here we are.

983
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:36,268
To my surprise,
she got really excited

984
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:37,547
about moving to Seattle.

985
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,050
We were both
from the East Coast,

986
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,300
both went to prep schools.

987
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,235
And she was a rising star.
An absolute force.

988
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:46,699
Of course,
I was taken by her beauty

989
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,298
and her amazing talent

990
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:50,527
and her humor and her energy.

991
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:53,773
And at the time
that we got married,

992
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:55,755
I was working on
a computer animation program

993
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:58,719
which was eventually
bought by Microsoft.

994
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:03,135
And around the same time, uh...

995
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:07,148
she ran into some trouble
with a house that she built

996
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:11,211
and abruptly
declared herself done

997
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,036
with the LA architecture scene.

998
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:14,559
The city planners here.

999
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,539
I mean, they never met
a beautiful view

1000
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:17,639
they didn't want to block

1001
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:18,936
with a 20-story old folks home

1002
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:21,228
with zero
architectural integrity.

1003
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:22,476
And believe me, that is

1004
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,413
the first time that
the words "architectural"

1005
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:26,309
and "integrity" have ever
been used together

1006
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:27,532
in a sentence about Seattle.

1007
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,163
And whoever
laid out this place...

1008
00:44:29,262 --> 00:44:31,179
I mean, they never met
a two-way street

1009
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,068
they didn't suddenly,
and for no reason,

1010
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:34,606
want to turn into
a one-way street.

1011
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:36,262
They never met
a four-way intersection

1012
00:44:36,362 --> 00:44:38,559
they didn't want to turn
into a five-way intersection.

1013
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:40,137
Paul, I swear to God,
they even have

1014
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:41,514
seven-way intersections up here.

1015
00:44:41,614 --> 00:44:43,947
All of the energy
that she once channeled

1016
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:46,463
so fearlessly
into architecture...

1017
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,760
she seems to have
turned towards...

1018
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:53,869
fulminating about Seattle

1019
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:57,835
in the form of these wild rants.

1020
00:44:57,936 --> 00:45:00,106
BERNADETTE: I bought a house
the second we got here.

1021
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:03,851
(chuckles) It was this crazy
reform school for girls,

1022
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,701
you know, with every conceivable
building restriction attached.

1023
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,682
I mean, to make something
of it would require.

1024
00:45:08,782 --> 00:45:10,315
Harry Houdini ingenuity,

1025
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,653
which of course appealed to me,

1026
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,431
- but... (clears throat)
- JELLINEK: Mmm.

1027
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:16,170
What, you know,
actually happened

1028
00:45:16,271 --> 00:45:17,628
was that I had
a series of, uh...

1029
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:19,242
I had four miscarriages and...

1030
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,003
'Cause, no,
I fully intended to recover

1031
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:23,019
from the ass whooping
of Twenty Mile

1032
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,907
by making a home
for Elgie and me

1033
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:27,596
and the baby
I was always pregnant with,

1034
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:28,695
but, you know...

1035
00:45:29,663 --> 00:45:31,101
I'd sit on the toilet
and look down

1036
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,291
and there it was,
blood on my underpants.

1037
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,275
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry, Bernadette.

1038
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,813
- No, no, no.
- I just didn't know.

1039
00:45:36,913 --> 00:45:38,271
Hey, (clicks tongue)
Bee arrived.

1040
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,452
But, you know, her heart, um,

1041
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:43,211
hadn't developed completely

1042
00:45:43,311 --> 00:45:45,132
and, you know,
it needed to be rebuilt

1043
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:47,211
in a series of, um, operations,

1044
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,068
'cause, you know,
her chances for survival,

1045
00:45:49,168 --> 00:45:50,208
they were minuscule.

1046
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,043
Especially back then.

1047
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:54,827
You'd think
that having a sick child

1048
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:56,684
would either bring
a husband and wife

1049
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:58,623
closer together
or tear them apart.

1050
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:02,527
But in our case,
it didn't do either.

1051
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,083
We just started... drifting.

1052
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,940
The nurses took this.

1053
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,699
(chuckles)
You know, they do that

1054
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:12,364
when they don't think the...

1055
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:14,079
the baby will...

1056
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:16,907
JELLINEK: Aw, look at her.

1057
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,007
Mmm.

1058
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,215
When I first saw Bee, I just...

1059
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,467
I knew that she was other

1060
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,451
and that she'd been
entrusted to me.

1061
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,519
Do you know those posters
of baby Krishna?

1062
00:46:27,903 --> 00:46:29,226
- The Balakrishna.
- Right.

1063
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:30,525
The creator and the destroyer,

1064
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,331
and he's fat and happy and blue?

1065
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:35,851
Well, that's what Bee was,
the creator and destroyer.

1066
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:37,036
JELLINEK: Oh, yeah.

1067
00:46:37,137 --> 00:46:39,083
I mean, come on,
it's just obvious. Right?

1068
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:41,579
So I said to the nurses,

1069
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,500
"She's not gonna die.
She's Balakrishna."

1070
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,003
(both chuckle)

1071
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:47,420
And they actually put that name
on the birth certificate.

1072
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:48,519
(laughs)

1073
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:50,539
And, so, yeah,
I asked to be left alone

1074
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:51,949
with my daughter.

1075
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:54,378
And, well,
Elgie once gave me this locket

1076
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,202
of Saint Bernadette.

1077
00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:57,708
(stammers) You know...

1078
00:46:57,807 --> 00:46:59,726
- She had 18 visions, right?
- JELLINEK: Right.

1079
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:01,342
And he always said
the Beeber Bifocal

1080
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,161
and Twenty Mile were
my first two visions.

1081
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,490
And so I leaned in and I said

1082
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,989
to my beautiful
little blue guppy,

1083
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:08,244
(voice breaking) I said,
"You are my other 16 visions

1084
00:47:08,344 --> 00:47:09,344
all rolled into one."

1085
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:11,239
And she is.

1086
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:13,356
And now, I blinked,

1087
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:14,853
and she's going
across the country

1088
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:15,954
to boarding school.

1089
00:47:16,052 --> 00:47:17,052
(sighs)

1090
00:47:17,215 --> 00:47:18,891
She just immersed herself

1091
00:47:18,992 --> 00:47:21,226
so thoroughly in Bee's recovery

1092
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:23,135
that it became her every fiber.

1093
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:25,157
And...

1094
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,940
I worked longer
and longer hours.

1095
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:30,110
Called it a partnership.

1096
00:47:30,686 --> 00:47:33,708
I'm surprised to hear that
she isn't in therapy.

1097
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:36,172
That seems like
a logical first step.

1098
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:38,539
Mmm. I tried that.
Didn't go so well.

1099
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,248
I asked her again
recently. Um...

1100
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,871
Didn't go so well.

1101
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:46,731
You know,
what Elgie doesn't know

1102
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,643
is that I am still obsessing
about LA.

1103
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,262
- What do you mean?
- (clicks tongue)

1104
00:47:51,362 --> 00:47:52,362
(sighs)

1105
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:56,394
You know, just last night,
right, I woke up to pee.

1106
00:47:56,494 --> 00:47:58,331
You know, I'm half asleep.
I'm a blank slate.

1107
00:47:58,431 --> 00:48:01,068
And then the data
starts reloading.

1108
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:03,179
Bernadette Fox,
Twenty Mile House,

1109
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,186
destroyed, failure.

1110
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:08,403
You know, it's like failure
has got its teeth in me,

1111
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:09,541
and it won't stop shaking.

1112
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,398
And then I accidentally
see that cheesebag.

1113
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:12,498
Nigel Mills-Murray's name

1114
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:13,996
on one of his dumb TV shows,

1115
00:48:14,096 --> 00:48:15,851
and I go nuts inside.

1116
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:18,380
You know, and it just adds to
my bottomless, churning shame

1117
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,715
that I have become
so demented and dishonest

1118
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,532
that I'm a stranger
to the most brilliant,

1119
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:23,831
honorable man I have ever met.

1120
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:26,315
I technically have no idea
what's wrong with Bernadette.

1121
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:28,458
Is she depressed?
Manic? Agoraphobic?

1122
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,507
Hooked on pills?
Paranoid? I don't know.

1123
00:48:30,606 --> 00:48:32,284
I really don't even know
what constitutes

1124
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:33,708
a mental breakdown,

1125
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:35,166
but what has become
crystal clear

1126
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:37,644
is that ignoring it
is no longer an option.

1127
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:39,621
So I'm lying in bed
in the middle of the night

1128
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:41,099
when the thumping arrives.

1129
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,978
It's this black hole
of visceral panic.

1130
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,315
Oh, it was something ridiculous
like, you know,

1131
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,652
"I've got to pack more
fresh fruit in Bee's lunch."

1132
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:50,028
(Jellinek laughs)

1133
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,331
And I can feel
this irrational anxiety

1134
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:54,155
draining my store of energy

1135
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:56,458
like a battery-operated race car

1136
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,731
grinding away in the corner.

1137
00:48:58,831 --> 00:49:00,867
There go the dishes.
There goes the grocery store.

1138
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:02,666
There goes exercise.

1139
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:04,490
There goes basic human kindness.

1140
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,027
So from what you're saying,

1141
00:49:06,128 --> 00:49:08,012
she willfully created
an environment

1142
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,206
which destroyed
a neighbor's home.

1143
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,748
She's hoarding
prescription medicine.

1144
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:14,507
She ran over a mother at school,

1145
00:49:14,606 --> 00:49:16,427
and then had a billboard
erected outside

1146
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:18,143
this woman's home to taunt her?

1147
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:22,110
(sighs) It seems
she may be suffering from

1148
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:26,143
extreme anxiety, grandiosity,

1149
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:30,123
and if hoarding
prescription medication

1150
00:49:30,224 --> 00:49:31,775
means what I think it means...

1151
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:36,606
she may well be having
suicidal thoughts.

1152
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:40,106
(sighs)

1153
00:49:40,206 --> 00:49:42,208
So what do you say?

1154
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:46,059
(in Irish accent) 'Tis
a piteous fate to have befallen

1155
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:48,202
a MacArthur genius,
wouldn't you say?

1156
00:49:48,302 --> 00:49:49,695
(Jellinek chuckles)

1157
00:49:50,173 --> 00:49:51,454
You done?

1158
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:52,811
(normal accent) Yeah.

1159
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:54,474
Yeah, good, 'cause I know

1160
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,907
you can't honestly believe
any of this nonsense.

1161
00:49:57,007 --> 00:50:00,318
As amusing as it is,
it obscures the larger point

1162
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:04,606
which is that people like you
must create.

1163
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,789
That's what you were brought
into this world

1164
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:07,967
to do, Bernadette.

1165
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:11,391
If you don't, you become
a menace to society.

1166
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,739
I think there's one
very simple answer

1167
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:15,166
to all of your problems.

1168
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:17,952
Get your ass back to work

1169
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:19,936
and create something.

1170
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:25,114
ELGIE: So let's just
divide and conquer

1171
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:26,612
with approximate
nearest neighbors

1172
00:50:26,713 --> 00:50:29,119
and restrict it
to nearby matches.

1173
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:31,947
It's gonna minimize
about 90 percent

1174
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:33,407
of the computation time,
I think.

1175
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,755
PABLO:
That's super elegant, man.

1176
00:50:35,856 --> 00:50:37,706
Pablo, are you almost done?

1177
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:38,806
Yeah.

1178
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:39,905
- Thanks, Elgie.
- Okay.

1179
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:50,572
Elgie, this is Agent Strang

1180
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,588
with the FBI.

1181
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:54,175
- Oh. Hi.
- Hey.

1182
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,907
- Hello, Mr. Branch.
- Hi.

1183
00:50:57,007 --> 00:50:59,659
I'm the regional director of the
Internet Crime Complaint Center.

1184
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:00,759
IC3.

1185
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,795
Working in partnership with the.

1186
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,175
Department of Homeland Security.

1187
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:05,639
Wow.

1188
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:06,967
Let's have a seat.

1189
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,067
Thank you.

1190
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:14,463
Mr. Branch, you've come
to our attention.

1191
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:16,554
I have?

1192
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:20,894
Yep. Because of a charge
on your credit card.

1193
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:25,248
This is my credit card bill?

1194
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:27,692
These are charges
to a company called.

1195
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:29,675
Delhi Virtual Assistants
International.

1196
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:31,626
I see. Yes, I can see.

1197
00:51:31,726 --> 00:51:33,708
- Wow.
- STRANG: That company does not exist.

1198
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:35,306
It's a front

1199
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:37,407
for a crime syndicate
working out of Russia.

1200
00:51:37,853 --> 00:51:39,083
ELGIE: Really?

1201
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:40,420
We've spent the last six months

1202
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:41,679
building a case against them.

1203
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,851
We were granted a warrant

1204
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:47,146
which allowed us to access
emails between your wife,

1205
00:51:47,246 --> 00:51:48,702
Bernadette Fox,

1206
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:50,974
and one Manjula.

1207
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,847
(smacks lips)
There is no Manjula.

1208
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,411
This matter
is delicate and urgent.

1209
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,702
Elgie, we have
to call Dr. Kurtz.

1210
00:52:04,702 --> 00:52:07,702
(flute playing)

1211
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:13,835

1212
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:17,804

(audience cheering
and applauding)

1217
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:55,818
BEE: Not too long ago,
scientists sent

1218
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:57,706
these invisible cosmic rays

1219
00:52:57,806 --> 00:52:59,164
through the Great Pyramid
of Giza

1220
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:00,331
to see what was inside,

1221
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:02,731
and they found
this big empty space

1222
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:04,972
they never even knew about.

1223
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:06,572
They don't know how it was made

1224
00:53:06,672 --> 00:53:09,675
or even why
this inner chamber exists,

1225
00:53:09,775 --> 00:53:11,413
even though the pyramids
have been there

1226
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:13,309
for over 4,000 years.

1227
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,514
Only use "I feel" statements.

1228
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,179
We don't want her
to feel judged.

1229
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,226
I don't know if I can do this.

1230
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:23,114
I know this
can feel uncomfortable...

1231
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:24,233
(sighs)

1232
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,251
but we all share the same goal,

1233
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:27,882
which is to help Bernadette.

1234
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:29,119
Right. (Clears throat)

1235
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,079
Right.

1236
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:33,610
And she does need help.

1237
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,710
SOO-LIN: Absolutely.

1238
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,007
RECEPTIONIST: You're canceling
your appointment today?

1239
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:38,704
BERNADETTE:
Mmm-hmm. Yep, that's right.

1240
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:39,804
It's a cancellation.

1241
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:41,356
This is very last minute.

1242
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:43,980
I'm sorry. But, look...

1243
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,795
(sighs) My wisdom teeth
have waited this long,

1244
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:48,014
they can wait another month.

1245
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:49,791
- Would you like to reschedule?
- No, no.

1246
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:52,248
I'll reschedule when we get
back from our trip in January.

1247
00:53:52,347 --> 00:53:54,264
- Okay, thank you, Miss Fox.
- Okay, thank you.

1248
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,556
I knew I recognized you
from that TED Talk.

1249
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:01,663
(chuckles)

1250
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:03,628
My kids love that.

1251
00:54:03,728 --> 00:54:06,079
BERNADETTE:
Elgie, w-what's going on?

1252
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:08,902
Is it Bee?

1253
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:10,001
I just saw her at school.

1254
00:54:10,101 --> 00:54:11,101
No. Bee is fine.

1255
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,260
- (sighs)
- How was the dentist?

1256
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,681
Um, I, I didn't go.
Sorry, who are these people?

1257
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:18,923
Bernadette,
I'm Dr. Janelle Kurtz.

1258
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:20,061
Why don't we all sit down?

1259
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:22,150
Why? Elgie?

1260
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:24,652
Shall we begin, Doctor?

1261
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:26,251
Begin what? I don't like this.

1262
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:28,311
DR. KURTZ: Bernadette,
have a seat, so we can...

1263
00:54:29,215 --> 00:54:32,030
We'd like to present to you
the reality of your situation.

1264
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:34,405
Elgie?

1265
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,891
Whatever this is, can we talk
about it privately?

1266
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:41,994
I know everything, Bernadette,
and so do they.

1267
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:44,746
Okay, look, if this is
about the dentist,

1268
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:45,847
if he told...

1269
00:54:46,335 --> 00:54:48,204
I canceled the appointment.

1270
00:54:48,304 --> 00:54:49,322
I'm going to Antarctica.

1271
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:50,661
I'm looking forward to it. See?

1272
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,630
Bernadette, there is no Manjula.

1273
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:56,349
Manjula? M...

1274
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:58,347
Agent Strang, could you...

1275
00:54:58,447 --> 00:54:59,487
Agent?

1276
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:01,853
Hi. From the FBI.

1277
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:07,340
Miss Fox, we've determined
that Manjela or "Manjula"

1278
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,442
is an alias
for an identity theft ring

1279
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,583
operating out of Russia.

1280
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:13,516
Ide... What?

1281
00:55:13,615 --> 00:55:15,530
ELGIE: Yeah.
And you have given them

1282
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,599
all of our personal information.

1283
00:55:18,206 --> 00:55:19,914
And not only that,
they're on a plane

1284
00:55:20,014 --> 00:55:21,452
right now to Seattle

1285
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:22,764
so they can make their move

1286
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:24,684
while Bee and I
are in Antarctica.

1287
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,251
Isn't that correct,
Agent Strang?

1288
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:27,851
Pretty much.

1289
00:55:27,951 --> 00:55:30,067
And they used your airline miles
to buy the tickets.

1290
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,885
ELGIE: Yeah, and next
they could clean out

1291
00:55:31,985 --> 00:55:33,782
our bank accounts
and our brokerage accounts

1292
00:55:33,882 --> 00:55:35,918
and our property title
because you have given them

1293
00:55:36,018 --> 00:55:37,896
all of our personal information
and passwords.

1294
00:55:37,996 --> 00:55:41,034
Manjela, Man-Manjula
even asked...

1295
00:55:41,135 --> 00:55:42,539
for power of attorney.

1296
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,139
No, that's not true.

1297
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,188
As a matter of fact,
I haven't heard back

1298
00:55:46,288 --> 00:55:47,288
from her for days.

1299
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:49,996
I was getting ready to fire her.

1300
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,811
Well, that's because the FBI
intercepted the emails

1301
00:55:52,911 --> 00:55:53,911
and responded as you.

1302
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:55,596
Wha... (exhales)

1303
00:55:55,695 --> 00:55:56,896
They know everything!

1304
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,231
Bernadette, do you get it?

1305
00:56:02,717 --> 00:56:04,061
(Bernadette sighs)

1306
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:10,699
That was me
ending my relationship

1307
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:12,030
with technology.

1308
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,706
(groans)

1309
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:15,083
That's a great idea, Bernadette.

1310
00:56:15,184 --> 00:56:17,099
Let's all just take
a deep breath.

1311
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:19,434
BERNADETTE: Oh, God, Elgie,

1312
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:21,277
I am so sorry.

1313
00:56:22,365 --> 00:56:23,755
New Delhi Virtual Assistants

1314
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:27,083
had over 100
positive Yelp reviews.

1315
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,867
But the reality was
something different entirely

1316
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:31,563
and I would like for us
to stay focused

1317
00:56:31,664 --> 00:56:33,278
on reality right now.

1318
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:37,322
So it seems in addition
to this identity theft issue,

1319
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,594
you also tried to run over
a mother at school.

1320
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:40,695
Oh, don't be ludicrous.

1321
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:41,793
(scoffs)

1322
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:42,922
BERNADETTE: Oh, shut up.

1323
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:44,875
What is she doing here anyway?

1324
00:56:44,974 --> 00:56:47,596
Would someone open the window
and let that gnat out?

1325
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,322
Stop calling Soo-Lin that,
Bernadette.

1326
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:50,699
Oh, forgive me.

1327
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:53,547
Would someone let the admin
out of my living room?

1328
00:56:53,648 --> 00:56:54,847
I'm happy to go.

1329
00:56:55,262 --> 00:56:56,860
AGENT STRANG:
Yeah, how about I go too?

1330
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,371
We'll be in the other room.
(chuckles nervously)

1331
00:56:59,472 --> 00:57:01,351
Interventions are
slightly above my pay grade.

1332
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,159
(scoffs) Intervention?

1333
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:06,378
Is that what this is?

1334
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:09,355
I'm sorry,
am I the only one here

1335
00:57:09,454 --> 00:57:11,532
who thinks that's just
a little bit extreme?

1336
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:13,706
Bernadette, I'm worried
that you are suffering

1337
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,018
from adjustment disorder.

1338
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,652
(scoffs)
Adjusting is a disorder?

1339
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:19,306
DR. KURTZ: Adjustment disorder
is a psychological response

1340
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:20,746
brought on by stressors

1341
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:23,210
and usually involves
anxiety or depression.

1342
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:24,989
- (Bernadette scoffs)
- And in your case,

1343
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:26,635
I think that this...
the stressor is

1344
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,012
this planned trip to Antarctica.

1345
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,539
Yeah. Except that
I really do wanna go now.

1346
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:31,978
Oh, come on.

1347
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,697
You have no intention of going.

1348
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:37,516
- We have read the emails.
- Uh... (sighs)

1349
00:57:37,615 --> 00:57:39,295
DR. KURTZ: Okay, the reality is

1350
00:57:39,902 --> 00:57:41,577
that you have
willingly given over

1351
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:43,467
your personal information
to a criminal.

1352
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,451
I didn't know
she was a criminal!

1353
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,043
This poor judgment
has almost caused

1354
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:50,123
financial ruin
and physical harm.

1355
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:52,556
Your aggression
toward your neighbor

1356
00:57:52,655 --> 00:57:53,706
destroyed her home...

1357
00:57:53,806 --> 00:57:55,052
I removed...

1358
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:56,458
Let her finish!

1359
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,077
DR. KURTZ:
This is not the first time

1360
00:57:58,177 --> 00:57:59,737
that something like this
has occurred.

1361
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:01,483
And it seems

1362
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:03,532
that you are challenged
in the area

1363
00:58:03,632 --> 00:58:05,034
of basic human interaction,

1364
00:58:05,135 --> 00:58:07,018
relying on a virtual assistant

1365
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,748
to schedule
all your appointments

1366
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:11,199
and to carry on
all of your household duties.

1367
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:13,610
And, Bernadette, the fact that

1368
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,012
you are hoarding
prescription medication

1369
00:58:16,112 --> 00:58:18,570
and the state of your home
to me indicates

1370
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,364
a serious depression.

1371
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,471
(sighs)

1372
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:25,164
Are you still presenting
reality to me,

1373
00:58:25,264 --> 00:58:26,431
or can I say something?

1374
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:30,186
First, I'd like Elgin to begin
by expressing his love.

1375
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:32,012
- Elgin.
- (scoffs)

1376
00:58:32,112 --> 00:58:33,182
ELGIN: Yeah. Uh... yeah.

1377
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:36,702
Hey, of course I love you.

1378
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:39,500
I don't know
who you are right now.

1379
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,034
It's like aliens have come down

1380
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:42,688
and replaced you with a replica.

1381
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,746
Honest to God,
one night, Bernadette,

1382
00:58:44,847 --> 00:58:46,570
I reached over
and I felt your elbows,

1383
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,195
'cause I thought no matter
how good that replica is,

1384
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:51,452
there's no way that they got
the pointy elbows right.

1385
00:58:51,552 --> 00:58:53,418
And I-I had to stop myself.

1386
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:54,956
I thought, "Oh, my God."

1387
00:58:55,056 --> 00:58:57,163
"I can't plunge off
the cliff with her.

1388
00:58:57,262 --> 00:59:00,041
"I've got responsibilities.
I'm a father, I'm a husband.

1389
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:01,539
"I've got all these people
at work

1390
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,117
"and their families
depending on me.

1391
00:59:03,217 --> 00:59:05,414
"Bernadette, my Bernadette,
has gone absolutely crazy,

1392
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:08,255
but I cannot be
pulled down with her."

1393
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:12,811
I'm really sorry, Elgie.

1394
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:16,094
I don't know how
I'm gonna make this up to you.

1395
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:20,128
You're right. I need help.

1396
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:24,715
Let's start by spending time
together in Antarctica.

1397
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:26,090
You know, just the three of us.

1398
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:27,530
No work, no computers...

1399
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,666
Please, let's not blame this
on Microsoft.

1400
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:33,003
No. I'm just saying
the three of us.

1401
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:35,402
Our family, you know,
without any distractions.

1402
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:39,947
The three of us
are not going to Antarctica.

1403
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:41,547
Oh, we can't cancel the trip.

1404
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:43,902
I'm not canceling the trip.
I wouldn't do that to Bee.

1405
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:48,349
You're not taking her
to Antarctica

1406
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:49,693
without me, are you?

1407
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,523
Bernadette, I'd like to suggest

1408
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,443
that while Elgin and Bee
are on their trip,

1409
00:59:54,543 --> 00:59:55,679
that you and I...

1410
00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:57,916
that you and I work together

1411
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,583
for a few weeks at Madrona Hill.

1412
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,557
(scoffs)

1413
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:07,018
The loony bin?

1414
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,476
DR. KURTZ:
We don't call it that.

1415
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:09,577
BERNADETTE: Jesus Christ!

1416
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:11,786
You're shipping me off
to a loony bin!

1417
01:00:11,885 --> 01:00:13,675
Elgie, you-you're not!

1418
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,074
You need help, Bernadette.

1419
01:00:16,173 --> 01:00:17,835
You know, a little R and R.

1420
01:00:17,936 --> 01:00:19,402
R and R?

1421
01:00:19,503 --> 01:00:20,554
So, what, you guys,

1422
01:00:20,655 --> 01:00:21,706
y-you go on the trip

1423
01:00:21,806 --> 01:00:24,235
and I get locked up
at Madrona Hill?

1424
01:00:24,335 --> 01:00:25,481
You, you can't do that.

1425
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,402
Ideally, we'd like you
to come voluntarily.

1426
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:29,130
Lock myself up?

1427
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,954
Oh, my God. You have no concept

1428
01:00:31,054 --> 01:00:32,331
of how ill you actually are!

1429
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:33,885
Elgie, look at me!

1430
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:40,126
Yes, I am in the weeds,
but I can get myself out.

1431
01:00:40,893 --> 01:00:42,411
(exhales)

1432
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,838
We can get out of this together.

1433
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:47,679
We don't need
Colonel Kurtz here.

1434
01:01:02,653 --> 01:01:06,398
I'm sorry, I've had to pee
since I got here.

1435
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,398
Or do I need
doctor's permission?

1436
01:01:17,565 --> 01:01:20,382
(breathing heavily)

1437
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,300
You know, she's been
in there a while.

1438
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,527
Do you think that she's okay?

1439
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,670
Maybe we should go
and check on her.

1440
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:00,510
Bernadette?

1441
01:02:05,117 --> 01:02:06,117
Bernadette!

1442
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:09,451
I can hear the water running.

1443
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:10,858
DR. KURTZ: Miss Fox?

1444
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,675
- It's been a while.
- ELGIE: Is she okay?

1445
01:02:12,775 --> 01:02:14,492
- (banging on door)
- DR. KURTZ: Miss Fox?

1446
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:16,523
- Bernadette?
- Miss Fox, can you hear me?

1447
01:02:16,623 --> 01:02:17,630
Step aside.

1448
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:23,242
(water running)

1449
01:02:23,342 --> 01:02:24,574
(exhales heavily)

1450
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,141
I need your help, Audrey.

1451
01:02:43,038 --> 01:02:45,534
Well, her car is still here.

1452
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,396
Everything's so screwed up.

1453
01:02:52,496 --> 01:02:55,422
I am really, really sorry

1454
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:57,918
about your house

1455
01:02:58,972 --> 01:02:59,998
and the sign.

1456
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:05,853
Don't worry.
Nobody will look for me here.

1457
01:03:10,398 --> 01:03:11,775
Look, I know
I'm not your friend.

1458
01:03:13,597 --> 01:03:15,262
I'm nobody's friend,
let's face it.

1459
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:18,411
But when I was running
from my house,

1460
01:03:18,512 --> 01:03:21,246
I thought maybe
I could come here.

1461
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:23,134
I have nowhere else to go.

1462
01:03:26,077 --> 01:03:29,630
I don't... know anyone
in Seattle.

1463
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:36,639
- (footsteps approaching)
- (knocking on door)

1464
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,710
(exhales)

1465
01:03:48,253 --> 01:03:49,853
- Hi.
- Audrey.

1466
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:52,681
You'll never guess
what happened.

1467
01:03:52,782 --> 01:03:54,603
She disappeared. Bernadette.

1468
01:03:54,702 --> 01:03:56,842
From an intervention
Elgie and I were just doing.

1469
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:58,858
That crazy bitch
jumped out a window.

1470
01:03:58,958 --> 01:03:59,958
What?

1471
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:01,780
'Cause Elgie's having
to lock her up

1472
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,318
to save her
from the Russian mafia.

1473
01:04:03,418 --> 01:04:04,418
I'll tell you later.

1474
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:05,963
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

1475
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:07,434
That poor man.

1476
01:04:07,534 --> 01:04:08,534
He has been through...

1477
01:04:09,373 --> 01:04:10,373
so much.

1478
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,106
You have no idea.

1479
01:04:12,206 --> 01:04:14,186
So we're all out
looking for her,

1480
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:15,818
so I told Elgie
I'd zip down here

1481
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,347
to see if she ran across
your yard or anything.

1482
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:19,786
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1483
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:21,387
Yeah. Sorry, I'm just, um...

1484
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:23,563
The house, you know,
I've just been cleaning a lot.

1485
01:04:23,663 --> 01:04:25,061
- Oh, right.
- And I'm just tired.

1486
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,161
Mud and all of it.

1487
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,331
But, um, but I will, uh,
let you know if I see her

1488
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,509
running through the streets

1489
01:04:29,608 --> 01:04:31,086
with her arms flapping
or something.

1490
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:32,264
- (chuckles)
- It's crazy.

1491
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:34,411
It's crazy.
Oh, gosh, let me know.

1492
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,614
Come here.

1493
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:37,286
Yeah.

1494
01:04:38,557 --> 01:04:40,106
- More details later.
- Okay.

1495
01:04:40,206 --> 01:04:41,534
I wanna hear all of 'em.

1496
01:04:51,326 --> 01:04:52,326
Nothing?

1497
01:04:53,981 --> 01:04:55,389
Well, she didn't just vanish!

1498
01:04:55,998 --> 01:04:58,271
We got 'em. I just got word.

1499
01:04:59,036 --> 01:05:01,822
Manjula was apprehended
switching planes in Dubrovnik.

1500
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,074
This investigation
is now closed.

1501
01:05:04,175 --> 01:05:06,092
(chuckles) Really?

1502
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:07,391
What about Bernadette?

1503
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,675
She's not in any danger now.

1504
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:11,231
Oh, really?

1505
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:14,987
Well, from the Russians.
(laughs)

1506
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:16,447
We've, we've solved
that problem.

1507
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,949
I have been struggling
with Kyle.

1508
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,740
A lot.

1509
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,550
I try with him, but...

1510
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:31,934
And he did not get
into Lakewood.

1511
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,262
So we'll try public school
next year.

1512
01:05:38,204 --> 01:05:41,597
Well, I'm sure it's nicer
than Madrona Hill.

1513
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:44,123
You know what?
I'll switch places with you.

1514
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:45,661
(chuckles)
I'll go to Madrona Hill.

1515
01:05:46,014 --> 01:05:48,331
Yeah, you could probably use
some R and R.

1516
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:49,706
(both chuckle)

1517
01:05:49,806 --> 01:05:51,244
All right.
Well, then you stay here

1518
01:05:51,344 --> 01:05:53,898
with my video-game-obsessed,
rude, pot-smoking son.

1519
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:56,074
Okay. Well, then you can have
my workaholic husband

1520
01:05:56,175 --> 01:05:57,771
and his soon-to-be
mistress admin.

1521
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,547
Okay, well, only if you
throw in Manjula,

1522
01:05:59,648 --> 01:06:01,355
aka Sergei,
the Russian identity thief.

1523
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:02,463
(both laugh)

1524
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:05,867
(groans softly)

1525
01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:08,735
The most important thing
for you to understand

1526
01:06:09,438 --> 01:06:11,934
is that it's not your fault.

1527
01:06:12,476 --> 01:06:14,014
That wasn't even the question.

1528
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:15,914
Mom disappears into thin air

1529
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,951
right before Christmas
without telling me?

1530
01:06:18,429 --> 01:06:20,030
The truth is complicated, honey.

1531
01:06:20,797 --> 01:06:22,826
There's just no way
one person can ever know

1532
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:24,362
everything about another person.

1533
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:25,695
Of course it's complicated.

1534
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,074
Just because it's complicated,

1535
01:06:28,175 --> 01:06:30,331
just because you think
you can't ever know everything

1536
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:32,548
about another person,
it doesn't mean you can't try.

1537
01:06:33,438 --> 01:06:35,070
It doesn't mean I can't try.

1538
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:37,150
ELGIE: I can't...

1539
01:06:37,757 --> 01:06:39,755
It's a very complicated thing
that she's going...

1540
01:06:39,855 --> 01:06:41,813
What are you doing with that?
Hey, listen to me.

1541
01:06:41,913 --> 01:06:43,271
Your mom needs
professional help.

1542
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:44,371
Stop, please.

1543
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:46,067
Hey, I know
you're upset, Buzzy, but...

1544
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:47,166
Don't call me that.

1545
01:06:47,266 --> 01:06:48,478
Mom calls me that, not you.

1546
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,371
(instrumental music playing
on speakers)

1547
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:01,228
FEMALE NARRATOR:
In September of that year,

1548
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:03,530
Fox was awarded
a MacArthur genius grant.

1549
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:04,780
REPORTER: So why her?

1550
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,563
Bernadette Fox is simply
the most exciting thing

1551
01:07:07,663 --> 01:07:09,260
in the world of architecture
right now.

1552
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,518
I think Bernadette stands out

1553
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:12,713
because no one knows
exactly who she is.

1554
01:07:12,813 --> 01:07:14,570
Is she an architect? Obviously.

1555
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,202
An inspired
dumpster diver? Yeah.

1556
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:18,059
REPORTER: Any thoughts
about what you'll do

1557
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,159
with your grant money?

1558
01:07:19,259 --> 01:07:20,259
I don't know.

1559
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:21,875
Start a new project,
finish this one.

1560
01:07:21,974 --> 01:07:23,213
You know, I got a lot of ideas.

1561
01:07:23,313 --> 01:07:24,550
NARRATOR: Mills-Murray's house,

1562
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,570
the White Castle,
was ready to move into

1563
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:27,849
before Fox and Walker

1564
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,730
had closed the walls
on the Twenty Mile House.

1565
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:32,681
The White Castle's
crowning touch was

1566
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,753
a million dollars' worth
of California fan palms.

1567
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:38,442
Yeah. Made it look more like
a Ritz-Carlton, if you ask me.

1568
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,739
I mean, she complained.
She complained and complained,

1569
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:41,838
but... (inhales sharply)

1570
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:43,179
That's just how it was.

1571
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:45,757
The You Catch It,
You Keep It guy.

1572
01:07:46,077 --> 01:07:49,067
Ni... Nigel Miles-Mills

1573
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:50,793
is a douchebag.

1574
01:07:50,893 --> 01:07:53,835
Bernadette called me and said
she wanted to list the house

1575
01:07:53,934 --> 01:07:55,563
and find another piece
of property.

1576
01:07:55,663 --> 01:07:58,697
And before I could even get it
on the market,

1577
01:07:58,797 --> 01:08:00,746
I got a call
from this guy I knew

1578
01:08:00,847 --> 01:08:02,027
who's a business manager,

1579
01:08:02,126 --> 01:08:03,978
and he just wanted
to own the house

1580
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,961
that had won the Genius award.

1581
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:07,260
You know, I just wish that you

1582
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,637
could have seen the two of them.

1583
01:08:08,737 --> 01:08:10,666
He was so proud of her.

1584
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:13,034
She had just won this big award

1585
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:16,139
and made a killing on the house.

1586
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,666
You know, what husband
wouldn't be proud?

1587
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:21,451
I didn't know it at the time,

1588
01:08:21,551 --> 01:08:23,786
but the business manager

1589
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:27,305
was actually buying the house
for his client,

1590
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:28,405
who happened to be...

1591
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:30,364
Nigel Mills-Murray.

1592
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:32,297
And to this day,

1593
01:08:32,398 --> 01:08:35,998
Nigel uses the site
for overflow parking.

1594
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,538
NARRATOR: The Twenty Mile House,

1595
01:08:38,639 --> 01:08:40,810
which had taken
three years to complete,

1596
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:44,010
took only a few hours
to demolish.

1597
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:46,537
There was an outpouring of
grief in architecture circles

1598
01:08:46,637 --> 01:08:49,225
as word spread that
the house had been destroyed.

1599
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:50,698
Bernadette went AWOL.

1600
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:53,354
I, um, had a ton of architects
sign a letter

1601
01:08:53,453 --> 01:08:54,826
that got printed in the paper.

1602
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:57,162
And the Landmark Commission
got serious

1603
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:58,890
about preserving
modern architecture,

1604
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:00,105
which means that, you know,

1605
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:01,845
there was some good
that came out of it.

1606
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:10,761
School?

1607
01:09:10,862 --> 01:09:11,869
Yeah.

1608
01:09:13,405 --> 01:09:15,132
- Are you going to work?
- Yeah.

1609
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:18,301
Mom's missing
and you're going to work?

1610
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,266
Well, what do you
want me to do, Bee?

1611
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:22,090
I don't know,
maybe look for her.

1612
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:23,646
Hey, Bee, listen...

1613
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:25,099
Mom will come back

1614
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,987
when she is ready to come back.

1615
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:30,635
She's... clearly going
through something.

1616
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:33,011
Yeah, she's going through
something you put her through.

1617
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:34,110
Hey, stop it.

1618
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,210
Listen to me.

1619
01:09:36,412 --> 01:09:38,332
Mom has made her own choices.

1620
01:09:38,685 --> 01:09:42,217
Instead of facing reality,
she chose to escape.

1621
01:09:42,318 --> 01:09:43,818
And not for the first time.

1622
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:45,386
She escaped from Los Angeles.

1623
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:47,658
She escapes
any personal responsibility.

1624
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,195
And what did she do yesterday
when confronted with that fact

1625
01:09:50,296 --> 01:09:51,850
from people
who wanted to help her?

1626
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,417
She escaped...

1627
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:54,518
yet again.

1628
01:09:56,828 --> 01:09:57,828
Look at me.

1629
01:09:59,676 --> 01:10:01,212
We're gonna live our lives

1630
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:04,639
and when she is ready
to rejoin us...

1631
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:07,774
she will.

1632
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:16,733
Why do you always set it
so high?

1633
01:10:20,894 --> 01:10:21,894
(sighs)

1634
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,509
Bee? Bee?

1635
01:10:25,871 --> 01:10:27,978
Um, Miss Griffin,
I wanted to tell you

1636
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:29,914
that the only reason
I wanted to go to Choate

1637
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:31,612
was because I saw
some dumb documentary

1638
01:10:31,712 --> 01:10:33,868
about how it's supposed to be
a really good school...

1639
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:35,645
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
is your mom home?

1640
01:10:35,746 --> 01:10:36,746
No, why?

1641
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:38,217
She needed my help.

1642
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,876
I drove her to the airport
last night.

1643
01:10:39,975 --> 01:10:41,134
She said she thought you were

1644
01:10:41,234 --> 01:10:42,591
on the same flight
to Antarctica.

1645
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:44,362
- You drove her to the airport?
- Yes.

1646
01:10:44,462 --> 01:10:45,979
Do you know
if she got on the flight?

1647
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,478
I don't know, honey.
I don't know.

1648
01:10:47,645 --> 01:10:50,059
I-I gave her some of my clothes
for the trip.

1649
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,292
Thank you. Thank you.

1650
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:55,403
Mom's in Antarctica.

1651
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:56,778
- ELGIE: What?
- Yeah.

1652
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,636
Audrey drove her
to the airport last night.

1653
01:10:58,735 --> 01:10:59,753
Audrey?

1654
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:00,905
Yeah. She told me.

1655
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,283
I really think Mom is gonna be

1656
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:04,489
on the trip we were gonna take.

1657
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:06,546
She'll be on the Allegra,
and I already checked,

1658
01:11:06,646 --> 01:11:08,203
there's another ship
called the Louisa

1659
01:11:08,304 --> 01:11:10,181
that we can take
if we get down there in time.

1660
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:11,960
Both the ships
are gonna be at this place

1661
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,537
called Port Lockroy
on the same day.

1662
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:15,036
We can go down there
and find Mom.

1663
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:16,136
You promised.

1664
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:17,469
You have to take me.

1665
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:23,869
And you like
the fishing vest too, huh?

1666
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:34,207
[(breathing heavily]

1667
01:11:45,118 --> 01:11:47,806
Oh. (Breathing heavily)

1668
01:11:58,653 --> 01:12:00,554
BEE: Whatever you do,
don't ever tell Mom

1669
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:01,673
you're bored.

1670
01:12:01,774 --> 01:12:03,627
She'll be like,
"Well, guess what?

1671
01:12:03,726 --> 01:12:05,065
"It only gets more boring

1672
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:06,682
"and the sooner you learn
it's on you

1673
01:12:06,783 --> 01:12:08,779
"to make
your own life interesting,

1674
01:12:08,878 --> 01:12:10,795
the better off you'll be."

1675
01:12:10,895 --> 01:12:13,694
I hope she's doing something
interesting right now.

1676
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,476
(penguins warbling)

1677
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,570
CAPTAIN (over PA): Many of you
are already on deck relishing

1678
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,242
the clear, still morning.

1679
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:26,474
The Zodiacs
will begin loading at 9:30.

1680
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:29,118
And, of course, kayaks
are always available.

1681
01:12:30,077 --> 01:12:31,389
Welcome to Antarctica.

1682
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:13,470
(indistinct chatter)

1683
01:13:18,556 --> 01:13:21,161
Hang on, ma'am.
Here's your flotation device.

1684
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:25,322
Oh, yes. I should probably
keep one of these on 24/7.

1685
01:13:25,421 --> 01:13:27,899
And then you wanna line up for
the kayaking right over there.

1686
01:13:27,998 --> 01:13:29,501
- Okay.
- Oh, no, thanks.

1687
01:13:30,141 --> 01:13:31,141
Uh...

1688
01:13:31,902 --> 01:13:33,832
Wait, do you have singles?

1689
01:13:33,932 --> 01:13:35,453
Yeah. Of course we do.

1690
01:13:38,588 --> 01:13:40,146
ELGIE: We have every reason
to believe

1691
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:41,484
that my wife is on the Allegra.

1692
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,051
There was, uh,
a misunderstanding

1693
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,389
about the departure date and...

1694
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:45,822
A misunderstanding?

1695
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:48,970
Yes, a misunderstanding.

1696
01:13:49,069 --> 01:13:50,347
And we want to meet up with her.

1697
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:51,845
BEE: Both ships
are supposed to be

1698
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:53,224
at Port Lockroy on the same day.

1699
01:13:53,323 --> 01:13:55,530
Look, everything depends
on weather conditions.

1700
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,480
So the idea of
a scheduled itinerary

1701
01:13:57,581 --> 01:13:59,497
with exact port calls
doesn't really exist

1702
01:13:59,597 --> 01:14:00,597
in the Antarctic.

1703
01:14:00,697 --> 01:14:02,314
Can you at least confirm for me

1704
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:04,073
that my wife is on that ship?

1705
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,386
I'm sorry.

1706
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:06,858
I can't release any information

1707
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:08,010
on passenger lists.

1708
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:09,707
Dad, it's fine.

1709
01:14:09,806 --> 01:14:11,037
It'll be fine. Come on.

1710
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,788
(blowing)

1711
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:26,045
BECKY: Hello.

1712
01:14:29,149 --> 01:14:30,237
Hey, who are you?

1713
01:14:30,942 --> 01:14:35,677
Ah. Funny. I was just
wondering that myself.

1714
01:14:36,957 --> 01:14:39,850
When you're in a boat
in Antarctica

1715
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:41,118
and there's no night,

1716
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,613
who are you?

1717
01:14:44,957 --> 01:14:46,890
I-I'm thinking I'm a ghost

1718
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:49,405
on a ghost ship in a ghost land.

1719
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:54,474
You really need to be helping me

1720
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,253
take phytoplankton samples.

1721
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:59,658
Come on.

1722
01:14:59,759 --> 01:15:02,045
I'll take the water samples
and you can write my labels.

1723
01:15:03,006 --> 01:15:05,002
Don't worry. I'll show you how.

1724
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,505
It doesn't take a genius.

1725
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:08,317
Here. Here.

1726
01:15:24,828 --> 01:15:25,828
Dad...

1727
01:15:26,811 --> 01:15:28,060
I've come to a decision.

1728
01:15:28,412 --> 01:15:29,918
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1729
01:15:31,581 --> 01:15:33,225
I don't want to go
to Choate anymore.

1730
01:15:33,326 --> 01:15:34,921
I've been thinking
about it a lot

1731
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:37,117
and I know you and Mom
went to a prep school,

1732
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:39,037
and it sounded fun

1733
01:15:39,997 --> 01:15:42,472
living in a dorm
and playing in the orchestra,

1734
01:15:42,573 --> 01:15:44,331
being independent and grown up,

1735
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,430
but I don't wanna do it.
I just...

1736
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:48,829
I don't wanna go.

1737
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:53,033
I only have four years
until I go off to college,

1738
01:15:53,134 --> 01:15:56,573
so I figure
what's the hurry to go?

1739
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,752
Okay, you don't have
to do anything

1740
01:15:59,853 --> 01:16:00,853
you don't wanna do.

1741
01:16:02,172 --> 01:16:03,997
(chuckles)
I kinda thought you'd be mad.

1742
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:06,984
P.S., prep school
wasn't all that fun.

1743
01:16:07,085 --> 01:16:10,824
That's what I thought.
(chuckles softly)

1744
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:13,240
BECKY: A few other researchers
are bunking on the Allegra

1745
01:16:13,341 --> 01:16:14,418
en route to Palmer Station,

1746
01:16:14,519 --> 01:16:16,841
where we're gonna live
for the next several months.

1747
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,569
What's Palmer Station again?

1748
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,425
The scientific research center.

1749
01:16:20,524 --> 01:16:22,475
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I, I knew that.

1750
01:16:22,574 --> 01:16:24,362
That was, uh,
that's the southernmost spot

1751
01:16:24,462 --> 01:16:26,442
that only scientists can go to.

1752
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:29,320
No, you're thinking
of the South Pole Station,

1753
01:16:29,421 --> 01:16:31,257
which is the southernmost spot
on the planet.

1754
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:32,358
Oh.

1755
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:34,016
That's where
I'm heading after Palmer.

1756
01:16:35,006 --> 01:16:37,546
Actually, my ex-husband
is a contractor

1757
01:16:37,645 --> 01:16:39,966
and he's working on a proposal
for the dismantling of it.

1758
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,474
They're hoping
to build a new one,

1759
01:16:42,573 --> 01:16:44,010
but I don't know why.

1760
01:16:44,109 --> 01:16:46,653
The old one's a geodesic dome.
It's very cool.

1761
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,590
What's the new station
gonna be built from?

1762
01:16:51,548 --> 01:16:52,970
Who knows?

1763
01:16:53,069 --> 01:16:55,037
He's only doing the bid
for tearing it down,

1764
01:16:55,547 --> 01:16:56,860
which is appropriate.

1765
01:17:00,668 --> 01:17:02,988
You're making sure to put
the station names on there too?

1766
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:04,931
Yeah.

1767
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,909
(bellows)

1768
01:17:24,046 --> 01:17:25,694
(penguins warbling)

1769
01:17:29,756 --> 01:17:32,265
CREW MEMBER (on PA):
And we'll also have side trips

1770
01:17:32,365 --> 01:17:33,738
going to Port Lockroy,

1771
01:17:33,837 --> 01:17:38,250
a British military outpost
left over from World War II.

1772
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:41,002
It is now
an Antarctic heritage museum

1773
01:17:41,101 --> 01:17:42,570
where, believe it or not,

1774
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:44,747
a couple people actually live

1775
01:17:44,846 --> 01:17:47,210
and run a gift shop
and a post office.

1776
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:49,002
So you are all encouraged

1777
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:51,819
to go buy
Antarctic penguin stamps

1778
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,438
and mail letters home.

1779
01:18:01,596 --> 01:18:03,242
Can you take me to that ship?

1780
01:18:03,341 --> 01:18:05,161
That, that ship over there?

1781
01:18:05,261 --> 01:18:07,519
MAN: Only to Port Lockroy
and back on this trip. Sorry.

1782
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:26,761
VIVIAN: All right, everyone,

1783
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,362
- come around.
- IRIS: Welcome.

1784
01:18:28,462 --> 01:18:30,025
- I'm Vivian.
- I'm Iris.

1785
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:32,403
Uh, don't forget to close
the door behind you because...

1786
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:34,579
VIVIAN: Sneaky little penguins
are likely to get in

1787
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,680
and once they are in,

1788
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,176
it is really hard
to get them out.

1789
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:38,277
Uh...

1790
01:18:38,376 --> 01:18:39,689
BOTH: Welcome to Port Lockroy.

1791
01:18:39,789 --> 01:18:41,578
VIVIAN: Come on in.
Come a bit closer.

1792
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,368
During World War II,
Port Lockroy was

1793
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,908
a secret outpost
for the British...

1794
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:51,177
IRIS: Paid to turn
Port Lockroy into...

1795
01:18:51,278 --> 01:18:53,052
Where are the passengers
from the Allegra?

1796
01:18:53,532 --> 01:18:55,572
Um, the other cruise ship
passengers already left.

1797
01:18:57,372 --> 01:18:58,859
VIVIAN: Oh, dear.

1798
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,670
WOMAN: Dear God,
what's wrong with her?

1799
01:19:03,996 --> 01:19:05,033
Good morning.

1800
01:19:05,132 --> 01:19:07,050
Hey. You're up early.

1801
01:19:07,149 --> 01:19:08,350
Ready?

1802
01:19:09,436 --> 01:19:10,436
Yeah.

1803
01:19:11,932 --> 01:19:13,225
BECKY: Okay...

1804
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:15,274
So what's the ratio
of men to women

1805
01:19:15,373 --> 01:19:17,002
overwintering in the South Pole?

1806
01:19:17,103 --> 01:19:18,590
BECKY: Uh, I don't know.

1807
01:19:21,212 --> 01:19:22,940
I can let you know
when I get back.

1808
01:19:24,636 --> 01:19:26,653
(penguins warbling)

1809
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:38,557
Antarctica sucks.

1810
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:40,554
She's gonna get back to port

1811
01:19:40,654 --> 01:19:42,530
and she's not gonna know
that we came for her.

1812
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:44,862
It's okay, we'll find her.
I'm not worried about that.

1813
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:47,485
What are you worried about then?

1814
01:19:48,157 --> 01:19:50,493
What's gonna happen
when we find her.

1815
01:19:51,771 --> 01:19:53,514
Mom is my best friend.

1816
01:19:53,613 --> 01:19:54,654
Hey, I know.

1817
01:19:58,012 --> 01:19:59,805
I was only trying
to get your mom help.

1818
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:02,301
You have to believe that.

1819
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,100
Is it true that you got her
a Saint Bernadette medal?

1820
01:20:08,797 --> 01:20:10,216
(chuckles) Yes, it is.

1821
01:20:10,317 --> 01:20:11,675
When she won
the MacArthur grant?

1822
01:20:11,774 --> 01:20:13,372
That's right.
That was a long time ago.

1823
01:20:15,068 --> 01:20:17,020
I didn't do it just
for the name. I told her...

1824
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:21,373
"It's Saint Bernadette,
Our Lady of Lourdes."

1825
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:26,332
"She had visions, 18 in all."

1826
01:20:27,773 --> 01:20:28,957
"Beeber..."

1827
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,136
"Beeber Bifocal
was your first vision."

1828
01:20:36,237 --> 01:20:37,738
"Twenty Mile House
was your second."

1829
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:38,908
"Here's to 16 more."

1830
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:42,940
Oh, man.

1831
01:20:45,564 --> 01:20:47,550
I think I really failed Mom.

1832
01:20:50,588 --> 01:20:52,636
Sh... She's an artist...

1833
01:20:54,974 --> 01:20:56,139
who stopped creating.

1834
01:20:56,238 --> 01:20:58,877
I should have
never let that happen.

1835
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,278
Well, why did you?

1836
01:21:03,036 --> 01:21:04,073
I don't know.

1837
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:06,057
I mean, I don't think I knew how

1838
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:07,518
to try to get...

1839
01:21:08,828 --> 01:21:11,497
an artist with, um, your mom's

1840
01:21:11,597 --> 01:21:14,442
particular kind
of genius to create.

1841
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:17,149
That's... gigantic.

1842
01:21:19,868 --> 01:21:23,868
I can understand how to teach
robots what people need...

1843
01:21:26,619 --> 01:21:28,510
but I couldn't understand that
about your mom.

1844
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:37,328
Have you noticed, by the way,
that I haven't been checking

1845
01:21:37,429 --> 01:21:38,707
my email very much on this trip?

1846
01:21:39,355 --> 01:21:40,444
No, not really.

1847
01:21:40,957 --> 01:21:45,757
Well, there is a huge reorg
going on at Microsoft.

1848
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:49,788
They're probably announcing it
while we sit on these rocks,

1849
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:53,097
but Samantha 2 is canceled.

1850
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:55,626
Canceled?
What do you mean canceled?

1851
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:57,246
Well, um...

1852
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:01,628
They're folding Samantha 2
into games.

1853
01:22:02,269 --> 01:22:04,226
Yeah, I know. I'm not
really interested in that,

1854
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:05,449
so I said,

1855
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:07,390
"You guys can go ahead
and do that yourself."

1856
01:22:09,051 --> 01:22:10,051
Doesn't matter anyway.

1857
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:11,390
I turned in the old badge.

1858
01:22:12,764 --> 01:22:14,716
Dad's a free agent now.

1859
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,402
I've never known you
without your badge.

1860
01:22:18,502 --> 01:22:19,516
(laughs)

1861
01:22:20,444 --> 01:22:21,725
Well, get used to it.

1862
01:22:22,363 --> 01:22:24,284
I'm gonna be around
a lot more now.

1863
01:22:24,926 --> 01:22:27,976
I would really like a shot
at designing that new station.

1864
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:29,898
- You're an architect?
- Well, no.

1865
01:22:29,997 --> 01:22:31,435
I've never really
considered myself

1866
01:22:31,536 --> 01:22:33,161
much of an architect, per se.

1867
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:35,177
I'm more of a, um...

1868
01:22:35,278 --> 01:22:38,185
I'm more of a creative
problem solver with good taste

1869
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,202
and a soft spot
for logistical nightmares.

1870
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:41,641
(chuckles)

1871
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:43,453
Speaking of...

1872
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:46,332
I really need to get
to the South Pole.

1873
01:22:46,877 --> 01:22:49,118
You know, check out
the lay of the land.

1874
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:50,788
(laughs)

1875
01:22:50,887 --> 01:22:52,061
Sorry.

1876
01:22:52,237 --> 01:22:53,962
That's probably not happening.

1877
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:55,177
(Bernadette laughs)

1878
01:22:55,278 --> 01:22:57,341
No, that would be
damn near impossible.

1879
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,913
- (laughs)
- Put it like this...

1880
01:23:00,014 --> 01:23:01,851
I spent the last five years
writing my grant,

1881
01:23:01,952 --> 01:23:03,992
and I'm just now getting there
for the first time.

1882
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,057
It's the most competitive place

1883
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:07,742
in the world for scientists.

1884
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:11,332
Two more Pink Penguins?

1885
01:23:12,381 --> 01:23:13,418
It's on me.

1886
01:23:13,519 --> 01:23:14,537
- Yeah.
- Two more.

1887
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:16,457
Hey, two more. (Chuckles)

1888
01:23:16,557 --> 01:23:18,856
Yeah, why not? I don't leave
for a few hours anyway.

1889
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:20,234
Oh, where are you going?

1890
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,612
Uh, the Allegra is rendezvousing

1891
01:23:21,712 --> 01:23:22,989
with our marine research vessel.

1892
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:24,766
That's how I'm getting
to Palmer Station.

1893
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,621
(warbling)

1894
01:24:29,243 --> 01:24:30,243
BERNADETTE: Absolutely.

1895
01:24:30,652 --> 01:24:33,002
I know I'm not authorized
to, uh, be here,

1896
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,826
but, you know,
I'll work for free.

1897
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:36,170
No job is too demeaning.

1898
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,757
Yeah, that's great,
but guess what.

1899
01:24:38,747 --> 01:24:39,945
There are people here

1900
01:24:40,046 --> 01:24:41,804
who have come here
through proper channels.

1901
01:24:41,904 --> 01:24:43,662
They have written approvals,
gotten grants.

1902
01:24:43,761 --> 01:24:45,119
And you show up here
unannounced,

1903
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,421
a stowaway,
and you expect a spot?

1904
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:49,467
But I am an architect.

1905
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:51,228
That doesn't mean shooot
around here.

1906
01:24:52,029 --> 01:24:54,088
I mean, I have
Nobel Prize winners

1907
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,520
sanding and painting decks,
an economist on kitchen duty,

1908
01:24:56,621 --> 01:24:59,626
and a television executive
who's studying fur seals.

1909
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:01,756
And I've been helping Becky
with her research.

1910
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:04,841
(stammering) Yeah.
I'm, I'm sorry, Ellen. I just...

1911
01:25:04,942 --> 01:25:07,421
I... I had no idea and...

1912
01:25:08,444 --> 01:25:09,578
How would she get home?

1913
01:25:09,677 --> 01:25:11,689
We can stick her
on the next ship out.

1914
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:14,185
Where's she gonna sleep? Aren't
all the beds accounted for?

1915
01:25:14,286 --> 01:25:15,323
That's what we always say.

1916
01:25:15,423 --> 01:25:16,423
In the meantime,

1917
01:25:16,523 --> 01:25:18,199
- I will hand you over to Mike.
- Uh-huh.

1918
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,042
He is a former state senator
from Boston

1919
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:23,645
who wanted so badly
to spend time in Antarctica

1920
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,020
that he trained to become
a diesel mechanic.

1921
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:29,512
All right.

1922
01:25:29,613 --> 01:25:30,890
I'm letting you know now

1923
01:25:30,989 --> 01:25:32,809
because you're listed
as her next of kin,

1924
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:35,739
but your wife's name is on
the Allegra passenger list.

1925
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,185
Good. Thank you.

1926
01:25:38,286 --> 01:25:40,362
Mr. Branch,
your wife went missing

1927
01:25:40,462 --> 01:25:41,981
somewhere
in the Gerlache Strait.

1928
01:25:43,581 --> 01:25:45,833
What does that mean?

1929
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:48,360
Her last recorded activity
was carding in

1930
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:50,761
from an excursion 26 hours ago.

1931
01:25:50,862 --> 01:25:51,942
She has since gone missing.

1932
01:25:53,628 --> 01:25:56,585
Okay, uh, Bernadette
really likes her privacy.

1933
01:25:56,685 --> 01:25:59,177
The ship has been searched
top to bottom.

1934
01:25:59,278 --> 01:26:00,649
But she's gotta be somewhere.

1935
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:04,393
This report is largely based
on the electronic signature

1936
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:07,274
created by your wife's
magnetically coded ID card.

1937
01:26:07,373 --> 01:26:09,737
As you can see,
on her last night,

1938
01:26:09,837 --> 01:26:11,945
she ran up large bar tab.

1939
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:14,140
It's like you're assuming
she's dead or something.

1940
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,617
She just escaped again.

1941
01:26:16,716 --> 01:26:20,970
To where? It's, it's not like
disappearing from Seattle.

1942
01:26:21,069 --> 01:26:23,506
Out here, there's nowhere to go
but the boat that you're on.

1943
01:26:23,605 --> 01:26:25,721
Where's she gonna stay?
Out there with the penguins?

1944
01:26:25,822 --> 01:26:27,898
You're looking at the
Pink Penguins on her bar bill

1945
01:26:27,997 --> 01:26:29,475
and you're assuming
she's depressed.

1946
01:26:29,576 --> 01:26:31,014
What if she was having
a good time?

1947
01:26:31,113 --> 01:26:32,912
How do you know
she wasn't celebrating, Dad?

1948
01:26:33,011 --> 01:26:34,729
All right. Okay.
I hope you're right, Bee.

1949
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,466
While you spent
your whole life at work,

1950
01:26:39,565 --> 01:26:41,948
Mom and I were having
the best time ever.

1951
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:44,957
We live for each other.

1952
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:48,168
And she would never do anything

1953
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:49,533
where she'd never see me again.

1954
01:26:51,069 --> 01:26:52,905
(grunts) Got it. Yeah.

1955
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:55,358
Okay. Now we can get
this little...

1956
01:26:56,572 --> 01:26:59,145
We gotta get
the glow plug outta there.

1957
01:26:59,244 --> 01:27:00,643
- Do you have the crescent?
- Yep.

1958
01:27:00,743 --> 01:27:01,900
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1959
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:05,854
Fox, come here.

1960
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:13,405
I googled you.
So why are you here?

1961
01:27:14,398 --> 01:27:18,185
I am trying not to be
a menace to society anymore.

1962
01:27:18,284 --> 01:27:20,402
And, look, I probably did get
a little carried away,

1963
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:22,697
but, Ellen, I would
really like a shot

1964
01:27:22,796 --> 01:27:24,701
at designing this new station
at 90 South.

1965
01:27:25,885 --> 01:27:27,145
What do you know about that?

1966
01:27:27,244 --> 01:27:29,512
Well, I, I know
they're dismantling it,

1967
01:27:29,613 --> 01:27:31,081
and they're gonna build
a new one.

1968
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:33,577
You know, anyone who's gonna
have a shot at redesigning it,

1969
01:27:33,676 --> 01:27:35,993
they're gonna have to go visit
and see it for themselves.

1970
01:27:36,092 --> 01:27:38,314
No one just visits
the South Pole.

1971
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:39,612
It's essential personnel only.

1972
01:27:39,712 --> 01:27:41,269
And as far as I
can make out, you fall

1973
01:27:41,368 --> 01:27:43,273
in that rather large category
of nonessential.

1974
01:27:43,372 --> 01:27:45,096
It's just, the way I work

1975
01:27:45,197 --> 01:27:46,921
is I have to inhabit
a space, you know,

1976
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,130
before I can even begin
designing it.

1977
01:27:49,229 --> 01:27:51,657
Before I can discover
what it needs to be.

1978
01:27:51,756 --> 01:27:54,271
You know... God, just thinking
about it's got my heart racing.

1979
01:27:54,372 --> 01:27:55,432
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

1980
01:27:55,533 --> 01:27:57,091
It's not the bad kind
of heart racing,

1981
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,190
as in, "I'm gonna die."

1982
01:27:58,289 --> 01:27:59,728
It's the good kind
of heart racing,

1983
01:27:59,828 --> 01:28:01,706
as in, "Hello, can I help you
with something?"

1984
01:28:01,805 --> 01:28:02,805
"'Cause if not step aside

1985
01:28:02,904 --> 01:28:04,989
'cause I am about to kick
the shooot out of life."

1986
01:28:05,467 --> 01:28:08,862
Do you have any idea
what overwintering entails?

1987
01:28:09,341 --> 01:28:12,873
It's twice the challenge
anyone ever imagines going in.

1988
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:15,011
The only ones who can cut it
are the ones who have

1989
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:16,948
a little bit of
an antisocial streak in them.

1990
01:28:17,275 --> 01:28:19,551
You have to be comfortable
spending a lot of time alone.

1991
01:28:19,652 --> 01:28:22,216
You have to go for long
stretches without exercise.

1992
01:28:22,317 --> 01:28:24,155
Showers are few and far between.

1993
01:28:24,988 --> 01:28:26,706
Sounds like I've been
in training for this

1994
01:28:26,805 --> 01:28:28,092
for the last 20 years.

1995
01:28:29,533 --> 01:28:31,166
VIVIAN: All I wanted
was South America.

1996
01:28:31,644 --> 01:28:33,320
Are you gonna take that away
from me too?

1997
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:34,792
World domination ain't pretty.

1998
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,157
(softly) Oof.

1999
01:28:37,787 --> 01:28:38,787
Where are we?

2000
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:41,756
IRIS: Um...

2001
01:28:43,453 --> 01:28:45,972
Oh, I think we're dropping off
a researcher at Palmer Station.

2002
01:28:47,707 --> 01:28:48,841
Right now?

2003
01:28:48,942 --> 01:28:50,537
We're at Palmer Station?

2004
01:28:50,636 --> 01:28:52,752
VIVIAN: Yeah, the cruise
companies always like to do

2005
01:28:52,853 --> 01:28:54,609
these transfers
in the middle of the night.

2006
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:55,944
Really?

2007
01:28:56,045 --> 01:28:57,721
VIVIAN: Yeah,
they just keep it hush-hush

2008
01:28:57,822 --> 01:28:59,500
so as not to bother
the paying customers.

2009
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,016
See, Dad? It's Palmer Station
right there.

2010
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:05,314
There's a ton of people there,

2011
01:29:05,414 --> 01:29:07,092
and I really think
Mom is gonna be there.

2012
01:29:07,193 --> 01:29:09,110
We have to go and check
and see if she's there.

2013
01:29:09,724 --> 01:29:11,625
You wanna borrow a Zodiac
and go find out?

2014
01:29:11,725 --> 01:29:14,162
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, you wait here. I'm
gonna get my gear.

2015
01:29:14,261 --> 01:29:15,261
Ah! Don't go anywhere!

2016
01:29:22,011 --> 01:29:23,912
ELGIE: All right, look, um...

2017
01:29:24,012 --> 01:29:26,250
Just, uh, you know, act normal.

2018
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:27,997
- Look cool, all right?
- BEE: Yeah.

2019
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:36,778
Oh, crap. All right. I gotta
look for a place to dock.

2020
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:39,645
Uh, just ram into the shore
at full speed.

2021
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:41,385
You just gotta do that.

2022
01:29:41,484 --> 01:29:43,965
- No, you don't.
- Yes, you do.

2023
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,092
(sander whirring)

2024
01:29:49,275 --> 01:29:50,275
Hey.

2025
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:53,891
Hey.

2026
01:29:54,444 --> 01:29:57,756
Lucky for you, I'm partial
to weirdos and geniuses.

2027
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:01,417
I got you a spot on a Herc
from McMurdo to 90 South.

2028
01:30:01,518 --> 01:30:03,515
You have to stand for
the whole three-hour flight

2029
01:30:03,614 --> 01:30:05,052
next to powdered milk
and jet fuel.

2030
01:30:05,153 --> 01:30:06,856
I'm fine with standing.
(chuckles)

2031
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:07,976
You say that.

2032
01:30:08,077 --> 01:30:09,475
Do you have
all your wisdom teeth?

2033
01:30:09,574 --> 01:30:10,574
Uh, yeah.

2034
01:30:10,673 --> 01:30:11,753
No wisdom teeth.

2035
01:30:11,854 --> 01:30:13,492
We once had to, uh,
airlift out somebody

2036
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:14,670
with infected wisdom teeth.

2037
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,127
Do not ask me
how much that cost.

2038
01:30:16,228 --> 01:30:17,228
Oh, shooot.

2039
01:30:17,327 --> 01:30:18,345
No, don't worry about it.

2040
01:30:18,445 --> 01:30:20,297
The Laurence M. Gould
is loading up now.

2041
01:30:20,398 --> 01:30:22,475
And once you get to McMurdo,
we can get rid of 'em.

2042
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:23,574
Oh, okay.

2043
01:30:23,673 --> 01:30:25,152
We have a veterinarian
from Pasadena

2044
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:26,649
with a degree
in equine dentistry.

2045
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,427
- He's done it before.
- On which animal?

2046
01:30:28,528 --> 01:30:29,605
Volunteers can't be choosy.

2047
01:30:29,706 --> 01:30:31,400
And once you get
to the South Pole,

2048
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:32,658
you are there for five weeks.

2049
01:30:32,759 --> 01:30:33,961
No going in or out.

2050
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,925
Oh, God, this is so great.

2051
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:39,337
Oh, the only thing
I feel I have to do is

2052
01:30:39,436 --> 01:30:40,744
I gotta run it by my family.

2053
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:42,283
You know,
see they're okay with it.

2054
01:30:42,382 --> 01:30:44,009
- Do it.
- (exhales heavily)

2055
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:45,787
- Hey.
- Yeah.

2056
01:30:46,555 --> 01:30:48,157
Thank you.

2057
01:30:52,188 --> 01:30:54,460
(whooping quietly)

2058
01:31:11,228 --> 01:31:13,512
BEE: Hi, you've reached
the archaic landline

2059
01:31:13,613 --> 01:31:15,177
of the Fox-Branch residence.

2060
01:31:15,278 --> 01:31:17,475
Since my parents still won't
let me have a cell phone,

2061
01:31:17,574 --> 01:31:19,305
all my friends
can leave messages here.

2062
01:31:19,405 --> 01:31:21,372
- (answering machine beeps)
- Hey, Buzzy.

2063
01:31:22,171 --> 01:31:24,125
Hey... Elgie.

2064
01:31:24,764 --> 01:31:27,689
I'm sorry I haven't called,
but as you know,

2065
01:31:27,788 --> 01:31:29,546
my phone jumped off
the Tallahatchie Bridge

2066
01:31:29,646 --> 01:31:30,877
and has not been seen since.

2067
01:31:31,613 --> 01:31:34,409
There's much more explanation
coming in our future,

2068
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:36,520
but for now the headlines,

2069
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:39,005
and it has been a busy news day.

2070
01:31:39,645 --> 01:31:43,817
I am about to head
to McMurdo Station

2071
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,225
to have four wisdom teeth

2072
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:47,208
voluntarily extracted
by a veterinarian.

2073
01:31:47,309 --> 01:31:49,756
So, I got that going for me.

2074
01:31:51,996 --> 01:31:54,109
(indistinct radio chatter)

2075
01:32:28,733 --> 01:32:31,932
(water dripping)

2076
01:32:42,685 --> 01:32:45,320
BERNADETTE: This crazy place
is a shifting ice sheet.

2077
01:32:45,421 --> 01:32:46,761
And did you know

2078
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,417
they have to reposition
the official South Pole marker

2079
01:32:49,516 --> 01:32:51,047
- because it can move...
- Shhh.

2080
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:52,636
BERNADETTE: 100 feet a year?

2081
01:32:53,404 --> 01:32:56,938
God, I might have to make
my building a wind-powered,

2082
01:32:57,037 --> 01:32:59,037
crab-walking igloo.

2083
01:32:59,581 --> 01:33:02,177
- I don't know. I'll figure it out.
- (whispers) She's building.

2084
01:33:02,278 --> 01:33:04,595
- That's what insomnia is for.
- She's making a building.

2085
01:33:04,694 --> 01:33:06,920
The thing about it is,
any structure built

2086
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,439
will have to be coordinated
out of the United States.

2087
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:11,720
You know, I mean...

2088
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,256
Every material down to the nail

2089
01:33:13,356 --> 01:33:14,356
will have to be flown in.

2090
01:33:14,685 --> 01:33:17,448
Getting the supplies here
will be so costly

2091
01:33:17,548 --> 01:33:19,997
that absolutely nothing
can be wasted.

2092
01:33:21,211 --> 01:33:23,847
You know, I've realized
that none of what

2093
01:33:23,948 --> 01:33:26,077
has become of me
is Seattle's fault.

2094
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:28,202
Well, might be a little,

2095
01:33:28,301 --> 01:33:30,090
but let's withhold
final judgment

2096
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:31,880
until I start being
more of an artist

2097
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:33,275
and less of a menace.

2098
01:33:34,011 --> 01:33:36,380
But I make you guys
this one promise,

2099
01:33:36,765 --> 01:33:38,666
and it is a big one.

2100
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:40,541
I will move forward.

2101
01:33:42,108 --> 01:33:43,704
Oh, God, this is more
of a conversation

2102
01:33:43,805 --> 01:33:44,904
than a message.

2103
01:33:45,003 --> 01:33:48,680
Uh... But, listen, look um,
I have this one shot

2104
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,282
to make it to the South Pole

2105
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:53,693
and looks like we're leaving
in a couple of hours.

2106
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:56,935
And I'll be gone for five weeks.

2107
01:33:57,036 --> 01:33:59,547
But I will only go
if it's okay with you guys...

2108
01:34:01,404 --> 01:34:02,621
so would you please call me?

2109
01:34:03,386 --> 01:34:06,824
Um, here's the number
I can be reached at.

2110
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:08,965
(sighs) It goes through Denver,
believe it or not.

2111
01:34:09,466 --> 01:34:11,368
303-295...

2112
01:34:11,469 --> 01:34:12,469
Mom!

2113
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:15,145
You can go!

2114
01:34:15,244 --> 01:34:16,244
Bee?

2115
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:19,613
(Bernadette exclaiming)

2116
01:34:21,595 --> 01:34:23,163
I knew I'd find you.

2117
01:34:24,891 --> 01:34:26,140
God, how did you...

2118
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:28,475
How did you get here?

2119
01:34:30,939 --> 01:34:32,315
(Bernadette exclaiming)

2120
01:34:41,435 --> 01:34:42,587
Dad brought you something.

2121
01:34:45,275 --> 01:34:46,275
He did?

2122
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,180
(pocket opens)

2123
01:34:57,371 --> 01:34:58,371
BEE: We decided

2124
01:34:58,908 --> 01:35:01,788
there's no way I could have
taken up all 16 miracles.

2125
01:35:08,922 --> 01:35:09,922
ELGIE: Yep.

2126
01:35:10,363 --> 01:35:12,604
You got
a lot more miracles left.

2127
01:35:26,074 --> 01:35:27,484
(cries softly)

2128
01:35:46,234 --> 01:35:47,323
(Bernadette chuckles)

2129
01:35:57,787 --> 01:35:59,337
BEE: Scientists always thought

2130
01:35:59,436 --> 01:36:01,288
gentoo penguins mated for life.

2131
01:36:01,389 --> 01:36:03,368
But they recently discovered
that wasn't true,

2132
01:36:03,469 --> 01:36:05,148
and about 20 percent
of them don't.

2133
01:36:06,524 --> 01:36:08,007
The way I look at it then,

2134
01:36:08,108 --> 01:36:09,993
that means the ones
who stay together forever

2135
01:36:10,094 --> 01:36:11,164
are making a choice.

2136
01:36:11,996 --> 01:36:13,307
