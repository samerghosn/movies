You know, sometimes it takes an
extremely traumatic experience

717
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:01,260
to make you appreciate a good makeover.

718
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,771

What are you reading? I Am Malalalala?

723
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,088
No books! Think of your mother.

724
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,050
What's the big deal?
Mom read tons of books.

725
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,726
And a one-ton book killed her.

726
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,126
The book didn't kill Mom. You did.

727
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,367
And you nearly killed me, too.

728
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,521
Come on. Look at us. We look ridiculous.

729
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,139
What, okay,
maybe your pants are a little loose.

730
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,083
- Are you serious right now?
- What?

731
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,139
I don't want to be anything like you!

732
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:49,365
You're a has-been!

733
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,684
And you are the most narcissistic,

734
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,485
self-involved person I've ever met!

735
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,481
But that's not how I think of me.

736
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,650
I'm going back to school.

737
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,940
Little Derek, come back here!

738
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,219

How did you learn to speak Italian?

743
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,079
Because I'm smart!

744
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,179
Mom was smart, too.

745
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,380
The only stupid thing she ever did

746
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,083
was fall in love with you.

747
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,047
I don't even have the words
to express what a burn that is.

don't have the vocabulary to respond.

750

You're like a walking Tyrannosaurus.

751
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,246
You mean "walking thesaurus".

I don't know.

753

I guess it's nice
that you want to reconnect or whatever.

No, Derek, not the hand job

The real Fountain of Youth.

881
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,204
It dates back some 6,000 years.

00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,442
Its original location is thought to have
been the Garden of Eden.

with a look so powerful...

891
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:48,447
that even the pools of water he gazed upon

892
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:50,364

Trying to take a ride in the cool mobile

Pack it up, old lames
You just irrelevant to us

1623
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:23,500
Old as the presidents
Your style is like the republican twos

1624
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,739
That's a definite
Give grief to all your relatives

1625
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,242
And next of kin and
Gave 'em D-attention, no decificit

When I say ancient relics,
Hansel and Derek,

I'm handsome, you jealous

1628
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:39,243
I can tell it from your facial expressions
Or I take it, you smell it

1629
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:44,970
I'm sorry. Don Atari, but Donatella
suggested Valentino for the party

1630
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,967
Shoot it in the right direction

1631
01:34:49,239 --> 01:34:52,483
Make it your intention

1632
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:54,770
Live those dreams

1633
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,489
Scheme those schemes

1634
01:34:57,039 --> 01:34:58,804
You gotta hit me

1635
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,939
Hit me with those laser beams

1636
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:04,220
Relax, don't do it When you wanna go to it

01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,539
Relax, don't do it

1641
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:16,962
When you wanna come
