1
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,082
<i>You need to know from the get-go,
this is about nothing.</i>

2
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,543
<i>Just a geometrical contradiction.</i>

3
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,215
<i>The story of a dumb, round planet
revolving aimlessly</i>

4
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,969
<i>around a dumb, round sun
burning aimlessly.</i>

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,345
<i>The story of a round belly</i>

6
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,640
<i>purposefully containing
a round, gooey thing.</i>

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,976
<i>That becomes an un-gooey thing.</i>

8
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,353
<i>That looks at lots of round things.</i>

9
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,523
<i>The rounds of freedom.</i>

10
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:05,567
<i>Sophie's round dots.</i>

11
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,445
<i>Samantha's round rounds.</i>

12
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,198
<i>As round as people's round glasses.</i>

13
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:13,908
<i>Round.</i>

14
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,667
<i>It's also the tale
of a curve going straight</i>

15
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>and becoming a rigid angle.</i>

16
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:28,631
<i>A square squishing a round
with the rule book.</i>

17
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,216
<i>A squared-off morality tale.</i>

18
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,679
<i>Square education.</i>

19
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>Like square food at school,</i>

20
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,018
<i>college, university...</i>

21
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:41,728
<i>Square to the jaw like...</i>

22
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:42,561
It's over!

23
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,899
<i>As square as square people's glasses.</i>

24
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,983
Here we go.

25
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:48,817
<i>Square games.</i>

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,695
<i>Square office life.</i>

27
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,656
<i>Square. Like your father's cancer.</i>

28
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,866
<i>Square.</i>

29
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,245
<i>So we come to the contradictory aspect
of our story.</i>

30
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,873
<i>Of the few things we can be sure of,</i>

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>there is one even the worst skeptics
cannot call into question.</i>

32
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,674
<i>A square peg never fits in a round hole.</i>

33
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,718
<i>Never.</i>

34
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,598
<i>And vice-versa.</i>

35
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,360
Morning, everybody.

36
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,903
Morning.

37
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,495
What about your cortisone?

38
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:24,288
I stopped. I get so bloated.

39
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,165
But it stops you sleeping all day.

40
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,586
Rest assured, honey, you're already fat.

41
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,840
You can bloat all you want,
it's like tennis socks in boots.

42
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,174
Nobody will notice.

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,301
I'll take it.

44
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,762
What's on the agenda today?

45
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,307
Playing Candy Crush on the couch.

46
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,727
No, not playing Candy Crush
on the couch.

47
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,937
I have my meeting with HR
this afternoon.

48
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,564
- It's today?
- At 3.

49
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,484
Six months waiting
and you sit on it all weekend?

50
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:54,401
I forgot it.

51
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,236
- Forgot?
- I didn't think.

52
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,991
I didn't want to think about it.

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,126
Come on, kids, let's go.

54
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,046
Have a good day, son.

55
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,340
I wanna die.

56
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,550
Obviously. It's your acne.
You'll be over it by lunch.

57
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,637
I hate you.

58
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,182
Obviously, too.

59
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,108
You good?

60
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,033
Let's go!

61
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:06,723
It doesn't matter.

62
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:07,850
Stuff happens.

63
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,144
Maybe it was too early.

64
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,605
No? I don't know.

65
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,149
What do you think?

66
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,930
SINK OR SWIM

67
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,454
One.

68
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,288
Two.

69
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,290
Grace. Elegance.

70
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,043
Five, six, seven, eight!

71
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,428
We can go, I'm ready.

72
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:29,658
<i>Swimmer wanted to join
men's synchronized swim team.</i>

73
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,536
<i>Amateurs welcome.</i>

74
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,375
The teacher said I didn't talk.

75
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,627
After, I did somersaults.

76
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,254
It was really good.

77
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,838
And flips and things.

78
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,091
The teacher said I had to leave class...

79
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:56,894
There's no federation,
league or whatever.

80
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,148
I guess we could start one
if we write letters

81
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,524
to someone somewhere.

82
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,485
We never discussed it much

83
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,946
'cause we don't give a damn.

84
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:12,160
Practice times depend on school days
and the water polo club.

85
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,411
Mondays, it's at 6:30.

86
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,913
Thursdays at 7,

87
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,917
but you can arrive
ten minutes later if you want.

88
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,377
It's no problem.

89
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,670
We do it for fun, after all.

90
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,298
It's not the army.

91
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,466
It's just a little...

92
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,429
I'm Thierry
but you can call me Titi.

93
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,264
No, Thierry's fine.

94
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,434
I don't know why I said that.
Nobody calls me Titi.

95
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,812
It's like, you big boob, right?

96
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,355
Yes, for sure.

97
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm thrilled you answered the ad.
You'll see, we're one big family.

98
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,529
Not a real family, but kind of.

99
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,407
Welcome!

100
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,744
Guys!

101
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,705
Guys! This is Bertrand.

102
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,498
Hi, Bertrand.

103
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,375
Everybody in the pool.

104
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,010
Delphine!

105
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,846
This is Bertrand.
He called about the ad!

106
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,894
So what brings you here?

107
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,687
I don't really know.

108
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,649
You don't know?

109
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,192
You know what we do?

110
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,695
Yes, sure.
Synchronized swimming for men.

111
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,240
What is synchronized swimming for men?

112
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,825
The same as for women, I guess.

113
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,993
But for men.

114
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,246
- It made you want to sign up?
- Not exactly.

115
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,957
So what the hell brings you here?

116
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,125
Guys, it's called training!

117
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,255
Men's synchronized swimming

118
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,216
is not for everybody.

119
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,176
Many are called, few are chosen.

120
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,677
The guys you see here

121
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,721
aren't here by chance.

122
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,139
They want it.

123
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,142
To make this team, Bertrand,

124
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,019
you must combine willpower,
grace, rhythm

125
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,772
and a healthy lifestyle.

126
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,274
Can you cut it?

127
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,528
- You can swim at least?
- Sure. Quite well.

128
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,739
I don't know.

129
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,033
You know nothing, in fact.

130
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,327
Not anymore.

131
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,081
Great, you made the team.

132
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,126
Move! Locker room!

133
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,213
Grab trunks, cap, nose clip, goggles.
In the pool in 5!

134
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,508
Now that's a warm welcome.

135
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,884
Run along!

136
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:42,350
"What, no treason?

137
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,352
"This grief is without reason.

138
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,315
"It is indeed the worst pain

139
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,024
"Not to know why

140
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,236
"Without love, without hate
My heart suffers this fate."

141
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,697
Let's go again.

142
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,792
"Sweet sound of rain
On the earth and roofs

143
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,918
"For a heart that wanes

144
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,962
"Sweet is the song of rain!"

145
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,674
Knock it off now!

146
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,802
Pain in the ass! You all piss me off!

147
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,434
I didn't drive 40 minutes here for this!

148
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,062
I want to train!

149
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,482
Look at you! What the hell!

150
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,817
I want discipline!

151
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,611
I'm sick of it!

152
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,865
Very well, let's go again.

153
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,476
They made me do tests
like it was for a space flight.

154
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,772
Cholesterol level,
this level, that level.

155
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,066
Whatever. Two days it took,

156
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,735
only for them to send a letter saying,

157
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,778
I'm in super shape.

158
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,532
But I'm too old to get a mortgage.

159
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,701
38, and I'm too old.

160
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,953
It's absurd.

161
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,999
Now I keep obsessing about it.

162
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,419
I look at myself in the mirror

163
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,004
and find wrinkles.

164
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,341
I'm easily out of breath.

165
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,259
38 years old.

166
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,971
All because I wanted to buy a place.

167
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,142
I don't know
if you guys own your homes.

168
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,394
But I'm telling you, rent!

169
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,440
Save on metaphysical shooot.

170
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,738
I appreciate it.

171
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,506
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

172
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,667
You're up bright and early.
What are you doing?

173
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,711
Eating my apple turnover.

174
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,630
Say, Nicolas,

175
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,924
we open the store at 10.

176
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,052
Not 10:30.

177
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,928
- We open at 10:30.
- Don't.

178
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,138
- We do.
- Don't.

179
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,222
- Do!
- Don't!

180
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,140
It says so on the door!

181
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,269
It means 10 o'clock here.
10:30, ready to sell.

182
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,855
You arrive at 10:30 and then what?

183
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,399
Get a coffee,
check email and stuff.

184
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,400
That takes us to 11:30.

185
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,236
Meanwhile, folks come by,

186
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,863
looking for a pool.

187
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,322
These pools don't sell.

188
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,658
They don't sell, I lose money on them.

189
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,536
Nobody buys mine in the end.

190
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,371
Even afternoons are quiet.

191
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,873
Yes but...

192
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,543
I can talk like a boss sometimes, right?

193
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,548
Do you have any weed?

194
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,229
- It's me.
<i>- Two hours she's been waiting.</i>

195
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,898
I know, sorry. This guy...

196
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,524
<i>She's coming down.</i>

197
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,235
- All good?
<i>- Wonderful. Lola's on her way.</i>

198
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,323
Scissors.

199
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,452
Don't hold back.
Express yourself through the whole word.

200
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,205
Phyllo.

201
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:14,873
Good.

202
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,250
Banjo.

203
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,309
Your son is hindered.

204
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,352
He has a real mental blockage.

205
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,565
Communication between you is crucial.

206
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,774
Involve him, stimulate him.

207
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,860
Maybe drama classes or...

208
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,447
Excuse me, are you a shrink?

209
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,032
No, you're not a shrink.

210
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,452
So we'll stop there.
I don't pay you for a parenting lesson.

211
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,580
Just do your job, that's plenty.

212
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,216
Seventy-six!

213
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,644
- How are you feeling, champ?
- Copacetic.

214
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,102
They're rocking.

215
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:19,812
Not quite rocking.

216
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,938
Simon!

217
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,234
You're on after the bingo.
5-6 minutes, tops.

218
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,568
When I do this...

219
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,200
Has he got nerve issues?

220
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,907
So how was the party?

221
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,492
A lot of people turned up?

222
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,208
I wish I'd been there.

223
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,352
Here. Forty for you.

224
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,605
The blue spot during the intro,
did it dazzle you?

225
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,065
I could hardly see.

226
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,861
I'll try it behind.
Like you step out of a flying saucer.

227
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,403
Mauve then.

228
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,572
Mauve, sure.

229
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,074
Are you guys for real?

230
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,777
Take it easy!

231
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,320
What?

232
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,031
Third time this month
we've moved you on, sir.

233
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,035
We've played nice so far. Now beat it.

234
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,246
This isn't for camping,
it's for parking.

235
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,372
OK, we're going.

236
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,999
- Right now.
- Sure.

237
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,463
They woke you up.

238
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,259
I'm going, dad.

239
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,636
Already? Without breakfast?

240
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,012
I'm not hungry.

241
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,224
I thought we'd spend the day together

242
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,143
and I'd drop you at mom's tonight.

243
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,729
It's your call but it's...

244
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,737
You didn't say, how was my gig?

245
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,819
And stretch.

246
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,320
What's stretching?

247
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,030
No, look, you're...

248
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,576
Too tight, too stiff. All wrong.

249
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,202
So scared of looking stupid,
you almost do.

250
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,663
Listening is crucial.

251
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,041
You need music in you
to make the world dance.

252
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,167
Stretch....

253
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,586
Mermaids, yes!

254
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,548
Let's find our inner woman.

255
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,843
I don't have an inner woman.

256
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,930
Bullshit. Finding her
might help you grow a pair.

257
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,223
I know I don't have one.

258
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,435
Reach up and stretch. Ballerinas!

259
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:28,729
Ballerina!

260
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,814
Let's find some grace.

261
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,900
It's in there somewhere.

262
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,445
Remember, we have a show coming up,
so let's be ready. Let's go!

263
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,364
Sorry, you're not in the gala.

264
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,907
You're not up to it.

265
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:41,909
Yeah.

266
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,246
He says, you'll see, it's an easy climb.

267
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,082
But I can see it's no easy climb.

268
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,710
So I say, watch out, I'm no...

269
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,502
I'm no mountaineer.

270
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,047
I hike for fun.

271
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,173
An amateur.

272
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:00,009
Simply to keep him company
and my auntie happy.

273
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,385
He's my stepfather.

274
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,682
He says, no, don't worry.

275
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,517
He insists.

276
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,395
I didn't follow him,
I stayed down below.

277
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,273
Is that it?

278
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,984
It really wasn't very interesting.

279
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,528
You say that 'cause it's Thierry?

280
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,031
I thought we agreed not to judge.

281
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,157
No judging, OK?

282
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,661
That's the rule.
Without rules, I'm gone.

283
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,163
He's right.
If we're judged, we won't talk.

284
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,958
Sorry but what he says
is always kinda weird.

285
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,500
That's my point.

286
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,378
No, thanks.
On anti-depressants, I can't.

287
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,635
I'm in depression.

288
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,974
A major depression.

289
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,565
I don't really know where to begin.

290
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,864
Two years now, I've been off work.

291
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,078
So long, guys!

292
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,834
See you, Simon.

293
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,288
flap!

294
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,249
flaping shooot!

295
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,542
Claire?

296
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,296
Is there any brandy for Thibault?

297
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,297
There.

298
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,347
Take it from me,
this country's going to hell.

299
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,477
I see it at work every day. Believe me.

300
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,269
People have no respect.

301
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,151
You're very quiet, Bertrand.

302
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,611
All good?

303
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:24,904
Great.

304
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,199
Better.

305
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,657
No, good.

306
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,701
Claire said you do sports.

307
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,496
That's good. Great!

308
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,624
What kind of sport?

309
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,584
I signed up for a...

310
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,921
A swim team. Synchronized swimming.

311
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,756
Remind me what that is.

312
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,924
Like in those 50s movies?

313
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,720
Water ballet?

314
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:49,762
That's right.

315
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,097
Isn't it for...

316
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,348
I mean, it's...

317
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,017
For women? Sure.

318
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,602
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,771
- But this is for men.
- Great.

320
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,108
After all, women play soccer.

321
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,155
My offer of a job at the store
is still open.

322
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,451
Thanks, I appreciate it.

323
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,702
It's no big deal.

324
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,789
When did you last get away?

325
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,791
Ever since Bertrand....

326
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,837
What's that? Two years?

327
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,257
Something like that.

328
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,718
Two years is a lot, don't you think?

329
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,929
I mean,

330
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,056
six months, a year maybe.

331
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,223
But two years!

332
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,101
Sure, but it's two years. Period.

333
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,979
Nothing against Bertrand.
I love the guy.

334
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,690
I'm worried, that's all.

335
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,567
I know.

336
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,531
My little darling sister.

337
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,625
Bye!

338
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,501
Remind me, never again.

339
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,712
15 years I've been reminding you.

340
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,760
That's horrible. I'm horrible.

341
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,806
It's not normal
to have these thoughts.

342
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:15,932
What thoughts?

343
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,727
I had an atrocious vision in my mind...

344
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,353
A comet?

345
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,855
How do you know?

346
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,480
I had the same vision.

347
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,358
I saw a glimmer in the sky,
like a star,

348
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,444
but it was blue, red, green.

349
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:32,574
It's alive, headed for us,
dazzling, about to flatten us but...

350
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,535
It slams into your sister's BMW.

351
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,537
Explosions, screams, flames!

352
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,330
All dead!

353
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,458
Atrocious.

354
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm cold.

355
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,962
Let's go to bed.

356
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,011
Time, guys!

357
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,557
I know I'm a party pooper. Be cool.

358
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,519
I'm the one getting his knuckles
rapped by city hall.

359
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,940
9 o'clock does not mean 9:30.

360
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:10,028
If you want to stay later,
ask for permission.

361
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,071
Or go talk outside.

362
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,285
That's nonsense!

363
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,840
It's a thrill to see
so many of you here

364
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:16,970
for the fourth round
of the Interregional Water Polo Cup!

365
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,182
We have a water-themed
curtain-raiser for you.

366
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,810
They're nervous
before their first ever show.

367
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,439
Let's give a big hand

368
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,526
for our first
synchronized swim team for men.

369
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,193
That's right, for men!

370
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,278
Give it up!

371
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,560
That's your team?

372
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:36,883
Magnificent!

373
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,905
Let's hear it for them!

374
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,994
Never an easy discipline,
synchronized swimming.

375
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,416
Time now for the ball game!

376
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,042
Time for some water polo!

377
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,461
Our fourth-round match

378
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,297
between Jugnac

379
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,799
and Chevigny-Le-Ouin.

380
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,396
Team mates forever!

381
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,065
I'm so proud of you.

382
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,025
Bravo!

383
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,694
It was...

384
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,738
Bravo for what? We were shooot.

385
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,700
Look at them. Like they won the cup.

386
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,410
They're having fun.

387
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,743
They look happy.

388
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,621
Sure, they look happy.

389
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,039
Looking isn't being.

390
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,920
Sounds like
someone's more depressed than me.

391
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,387
Our first performance. It was insane.
The crowd went wild.

392
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,932
I'm super proud of the guys.

393
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,810
I just wanted to tell you.
Love you, bye.

394
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:14,897
Guys...

395
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,275
I gotta go or he'll go crazy.

396
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:18,317
- Sure?
- Yeah.

397
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,153
- Thanks, Delphine.
- See you. You were great!

398
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,867
I'll be going too. Need a ride?

399
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:28,286
With pleasure.

400
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,007
I've released seventeen CDs.

401
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,425
More or less self-produced.

402
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,094
Really? No kidding!

403
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,804
Not a single hit.

404
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:47,805
Not one.

405
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,142
I don't give a damn.

406
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,894
What I love doing
is singing, expressing myself.

407
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,395
Not selling records.

408
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,441
Sure, you have to stay free.

409
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,692
Exactly. Look at me!

410
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,238
How about this for freedom!

411
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,532
All this time,
did I ever ask for a favor?

412
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,451
Except the 3,000-euro loan.

413
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,203
Besides money. Let's elevate the debate.

414
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,623
I mean, a favor for a friend.

415
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,959
The poor guy has nothing in his life.

416
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,877
Home, the pool. The pool, home.

417
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,130
He needs to get laid.

418
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:24,174
I doubt he ever got laid in his life.

419
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,343
Sure, I did.

420
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,010
I've done it.

421
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:28,637
I made love.

422
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,765
Leave this to me, will you?

423
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,767
You bang me, right?

424
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,603
- So bang him. Same difference!
- Totally not.

425
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,065
Marcus, let it go.
I don't think she wants to.

426
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,441
No, she doesn't.

427
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,901
Let it go.

428
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,944
No, don't let it go, you jerk!

429
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:47,781
Did I upset you?

430
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,200
Guys, let's go.

431
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:50,701
Great job.

432
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,246
Pay up. I forgot my wallet.

433
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,873
You often forget it.

434
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,794
I'll pay you back tomorrow.
Here's the thing...

435
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,630
You won't get laid being a tightwad.

436
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,673
Women detest a tightwad.

437
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,343
Black mark for you
but I've got your back.

438
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,176
Wait!

439
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,555
No, my friend's buying.

440
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,557
Mr. Marcus!

441
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:13,766
What?

442
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,728
Sorry to bother you,
but we need to talk.

443
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,146
Duty calls, sorry.

444
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,940
I'm the boss, the CEO.

445
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,653
Have fun.
That button there changes the colors.

446
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,198
This can't go on.

447
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,115
What can't?

448
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,868
I told you 4 months ago.
Nothing happened.

449
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,413
Something has to give.
We owe 150,000

450
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,873
to our suppliers.

451
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,000
And no income to cover loans.

452
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:41,961
I'll get by.

453
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,589
You don't get it.
We'll be bankrupt before Xmas.

454
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,885
Before Xmas?

455
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,681
- You're sure of the math?
- Sure.

456
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,519
Call her a cab, will you, please?

457
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,233
Hello.

458
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,820
My name's Delphine. I'm an alcoholic.

459
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,449
I've been sober five years now.

460
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,701
It started when I was 26.

461
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,624
I was doing
artistic swimming in duet.

462
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,836
It was international level,
competing in championships.

463
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,381
And I won a lot of them.

464
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,799
We won a lot, my partner and I.

465
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,720
For me,
those were the best years of my life.

466
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:36,348
It was a wonderful time. Awesome.

467
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,226
And then...

468
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,561
Then came a major incident.

469
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,733
She was forced
to give up swimming with me.

470
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,568
To give up swimming, period.

471
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,363
Likewise for me.

472
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,156
My whole career had been with her.

473
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,867
Without her, it just wasn't right.

474
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,078
I think I...

475
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,707
I should've been there for her then.

476
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:06,712
Instead, I blamed her
for us being forced to quit.

477
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,340
Now I have only myself to blame.

478
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,802
Back then,
competition, the pool and stuff.

479
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,722
It left a hole in my life.

480
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,056
She...

481
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,141
left a hole in my life.

482
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,728
I was broken.

483
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,063
I couldn't see...

484
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,608
I was just surviving until the first,

485
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,820
you guessed it, gin and tonic.

486
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,489
I had never drunk alcohol.
It was my first time.

487
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:37,034
You can imagine what happened next.

488
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,119
Just falling.

489
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,081
I thought about ending it all.

490
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,543
What saved me

491
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,005
was, on the one hand, my team

492
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,257
of male synchronized swimmers.

493
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:56,137
Yes, I coach a team
with serious potential.

494
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,972
But what really hauled me
out of deep shooot...

495
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,144
As lame as it sounds...

496
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,856
It could be a line

497
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,690
from music in a supermarket...

498
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,318
Was love.

499
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,489
Saying it now, I could slap myself,
but it's true.

500
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,076
He saved my life.

501
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,213
Hi Serge, this is Bertrand,
our new hire.

502
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:32,965
Show him the ropes.

503
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,177
I won't put you here
until you're up to speed.

504
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,846
Morning, ma'am. Excellent choice.

505
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,972
Hey, guys, break over!

506
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,976
Here, we have the high-end models.

507
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,356
This is the cafeteria-slash-break room.

508
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,983
Staff come here for coffee and stuff.

509
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,318
What's going on here?

510
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,530
Your uniform.

511
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,996
We have a Bertrand with great sales.
I can't...

512
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:05,998
See?

513
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,960
Welcome. See you in convertibles
for a briefing.

514
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,878
Convertibles?

515
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,672
Sofas.

516
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,882
This is a furniture store.

517
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,800
It's gotta go faster up there.

518
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,385
See you later.

519
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,016
- You thought it over?
- I'm not quite sure but yes.

520
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,268
Thought what over?

521
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,561
- His foreign language option.
- And?

522
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,063
I think

523
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,731
I'll go for Spanish.

524
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,067
Spanish?

525
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,985
You think or you're sure?

526
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,070
Sure, I guess.

527
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,239
Spanish gets you nowhere.

528
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,909
- Spanish gets you nowhere?
- Nowhere.

529
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,452
Why take Spanish?

530
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,414
Our roots.

531
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,750
I mean, yours and granny's.

532
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:51,918
Who said that?

533
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,170
You said that?

534
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,338
About my mother?

535
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,965
Why talk about her?

536
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,925
Dad, please. Calm down.

537
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,552
Are you stupid or what?

538
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,429
Why stir up all that shooot?

539
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:03,431
Stop, dammit!

540
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:04,556
Stop it!

541
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,737
If you want,
I'll make pancakes tonight, OK?

542
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,619
So we're patched through here.

543
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:27,621
And here.

544
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,123
Look. See how it works?

545
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,418
Yes.

546
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,795
- You're sure?
- Yes.

547
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,840
Imagine the pump
fails to start one night.

548
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,550
An alert flashes up. What do you do?

549
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,804
I use the mouse and I tap on...

550
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,351
- I tap on...
- "I click."

551
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:51,771
"Tap" works too, right?
If I prefer.

552
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:52,563
I guess.

553
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,483
That's an interesting word, click.

554
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,652
Where does that come from? Click?

555
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,862
- Thierry, it's late.
- Yes.

556
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,032
The pH level is shown by this line.

557
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,742
At midnight, it kicks in automatically.

558
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:08,119
Cover, filter, water level,
pH levels, everything.

559
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,831
Alright.

560
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,126
So what do I do?

561
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,545
Nothing. The computer runs it.

562
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,925
So what's the point of me?

563
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,844
You put away the floats.

564
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,833
Where are you?

565
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,253
Where?

566
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,041
Stupid animals, cats.

567
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,670
Mr. Marcus?

568
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,757
Nobody ever taught you to knock?

569
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:28,927
You still haven't paid my wages.
Four months is too long.

570
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,014
- Really? How much do I owe you?
- 5,600 euros.

571
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,474
5,600! Gracious.

572
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,893
Where did I put my checkbook?

573
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,563
Nicolas, first of all,
see that sign we're so proud of?

574
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,690
- My check.
- What does it say?

575
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,527
My check, nonsense!
What does the sign say?

576
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,487
PoolLove!

577
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,405
Pools sold with love. From the heart.

578
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,076
In a world of people
withdrawing into themselves,

579
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,077
fear sweeps the streets but we...

580
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,204
I want my check!

581
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,081
"I want my check"?

582
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,875
No more memories?
No more smiles? No more...

583
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,543
I have work to do.

584
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,838
Tell me when it's ready!

585
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,300
I'll write your damn check!
I'll write it right now!

586
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,597
Instead of PoolLove, go work
at PoolCash. I'll write your check.

587
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:15,557
- Do it!
- When I find my pen.

588
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,978
I'll add an extra 100
just to shut your big mouth!

589
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,980
Anyway, it'll bounce.

590
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,773
Tell it to the court!

591
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,650
Tell what to the court?

592
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,862
The court will be delighted
to hear you deal drugs at work.

593
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,612
Let's see how that flies.

594
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:32,824
- What's up now?
- Where's the van?

595
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,286
No idea. Wherever you left it.

596
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,329
I didn't touch it!

597
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,456
This is very serious, Nicolas.

598
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,751
Whatever you did with the van,
you can tell me. Shoot.

599
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,128
I just told you, I didn't touch it.

600
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:49,842
Holy shooot!

601
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,016
I'm cursed!
Why are you tormenting me?

602
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,018
What did I do to deserve this?

603
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,644
No matter...

604
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:04,398
Let's not get our panties in a wad.

605
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,108
Hurry to the police, report the theft.

606
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,235
I'll file the insurance claim.

607
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,905
No, forget the insurance.
We stopped paying.

608
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,865
A waste of money, you said.

609
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:17,702
- What did I say?
- That insurance was a waste of money.

610
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,094
Lola!

611
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,768
Happy birthday, sweetie.

612
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,686
You'll see, I nailed it.

613
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:44,938
Unlike last year.

614
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:46,440
Sure.

615
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:47,942
Open it.

616
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,108
Later.

617
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:51,237
- C'mon, open it.
- No, later.

618
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,030
- How come?
- Back off!

619
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,407
I'll open it at home.

620
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,092
Hello.

621
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,177
I wanted to tell you guys...

622
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:19,181
Go ahead, sorry.

623
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,182
You wanna talk? No problem.

624
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,726
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

625
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:27,438
It's not easy.

626
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,942
I feel like...

627
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,028
Everything I touch is destined to fail.

628
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,492
I'd have loved to be a guy...

629
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,829
One of those guys you see on TV,

630
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:44,373
those guys snapping their fingers...

631
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,626
Moving and shaking, making it happen.

632
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,503
An entrepreneur.

633
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,507
Kind of like Michael Douglas
in <i>Wall Street</i>, you see?

634
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,639
I guess being held back in 5th grade
wasn't a good sign.

635
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:06,936
People say, believe in your dreams,
they'll come true.

636
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:08,688
It's a lie.

637
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:10,815
I'm in deep shooot, guys.

638
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,572
I'm this far from going bankrupt.
For the fourth time.

639
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:23,036
One year here and nobody knows,
nobody gives a damn about my pools.

640
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,623
What lunatic would build a pool
in this neck of the woods?

641
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,833
Me.

642
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,670
That's sweet, Thierry.

643
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,007
As my ex-wife used to say,

644
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,885
Marcus, it's not only your pools
that are cracked.

645
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:43,724
Anyway, sorry...

646
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,039
<i>synchronized swimming men</i>

647
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:54,795
flap a duck!

648
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,280
Japan, Germany, New Zealand...

649
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,659
- Every country!
- The world championships!

650
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,452
Italy...

651
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,413
England, Portugal...

652
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,081
We'll take down Portugal.

653
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,331
How come?

654
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,333
Portugal, come on!

655
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,086
- When is it?
- April.

656
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,173
- Is that enough time?
- Enough time?

657
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,507
For training.

658
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,594
Seriously? Check out the competition.

659
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,596
- So?
- Yeah!

660
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:48,306
It's in Norway. It'll cost a fortune.

661
00:46:48,474 --> 00:46:50,391
We're just thinking out loud.

662
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,059
I say no out loud.

663
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:53,603
You say no out loud?

664
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,063
Just like that.

665
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,398
How about you tell us why?

666
00:46:58,192 --> 00:47:02,070
We suck as the warm-up act
at a crappy regional championship.

667
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,780
Wake up!

668
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,657
World championships!

669
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,909
It's pure fantasy.

670
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:10,369
Fantasy, reality.
You get the difference?

671
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:15,041
If you were so right, you'd lose
the condescending asshole air.

672
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,630
You wouldn't be telling
a bunch of losers that they're losers.

673
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:24,635
Two things you're cruelly lacking
are sympathy and enthusiasm.

674
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,094
And a smile. 3 things!

675
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,389
We'd appreciate it
if you'd leave the losers alone.

676
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,893
You're team spokesman now, are you?

677
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,686
Just like you, so far.

678
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,233
This is bullshit! Look at him...

679
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,818
He's a washout whose life is a mess.

680
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,277
Sorry, I forgot.

681
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:44,530
He's in depression.

682
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:48,492
In depression?
It's an excuse and you know it.

683
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,913
You're a flake, beating yourself up
about flunking on your dreams.

684
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,998
You have a monopoly on depression?

685
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,626
It's got us all. All of us!

686
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,880
For a year now, we've shared our lives,
talking and training.

687
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,423
Sure, I'm a loudmouth.

688
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,594
Sure, I'm pissed off.
But I don't lie to them or myself.

689
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,806
I know I'm a loser
but that's fine by me.

690
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:15,226
Why go lose my last shred of dignity
'cause an angry jerk decrees it?

691
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,896
This asshole doesn't need a medal
to solve his problems.

692
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,148
I think we could all use a medal.

693
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,458
He's right.

694
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,295
Let's vote on it. Who's in favor?

695
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:44,422
OK, it's agreed!

696
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,340
Sign us up.

697
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,550
What do I put?

698
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,010
Team France.

699
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:52,431
- TF for short.
- Sounds like WTF. That sucks.

700
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,224
- Sucks ass!
- Grow up.

701
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:58,603
Men's Synchronized Swimming
Team of France.

702
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,731
That makes MSSFT.

703
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:02,773
No, MSSTF.

704
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,902
Stop! Just put Team France.

705
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,947
Why not The Human Dolphins?

706
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,617
Knock it off, Thierry.

707
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:14,286
Just put Team France.

708
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:17,246
- Caps.
- There, E!

709
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,793
You type like a cop, Thierry!

710
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:29,885
We are Team France!

711
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,179
- Look at you!
- That's us!

712
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,682
Why are you like this?

713
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:40,603
What's blocking you?
What makes you block everything?

714
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,396
Why are you a pain in the ass?

715
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,523
I'm not.

716
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,485
Pain in the ass!
Come and drink with us!

717
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:47,777
See?

718
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:13,512
We're gonna practice
your entry in the water.

719
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,472
You dive like potatoes.

720
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,641
- I disagree...
- I said like potatoes.

721
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,559
I want you to scythe
through air and water.

722
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,938
You scythe through neither.

723
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,150
You need to scream and leap,
leap and scream.

724
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:28,652
It's today's exercise.

725
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:31,028
It must be a primal scream,
so listen up.

726
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,657
In turn, without thinking,
launch yourselves and yell a word.

727
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,702
The first word that comes to mind.

728
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,369
Jump or dive?

729
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,954
I believe I said dive.

730
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,916
- This is ridiculous.
- No, you're ridiculous.

731
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,501
Don't think, do it.

732
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,420
Let's go!

733
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,713
Ridiculous!

734
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,963
Mortgage!

735
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,632
Prozac!

736
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,800
Smokieblankieflash!

737
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,971
He didn't get the idea.

738
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,556
No, he didn't get it.

739
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,809
5, 6, 7, 8...

740
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,478
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

741
00:51:05,856 --> 00:51:08,858
Guys, it's crap!
You're so not in sync.

742
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,318
You're kidding me.

743
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:13,280
You're floppy,
floppier than anything I ever saw!

744
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:14,364
Let's go again.

745
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:19,827
Bravo, guys. Great job!

746
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:22,998
Practice over.

747
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:26,960
Give yourselves a big hand.
That was extraordinary!

748
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,128
We're here.

749
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,045
No, we're up here!

750
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,630
Let's go!

751
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,010
You're hitting your peak! Artists!

752
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,179
I'm seeing aquatic artists!
The real deal!

753
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:41,557
I know them when I see them!
In all modesty, big up!

754
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,809
That was something else.

755
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:45,269
Locker room.

756
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:46,896
Champions!

757
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:01,536
My champs!

758
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:05,831
"Sweet sound of rain
On the earth and roofs

759
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,293
"For a heart that wanes

760
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,047
"Sweet is the song of rain"

761
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,175
- What are you doing?
- The robot dance.

762
00:52:15,342 --> 00:52:17,177
- That's not right.
- It is.

763
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:18,969
It's terrible.

764
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,190
OK, great. That was amazing.

765
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,110
Most people can't tell man from machine.

766
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:39,199
I introduced the robot dance
into France, back in '82.

767
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:40,534
Delphine!

768
00:52:40,951 --> 00:52:42,619
Come over here, will you?

769
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:44,329
Come on!

770
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,541
I wanna talk, dammit!

771
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,626
You realize what you're doing?

772
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,920
Don't touch me! Butt out!

773
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,965
Don't come by, don't call me.
Leave me alone!

774
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,927
I don't love you, I never loved you.

775
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:01,721
Two years since we broke up. Jesus!

776
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,559
I have a wife and baby.
How do I get it into your head?

777
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,269
Stupid bitch, you're wrecking my life!

778
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:09,728
Beat it!

779
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,275
I reported her to the cops, OK?

780
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:47,601
- It's full of fungi.
- Bullshit! It's super chlorinated.

781
00:53:57,485 --> 00:53:58,777
Let's go.

782
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,405
Take it easy, go over the...

783
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,702
The choreography.

784
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,293
Come on!

785
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,050
Get in the water!

786
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,619
You dumb bitch!

787
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,757
Hold on, let me...

788
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:04,302
Did I ask for anything?

789
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,514
- I'm lending a hand.
- Scratch your ass with it. In line!

790
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:14,269
You really think
you're gonna win like this?

791
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,438
We just wanna take part.

792
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,108
Excuse me?

793
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,818
We just wanna take part.

794
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,152
- Sonofabitch!
- You're nuts!

795
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,905
I'm what?

796
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,532
Nothing!

797
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,119
Fun's over! We're going for a run.

798
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,869
I don't have my running gear.

799
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:33,998
No problem.

800
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,380
Let's go!

801
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:41,755
Move it!

802
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,509
Keep going!

803
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,594
Run! Eyes front!

804
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,554
Move that fat ass!

805
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:49,556
shooot!

806
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:50,639
Stand up!

807
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,184
Cut the crap and run! Move!

808
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,105
Come and explain the respiratory system.

809
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:00,442
The respiratory system

810
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:01,943
works...

811
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,320
I know it.

812
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,326
Sit down!

813
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,661
F...

814
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:13,246
C...

815
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,414
From the top! C...

816
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,751
It's not the Sri Lankan alphabet!

817
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,545
16...

818
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:22,713
17...

819
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,340
C'mon, assholes!

820
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,592
You just wanna take part?

821
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,429
I'll show you taking part!

822
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:31,056
We're here to win!

823
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:34,266
Air enters the buccal cavity.
The mouth.

824
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:37,228
Fine particles go through the trachea.

825
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:41,065
For right or left lung, air goes down...

826
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,608
You have no idea!

827
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:43,943
Back to your seat!

828
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,527
I told you to learn it!

829
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:47,362
Theory is very important.

830
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,365
No stopping! No walking!

831
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,536
I'll teach you what effort means!

832
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,039
Delphine?

833
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:02,045
I passed by the bank.
They said you were off sick.

834
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,257
Some mail came for you at the pool.

835
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:12,347
And I should tell you,
your friend is coaching us now.

836
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:17,393
She says we suck but there's no reason
for the others to be any better.

837
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:21,313
We've really improved.
You should see it.

838
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,777
The thing is, she doesn't read to us
and she's mean.

839
00:57:27,237 --> 00:57:29,489
Marcus says she's a bitch,

840
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,782
but I think

841
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:34,244
maybe she's a little

842
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:35,536
shy.

843
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,000
I don't know if you're there or not,
but I hope you're good.

844
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,385
She'll be happy to see you.
She gets few visitors.

845
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:53,387
Except your sister
at Christmas and birthdays.

846
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:56,807
That is your sister?
Plump, quite pretty.

847
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,184
My half-sister.

848
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,853
Fresh, isn't she?

849
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,105
I don't know.

850
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:03,565
This way.

851
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,817
Under the trees.

852
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,778
I should warn you, don't expect...

853
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,239
You know.

854
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,115
She's still...

855
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,159
She's still my mother. I know.

856
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,163
I'll be going.

857
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:19,246
Thank you.

858
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,474
Hello, mom.

859
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,063
My son! You came to see me.

860
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,442
That makes me so happy.

861
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:49,568
Same here.

862
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:54,324
Sorry I couldn't come more often but...

863
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,702
Honey, you have your life.
It's only normal.

864
00:58:57,911 --> 00:59:00,329
How's Diane? And the little one?

865
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:03,248
They're good. They send their love.

866
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:06,251
Weather's good.

867
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,880
You're not too warm in that coat?

868
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:13,635
There's always a nice breeze
under the trees. It's pleasant.

869
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:19,641
You still have
your horrendous face, though.

870
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:22,101
Astonishing how ugly you are.

871
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:26,231
Your idiot father was no oil painting
but you are hideous.

872
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,356
Ghastly.

873
00:59:28,775 --> 00:59:31,068
You selfish piece of shooot.

874
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,278
Look at you, little vermin.

875
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,782
That rotten, shapeless face of yours.

876
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,076
Alright, mom.

877
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,079
Alright, mom!
That's all you can say.

878
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:44,248
Why didn't I stab my gut
rather than endure your ugliness

879
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,541
my entire life?

880
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,876
That's right, beat it!

881
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,503
You're ugly!

882
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:51,297
You're gruesome!

883
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,550
Listen up, fatties!

884
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,719
There's a question maybe needs asking.

885
00:59:58,096 --> 00:59:59,972
What music do you plan to use?

886
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:03,101
We need something dynamic and upbeat.

887
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:06,353
You think so?
I had in mind sluggish and limp.

888
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,606
No, that's terrible. People will...

889
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:09,773
Not another word.

890
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:11,943
- It's gotta be rock.
- Well?

891
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,487
Not salsa! No way!

892
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:16,822
<i>My Rocking Heart?</i>

893
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,199
Something with oomph.

894
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,784
Opera would be stunning.

895
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,619
<i>Melissa My Babe From Ibiza!</i>

896
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:22,786
Rap. Has to be.

897
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:25,414
A track we relate to,
that tells our story.

898
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,333
He's right. From our heyday.
A song like us.

899
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:29,376
We're old.

900
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,335
We're not old!

901
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:34,172
We are, but we have to own it,
find music that's a fit.

902
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,382
<i>The Chick in Nylons?</i>

903
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,759
You like power pop.

904
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:37,677
Love it!

905
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:38,802
Stop now.

906
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:42,472
No rhythm.

907
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,349
He had a swim team.

908
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,019
- Your brain's a sewer.
- It's impressive.

909
01:00:50,273 --> 01:00:51,815
Some great arm movements.

910
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,610
I like that. Or Led Zep or U2.

911
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,570
Radiohead?

912
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:58,614
- What?
- Radiohead.

913
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:07,706
Simon!

914
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,083
Just a second.

915
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:23,431
- See you, Jean-Luc.
- Bye.

916
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:29,728
Serge can't work Thursday night.

917
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:32,023
You'll replace him.

918
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:34,400
But I have practice.

919
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:36,735
Maybe so.

920
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:46,661
Feet in the middle.

921
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:49,916
Don't forget to breathe.

922
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,086
Point those toes!

923
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,255
Feet in the middle!

924
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,092
What the hell, Avanish?

925
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:02,887
Get your feet in the middle!

926
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:05,222
Scull!

927
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:10,018
It's shooot!

928
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,938
It's shooot! It's pointless!

929
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:13,398
Who's the base?

930
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:14,898
What's a base?

931
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,525
What's a base?

932
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,653
You must be joking.

933
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,782
You're going to the Worlds
without a base?

934
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:28,246
The base is the guy
who holds his breath!

935
01:02:28,913 --> 01:02:30,748
Who can hold his breath?

936
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:02,280
47 seconds. Useless!

937
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:05,574
I coach little girls
who do two minutes!

938
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,617
And you?

939
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:11,204
No base means no lifts,
no star, no show, no Worlds!

940
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:12,914
From now on,

941
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,668
you all stop breathing!

942
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,088
47 seconds.

943
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,425
Sure, it sucks!

944
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,971
I am not lying.

945
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,472
You, 47. Me, 1.10.

946
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:46,949
I'd take my first drink
and throw it down the sink.

947
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,742
I'd only drink the second.

948
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:52,163
Merrily, carefree.

949
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:54,956
Silly, isn't it?

950
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,840
Attention to detail
makes all the difference.

951
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,677
Same outfit, same trunks, all in black.

952
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:08,387
We're a team, we look good.

953
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:11,849
In this day and age,
image is crucial, Laurent. Crucial!

954
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:15,811
I don't give a shooot about image.
People obsess about it.

955
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,313
I couldn't agree more.

956
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:19,731
I totally agree.

957
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,027
On the other hand,
it's our modern-day reality.

958
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,655
Good job, Titi!

959
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:29,699
I'd love to screw the system
but image is everything.

960
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,621
I did three lengths! Three!

961
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,208
After the second, I had nothing left,
I started to come up.

962
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:41,295
But I wanted to keep going.
So you know what?

963
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:44,297
I thought of my stepfather.

964
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,925
He was a bizarre man.

965
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:48,219
Some nights, he came into my room.

966
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,429
He put me in a headlock like that

967
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,599
and burned my eyelashes
with his cigarillos.

968
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:57,519
But only when my mom worked nights.

969
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,981
Whenever I heard him come upstairs,

970
01:05:00,565 --> 01:05:02,817
I hid in the laundry basket

971
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,777
and held my breath
so I wouldn't make a noise.

972
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,155
On my third length just now,

973
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:10,074
I remembered that basket.

974
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,367
And I did it!

975
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:12,994
I did it!

976
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,121
It's all in the mind.

977
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,378
My ear's clogged up.

978
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,137
You cannot deny
that style is important.

979
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:33,889
How much does style come in at?

980
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,057
All inclusive?

981
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,768
289 euros.

982
01:05:38,728 --> 01:05:39,728
The whole lot?

983
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,105
Per person.

984
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:43,523
But it includes trunks, robe...

985
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,818
You're nuts! They can't even pay rent.

986
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:48,070
Which is why I have a plan B.

987
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:49,905
Plan Foxy.

988
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:51,824
- Wanna hear it?
- No.

989
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,992
I'll tell you anyway. Listen.

990
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,083
You're shitting me?

991
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,923
I'm messing with you!

992
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:16,264
Those are maki.

993
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:18,059
I said sushi, not maki!

994
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,309
I hate maki.

995
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:22,063
Alright, give me them. Come on.

996
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:23,230
Gimme.

997
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,152
Yeah, what?

998
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,155
Nothing.

999
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,884
What do you think?

1000
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,637
Imagine it with bass and drums.

1001
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:56,764
Great.

1002
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,224
Really good.

1003
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:05,690
How much?

1004
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:08,943
259 euros.

1005
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,277
- Too much.
- No way!

1006
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,280
How about we stay mismatched?

1007
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,202
I knew you'd say that.

1008
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:20,454
Which is why I have

1009
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:21,996
a plan B.

1010
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,164
Plan Foxy.

1011
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,291
Why Foxy?

1012
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:25,876
Because it's sly.

1013
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,086
True. Foxes are sly.

1014
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:31,297
Wanna hear it?

1015
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:36,177
<i>My plan has got every detail down.</i>

1016
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:41,016
<i>Just pile the gear in a cart
like a regular customer.</i>

1017
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:45,186
<i>Use pliers from Home Improvement
to cut the emergency exit chain.</i>

1018
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,023
<i>The door opens onto the parking lot.</i>

1019
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,775
<i>The getaway car waits there,</i>

1020
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:52,235
<i>ready to burn rubber.</i>

1021
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,802
We get a lot of theft but come on!

1022
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:01,012
Bathing suits! How old are you?

1023
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:02,305
53.

1024
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,140
- 38.
- 41 and a half.

1025
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,725
We're not proud, you know.

1026
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:07,811
You pay up
or we call the cops?

1027
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:08,895
Easy, easy.

1028
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:10,730
We'll pay up, of course.

1029
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,443
- Thierry...
- What?

1030
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,944
You got a checkbook?

1031
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:17,404
Perhaps.

1032
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,532
- Pay.
- Certainly not.

1033
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,368
Call the police.

1034
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,663
- How much is it?
- 1,258 euros.

1035
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,257
Let's go!

1036
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:42,345
Cool it, we paid.

1037
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:44,597
Calm down.

1038
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,435
I'm not kidding, pay me back fast.

1039
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,689
I'm sick of being your fool.

1040
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,899
I never make a fool of you. Never.

1041
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:55,067
Not you, him!

1042
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:56,109
Me?

1043
01:09:56,277 --> 01:09:59,488
I tell him about my love life
and he makes a fool of me.

1044
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,949
Get to know people
before judging them.

1045
01:10:03,993 --> 01:10:05,368
I'm an iceberg.

1046
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,954
I only let people see the tip.

1047
01:10:08,122 --> 01:10:09,247
The bit underwater...

1048
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,582
The submerged part.

1049
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:11,625
Exactly.

1050
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:15,128
That bit has made love
to countless women.

1051
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,671
A lot.

1052
01:10:17,715 --> 01:10:19,841
Countless means what exactly?

1053
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:21,594
Keep your nose out!

1054
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,637
We're your friends. Tell us how many.

1055
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,722
One?

1056
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,641
Two?

1057
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:31,770
Three?

1058
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:33,354
There you go.

1059
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,899
Three?

1060
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,025
I'm nobody's fool now!

1061
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,447
One thing's for sure, we have style.

1062
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,212
Don't worry.

1063
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,381
What Marcus breaks, Marcus fixes.

1064
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:03,051
- Leave your wife to me.
- That may not be a good idea.

1065
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:16,064
That black look in her eye...

1066
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,399
A woman of character. Aries, right?

1067
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,069
My sister's Aries.

1068
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,448
No, it's not...

1069
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:30,453
See you tomorrow, Bertrand!

1070
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:31,622
Hi, Claire.

1071
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:54,144
- How's it going?
- Good.

1072
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,771
And with your mother?

1073
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:59,108
Badly, but it always has with her,

1074
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:00,693
so let's say we're fine.

1075
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,819
Thanks for all you do for her.

1076
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:04,529
You're welcome. It's my job.

1077
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,280
You do it well.

1078
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,951
It wasn't always the case.

1079
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,703
I wanted to race motorcycles.

1080
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,332
Trouble is, I'm no competitor.

1081
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,917
Stress management close to zero.

1082
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,547
- Who are the anxiolytics for?
- Mrs. Chamblain.

1083
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:24,716
- She already had hers.
- Sure?

1084
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,060
I was hired for six months
and here I am.

1085
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,896
I thought
I wouldn't stick it out 3 days.

1086
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:39,898
How come?

1087
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,190
The smell.

1088
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:46,154
It's a terrible thing to say,
and I shouldn't, but it's the truth.

1089
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,573
Old folks stink.

1090
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,073
They stink horribly.

1091
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,368
You arrive, it's clean,
they're showered, all good.

1092
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,287
But when they wake up,

1093
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:55,997
it's like a zoo here.

1094
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:57,248
Carnage.

1095
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:05,256
Morning, sir.

1096
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,011
I developed a technique
to do a whole room...

1097
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,347
Sheets, bedpan, basic ablutions...

1098
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:15,600
while holding my breath.

1099
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,708
A whole room?

1100
01:13:41,085 --> 01:13:41,960
Yes.

1101
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,628
Without a breath?

1102
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:44,837
Yes.

1103
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,483
- How long?
- 3 minutes 52.

1104
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:07,027
Is that good?

1105
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:09,654
Not bad.

1106
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:10,948
No, it's decent.

1107
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:12,533
It's great!

1108
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:13,826
No, it's decent.

1109
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:18,122
I'm gonna play you a track.

1110
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,750
It's a bit intimidating
in front of you all.

1111
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:25,962
Feel free to say what you think,
even if you don't like it.

1112
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,256
It needs mixing and arranging.

1113
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,800
It's a rough draft.

1114
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,052
But try to imagine what it'll be like

1115
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,137
when I finish it.

1116
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:35,264
There we go.

1117
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,390
Now I'll...

1118
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,684
- Go for it.
- Yeah, here goes.

1119
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,226
I'm so nervous.

1120
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,381
You OK?

1121
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:11,048
You're asking me that?

1122
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:12,759
Sure, why?

1123
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,304
I'm amazed you'd be interested.

1124
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,347
Thank you for the present.

1125
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,850
You're welcome, sweetie.

1126
01:15:21,185 --> 01:15:22,685
I didn't mess up?

1127
01:15:22,853 --> 01:15:26,439
No, it's exactly what I wanted.
Except for the color.

1128
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,109
So it's not exactly what you wanted.

1129
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,362
Which color did you want?

1130
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,407
Blue's good but red's really good too.

1131
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:36,908
So we have a problem.

1132
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:38,993
Blue's blue. It's not red.

1133
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:41,622
Forget that
and this sponge is your fate.

1134
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,377
Don't you have class?

1135
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,430
I thought
it'd be a great surprise for them.

1136
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,891
I expected to get an ovation
but nobody even clapped.

1137
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,560
They said nothing.

1138
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:04,770
Nothing.

1139
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:06,688
Pathetic.

1140
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,399
I wasn't there to hear it but...

1141
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:13,945
Maybe they were right not to clap.

1142
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:17,908
I have talent. I have serious talent.

1143
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,534
Lots of people will tell you.

1144
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,247
At the conservatory,
I was the next big star.

1145
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,082
I had something. That extra something.

1146
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:30,587
Maybe I didn't make the right choices.

1147
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,588
That's not what I'm saying, dad.

1148
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:34,800
Maybe they were right not to clap.

1149
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:37,094
Maybe they were wrong too.

1150
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,512
So lots of people are wrong?

1151
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,932
Lots doesn't make it right.

1152
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,519
Dad, sorry to break it to you but...

1153
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,439
I mean it's not...

1154
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,193
You're not David Bowie.

1155
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,154
You never were and never will be.

1156
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:01,033
I'm sad you don't see
glory isn't around the corner.

1157
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:03,328
It never was and never will be.

1158
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,789
You understand?

1159
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,262
Maybe so, but I hold onto my dreams.

1160
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,225
Holding onto your dreams is important.

1161
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,851
That's your dream?

1162
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,064
Your concerts?

1163
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,524
Your RV?

1164
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,278
Autographs for people
who don't know you?

1165
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:37,695
That's your dream?

1166
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:47,413
Remember dancing on my shoulders?

1167
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,832
Sure. Why bring that up now?

1168
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:50,792
No reason.

1169
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:53,795
Because it was fun.

1170
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,340
It was when I was little.

1171
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,382
Way back when.

1172
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:19,945
Seriously, we're doing good.

1173
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,530
Don't you think?

1174
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:23,240
We're doing good, sure.

1175
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:26,328
Your drama class? Enjoying it?

1176
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,453
Totally.

1177
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,432
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

1178
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,189
C'mon, keep going!

1179
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:56,733
Energy, guys!

1180
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:02,988
I hate her.

1181
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,240
I detest her.

1182
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,796
It'll be alright, buddy.
We can do this.

1183
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,012
OK?

1184
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:28,265
No.

1185
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,979
I'm going to kill her.

1186
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,690
- Too fast!
- Come again?

1187
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:39,234
It's too fast!

1188
01:19:39,443 --> 01:19:40,652
Shut your big mouth!

1189
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,404
It's impossible, too hard.

1190
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:46,490
Open it when you're not shooot anymore!
What are you doing?

1191
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:49,578
I'm ashamed! Look at you!

1192
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,372
I'm sick of coaching
worthless pieces of shooot!

1193
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:55,542
You're useless! Why do I bother?

1194
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,127
I don't believe this!

1195
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,212
Laurent, back in the water!

1196
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,423
You're shooot! Useless pieces of shooot!

1197
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:05,676
It's the last time!
I bust my ass for you for weeks!

1198

You think I do it for me?

1202
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:25,197
I'm doing it for you.

1203
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:26,323
I know.

1204
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,240
I'm sorry, it was on impulse.

1205
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,578
You're running out of time, dammit!

1206
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:33,747
- Yeah, we know.
- So?

1207
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,957
If I were you guys,
I'd do so flaping much!

1208
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,213
- Better?
- Fine, thanks.

1209
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,842
I apologize again, I'm really sorry.

1210
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,177
It's already forgotten.

1211
01:20:48,345 --> 01:20:50,514
- You had to let it out.
- Yes, sorry.

1212
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:52,390
Now rest up.

1213
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,811
Miss Ironside will dial it down now.

1214
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:02,984
Two hours, you tubby bastards!

1215

Two hours in the sauna!

Amanda!

1219
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,619
It was an accident!

1220
01:21:13,787 --> 01:21:14,787
Shut it!

1221
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,167
Let's lay a trap for her.

1222
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:23,963
We'll dig a hole and lure her into it.

1223
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,298
He's right.

1224
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:27,341
Who's in?

1225
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:38,853
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

1226
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,355
It tastes great.

1227
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:43,440
How did it go?

1228
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:44,525
Great.

1229
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:49,322
At the pool today,
Marcus tried to unscrew Amanda's wheels.

1230
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:51,908
It's going to end badly.

1231
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,326
It won't work.

1232
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:15,515
Are you keeping up back there?

1233
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:17,684
Go, go, go!

1234
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,815
Run! Extract your fingers
from your asses!

1235
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:26,693
7 minutes more!

1236
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:30,779
What the hell?

1237
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,699
He can't go on. He can't take any more.

1238
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:35,452
- What the...
- Just a second.

1239
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,203

1240
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:39,747
I'm done, enough.

1241
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,707
I can do nothing for them.

1242
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,793
You have to talk to them.

1243
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:46,837
- Talk to them?
- Yes.

1244
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:48,213
About what?

1245
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,676
Just talk.

01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,658
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

1265
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,161
Like I have for 25 years, asshole!

1266
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:06,412
Precisely.

1267
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:08,872
Here we are.

1268
01:26:13,211 --> 01:26:15,046
Thank you, son. It's magnificent.

1269
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:19,509
Come here.

1270
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,511
Come on.

1271
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,354
Bastard!

1272
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:35,233
I despise you and your shithole house!

1273
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:36,943
You're a shooot stain!

1274
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,695
It's ugly here! It's hideous!

1275
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:43,283
I was looking all over for you.

1276
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:47,494
- Nice, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1277
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,912
Very comfortable.

1278
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:52,750
Sure, but you'd need
cancer of good taste to buy it.

1279
01:26:55,712 --> 01:26:58,672
Your pitch explains
why your sales are so low.

1280
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,719
Everything here speaks for itself.
Maybe that's the problem.

1281
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:06,722
You never tried opening a section
for non-ugly furniture?

1282
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:09,350
Not easy on the eye,

1283
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,394
maybe, just not an eyesore.

1284
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,271
I appreciate the advice.

1285
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:16,106
My pleasure. You give me lots.

1286
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:17,358
You need it.

1287
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,153
Such as, try standing.

1288
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,570
I totally agree.

1289
01:27:21,738 --> 01:27:23,864
But I look around and think...

1290
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,449
Zero customers!

1291
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:27,702
So I stay seated.

1292
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:30,954
Surely it's more annoying
to have zero customers

1293
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:33,123
than to know I'm on the couch.

1294
01:27:42,926 --> 01:27:44,426
You're a grade-A jerk!

1295
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:50,140
Your wife works to keep you
while you're in a pool acting the fairy.

1296
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:53,019
You aim to be a world champion faggot.

1297
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:55,563
You're ridiculous. Know what?

1298
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,106
I never could take your stupid mug.

1299
01:27:58,274 --> 01:27:59,233
Never could.

1300
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,860
But you weren't so cocky then.

1301
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:05,489
Fair enough, we don't like each other,

1302
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,658
but it's not our fault. Get it?

1303
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:10,536
You and me,
we'd never choose to be buddies.

1304
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:12,579
Our meeting was a twist of fate.

1305
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:14,247
I can't be mad at you.

1306
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:17,335
So I'll never insult you
the way you insult me.

1307
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:27,095
However,
you are one hell of a douchebag.

1308
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:29,721
Why shouldn't I tell you?

1309
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:33,600
One hell of a douchebag
married to one hell of a shitbag.

1310
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,104
You're right, that feels so good.

1311
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,271
For sure.

1312
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:39,439
I'm not done.

1313
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:43,194
I'd abandon your kids in a forest.
I just wanted to add that.

1314
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:46,072
- Outside?
- Yup.

1315
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,756
And you just take it
without saying a word.

1316
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:06,050
You don't complain, you don't care!

1317
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,802
When will you see him
for the jerk he is?

1318
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,220
He's a jerk!

1319
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,097
Open your eyes, Claire!

1320
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,858
- You called him a douchebag?
- I certainly did.

1321
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:24,109
They're family, Bertrand, see?

1322
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:25,528
A family of douchebags.

1323
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,823
- You embarrass me.
- How come?

1324
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:31,117
By speaking my mind at last?

1325
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:33,744
By breathing again?

1326
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:38,332
Or by being a laughing stock
for swimming in a pool?

1327
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:41,043
You don't swim, you sink. Admit it.

1328
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,712
So subtle. "You don't swim, you sink!"

1329
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,136
And you got your ass kicked.

1330
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,972
I was on top at the start.

1331
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:12,658
Well...

1332
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:22,292
The buds are out.
A cold snap and they're ruined.

1333
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:28,091
Well...

1334
01:30:31,135 --> 01:30:32,302
I'll be going.

1335
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,056
You're not going to wish me luck?

1336
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:37,557
Say something, Claire.

1337
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:44,524
Remember, that bitch called the cops
to our daughter's birthday.

1338
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:47,025
Did I hear him insult me?

1339
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:48,402
Absolutely not.

1340
01:30:48,778 --> 01:30:51,113
And sued us over an apple tree.

1341
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,335
He's here, gotta go.

1342
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,262
Hi, Lola.

1343
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,305
Hi, Lola.

1344
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:18,557
Surprise!

1345
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,103
See those twin peaks?

1346
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,189
Well, according to the guide...

1347
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,984
"The peaks represent the breasts
of the mammary goddess.

1348
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:11,903
"Norwegians love snacking.

1349
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:14,279
"They are particularly fond of sausages,

1350
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:17,617
"rolled in pancakes,
and sold at newsstands."

1351
01:32:17,867 --> 01:32:19,911
"You can buy a newspaper
without a sausage,

1352
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:22,662
"but not a sausage without a newspaper."

1353
01:32:40,014 --> 01:32:41,681
Let's start with the basics.

1354
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,019
"Hello" is Hei.

1355
01:32:47,188 --> 01:32:48,898
"How are you?" is...

1356
01:32:57,364 --> 01:32:58,783
Should I write it down?

1357
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:01,618
"I am delighted to be in your country."

1358
01:33:01,786 --> 01:33:04,412
You're a pain
with your Norwegian lesson.

1359
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,873
- We're not at school now.
- That's irrelevant.

1360
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,876
It's about making an effort.

1361
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:11,002
If you don't like it, suck it up!

1362
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:12,212
Yeah, zip it!

1363
01:33:12,421 --> 01:33:13,631
Keep going.

1364
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,716
If nobody gives a shooot...

1365
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:21,221
Not one shooot!
Your wife bailed 'cause you're a pain!

1366
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,556
- No, my friend.
- That's low!

1367
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:24,766
I didn't say that.

1368
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:26,060
Yes, you did!

1369
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:27,811
It slipped out.

1370
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,747
Try to get some sleep, Thierry.

1371
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:50,626
I'd love to, but I'm way too excited.

1372
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,461
So stay awake in silence.

1373
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,921
I can't sleep either.

1374
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:56,548
How about a beer?

1375
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:57,841
I'd love a beer.

1376
01:33:58,009 --> 01:33:58,801
No!

1377
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,345
Sleep! Not a peep out of you!

1378
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:05,765
- Shut up! Tomorrow's the Worlds.
- It's no reason to...

1379
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:07,726
Watch out, I'll get up!

1380
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:09,645
She said, I'll get up!

1381
01:34:15,234 --> 01:34:16,569
It makes you laugh?

1382
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:17,819
Sure, it's funny.

1383
01:34:25,328 --> 01:34:26,453
Stop it!

1384
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:27,954
Sorry.

1385
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,166
I feel an attack coming on.

1386
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:31,583
What kind of attack?

1387
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:34,962
Are they all natural?

1388
01:34:36,756 --> 01:34:37,756
Cut it out!

1389
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,219
- You complete idiot!
- Sure, I'm the idiot.

1390
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,012
You'll thank me one day.

1391
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:46,474
You have no idea!

1392
01:34:57,068 --> 01:34:59,278
Move it, we're running late!

1393
01:35:07,787 --> 01:35:10,914
Quit tossing stuff in here.

1394
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:14,710
Hey.

1395
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,506
- How are you?
- I should be asking you.

1396
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:19,756
I'm just great.

1397
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:22,551
- You can tell me if...
- I know.

1398
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:23,969
He went?

1399
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:25,345
Yes.

1400
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:26,262
Even so?

1401
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:28,265
After all that happened?

1402
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:32,770
It's not just selfish,
it's utterly irresponsible.

1403
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:35,898
Just imagine the rumors about him.

1404
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:38,234
I don't tell you, to protect you, but...

1405
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,737
It's not very virile. It's odd.

1406
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:43,238
It puzzles me.

1407
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,614
Of course it does.

1408
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,324
Some chocolate, kids?

1409
01:35:46,867 --> 01:35:48,034
What do you mean?

1410
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,581
I mean you have a gift
for organizing birthday parties,

1411
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,750
making quiche, choosing napkins...

1412
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:58,378
Not so much for imagining
your husband can't play tennis, say.

1413
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,422
If you want the truth,

1414
01:36:00,631 --> 01:36:03,300
your husband has a ball,
but not on the court.

1415
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:07,304
No, in a dungeon with cuffs,
leather thong, and a good whipping.

1416
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:10,015
But I hear his favorite
is getting peed on.

1417
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,643
I don't tell you, to protect you,

1418
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:14,811
but you have no idea of the rumors.

1419
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,065
Thing is, you can't take them,
whereas I don't care.

1420
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:23,194
Maybe my guy isn't very virile,
but I don't judge him.

1421
01:36:23,404 --> 01:36:25,405
He doesn't have to hide and act like

1422
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:26,948
he's someone else.

1423
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,033
Because...

1424
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:31,287
I'm proud of him.

1425
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,747
Whatever he does, I'm proud.
And he's proud...

1426
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,500
We're proud of each other.

1427
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,752
Not always but often. And often

1428
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,587
never means never, get it?

1429
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,256
Let's cut to the chase.

1430
01:36:42,631 --> 01:36:47,261
Either your pretty Ralph Lauren home
gets a BDSM basement.

1431
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:51,265
Or you can go screw yourself
and your supermarket gossip.

1432
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:54,518
That's called
giving as good as you get.

1433
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:00,649
Kids, let's go.

1434
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,984
- Where are we going?
- We're going.

1435
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,201
What's wrong?

1436
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:35,411
You OK?

1437
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:36,412
Fine.

1438
01:38:37,037 --> 01:38:38,247
Bullshit. What's wrong?

1439
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,622
I'm not fine.

1440
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:40,916
I'm stressed out!

1441
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,501
I hate being judged, OK?

1442
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,545
It's nerves. I'm in bits.

1443
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,630
You idiot, now you tell us?

1444
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:47,881
You junked my pills!

1445
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,632
Why did you do that?

1446
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,011
Why? I don't know, I thought...

1447
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:53,554
Complete idiot.

1448
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:54,762
Now it's my fault?

1449
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:56,472
Hey, look! Get a grip!

1450
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:01,395
- Feeling better?
- Same.

1451
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:07,609
What?

1452
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:08,610
Nothing.

1453
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:10,654
- It's too orangey?
- No.

1454
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,697
Looks natural?

1455
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:12,864
Sure.

1456
01:39:14,617 --> 01:39:15,826
Self-tanner.

1457
01:39:17,411 --> 01:39:20,247
I thought, can't be pasty white
for the Worlds.

1458
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:21,914
Gotta be presentable.

1459
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:22,832
We'll

1460
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:24,877
watch on internet.

1461
01:39:26,587 --> 01:39:28,713
Knock it off, Granny!
Pain in the butt!

1462
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:34,052
Anyway, I wanted to wish you...

1463
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,012
Thanks, son.

1464
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:38,681
Lots of love.

1465
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,310
I understand you feeling sick.

1466
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:44,896
The fear of the obstacle,
the pressure, of course...

1467
01:39:45,064 --> 01:39:46,273
Are you listening?

1468
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:48,984
Puking is not constructive. Stop it!

1469
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,234
What's going on?

1470
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:52,320
He's sick, won't open the door.

1471
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:54,698
John, open this door now!

1472
01:39:55,032 --> 01:39:56,699
You hear me? Open up!

1473
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:59,203
We need you. You're the base. Open up!

1474
01:40:02,789 --> 01:40:03,832
I feel terrible.

1475
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:05,250
Come on!

1476
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:07,377
We're screwed without him.
Get on it!

1477
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:12,800
Stop, Thierry!

1478
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:16,679
You didn't work the artistic enough.

1479
01:40:17,054 --> 01:40:18,846
That's all I ever did.

1480
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:21,475
Look at the bodies those guys have got!

1481
01:40:22,768 --> 01:40:24,144
Just wait for their score.

1482
01:40:45,082 --> 01:40:46,207
You're trembling?

1483
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:48,335
Yes, I'm trembling.

1484
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:50,962
You never tremble?

1485
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:52,631
No.

1486
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,550
Doesn't mean I'm not scared.

1487
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:58,261
- I'm sorry about...
- Me too.

1488
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:03,559
Wake up!

1489
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:06,520
We're not here to hide, sonofabitch!

1490
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,235
He's bonkers!

1491
01:41:15,362 --> 01:41:16,822
Calm the flap down!

1492
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:19,073
Stop! Both of you!

1493
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:26,206
Ready? Let's go see the boys.

1494
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:27,541
Everything OK?

1495
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:30,793
If they screw up the execution,
it's all over.

1496
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:31,795
Calm down.

1497
01:41:31,962 --> 01:41:34,213
Juries don't like the French.
Norway doesn't.

1498
01:41:34,381 --> 01:41:37,467
- Stop it, please.
- Norway hates France!

1499
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:39,261
They'd better be good.

1500
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:41,555
You went easy on them.

1501
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:44,182
Here. You feel up to being base?

1502
01:41:44,349 --> 01:41:44,975
Sure.

1503
01:41:46,726 --> 01:41:47,560
Guys!

1504
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:52,858
You first.

1505
01:41:54,902 --> 01:41:58,238
We just wanted to say,
we know you're scared.

1506
01:41:58,404 --> 01:42:01,199
So are we but here we are. OK?

1507
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:07,914
We also want to say

1508
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,166
we love you.

1509
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:12,461
I'd like to say a word!

1510
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:15,922
Friends...

1511
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:19,717
What we will do tonight

1512
01:42:20,594 --> 01:42:22,220
is not only bigger than us.

1513
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:26,516
Tonight, it's not ten of us
in that pool, but 69 million.

1514
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:27,893
Tonight we are

1515
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,851
France!

1516
01:42:29,019 --> 01:42:32,104
Yes, the France we love,
the France of Voltaire.

1517
01:42:32,523 --> 01:42:35,818
The France that goes
from Corsica to Puy-de-Dôme via...

1518
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:37,109
Charente-Maritime.

1519
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:38,237
Too long!

1520
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:41,113
I want you to imagine,
maybe one day,

1521
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,699
our grandchildren will look up and say,

1522
01:42:44,701 --> 01:42:47,328
Granddad, did you do all that?

1523
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,413
And we'll reply...

1524
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:50,541
Shut up!

1525
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:53,001
Shut it, Marcus. Let's go!

1526
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,086
Yes.

1527
01:43:58,442 --> 01:43:59,650
Guys, in formation!

1528
01:44:00,027 --> 01:44:01,944
- This is it.
- Let's go!

1529
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,451
This is Dad's thing?

1530
01:44:08,577 --> 01:44:09,661
It's crap.

1531
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:12,788
Classy pool!

1532
01:44:12,956 --> 01:44:16,208
What the hell's going on?
The store's unattended.

1533
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:18,377
- It's Jean-Luc.
- The World Championships.

1534
01:44:18,545 --> 01:44:19,796
He's up next.

1535
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,180
I blew the sound
but nailed the lights!

1536
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:49,435
Pull over.

1537
01:50:51,563 --> 01:50:52,939
Pull over there.

1538
01:52:46,886 --> 01:52:48,137
There's nothing.

1539
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:49,805
Here neither.

1540
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:51,265
Obviously.

1541
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:53,560
Tomorrow. Wait till tomorrow.

1542
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:55,979
For the news to filter through.

1543
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,231
Definitely tomorrow.

1544
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:01,568
For sure.

1545
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:11,869
Daddy!

1546
01:53:15,957 --> 01:53:16,957
Gold medal!

1547
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:22,046
- Beat it, kids.
- Where?

1548
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:25,507
Who cares! Play on the freeway,
score crack, just beat it.

1549
01:53:25,675 --> 01:53:26,885
Leave us alone.

1550
01:53:27,092 --> 01:53:27,760
Scram!

1551
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:28,802
Let's go.

1552
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:38,474
<i>Naturally, for a moment,
one fleeting moment,</i>

1553
01:55:38,975 --> 01:55:41,185
<i>they dreamed of being national heroes.</i>

1554
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:44,271
<i>Most likely, they will never receive
due recognition.</i>

1555
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:48,234
<i>It seems unlikely
their story will become a model,</i>

1556
01:55:48,818 --> 01:55:50,235
<i>with a single exception.</i>

1557
01:55:50,403 --> 01:55:51,695
<i>One thing is now certain,</i>

1558
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:55,742
<i>and the most skeptical
will never call it into question...</i>

1559
01:55:55,908 --> 01:55:57,618
<i>If the desire is there,</i>

1560
01:55:57,784 --> 01:56:00,537
<i>a round peg
will fit in a square hole.</i>

1561
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,082
<i>And vice-versa.</i>
