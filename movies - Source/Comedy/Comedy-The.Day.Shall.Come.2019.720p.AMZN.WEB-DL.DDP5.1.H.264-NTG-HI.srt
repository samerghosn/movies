00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:39,163
Oh, okay, just bring up
the whole number.

179
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,789
That number is a plague
of fuckin' fives.

180
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:45,067
If the guy is afraid of fives

181
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,345
then that number's
a real soup sandwich.

182
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,625
The next number is a two,
so it's like a 52.

183
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,938
That's a five, brother.
It's still a five.

184
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,394
We are dialing
our own bomb here, Andy.

185
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,673
Shall we just send
the fuckin' target home?

186
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,571
Okay, now four.

187
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,813
You do it.

188
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,746
This is a four.
It's not even a five.

189
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,851
Please.
My fingers won't work anymore.

190
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:15,787
It's just killing a few flaping
kids. Jesus Christ!

191
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:19,583
I dial one four,
you dial one four, okay?

192
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,523
Dial the last number, brother.

193
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:30,940
Dial it. Come on.

194
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,532
- Shazam!
- Go, go, go!

195
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:38,188
Go.

196
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:42,538
I think God stopped it, brother.

197
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:43,850
Police! Hands up, now!

198
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:46,437
Police! Let me see your hands!

199
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,095
- Get down!
- On the ground!

200
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,131
Yes!

201
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:54,239
Great job, guys.
Ristretto. One sugar cube.

202
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:57,346
Yeah. Great job, guys.

203
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:00,245
Shitty job, guys. Most of that
bomb was dialed by us.

204
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,557
What if some libtard on my jury

205
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:04,524
thinks that's a little unfair
to Ali Bin Weasel?

206
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,527
Hey!

207
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:10,254
Assholes, what the flap
was that fives bullshit?

208
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,499
- This is your fault.
- You saw the paperwork, Rick.

209
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,363
Don't hide behind
a piece of paper, Andy

210
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:16,330
unless you're a fuckin'
tampon wrapper.

211
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:18,229
Right.

212
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,196
You mean tampon?

213
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,509
Look, I'm dropping it, alright?

214
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:25,961
I'm a genius attorney, but you
need to retire on a better case

215
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,455
unless you wanna spend
your twilight years

216
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,585
on a Segway as a mall cop.

217
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,864
For the record,
this is an FBI operation

218
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,729
in which the police played
no decision-making role.

219
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,179
Says the man
with a very small badge.

220
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:42,942
No, police badge is 14 percent
larger than an FBI badge.

221
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,912
And it's also heavier
by weight.

222
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,294
Brother Pure,
that's what I'm gonna call you.

223
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,022
'Cause you're pure
like the piss of a dove, man.

224
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,610
Thank you, sir.

225
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,543
Professor X, Farmer Africa,
are not pure.

226
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,235
- X like Malcolm X?
- After the X-Wing.

227
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,619
"Star Wars." This brother could
fly if he put his mind to it.

228
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:07,173
Ninety-seven percent of our
brains aren't used, bruh.

229
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,797
One hundred percent
in your case.

230
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,177
Come the day,
I shall buckle those cranes

231
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:14,077
with one flick of my brain,
brothers.

232
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:16,666
And the day is coming.

233
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,945
Time to put nail bombs
in their Whole Foods.

234
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:21,187
- No, brother.
- No, sure, just one.

235
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:23,052
No, brother,
you may not do that.

236
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,745
No, but we may.

237
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,850
Why may we not?

238
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:30,000
We shall not start a race war
we will definitely lose.

239
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:32,268
The Farmer Army
is not yet to scale.

240
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,107
When General Toussaint
was attacked after church

241
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,823
did he strike the white man
who hit him?

242
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,169
Did he set him on fire?

243
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,344
He waited ten years
for the revolution

244
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,207
then he bopped him, right?

245
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,933
- No.
- Yes, brother.

246
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,523
I mean, that no.

247
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,801
[indistinct chatter]

248
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,837
Damn!

249
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,816
What did I tell you was gonna
happen if you didn't pay?

250
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,471
- Notice of eviction.
- Notice of eviction.

251
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,705
- All out. You ain't paid.
- You can't just walk in..

252
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,269
Yeah, yeah,
it's to the end of the month

253
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,883
that we ain't paid, Ruben.

254
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,504
Right, but that's bullshit,
okay?

255
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,610
Look, I'm a very successful
businessman, alright?

256
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,269
I got watches
showin' three different times.

257
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:08,649
Ruben, Ruben, brother.

258
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:10,443
How big is the biggest omelet
you ever ate?

259
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,445
No, not eggs.

260
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,595
What about eggs
that taste like eggs

261
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:13,758
before science fiction?

262
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,864
You're not payin' me
in eggs again, Venus.

263
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,038
Okay, how about some
fried potatoes?

264
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,868
I bought 'em
by the flea market.

265
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,697
You could use 'em
at your restaurant.

266
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,905
Real good ones, brother.

267
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,701
Man said he could hardly bear
to sell them.

268
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,610
- They're wooden.
- They're what? They're wooden?

269
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,600
You didn't check
the potatoes, Mo?

270
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,431
What? But the ones he showed me
were real.

271
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,984
You should have checked 'em,
alright?

272
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,677
Since when did we have to start
checking if potatoes was wood..

273
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:39,508
- Yeah, well, I checked them.
- I can get you that machine.

274
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:40,611
The X-ray machine.

275
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,615
No idea what you're
talkin' about.

276
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,409
I know what you're doin', bruh.

277
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:48,033
You're makin' a ray gun,
some dirty cool shooot.

278
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,345
You said when you was drunk.

279
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:54,073
Look, look, you want a ray gun?
I got what you need.

280
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,568
I'll take good merchandise
or you're out.

281
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:58,629
But, uh, look, brother.

282
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,464
- It's bent.
- Just at one end. On purpose.

283
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,706
Moses, you know
how a real ray gun works?

284
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:09,296
That's the gun part. Now all
you need is the rays, brother.

285
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:12,748
Okay, look, I have a client
who needs radioactive material

286
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:15,129
that gives off rays,
like fuel rods

287
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:17,235
or something from
an X-ray machine.

288
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,030
This is basically
just a fuckhead's paperweight.

289
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,583
I'll unbend it.

290
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:30,972
[dramatic music]

291
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:48,817
- Nice building, Andy.
- Thanks, Rick.

292
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:52,374
Was the bureau high
when they commissioned this?

293
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,066
'Cause it actually looks
like a personality disorder.

294
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,722
Oh, he's on a roll.

295
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:57,907
You know, Bin Laden
got you this.

296
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,139
It's a shooot roll.

297
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,702
You guys should
put a big picture of him

298
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:01,865
up the front of the building

299
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,418
like the Colonel Sanders logo.

300
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:06,008
shooot just rolls out
of his mouth.

301
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:09,390
So, as to your mall cop jibe,
Rick...

302
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:10,840
You're gonna pitch me
the next 9/11.

303
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,427
You know,
the Mexican Hezbollah

304
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:14,015
is planning an attack
on Orlando.

305
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:15,407
Flooding the streets
with alligators?

306
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,538
- Still a threat, Rick.
- It's a literal croc of shooot.

307
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:21,471
There's a guy who wants
to attack a strip club

308
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,405
from a balloon
with flaming urine.

309
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,994
That was an undercover cop.

310
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:29,375
He had a breakdown
and he blew up his own bladder.

311
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:30,480
Right.

312
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,138
What about this guy
Moses Shabazz?

313
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,586
Who?

314
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,969
He preaches overthrow of the
government on Facebook Live.

315
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,832
He does? Cheryl has that.

316
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,765
That's my wife.
She's quite cool.

317
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,355
- He talks about black jihad.
- Right.

318
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:44,081
Huh? Classic lone wolf.

319
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:45,979
Uh, there's four of them,
actually.

320
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,912
Pack of lone wolves.
Had to happen.

321
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,982
- It's a uniformed militia.
- Oh.

322
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,709
Wait. Andy, he's black?

323
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,434
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' black?

324
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,850
- Seriously?
- Hold on.

325
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:58,611
All these, they're totally
fuckin' black.

326
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,062
I mean, wake up, people.
Come on.

327
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:03,100
We're down with brown,
but black is whack.

328
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,378
- Black is whack?
- Don't twist my words.

329
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm not racist. Black targets
are no longer cool.

330
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,727
It's not my fault. The cops
have fucked the legal optics.

331
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,876
You mean, their skin's black,

332
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,626
but they're basically
brown, right?

333
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:14,835
Think ISIL Panthers.

334
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,562
- Uh, brown blacks.
- Brown blacks.

335
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:19,368
Sir, if they break the law, it
doesn't matter if their skin's

336
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,462
made of bark and they worship
a pig in a wing suit.

337
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:22,498
Right.

338
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,086
So I can get
the local informant...

339
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,917
Uh, my informant, Reza,
he could set up a meeting

340
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:29,402
between this Shabazz

341
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:33,577
and, um, a rich ISIL sheikh

342
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,167
played by the beach informant,
Nur Ad-din.

343
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,030
He's annoying,
but he's a good closer.

344
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,965
Uh, Nur Ad-din hates other
informants. Flies solo.

345
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,219
I think he would hate it more
if we sent him back to Syria

346
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:44,288
even though
the real estate deals

347
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,315
are supposed to be
amazing right now.

348
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,042
Right, so let's offer
this Moses Shabazz some funds

349
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,044
get him some military equipment
from, uh, some catalogue.

350
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,702
He has no license.
Get him some automatic weapons.

351
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,394
Could you walk him
across the line?

352
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,501
Of course, yeah.
Brown blacks track, yes.

353
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:02,538
- Right.
- She means no.

354
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:05,093
I mean, theoretically she could,
but Reza works for us

355
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,818
because we're shielding him
from sex charges with minors

356
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:09,200
and he's still at it.

357
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,857
We shouldn't expose
a female agent to that

358
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,618
especially a very small one.

359
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,563
That's sexist, and heightist
and probably offensive

360
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,484
to pedophiles,
which is really something.

361
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,384
I can... I can handle
Reza, yeah.

362
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,076
Good. Uh, please don't
flap it up.

363
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:26,330
Won't flap it up. Won't let you
down. Won't let any of you down.

364
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,875
Except for Stevie, 'cause
he wants me to flap it up.

365
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,359
So I will let him down happily.

366
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,434
[dog barking at a distance]

367
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,625
I think we ruined
with this eviction thing, Vee.

368
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:58,559
Like flat tire,
empty icebox ruined.

369
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,803
Can't be a farmer
without a farm.

370
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:02,736
I can't even move the wheel.

371
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,844
A farm can be anywhere, Mo.
It's an attitude of mind.

372
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:10,260
They make me drowsy.

373
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:11,342
And they stop you from thinking

374
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,538
that animals can talk to you

375
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,748
or that you have five arms.

376
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,415
Damn!

377
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,074
Was it the heat of my hands
or was it a miracle?

378
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,626
Did you... did you blow?

379
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:35,044
No. I made an effort.

380
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:36,805
I mean, will God
bring down the cranes

381
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,117
if you ain't trying first?

382
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,126
Will the gentrificators
dump their condos on our heads?

383
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:58,722
[blows]

384
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:04,176
[both blowing]

385
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:08,940
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so.

386
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,773
Your bikini comes off
in my mouth.

387
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:16,292
Not my style.

388
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:21,089
I want to feel your hot, moaning breath on my ball sack.

389
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,092
Doesn't sound like me either.

390
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:27,061
You said them both today, Reza.
How old was she?

391
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:30,444
- Thirty-five? Thirty-six?
- Fifteen.

392
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,826
- A minor.
- She was Canadian.

393
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,001
They don't even have minors
in Canada.

394
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:38,384
I've got 800 pages
of this stuff.

395
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,180
I'm all that stands between you
and 20 years in a penitentiary

396
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,836
that uses your screams
to power the lights.

397
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,289
[speaking in foreign language]

398
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:51,259
[intense music]

399
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:55,642
Let up, Farmer X. Go!

400
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:57,161
And go.

401
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,128
Up!

402
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:02,855
Down!

403
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,237
Up!

404
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,103
Down!

405
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:09,518
Go!

406
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,525
Down!

407
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:20,148
Arms up!

408
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:21,598
Duck walk.

409
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,810
Ducks are strong.
Strong ducks win.

410
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,605
Ducks are mighty ducks.

411
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:30,538
- Right, Brother Pure?
- Sir.

412
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,713
- Hello.
- Hey, Reza.

413
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,304
Salaam Alaikum, sister.
How are you?

414
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:39,513
Hello. Buk-buk-buk.

415
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:42,448
- Brother Shopkeeper.
- The man's up to somethin'.

416
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:45,070
Yes, to help in your enterprise.

417
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:46,969
And what enterprise
would that be, brother?

418
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,833
All of it, actually.

419
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,112
Growing the fresh vegetables,
playing chess

420
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:55,737
keeping fit,
the great inversion

421
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,015
bringing down the cranes

422
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,878
bringing down the government.

423
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:02,364
- What sort of help?
- Cash.

424
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:06,540
Really quite a lot of cash.

425
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,888
♪ Bismillah al rahman
al rahim ♪♪

426
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,166
Stop makin' that noise.

427
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,377
So tell me, Reza,
what cash you talkin' about?

428
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,414
- My uncle...
- Take your shirt off.

429
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:26,699
- What cash, brother?
- My uncle...

430
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,287
Star jump.

431
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,222
My uncle from the Middle East

432
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:38,606
he very much admires your work.

433
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:43,473
My work? From the Middle East?
Burpee.

434
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,992
They travel widely.

435
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,066
They're very rich.

436
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,034
We have no interest in cash.

437
00:21:52,068 --> 00:21:53,519
Tell me how it works.

438
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:56,279
Duck pose.

439
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,834
My uncle comes
to the Holiday Inn.

440
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:02,528
We don't need to get hustled
by your imaginary uncle, Reza.

441
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:05,393
He is not imaginary.
He is real.

442
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:08,775
He is a mujahideen.

443
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:12,192
He has a bad limp,
from a bullet

444
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,747
to the foot. Yes.

445
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,440
- He has a built-up shoe.
- What's his name? Uncle Scam?

446
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:21,097
Sultana and me, we got plenty
of good finance options, bruh.

447
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,239
- Wells Fargo. Bank of America.
- The United Dollars Bank.

448
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:25,941
- The big money buildin'.
- We got options.

449
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:28,519
- The other one next to it.
- Thank you, Reza.

450
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,729
Okay.

451
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:35,457
Then I'm happy to hear
you don't need me.

452
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:38,597
I am weak, but I am strong.

453
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:45,122
[intense music]

454
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:50,161
Mr. and Mrs. Al Shabazz.

455
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:54,061
- Mr. Foltz.
- Hi. How you doin'?

456
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:55,822
A gift from the farm.

457
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:58,653
Fresh chicken eggs, eggplant
and black Yaupon tea.

458
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,619
Filter out the bark
with your teeth.

459
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:03,760
It's strained, but the debris,
it's just fiber, so it's good.

460
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:06,730
- An example of our produce.
- Just some.

461
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:08,766
Please, be seated.

462
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,047
So the, uh, charitable loan,
yes?

463
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,498
Ten thousand dollars for the
Star of Six Community Farm.

464
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:18,568
It's the non-profit application?

465
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,364
Correct, sir. We make a loss.

466
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:24,989
Financial loss,
but spiritual gain.

467
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:26,622
- But, I mean, we can change.
- Oh, sure.

468
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:29,546
Put that as a profit if you
like, if that's better.

469
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:32,202
Uh, right, there might
also be a problem

470
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:34,791
with your 501[c][3]
tax relief application.

471
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:38,451
We have that,
just not in writing.

472
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:41,005
So the IRS might fail
your organization

473
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,248
if it's seen to be political?

474
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,397
Yeah, that's why it's
not in writing

475
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,388
'cause the writing is wrong.

476
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,665
Uh, so you're not political?

477
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,219
Well, everything's political,
brother.

478
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:51,981
- I mean, we're not political.
- No more than a bank.

479
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,778
Look, my farmers
used to sell drugs, bruh.

480
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:58,471
Now they grow kale and marshal
ducks for the Almighty.

481
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,162
That is great.

482
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,300
You know Marcus Garvey said

483
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:02,992
there would be
three more after him?

484
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,477
Elijah, Muhammad, Malcolm X

485
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,824
and the third
has yet to be revealed.

486
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:07,962
Oh, okay.

487
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,932
My mission is to change
the lives of poor people

488
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:13,174
using all my abilities

489
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,557
including the untapped
invisible.

490
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:18,041
All the electrons in space.

491
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,286
The mighty beast
of my bloodline.

492
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,470
You should know that I descend

493
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,599
from a long line
of powerful bears.

494
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:26,394
It's not just a farm.
I mean, it's a school.

495
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,913
I mean, you lend to the nail bar

496
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:29,813
and they jerk off
Koreans out back.

497
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:32,056
That's just what folks say.
It may be racist, so..

498
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,921
Okay, uh, look, maybe
if you could provide security

499
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:37,130
we could just do
a, a straight loan.

500
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:38,993
Do you have security or..

501
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,409
What security do you have

502
00:24:40,443 --> 00:24:43,204
apart from the American
government which is bust?

503
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,079
Well, the Federal Depository
Insurance Corporation

504
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:48,244
backs up all the accounts
at this bank up to $250,000.

505
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,144
So in terms of cash
for your farm

506
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,009
it just doesn't seem
like this is gonna work out.

507
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:55,769
I'm... I'm sorry.

508
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,118
[sighs]

509
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:03,846
[intense music]

510
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,866
- Hello!
- Black Santa prevail.

511
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,007
- Yes, Black Santa.
- What is this?

512
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,559
Your uncle wants us
on some pyramid

513
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:28,847
selling deal
for cleaning products?

514
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:29,906
Somethin' like that?

515
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:31,150
Sultan, I assure you

516
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:34,325
my uncle is good straight cash.

517
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,987
Take this, brother.
Don't be afraid to use it.

518
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,683
Activating recording at 11:06.

519
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,412
I have some expense receipts
for you.

520
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:56,209
It's mostly the usual.
Rent, food, gas.

521
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:59,419
This flaping orthopedic clog.

522
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:01,594
Reza, take that thing.

523
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,733
Put it right there,
in the center.

524
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,256
Tell him I will see him now.

525
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:11,673
Twenty-two stress consultations
and a massage

526
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,711
and a Bobby Brown boxset
for more stress

527
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:16,575
because I had to kill a dog.

528
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:21,509
The prophet will see you now.

529
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,305
[speaking in foreign language]

530
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:34,212
[groans]

531
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:37,491
You bring this fish to me
and go.

532
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,493
He is my fish, you brute.

533
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:42,670
The money they pay you
should be coming to me.

534
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:46,155
So my hands are crushing your
balls even when I let go.

535
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,951
[groaning]

536
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:51,022
Let's go.

537
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:03,691
Salaam Alaikum, prophet.

538
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:09,593
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

539
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,250
Have a seat on the table.

540
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:14,391
It is our custom.

541
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:30,718
- So..
- So..

542
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,927
Your work is very much admired
by the chief sheikh of IS.

543
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:36,240
The tax office?

544
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:38,932
Unfortunately they do not
admire my work.

545
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,490
IS, prophet.
Islamic State?

546
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,387
Al-Qaeda, same thing.

547
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:51,599
Al-Qaeda. Yes.

548
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:54,603
I'm sorry for the loss
of your Sheikh Osama.

549
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:57,123
Though you know
he never really existed.

550
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:59,849
He was a figment
of European paranoia

551
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:02,403
which is why he still lives.

552
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,719
[speaking in foreign language]

553
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:10,758
[speaking in foreign language]

554
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:22,942
My uncle says that his sheikh
offers large sums of money

555
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:26,117
to help oppressed people
build armies.

556
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,432
You have an army, prophet?

557
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,262
- Every nation has an army.
- Yes.

558
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:35,575
Mm-hmm.

559
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,645
How large is your army?

560
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,682
Oh, large.

561
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,720
How many could you
have here tomorrow?

562
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:46,794
- Four.
- An army of four?

563
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:51,936
Five, actually. My daughter
is due for promotion.

564
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:56,113
The rest would come on
a first some, then more basis.

565
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:57,977
Mr. Moses, are you serious?

566
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:01,290
- Am... am I serious?
- Yes.

567
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,915
Give him a list of the hardware,
Shopkeeper.

568
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:17,548
"Ten rolls of fencing.
Work boots. Overalls."

569
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:21,137
- "A chicken coop?"
- And a watch for my wife.

570
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,726
And a horse.

571
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,003
They don't do horses

572
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:27,317
but a general
should have a horse.

573
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,115
Perhaps your army needs
weapons too?

574
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:33,840
Guns.

575
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,566
- Guns.
- No.

576
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:39,155
Allah says until the day shall
the bullet weapon be silent.

577
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:41,124
Nothing to defend your farm?

578
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,816
We have a crossbow.

579
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:48,509
And if necessary,
we'll call on the dinosaurs.

580
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:49,925
The CIA has some left over

581
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,307
from when the Europeans
wiped them out.

582
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:54,171
We believe that
at the sound of a trumpet

583
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,241
they will come to our aid.

584
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:57,519
[foghorn blares]

585
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,181
- Very good, brother, yes.
- Is a ray gun a bullet weapon?

586
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:06,148
- What?
- A ray gun.

587
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:10,498
You want a ray gun?
X-rays? Radioactives?

588
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:13,569
I can find isotopes.

589
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,124
Ruben's gun don't use
no bullets, Sultan.

590
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,093
No, but we only permit
projectiles

591
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:20,784
of the visible realm.

592
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:24,166
Of course. Very good, brother.
I shall put this to the sheikh.

593
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:26,065
So that he may fund our mission?

594
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,239
Inshallah, inshallah.

595
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:28,377
May Black Santa prevail.

596
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:30,449
Yes, and Black Caesar

597
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,278
and Black Snow White
and Black T-Rex.

598
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:40,977
He's gotta be good for what

599
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,015
like...$500, right?

600
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,328
Lord Moses,
these are very serious people.

601
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:50,400
They pay, like..

602
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,851
...$50,000.

603
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,095
- Fifty thousand?
- Yes.

604
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,822
But for proper army weapons.

605
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,376
Not these things
so incredibly offbeat.

606
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,114
I need guns. Assault weapons.
Destroy the government.

607
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,012
- What did you say?
- Assault weapons.

608
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:19,221
Uh, destroy the government.
Yes, please.

609
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,636
Very good, brother.

610
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,673
Nura.

611
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,503
You know all the black brothers
in jail?

612
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:28,438
That is our army, waitin' for us
to break 'em out.

613
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,164
Like General Toussaint.
Like Spartacus.

614
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:33,246
Black Santa crashin' his sleigh
into the White House.

615
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:34,589
But you said guns
are not allowed.

616
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:36,525
Well, I just prayed to God
and He told me they are.

617
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,690
I shut my eyes and he wrote
"Guns okay" on my eyelids.

618
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:42,865
Guns okay.

619
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:49,320
It's cash, right,
from the sheikh?

620
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:50,978
Not checks written on camels?

621
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,875
American dollars, brother.

622
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,017
And 50 Kalashnikov assault
rifles for your army

623
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:58,709
banana clip, folding stock.

624
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:05,509
Um, Nura.

625
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:08,442
How about money now,
guns next year?

626
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:11,376
So that we can build a rack.

627
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,965
A good sturdy rack.

628
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,969
Also so we have time to practice

629
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,453
so that when we get the guns,
we're good with them.

630
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,698
You can practice with my guns,
of course.

631
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,665
Use living Americans
as targets, yes.

632
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,703
Who cares if you shoot a Kaffir,
a bull's-eye through the brain

633
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,877
or just rip half its face off?

634
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:33,502
Cheeks flap, eyes burst, yes?

635
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:37,885
Cheek, cheeks flap. Eyes burst.

636
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,473
Al-Qaeda magazine.

637
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,894
[intense music]

638
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:54,834
God's miracles take many forms

639
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:56,904
brothers and sisters.

640
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,424
We do not question them.

641
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,912
We accept God's plan for us
and we are grateful.

642
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:07,260
In the name of Allah,
Melchizedek, Jesus, Black Santa

643
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:09,642
Muhammad and General Toussaint.

644
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:13,714
What? Come on,
tell me this ain't good.

645
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,546
- This ain't good.
- You like your watch?

646
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,721
Your boots, brothers?
Your... your new uniforms?

647
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:22,000
- And this?
- You don't have to read it.

648
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,415
50K, Vee. We made.

649
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,798
Reza's uncle gives you 50K,
he owns your ass.

650
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,353
I own his ass, babe.
I hustled him.

651
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:32,355
He's a wonky wheel.
He's gonna give us guns too.

652
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,596
- But I told him...
- Guns?

653
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:34,884
Yeah, but you don't
have to worry, bruh.

654
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,403
We're just gonna take 'em
and bury 'em under

655
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:37,876
six feet of concrete.

656
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:42,157
Come on.
We're goin' to my sister's.

657
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:44,332
Vee. Wait. Vee!

658
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:45,791
We can even fill our guns
with concrete

659
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,714
paint 'em white
and use 'em for fence posts.

660
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:48,887
We hustlin' this guy.

661
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:51,511
You trying to save these boys
from guns.

662
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,893
You just gonna throw it all away
for a hat and a horse?

663
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,412
You make a bomb
out of bamboo canes.

664
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:56,941
- You see what you're doing?
- He don't mean that.

665
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:58,381
Do you mean that?

666
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:01,279
Sugar, coconut, bleach
and acetone.

667
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:03,075
This ain't us, Mo.

668
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,317
This ain't the farm.

669
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:07,045
50K, Vee.
I'm savin' the farm.

670
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,909
If you believe that, then
there ain't nothin' to save.

671
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,257
Come on, baby girl.

672
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,121
Sir, we don't believe in guns,
though, do we?

673
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,054
Of course not,
but I just talked to God

674
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:19,021
and He told me unless you fire
it, a gun is just a stick.

675
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,231
Well, I suggest you
ask Him again.

676
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,440
Okay.

677
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:25,648
Thank you.
He said the same thing.

678
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:28,168
- We done, Mo.
- Vee.

679
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:29,757

is my sister.

Well, yeah.

what if I'm playin' them

Open the door, baby.

697
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,706
Excuse my language.

698
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:02,780
You have a long,
wise face, sister horse.

699
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,887
Is Vee comin' back?

700
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,615
Can you answer me?

701
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:13,585
No.

702
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:17,105
Have I just blown
everything we stand for?

703
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,623
[thunder rumbling]

704
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,592
Holy shooot!

705
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:23,802
Did I just do that?

706
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,702
Did I?

707
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,134
[indistinct radio chatter]

708
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,688
Okay, guys, food's up.

709
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:51,036
I got you sunflower seeds,
dried cranberry

710
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,625
chia seed bars, crispy kale.

711
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:57,318
And donuts and coffee.
Come on.

712
00:36:57,353 --> 00:37:00,045
Hey, all 50 pins drilled out
on those guns, right?

713
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,528
Arrest plan, box three.

714
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:03,231
There's a video of each drilling
on the red flash drive.

715
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:04,255
In the right order?

716
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,360
Serial number equals date

717
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:06,476
equals yes, in the right order.

718
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,467
So 50 AKs sounds about right,
yeah?

719
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:10,996
I kind of wish this asshole
was gonna blow up Disney World.

720
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,610
- It's solid.
- Heads up.

721
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:15,853
Your pet kiddy kisser's
on level two.

722
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,132
He's come to bitch about
Nur Ad-din.

723
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,721
Uh, what sub-tab is that
in your arrest plan here?

724
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,032
He's timeline peripheral.

725
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,976
Can you just pay his expenses,
get rid of him, please?

726
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,898
Happy to be
just peripherals guy.

727
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,347
Don't sell yourself short,
Stevie.

728
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:29,730
I mean, didn't you see
your special arrest plan?

729
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,217
That's not funny because
I'm not even laughing, so..

730
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,494
flap me, guys. How old are you?

731
00:37:35,528 --> 00:37:37,184
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you five?

732
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,635
Good one, sir. Thanks.

733
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:43,054
Setting up a perimeter,
we need four...

734
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:45,228
- Guns in place. Check.
- Okay.

735
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:49,300
It's the good guys bit.
It's good being the good guys.

736
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:51,820
Tell SWAT to stand by.

737
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,375
And, lo, Moses
shall take the guns

738
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,894
and, lo, Kendra
shall bust his ass.

739
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,724
Copy that.
SWAT A is standing by.

740
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,865
Why has he stopped there?
What is he doing?

741
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:05,731
Oh, wow!

742
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:08,320
- Actual factual wow.
- What?

743
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:10,840
Can you chuck the CCTV
up on the smart board for me?

744
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:17,155
He's here?

745
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,951
Oh, come on!

746
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,677
Two minutes ago.

747
00:38:20,711 --> 00:38:23,059
One minute. Real time.

748
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,992
shooot a pineapple.

749
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:27,304
shooot a live yodeling manatee.

750
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,755
What is your full name, sir?

751
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,139
Moses Al Shabazz.

752
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,971
- That was me.
- I'm sorry?

753
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:41,318
Me and my horse.
You know, we did that.

754
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:46,289
Sir, do you have an appointment?

755
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,670
Could you make me one?

756
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:51,742
- Okay, what do we do now?
- I don't know, Andy.

757
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:53,168
Maybe we should ask
the special agent

758
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:54,503
in charge of this building.

759
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:56,782
Okay, uh, I'll go talk to Moses,
find out what he wants.

760
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:59,128
So he looks like our friend?
Bang goes my rocket docket.

761
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:00,476
Sure, not good.

762
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,063
Um, We tell him everybody's
busy. He leaves right now.

763
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:05,135
And maybe you just blanked
a walk-in confession?

764
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,793
Okay, poker face,
totally neutral.

765
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,081
I just get him to walk back out
there into our next chapter.

766
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,797
Trust me, sir.
I know how this plays.

767
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,213
Uh, if I may, sir,
I think this plays

768
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:16,836
like a pennywhistle
jammed up an orangutan's butt.

769
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:18,804
What use is that comment
to anyone?

770
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:20,565
You're right, sir. Sorry.

771
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,221
- Ow!
- Meeting room seven.

772
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:24,362
If he says the wrong thing,
I leave it off the 302.

773
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:49,938
So you're here about our
community outreach program?

774
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:53,079
Yes, ma'am.

775
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,884
I believe you offer
rewards for justice?

776
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,025
As in..

777
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:08,681
If I had certain information

778
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,856
regarding individuals
selling firearms

779
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,547
would you be interested?

780
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:16,585
Uh, you mention a reward?

781
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:19,762
If you can pay us $50,000

782
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:23,282
I can show you
a man trading AK-47s.

783
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:24,800
flap it! flap me.

784
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:31,014
Uh, well, okay, look, uh

785
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:33,188
there are rewards
available, yes.

786
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,672
It's a process.

787
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,434
It starts with us
needing your full criminal

788
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,400
and employment record,
your immigration status

789
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,023
any family members'
immigration status.

790
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:42,300
- Good block. Okay, good block.
- Smart rat.

791
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,889
Your tax returns
for the last 15 years

792
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:45,373
you have those in good order,
yes?

793
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,793
Not on me right now,
but, uh, what about

794
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:53,554
for cash today?

795
00:40:53,588 --> 00:40:55,797
Could you pay someone

796
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,695
to inform upon themselves?

797
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:01,735
You wanna inform on yourself?

798
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:02,976
Yes.

799
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,498
Say if I was thinking
of doing something

800
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:10,295
and then I stopped before

801
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:11,710
and came to you

802
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:15,576
and informed you about the thing
I was thinking of doing

803
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,855
and maybe, uh,
you could pay me to...

804
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:21,478
Have you done something
that you should inform us about?

805
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,447
No, ma'am.

806
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,597
That's lying to a federal agent.

807
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:27,692
Five years right there.

808
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:28,945
Andy, just get him
back out there

809
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,489
to blow up a skyscraper
or I'll drop the case.

810
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,768
Uh, well, Mr. Bey Al Shabazz,
we appreciate your contact.

811
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:35,976
Thank you so much.

812
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,563
I was gonna take the guns

813
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:39,911
but just turn them
into fence posts.

814
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:41,152
Fence posts?

815
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:43,052
Fill it with concrete
and paint it white.

816
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,847
We don't believe in guns,
but the guy was gonna pay me.

817
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:51,059
My farm is broke.

818
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:57,342
Well..

819
00:41:57,376 --> 00:42:01,552
...community support
is very important to us.

820
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:03,313
Okay.

821
00:42:03,347 --> 00:42:06,143
Different communities,
same needs.

822
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:09,561
Okay, so can you help?

823
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:13,978
Not at this time, no.

824
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,775
Oh.

825
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:20,295
But, um, thank you
for the information.

826
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:25,438
Communities.

827
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:27,751
Communities.

828
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:44,768
- I let him go.
- Oh, great call.

829
00:42:44,802 --> 00:42:46,010
We've got harpoons in him.

830
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:47,679
We just sit back calmly
and watch the barrels.

831
00:42:47,702 --> 00:42:49,981
No, I mean, I let him go.

832
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,362
He's got the threat signature
of a hot dog.

833
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:54,985
Kendra, he just admitted
he wanted guns.

834
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,159
For fence posts.

835
00:42:56,193 --> 00:42:57,367
Yeah, I mean, like you said

836
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:59,679
leave that non-material
detail off the 302.

837
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:00,887
He wanted guns.

838
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,925
Sir, I don't love saying this

839
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,271
but I made a mistake.

840
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:06,342
- I think he's delusional.
- Okay, well, yeah.

841
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,413
Schizophrenia plays.
Right, Rick?

842
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:10,735
On the fourth circuit, but you
have to fly them to Virginia

843
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,186
and then rearrest them
when they land.

844
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,349
Sure, whatever, perfect.

845
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,661
He did just report us
as the threat.

846
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:17,802
Nails of Christ, people.

847
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,458
Just because Sheikh Alaikum
reports

848
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:20,735
that Abu Woowack is a terrorist

849
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,057
doesn't mean
that Sheikh Alaikum's

850
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:24,117
not a terrorist too, right?

851
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:25,878
I mean,
he was false flaggin' us.

852
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,121
Twice.
He double false flagged us.

853
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:29,192
So regular flagging.

854
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:30,572
He took pictures
of the building.

855
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,367
- I think those were selfies.
- Yeah.

856
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,302
Selfie jihad
is bombing reconnaissance.

857
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:37,684
Okay, look, we throw him a 100K

858
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:39,789
he will definitely
do something for that.

859
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:41,998
Andy, you're happy with that,
what you just said?

860
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:43,413
It's a fool proof plan, Rick.

861
00:43:43,447 --> 00:43:45,898
We give him an actual fake bomb
and the guy tries to use it

862
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:49,385
we have the next Bin Laden,
even if he's Archie Bunker.

863
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,731
I smell doubt.

864
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:53,146
No, look, I am just a guy
standing here

865
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:54,389
talking to another guy

866
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,115
trying to send a third guy
to jail.

867
00:43:58,048 --> 00:44:00,672
I'm one leg down
on the beach case already.

868
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:02,994
Sir, I think you might have to
get fitted for doggy wheels.

869
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,746
I'm paying off Nur Ad-din
tomorrow.

870
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,230
I'm closing the case.

871
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:08,300

1047
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:53,021
If I push any harder,
I'm gonna breach the hold.

1048
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:57,612
[cell phone ringing]

1049
00:53:57,648 --> 00:53:59,856
Vee? Vee?

1050
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:01,583
- Daddy?
- Baby girl.

1051
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,585
Are you coming
to my birthday party?

1052
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,483
Sure I am. I'm gonna get you
a whole box of donuts.

1053
00:54:06,518 --> 00:54:08,452
Will it just be the holes again?

1054
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:10,833
No, it'll be the rings
this time.

1055
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:13,628
- Really?
- Who you talkin' to, baby girl?

1056
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:15,010
Daddy.

1057
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:20,291
You can't fix this by
manipulating the child, Moses.

1058
00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:23,052
- She called me, Vee.
- Did Daddy call you?

1059
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:28,367
- Well, all the same.
- You just called me "Daddy".

1060
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:30,784
- I feel good about that.
- Well, don't.

1061
00:54:30,818 --> 00:54:32,958
We're gettin' the farm back,
Vee.

1062
00:54:32,992 --> 00:54:35,306
Did you... did you
take the guns?

1063
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,893
Farmer Africa,
did we take the guns?

1064
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:39,862
Unfortunately no, sir.

1065
00:54:39,896 --> 00:54:41,632
I... I'll tell you all about it over donuts, Vee.

1066
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:43,210
It'll be the icing
on the donut

1067
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:44,695
unless the donut's
already got icing.

1068
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:46,385
Then it'll be the icing
on the icing.

1069
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,422
I'm not supposed to be
talkin' to you right now.

1070
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:51,184
Vee, this is a very good
reverse potato situation.

1071
00:54:51,217 --> 00:54:54,393
Well, this is a reverse
hello situation. Goodbye.

1072
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:56,153
Hello? Vee?

1073
00:54:56,188 --> 00:54:58,329
- Is Daddy coming?
- I don't know, baby girl.

1074
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:00,226
You're better off
askin' his horse.

1075
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:01,918
[engine starting]

1076
00:55:04,956 --> 00:55:06,648
And a handful of beans.

1077
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:10,617
No wonder most places
ain't got nukes.

1078
00:55:11,824 --> 00:55:13,481
It's hard to make a nuke.

1079
00:55:13,516 --> 00:55:15,346
These are still piss and beans,
though, right?

1080
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,864
Yes.

1081
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,833
[intense music]

1082
00:55:27,945 --> 00:55:29,670
[engine revving]

1083
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:36,711
[intense music]

1084
00:55:47,757 --> 00:55:49,931
Andy. Andy.

1085
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:53,590
It's unorthodox, yes, but..

1086
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,456
Andy.

1087
00:55:59,597 --> 00:56:01,806
Hiya. Yep? Okay.

1088
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,637
Open the gate. Open the gate.

1089
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,155
Thank you.

1090
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:09,572
Already Miami beach is eying
500 million dollars in..

1091
00:56:09,606 --> 00:56:10,952
Oh, God.

1092
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,507
Hey.

1093
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,371
Jesus wept.

1094
00:56:17,822 --> 00:56:20,480
- Welcome back.
- Oh, thank you.

1095
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:22,516
Uh, just a parking lot catch-up.

1096
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,208
Lots to fill you in on.

1097
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,760
Uh, good stuff, great stuff.

1098
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:28,626
Um, shall I get you a straw?

1099
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,972
Uh, what stuff?

1100
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:33,181
Uh, well, this is, like,
20 good things

1101
00:56:33,217 --> 00:56:34,632
that are all good.

1102
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,599
I just need to tell you them
in the right order.

1103
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:38,601
Okay, hit me.
I can double-hand it.

1104
00:56:38,635 --> 00:56:39,672
Okay.

1105
00:56:42,052 --> 00:56:44,884
Um, so, the..

1106
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:46,472
- I don't know if it's..
- It's...

1107
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:49,577
The long and short
of this excellent news

1108
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:52,409
is Shabazz made a very bad move.

1109
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,514
Shabazz.
You killed me on Shabazz.

1110
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:57,516
DC just paper-flaping
crucified me on Shabazz.

1111
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,518
Yes, but, Andy, I mean

1112
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:01,693
this is going down
for 35 years bad.

1113
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:03,972
- I mean, life.
- Oh, God, Lord, no.

1114
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,318
Incoming moron. Save me.
Quick, quick.

1115
00:57:06,353 --> 00:57:08,389
- Um, the president called you.
- Did he really?

1116
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,322
- No.
- Andy, quick five.

1117
00:57:10,356 --> 00:57:13,878
Hey, Clay. Just busy.
Quick, uh, two seconds?

1118
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:15,777
Sure, yeah, just wanna make sure
you're on top

1119
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:19,297
of this major nuclear threat
situation we got goin' on.

1120
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:21,472
- Nuclear what?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

1121
00:57:21,507 --> 00:57:23,025
Well, I guess the FBI
drops the ball

1122
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:24,648
the PD is here to pick it up.

1123
00:57:24,681 --> 00:57:27,001
So you guys are free to do
whatever it is you do down here.

1124
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,824
- What, did you shooot your chest?
- Clay.

1125
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:30,688
In my office.
Start from the beginning.

1126
00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:33,449
No, I don't think he needs
to start from the beginning.

1127
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,762
What we have here is
weapons-grade nuclear material

1128
00:57:36,797 --> 00:57:38,420
four canisters.

1129
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:39,697
Uh, no threat.

1130
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:42,148
Being traded
within city borders.

1131
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:44,978
Um, no, I don't think so, sir.

1132
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,842
This just doesn't
smell right to me.

1133
00:57:46,876 --> 00:57:48,025
Are you saying there are actual

1134
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,811
mushroom-cloud nukes
here in Miami?

1135
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:51,088
No, he's not saying that

1136
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:52,514
and if you are saying that,
you're mistaken.

1137
00:57:52,538 --> 00:57:54,987
I worked nukes a lot in intel.
This isn't them.

1138
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:57,197
Easily done, though, buddy.
No problem. Don't feel bad.

1139
00:57:57,231 --> 00:58:00,268
This is serious, Madam Agent.
Canisters of uranium.

1140
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:02,282
Have you checked they're full?
'Cause I'll bet they're not.

1141
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:04,826
I can tell.
Have you checked? No.

1142
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,206
He's not even cleared to hear
how he's flaping this up.

1143
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:09,244
I might have to ask him
to reprimand you.

1144
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,693
We don't have this at my PD.

1145
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:12,418
I'm gonna have to ask him
to reprimand you.

1146
00:58:12,454 --> 00:58:13,835
He can't reprimand me.

1147
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:16,320
I'm a different agency,
sweet cheeks.

1148
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:18,391
You wouldn't last
one second here.

1149
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:20,231
The only thing smaller
than your badge is your dick.

1150
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:22,463
It's probably inverted
like a belly button.

1151
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:24,121
[laughs]
I'm sorry.

1152
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:25,708
They will do that
from time to time.

1153
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:27,295
Just so you know,
under state law

1154
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:29,402
I'm taking control of this
in city borders.

1155
00:58:29,436 --> 00:58:31,679
- Permission not granted.
- Permission not asked.

1156
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:34,096
We've already gone up
the line to Homeland.

1157
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:38,099
Seriously, dude, you're gonna
look like such a flaping goober.

1158
00:58:38,135 --> 00:58:40,068
Andy, this idiot has no idea
what he's doing.

1159
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,701
He probably mounts the toilet
the wrong way around.

1160
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:43,288
You know, you have to face
away from the wall, right?

1161
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,900
Okay, okay. Now I do have
to issue a reprimand.

1162
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:47,327
Well, I don't accept
your reprimand.

1163
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:49,121
Agent, it's done. It happened
the minute I said it.

1164
00:58:49,146 --> 00:58:51,079
No, it didn't land.
I stopped it from landing.

1165
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:52,528
Okay, I will accept
your reprimand

1166
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,565
but you have to accept
my refusal.

1167
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,567
There it is.
We're settin' up the takedown.

1168
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,775
No, okay, look.

1169
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,501
There are no nukes.
There are no nukes.

1170
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,778
'Cause the canisters are mine.
They're empty.

1171
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:03,170
This is the same thing
I was trying

1172
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:04,817
to tell you about before,
out there.

1173
00:59:04,851 --> 00:59:06,612
This is the same thing.
So this is good.

1174
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:08,164
Okay, there may be
some new info.

1175
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:09,280
Can we just hold off until we..

1176
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:10,512
Yeah, here's the new info.

1177
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,824
I got four undercovers
posing as a Nazi cell.

1178
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:14,965
They caught your freaks
in a honey trap

1179
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:16,769
and now you're pissed off
that I'm ahead of you.

1180
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:18,623
Uh, no, Clay,
you're not listening.

1181
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:20,452
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Okay.

1182
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:23,248
Uh, the canisters don't contain
nuclear material.

1183
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:25,364
If the target thought they did,
if the target believed

1184
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:27,978
that he was trading actual
nukes, we could arrest him.

1185
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:29,092
Okay, so that's what
we're doing.

1186
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:30,427
No, because right now

1187
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:33,016
the target knows
that they're empty.

1188
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:34,501
Doesn't track.

1189
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,813
Just so you know, this action
can only be countermanded

1190
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:38,539
by someone of requisite rank

1191
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,059
who is fully on top of the facts

1192
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:42,199
not playing catch-up
from a chipmunk.

1193
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:45,789
A chipmunk? Seriously?

1194
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:50,000
What if I shot him?
I mean, I'm kidding.

1195
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:53,451
But it would end this if I did
shoot him, which is a joke.

1196
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:56,833
You know, Cheryl and I have
our anniversary dinner tonight at Nobu.

1197
00:59:56,869 --> 00:59:58,835
I told her I'd go this year.

1198
00:59:58,871 --> 01:00:01,217
That's great, sir, but, um,
you need to call him off

1199
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:02,436
otherwise we're gonna
look like total...

1200
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,842
Of course, I need to
call him off.

1201
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:06,775
You know, Kendra,
first you bring me Shabazz

1202
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,396
and then you take the case
away from me

1203
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:09,639
and then you give him nukes.

1204
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:11,686
Yeah, I was just trying to find
a way to prevent Shabazz

1205
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:14,679
from going on the open market
and getting actual nukes.

1206
01:00:14,713 --> 01:00:16,577
And, alright,
it would have worked...

1207
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:18,304
I'll need,
I'll need your case file

1208
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:19,719
and your informer's contacts.

1209
01:00:21,547 --> 01:00:23,481
I'm being stood down?

1210
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:27,451
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no. No. No.

1211
01:00:27,485 --> 01:00:30,487
No, no, no, no, no.

1212
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:32,628
I'll buy your wife flowers.

1213
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:35,079
No, that's weird. I'm gonna..

1214
01:00:35,114 --> 01:00:37,978
I will find this
Nazi takedown thing.

1215
01:00:38,012 --> 01:00:40,947
[intense music]

1216
01:00:58,481 --> 01:01:01,036
Okay, we just give 'em
the canisters

1217
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,693
take the money,
everybody's happy.

1218
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:05,869
- So what if we get nervous?
- Nervous is good.

1219
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:06,949
Nervous will make them think

1220
01:01:06,972 --> 01:01:08,905
that the fake nukes
are real nukes.

1221
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,114
You just gotta be nervous
like you're holdin' nukes

1222
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,047
not nervous like you're not
holdin' nukes, yeah?

1223
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:22,264
[intense music]

1224
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:32,757
We've got
the surveillance plane feed.

1225
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:34,242
- Uh, this is the takedown.
- Yeah.

1226
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,657
The police chief's
not answering.

1227
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,038
Uh, no, I'm on it.

1228
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:39,487
- Well, what's he saying?
- He's not pickin' up.

1229
01:01:39,523 --> 01:01:41,869
- Then why did you say...
- Hey, Rick. Come on in.

1230
01:01:41,905 --> 01:01:43,364
Thanks for coming.
Uh, have some cake.

1231
01:01:43,389 --> 01:01:45,597
Oh, no. I'm just comin'
to the edge of your shooot pit.

1232
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:46,909
I'm not jumpin' in.

1233
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:51,914
[intense music]

1234
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,755
- Clay.
- Hello, Andy.

1235
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:09,414
Okay, you have to call this off.
That is a federal order.

1236
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:11,106
- You wanna play rabbi?
- Nope.

1237
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,659
Well, my rabbi trumps you,
buddy.

1238
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:15,766
My rabbi's head of
Homeland Security.

1239
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,148
Hello, Andy? I can't..

1240
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:20,150
- Clay, don't even think of...
- Breakin' up!

1241
01:02:22,393 --> 01:02:26,018
- What an idiot.
- Jesus. Clay? Hello? Cla..

1242
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:27,467
God!

1243
01:02:31,643 --> 01:02:34,302
Uh, we can call the lead
undercover Nazi directly.

1244
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:35,519
- Yes.
- He's got to have a cell phone.

1245
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,650
- Do it.
- Okay, it would be somewhere..

1246
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:41,135
Try not to spend this all
on grape soda.

1247
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,688
Try not to knock these over

1248
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:44,277
makin' the beast
with your sister.

1249
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:47,177
Okay.

1250
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,454
Uh, I don't know
which number is which Nazi.

1251
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:50,456
Well..

1252
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:51,802
Check it out.

1253
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:57,990
You can, well, call one
at the same time as me.

1254
01:02:58,014 --> 01:02:59,543
If you get through,
just give him to one of us.

1255
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:00,534
- And dial.
- What the flap do I say?

1256
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,260
It's just ringing.

1257
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:04,884
[cell phone ringing]

1258
01:03:05,643 --> 01:03:06,954
Ignore it.

1259
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,925
[cell phones ringing]

1260
01:03:13,306 --> 01:03:15,688
Ignore the flaping phones.

1261
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:24,213
[indistinct chatter]

1262
01:03:25,353 --> 01:03:28,356
- Do something.
- I'm trying.

1263
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:30,253
Jesus. shooot.

1264
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:32,704
- I'm through. Stand down. Look.
- Hello, sir.

1265
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:35,259
This is the FBI Special Agent
In Charge Andrew J. Mudd.

1266
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:37,744
- Yes, sir.
- I need you to let the targets go.

1267
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:41,610
- Bismillah Black Santa Jesus.
- Comply immediately.

1268
01:03:41,644 --> 01:03:43,750
Yes, sir. Stand down.

1269
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:47,512
Everyone, stand down.
Guns down.

1270
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:54,451
- Okay.
- Let 'em up.

1271
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:55,728
You can get up.

1272
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,731
Yeah, I'm a cop. Get on up.

1273
01:04:00,664 --> 01:04:02,699
What about the brown guy?

1274
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:05,117
- Uh, you can have him.
- Not you. You're goin' to jail.

1275
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,257
- Wait.
- Take him away.

1276
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:13,780
Someone's got friends
in the FBI, huh?

1277
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:17,231
Go.

1278
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:27,414
So you do have
a sasquatch dick.

1279
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:28,485
Of course, I have.

1280
01:04:28,518 --> 01:04:30,867
- Yeah.
- Of course, I have a big dick.

1281
01:04:33,076 --> 01:04:35,905
- Right call, sir. Need a hand?
- No, we don't.

1282
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,565
- Knock next time, please.
- We're good, thank you.

1283
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,809
So, uh, I am back on for Nobu.

1284
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:44,224
Some yellowtail..

1285
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,780
...and then some Cheryl tail.

1286
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,681
Are we safe?
We can't be safe.

1287
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:55,753
- No such thing as safe.
- I think we're safe.

1288
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:57,731
- So they're not comin' after us?
- Yes, that's right.

1289
01:04:57,755 --> 01:05:00,309
After 500 years, they just
stopped comin' after us.

1290
01:05:00,344 --> 01:05:01,494
I don't think
they're comin' after us.

1291
01:05:01,518 --> 01:05:02,621
So we're free?

1292
01:05:02,657 --> 01:05:04,244
Better than free.

1293
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:05,911
They arrested Ruben,
so we got the farm back.

1294
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:06,947
So what the flap happened?

1295
01:05:06,972 --> 01:05:08,489
I don't know what happened.

1296
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:10,675
I was, I was praying my ass off
and then that happened.

1297
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:11,804
You made that happen?

1298
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:13,081
I don't know.

1299
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:16,360
Maybe it was the horse.

1300
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:17,396
That horse back there.

1301
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:19,362
The horse did that?

1302
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:21,054
I think God
was working through my horse

1303
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,952
when he blew up the cranes.

1304
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:24,643
I'm definitely gettin' a horse.

1305
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:25,644
[engine starting]

1306
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:28,614
[intense music]

1307
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:38,003
[engine revving]

1308
01:05:43,697 --> 01:05:45,630
[music continues]

1309
01:05:47,597 --> 01:05:49,047
- Uh, sir?
- Uh-huh.

1310
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:52,224
I think the cops
are following Shabazz.

1311
01:05:52,257 --> 01:05:54,605
Oh, you know, couple
of patrol cars to see him off.

1312
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:56,744
You know, Clay is a bad loser.

1313
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,713
It's a fuckin' archipelago.

1314
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,579
[sirens wailing]

1315
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:05,547
[dramatic music]

1316
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:11,311
[sires wailing]

1317
01:06:14,556 --> 01:06:15,556
[cell phone beeping]

1318
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:17,489
Shitty flaping Jesus!

1319
01:06:17,525 --> 01:06:19,458
What's up?
Nobu run out of starfish?

1320
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:21,253
No.
It's reached the Oval Office.

1321
01:06:21,286 --> 01:06:22,737
Clay has caused
Homeland Security

1322
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:24,221
to declare a nuclear emergency

1323
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:25,739
on your empty canisters.

1324
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,465
Well, he's having
some kind of breakdown.

1325
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,673
[groans]

1326
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,295
- Alright, we're takin' over.
- Whoa-oh.

1327
01:06:30,331 --> 01:06:32,021
Right, okay,
what do you need from me, sir?

1328
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:34,576
Right, well, we know
this emergency is groundless.

1329
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,820
- Correct. Right.
- But the emergency exists.

1330
01:06:36,853 --> 01:06:37,969
And you can't take
control of something

1331
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,039
if you're saying
it doesn't exist.

1332
01:06:39,063 --> 01:06:40,030
Okay.

1333
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:41,030
So we have to acknowledge that

1334
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:42,481
the emergency exists.

1335
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:44,793
Uh, oh, yeah, well, n... no.

1336
01:06:44,827 --> 01:06:47,072
Sorry, if we say,
"Yes, it exists"

1337
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:50,764
isn't that the same as declaring
a nuclear emergency ourselves?

1338
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,043
Uh, technically yourself,
but, yeah.

1339
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:56,460
So... to stop
a nuclear emergency

1340
01:06:56,494 --> 01:06:58,221
I have to declare
a nuclear emergency?

1341
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:01,050
Yes. The logic only works
if you say it slowly.

1342
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:03,329
Keep the contradictory
elements apart.

1343
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:06,159
- Well, I would look insane.
- Only if you say it fast.

1344
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:07,574
And also,
you already looked insane

1345
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:08,793
when you met me
in the parking lot.

1346
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,208
So you're just gonna throw her
under the bus?

1347
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:12,994
No. I would never do that
to an agent.

1348
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:15,134
She has to do it herself.

1349
01:07:15,168 --> 01:07:17,447
And the alternative
is dancing in the woodchipper.

1350
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:19,827
But then this stops?

1351
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:21,382
If you tell me
to go "Chicken Little"

1352
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,349
I have control over the cops,
over everything.

1353
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:31,012
Then I guess
we have a nuclear emergency.

1354
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,186
Good play, agent.

1355
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,911
I'm calling in
a full-armed response.

1356
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:36,706
I hope her record
will reflect the bravery

1357
01:07:36,742 --> 01:07:39,295
not the foolishness
of what she just said.

1358
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:42,333
- Is the woodchipper better?
- No, the same.

1359
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:45,440
Right, control. We have to
keep this off the TV.

1360
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:46,717
Uh, sir?

1361
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:47,960
- I said, knock.
- Sir..

1362
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:50,237
Yes, sir, but, um..

1363
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:53,862
You got Miami-Dade
black and whites out there

1364
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:55,623
sheriff's cars, dog vehicles.

1365
01:07:55,657 --> 01:07:56,623
We're looking at a..

1366
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:57,762
Ah..

1367
01:07:57,797 --> 01:08:00,110
Um, Kendra,
can you give us a second?

1368
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:01,456
Just..

1369
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,907
Yes, sir. Um..

1370
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,563
Thank you.

1371
01:08:05,597 --> 01:08:07,117
- Right.
- Yeah.

1372
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:10,085
[dramatic music]

1373
01:08:14,744 --> 01:08:16,436
Whoo!

1374
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:20,923
[sirens wailing]

1375
01:08:27,378 --> 01:08:28,655
[cell phone beeps]

1376
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:31,382
Um, okay, they're heading
to a donut shop.

1377
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:34,627
- Yep. Are we good in there?
- Informant's in place.

1378
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:38,561
- What's that?
- Oh, we got in there with the..

1379
01:08:38,596 --> 01:08:41,255
- Who's, who's where?
- Okay, here's what it is.

1380
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:43,980
We need to arrest Shabazz
for creating a nuclear threat.

1381
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:45,095
But we can't do it for that

1382
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,881
so we need him
to do something else.

1383
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,412
And given
the state of this case so far

1384
01:08:50,435 --> 01:08:52,645
it might just be better
if he got shot.

1385
01:08:53,336 --> 01:08:54,301
No, sir...

1386
01:08:54,337 --> 01:08:56,201
Angels walk on tightropes,
Kendra.

1387
01:08:56,234 --> 01:08:58,720
Disclosure of this snafu
in court

1388
01:08:58,755 --> 01:09:00,180
would cause more damage
to national security

1389
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:03,518
than a shooting that's basically
just another shooting.

1390
01:09:03,552 --> 01:09:06,487
Don't worry. It won't sound
so brutal on your record.

1391
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:11,663
[dramatic music]

1392
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:16,635
[crickets chirping]

1393
01:09:23,606 --> 01:09:25,194
Thank you.

1394
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:29,819
Hello.

1395
01:09:29,854 --> 01:09:33,306
My sister. She is my sister.

1396
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,172
Happy birthday!

1397
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:40,140
Here he is.

1398
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:42,902
Daddy?

1399
01:09:55,845 --> 01:09:57,434
Happy birthday, baby girl.

1400
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:59,815
Vee, we got the farm.

1401
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,748
- Ruben's gone.
- What?

1402
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:04,372
- We're good, I swear to God.
- Really?

1403
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:05,960
- Yes.
- No more guns?

1404
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,167
No more bullshit?

1405
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,721
No more guns. No more bullshit.

1406
01:10:09,756 --> 01:10:12,310
- We sweet like caramel cream.
- You swear?

1407
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:15,002
On my own personal donuts.

1408
01:10:15,037 --> 01:10:17,936
- Both your donuts?
- The chocolate ones.

1409
01:10:18,627 --> 01:10:19,628
Okay.

1410
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:20,837
[chuckles]

1411
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:23,805
[sirens wailing]

1412
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:30,916
[helicopter whirring]

1413
01:10:32,849 --> 01:10:34,782
So, I'm gonna have to tear
both of your nuts off.

1414
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:35,989
No, this can't be for us.

1415
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,439
This gotta be
for somethin' else.

1416
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:39,027
For what?
Like a food inspection?

1417
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:41,685
Like somebody just saw a fly
on a cinnamon twist?

1418
01:10:45,344 --> 01:10:47,207
Jesus. Look at this.

1419
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,692
This thing's bulletproof, right?

1420
01:10:48,726 --> 01:10:49,796
There will be no shooting.

1421
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:50,970
Kendra. Kendra.

1422
01:10:51,005 --> 01:10:52,386
- Hey, guns down.
- Kendra.

1423
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,524
Everybody, guns.

1424
01:10:53,559 --> 01:10:56,286
- Get your guns down.
- Agent Chipmunk.

1425
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,436
You better put on a nuke suit
or get the flap out of here.

1426
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:00,738
Can't hear you, Clay.
Just keep it on, alright?

1427
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:02,327
Andy, your rabbi won.

1428
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,500
This is your emergency.

1429
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:04,649
- Wrong again, Clay.
- Well...

1430
01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:05,685
We only called the emergency

1431
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:07,193
because we knew
there wasn't one.

1432
01:11:07,228 --> 01:11:08,297
- What?
- That's right.

1433
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:10,542
She just said it too fast.

1434
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:12,613
[sirens wailing]

1435
01:11:12,646 --> 01:11:15,131
Which part of your broken ass
did you pull this out of?

1436
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:17,411
I ain't pulled this
out of my ass, Vee.

1437
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:20,033
Wait. Look.

1438
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,034
I... I know her.

1439
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:23,279
From where?
Bumblefuck, Alaska?

1440
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,797
Listen, maybe she can help.

1441
01:11:25,832 --> 01:11:27,109
Go see.

1442
01:11:27,835 --> 01:11:29,112
Hey.

1443
01:11:30,216 --> 01:11:31,320
Hello!

1444
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:32,978
Threat is mobile. That's him.

1445
01:11:33,011 --> 01:11:34,427
That's it. The threat is mobile.

1446
01:11:34,462 --> 01:11:37,154
- Can I come over?
- Great, great.

1447
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:38,338
Let him come. I'll arrest him
when he gets here.

1448
01:11:38,363 --> 01:11:40,985
For what?
For wearing a shower curtain?

1449
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,850
Kendra, we can't arrest him
for something

1450
01:11:42,884 --> 01:11:45,577
until he does something
we can arrest him for.

1451
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:47,372
But you made me call
a national emergency

1452
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:48,890
on someone I can't
even arrest, Andy.

1453
01:11:48,925 --> 01:11:50,788
I should be
arresting myself for this.

1454
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:52,756
Hello. Ma'am!

1455
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:53,860
This could be a trick.

1456
01:11:53,895 --> 01:11:55,171
What kind of trick?

1457
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:56,277
A Taliban-type trick.

1458
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:58,175
A man who is actually a bomb.

1459
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,487
[gunshots]

1460
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:01,800
[all screaming]

1461
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:02,833
Hey!

1462
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,287
He's unarmed.

1463
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,530
Unarmed black man.
Unarmed white man.

1464
01:12:08,564 --> 01:12:10,842
Which one's more likely
to have the gun?

1465
01:12:10,877 --> 01:12:12,810
[clattering]

1466
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:20,162
Clay.

1467
01:12:20,197 --> 01:12:22,786
Stand your guns down.
I'm memoing this.

1468
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:25,409
Guns down!

1469
01:12:25,444 --> 01:12:27,273
All guns down.

1470
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:29,171
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

1471
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:32,070
Oh, okay, right. Our guns.

1472
01:12:32,105 --> 01:12:34,832
Bigger. More accurate. Good.

1473
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:38,813
Sir, the eight seconds
we just had

1474
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:40,390
with no guns felt really good.

1475
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:42,046
Shots were fired, Kendra.

1476
01:12:42,081 --> 01:12:44,014
There's no telling
how Shabazz could retaliate.

1477
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:48,190
Snipers and perimeter are set.

1478
01:12:48,225 --> 01:12:49,881
- Have your entry in position.
- Right.

1479
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:54,921
- That's the ISIL general?
- ISIL general, yeah.

1480
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:57,072
Oh, yeah, he could throw a bar
of soap at us at any second

1481
01:12:57,095 --> 01:12:58,338
so..

1482
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,447
See, they didn't arrest us
back there

1483
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,484
because they think it's gonna be
a lot more fun to shoot us.

1484
01:13:08,244 --> 01:13:10,212
[foghorn blowing]

1485
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:13,180
It's just the horn they use
to summon the dinosaurs.

1486
01:13:15,355 --> 01:13:16,356
[clattering]

1487
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,912
Everyone good?

1488
01:13:19,947 --> 01:13:22,845
- We're good. We're good.
- No, not good, brother.

1489
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:27,368
- Shopkeeper?
- I see my friend in trouble..

1490
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,507
- I bring help.
- Whoa.

1491
01:13:32,028 --> 01:13:33,787
Wha.. This is your plan?

1492
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:35,030
It's fake.

1493
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:36,307
Oh, thanks, Stevie.

1494
01:13:36,341 --> 01:13:38,078
Twenty-five years
if he tries to use that thing.

1495
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:40,622
Thirty-five,
you fuckin' prolapse.

1496
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:41,693
No one gets hurt.

1497
01:13:41,726 --> 01:13:44,143
This is his
Get-Out-Of-Jail card.

1498
01:13:44,177 --> 01:13:46,006
His Get-Out-Of-Jail card
is going to jail?

1499
01:13:48,664 --> 01:13:53,118
My sheikh is very happy for you
to use the device, Sultan.

1500
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:55,948
I'd be happy to use it to make
sure you never sit down again.

1501
01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:00,125
Please, save yourself.

1502
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,680
Brown cracker's right, Sultan.
Or we're leavin' in zip bags.

1503
01:14:08,512 --> 01:14:09,617
Okay.

1504
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:11,307
Mashallah, brother.

1505
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,488
Reza the shopkeeper?

1506
01:14:18,523 --> 01:14:21,007
- You're under arrest.
- What?

1507
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:23,181
I'm arresting you
for attempting to supply

1508
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:24,563
illegal missile things.

1509
01:14:25,184 --> 01:14:26,496
Ugh.

1510
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,738
Oh, my God.

1511
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:29,981
Vee, read him his rights.

1512
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:31,431
You have the right to remain.

1513
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:34,261
You may not say anything you say
you will be held against you.

1514
01:14:34,296 --> 01:14:38,301
And the thing about the lawyer.
Do you understand your rights?

1515
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:39,475
No.

1516
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,579
Do you understand these rights?

1517
01:14:41,614 --> 01:14:43,408
Yes, yes. Very clear.

1518
01:14:43,444 --> 01:14:45,032
That crossbow's a threat.

1519
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:46,515
The toy crossbow?

1520
01:14:46,551 --> 01:14:48,760
You can kill a dog
with one of those.

1521
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:51,279
Okay, so I'll arrest him
for having a dangerous toy.

1522
01:14:51,314 --> 01:14:55,076
Hey, wait. No. We arrest now,
the jury's with Shabazz.

1523
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:58,010
Alright, well,
this only goes one way.

1524
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:59,149
Entry squad.

1525
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:04,015
It's time for
the arterial Hail Mary.

1526
01:15:05,466 --> 01:15:07,432
The red-ink amen.

1527
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:08,917
Okay.

1528
01:15:08,952 --> 01:15:10,297
I'm arresting him anyway.

1529
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:11,645
- For what?
- I don't know.

1530
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,139
Trying to summon
the flaping dinosaurs!

1531
01:15:13,162 --> 01:15:14,198
Kendra!

1532
01:15:14,233 --> 01:15:16,581
So we're good with this?

1533
01:15:16,614 --> 01:15:18,237
- Yes.
- Okay.

1534
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:19,273
[gasps]

1535
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:22,413
Taxi.

1536
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:24,692
Are we still good
now that I shot him in the head?

1537
01:15:26,073 --> 01:15:28,350
No! No!

1538
01:15:28,385 --> 01:15:30,560
Everybody get down!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1539
01:15:30,595 --> 01:15:32,216
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1540
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:33,908
- Hands up.
- Oh, shooot!

1541
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:36,427
[indistinct yelling]

1542
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:39,154
Hey, don't shoot!
No shooting!

1543
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:41,846
Moses Sultan Al Bey Al Shabazz,
AKA David Ford Edwards

1544
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:44,021
I'm arresting you
on charges related to terrorism.

1545
01:15:44,055 --> 01:15:45,615
You can put that down.
It's fake anyway.

1546
01:15:45,644 --> 01:15:47,577
Me?
Wh... what charges?

1547
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:53,341
Uh, behaving in a way
to cause a man

1548
01:15:53,376 --> 01:15:55,274
to be shot in the head
with a toy

1549
01:15:55,309 --> 01:15:56,654
which is worse than it sounds

1550
01:15:56,689 --> 01:16:00,728
and planning to overthrow
the government with an army.

1551
01:16:00,762 --> 01:16:02,661
- Four people?
- It's a small army.

1552
01:16:02,695 --> 01:16:06,422
And... and intending
to procure WMDs

1553
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:07,469
which for a certain amount
of time

1554
01:16:07,493 --> 01:16:09,149
