00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,960
HAPPY GILMORE

2
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:54,964
My name is Happy Gilmore.

3
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:59,134
Ever since I was old enough to skate,
I loved hockey.

4
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,888
I wasn't really
the greatest skater.

5
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:06,642
But that didn't keep my dad
from teaching me...

6
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,270
...the secret of making
a great slap shot.

7
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:14,811
My dad worshipped hockey.
My mom didn't.

8
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,155
So she moved to Egypt, where there's
not a hockey rink within 1500 miles.

9
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,868
Dad took me to games
to see our favorite player...

10
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,453
...Terry O'Reilly,
"The Tasmanian Devil".

11
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:30,875
He wasn't a big guy,
but he feared nobody, just like me.

12
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:35,880
Handsome fellow, huh? He said
when I grew up, I could be anything.

13
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,300
But all I ever wanted to be
was a hockey player.

14
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:44,889
My childhood was going great,
but life is full of surprises.

15
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,651
After the funeral, I was sent to live
with my grandma in Waterbury.

16
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:06,744
I was nervous,
since I didn't know her that well.

17
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:11,165
She dressed like Gene Simmons
from KISS to cheer me up.

18
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:14,335
She's the sweetest person
in the world.

19
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,758
After my dad died,
I developed a short fuse.

20
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,010
That kid stole my party blower.

21
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,348
Instead of asking for it back,
I hit him in the head repeatedly...

22
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:28,265
with a hammer.

23
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,519
Most of the time, I was quick to say
I was sorry.

24
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:38,025
Years later, I played junior hockey
and still hold two league records...

25
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,277
...most time spent
in a penalty box...

26
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,782
...and I was the only guy to ever try
to stab someone with his skates.

27
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:49,745
After I graduated, I had
a lot of different jobs.

28
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:51,288
I was a road worker...

29
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:54,959
...a janitor...

30
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,798
...a security guard...

31
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,470
...a gas station attendant...

32
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,475
...and a plumber.

33
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:16,480
Lately, I've been working
construction. It's not bad.

34
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,649
I'm a good shot
with a nail gun.

35
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:23,988
But one day my boss, Mr. Larson,
got in the way.

36
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:29,034
Apparently, he also has a short fuse.
Look at the monster.

37
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:33,455
He got in a few lucky punches,
but I feel I won the fight.

38
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,708
Anyway, those jobs
weren't for me.

39
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,795
I was put on this planet
for one reason--to play hockey.

40
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:45,467
It's my puck, baby!
Don't you ever touch my puck!

41
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:50,472
Is that Gilmore again?
How many times has he tried out?

42
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:52,141
At least ten times.

43
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,476
He has a lot of intensity.

44
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,314
Not a strong skater, though.

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,149
Nor the best puck handler.

46
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,071
But, my God...

47
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:11,327
What a shot.

48
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:16,916
It that goal regulation size
or what?!

49
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:22,922
Number one...

50
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:26,592
...number fifty-two...number sixteen...

51
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:29,929
They saw my power.
They won't dog me this year.

52
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,096
...number nine...

53
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,851
...and number forty-three.
The rest of you...

54
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,437
...better luck next year.

55
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:42,107
Coach, what's going on?
What about me?

56
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:43,776
Gilmore.

57
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,946
I called your number,
didn't l?

58
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,864
No, you didn't.

59
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,451
Well, better luck next year.

60
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,538
That wasn't very nice!

61
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,963
You think you're better
than me?!

62
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:10,970
Where you going?
I got Subway.

63
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,555
I already ate.

64
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:16,475
I knew the guy working there,
so we got extra meatballs.

65
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,561
Great. I got to run.

66
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:20,980
Can you stay?
I had a rough day.

67
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,064
Bye.

68
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:23,983
-When will you be back?
-Never.

69
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:31,824
Terry, wait!

70
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,827
Wait! Hold on a second, babe.

71
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,997
You're not going for good,
are you?

72
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,749
You're going nowhere
and taking me with you.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,005
All you ever talk about is being a pro
hockey player, but you're not any good.

74
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:50,092
I am good! You know what?
You're a lousy kindergarten teacher!

75
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,679
I saw the finger paintings
you bring home--they suck!

76
00:05:55,347 --> 00:06:00,019
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
They're excellent finger paintings.

77
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,854
Please don't go.

78
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:05,024
I'm not spending the rest of my life
with a loser.

79
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:06,191
I'm gone.

80
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:11,030
Good! Get the hell out of my life!
Who needs you? Beat it!

81
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,033
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

82
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:17,203
I just yell
'cause I get so scared.

83
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,872
Scared of being a nobody.

84
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:23,542
Why don't you come back
upstairs, honey?

85
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,213
I'll give you the old smoochy-smoo
kissy-wissy.

86
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:32,051
You know Happy
will make everything okay.

87
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:42,895
I want to kiss you all over

88
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:45,481
And over and again

89
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:49,735
I want to kiss you all over

90
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:55,407
Till the night closes in

91
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:59,078
Till the night closes in

92
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,164
Terry!

93
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,932
Sit tight.
I'll be right over.

94
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:29,608
Hey, you don't want breakfast?

95
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:40,286
Grandma?

96
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,708
Put that down!
It's my grandmother's!

97
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,627
Cut it out, kid.
We're just doing our job.

98
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,462
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:53,299
Your grandmother
hasn't paid taxes in 10 years.

100
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:58,220
Grandma, you didn't pay
your taxes?

101
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,390
I would have,
but I didn't have any money.

102
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:04,310
Where are you taking her stuff?

103
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,229
I'm not taking her stuff,
the government is.

104
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,317
It's not like I'm taking her stuff
over to my place.

105
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,985
Don't get mad at me.

106
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,323
But she's an old lady.
Look at her. She's old.

107
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,743
You can't just take her stuff.
She's too old.

108
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:24,997
I'm sorry. I have no discretion.
Her stuff is now our stuff.

109
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,834
Well, at least we got the house.

110
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:32,671
I'll bring furniture from my place.
We'll be okay.

111
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:36,342
Now you'll really be mad.
I'm taking the house, too.

112
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:40,012
My grandfather built this house
with his bare hands.

113
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:44,600
My grandma's been here over 60 years.
You can't take her house.

114
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,521
Mrs. Gilmore owes the IRS
$270,000 in back taxes.

115
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:52,191
We have to take the house.

116
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:57,196
If you can't repay the money in 90
days, we sell the house to someone else.

117
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:58,864
You hate me, don't you?

118
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,033
No, I don't hate you.

119
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,041
He hates me.

120
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,171
Don't worry-
things will be okay.

121
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,173
Look at this place.

122
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:20,844
Silver Acres Rest Home.
It looks more like a country club.

123
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:23,347
Nice grass, nice people.

124
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,849
I hope you brought
your bathing suit.

125
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,852
You're going to make friends
in no time.

126
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:29,770
Mister!

127
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:34,024
Get me out of here!!!

128
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,195
Here, eat that!
Leave us alone!

129
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,032
Grandma, you could come
live with me.

130
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,702
Nonsense, dear.
You're a grown man.

131
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,455
I wouldn't burden you
like that and that's final.

132
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:51,709
Tell me, how is that nice girlfriend
of yours?

133
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,211
She got hit by a car.
She's dead.

134
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:58,382
Listen, I will get that $270,000
and get your house back.

135
00:09:58,716 --> 00:09:59,884
I promise.

136
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,302
Oh, sure.

137
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:05,556
In the meantime, just stay here
and have some fun.

138
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,725
I will, dear. Don't worry.

139
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:12,062
Pardon me,
but it's nap time.

140
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,565
Nap time--that sounds nice.

141
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,401
-You go.
-I love you.

142
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,571
I love you, too, darling.

143
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:26,577
Buddy, do me a favor.
You see that lady?

144
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,079
She's very important to me.

145
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:32,750
I want you to take
extra special care of her.

146
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,668
You know what I mean?

147
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,005
I can't accept that.
But this is what I can do.

148
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:42,259
I can take extra special care
of that young lady for nothing.

149
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,930
I appreciate that.

150
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,432
Have a nice afternoon.

151
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:53,854
Sir, could I trouble you for a glass of
warm milk? It helps put me to sleep.

152
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,358
You could trouble me for a warm glass
of shut the hell up.

153
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,612
Go to sleep
or I will put you to sleep.

154
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,199
Check out the name tag.
You're in my world now, Grandma.

155
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,117
Oh, dear.

156
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:12,289
Bet you I can hit a ball
past that tree.

157
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:14,625
Twenty bucks says you can't.

158
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,878
Morons, I told you I want to watch
the hockey game.

159
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:20,631
Cut the golf sissy crap
and finish up.

160
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:21,966
Oh, relax.

161
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,886
You can enjoy your grandma's
possessions for another half hour.

162
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,308
Oh, you got a hold of that one!

163
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,144
-You try it.
-It's not as easy as it looks.

164
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:36,814
Sorry, ladies.
I'm not the golfing type.

165
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,316
You hit a ball past my ball...

166
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:43,070
...we'll finish work so you can watch
your hockey game.

167
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,322
Give me the stupid club.

168
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,997
Look at this stupid thing.

169
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,750
This will be hilarious.
Look how he's standing.

170
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,169
You like that?

171
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,768
Holy shit.

172
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:15,853
Back to work.

173
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,938
That house is 400 yards away.

174
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:19,106
Is that good?

175
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,942
-That's unbelievable.
-Beginner's luck.

176
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,445
I bet $20 you can't do it again.

177
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:26,030
Bring it on.

178
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,629
You boys are going to pay
for that--

179
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,634
-You hit him!
-He shouldn't have been standing there.

180
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,303
One more time.
Double or nothing.

181
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:50,888
You better pay up.

182
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:04,401
Oops. Maybe we should
get back inside.

183
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:07,404
You made a bet.
Pay the man.

184
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,258
Thanks. Tell your friends.

185
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,593
Step right up, folks!

186
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:34,682
See if you can outdrive the amazing
Golf Ball, uh, Whacker Guy!

187
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,436
That's great.

188
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,021
Very good.

189
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,277
Bend your knees. Remember,
it's in the hips. You're doing great.

190
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,195
It's in the hips.

191
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:51,031
Fifty bucks I can hit it
over the highway.

192
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,876
That's real good.

193
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:05,462
So long, sucker.

194
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,303
How often do you play?

195
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:13,888
This is my first time.

196
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,808
You should play
in the Waterbury Open tomorrow.

197
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,060
Yeah, right, I'll see you there.

198
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:25,983
He's going to play.

199
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:28,819
And, by God,
he's going to win.

200
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:41,165
Mister, you need a helmet.

201
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't worry about it.

202
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:51,258
Yeah, bring that shit on.

203
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,344
I love it.

204
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,179
Awesome.

205
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,848
God, that hurt,
but I'm okay.

206
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,850
What the hell
are you doing?

207
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,938
Just 364 more days till the next
hockey tryouts. I got to get tough.

208
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,691
God, that felt good.

209
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,194
Cut that out.
You're making me sick.

210
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,532
So you're a hockey player.

211
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,785
You got to give that up
and concentrate on golf.

212
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,036
Who are you?

213
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,789
I'm the club pro here--
Chubbs Peterson.

214
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,377
I'm offering to teach you
how to play golf, personally, for free.

215
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,628
No.

216
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,713
You don't know who I am,
do you?

217
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,298
No, I don't.

218
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,717
Back in 1965...

219
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:37,888
...Sports Illustrated said I would be
the next Arnold Palmer.

220
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,139
What happened?

221
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,642
I wasn't allowed
to play pro anymore.

222
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,144
I'm sorry.
Because you're black?

223
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,147
Hell, no.
An alligator bit my hand off.

224
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:48,732
Oh, my God!

225
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:52,403
Tournament in Florida.
My ball went down by a lake.

226
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,907
Damn alligator just popped up!
Cut me down in my prime.

227
00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:01,495
But I tore one of that bastard's eyes
out. Look at that.

228
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,914
You're pretty sick, Chubbs.

229
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,749
I've never seen anyone...

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,670
...who can hit the ball
half as far as you. You got real talent.

231
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,425
That's nice of you to say, but
I trained all my life to play hockey.

232
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:18,095
Golf is no different--requires talent,
self-discipline.

233
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,015
Golf requires goofy pants
and a fat ass.

234
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,184
Talk to my neighbor--a great golfer.
Huge ass.

235
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:28,105
I bet your neighbor can't drive
the ball 400 yards.

236
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:32,860
I bet your neighbor doesn't have a shot
to get on the Pro Tour.

237
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:35,112
How would I do that?

238
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,449
You win the Open tomorrow,
you're on the Pro Tour.

239
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,869
Then, who knows? Maybe you'll win
the Tour Championship.

240
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:44,205
Get that gold jacket
I never got.

241
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:47,124
Gold jacket, green jacket--
who cares?

242
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:55,466
Don't worry. It's made of wood--
real sturdy.

243
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:03,140
Sorry about that.

244
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:06,310
It was good to meet you,
but, uh....

245
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,730
I'm out of here.

246
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,149
This is not real smart, kid.

247
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,736
I thought you were pro material,
primed for the big bucks.

248
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,161
Hey, Chubbs...

249
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:26,330
...what kind of big bucks?

250
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:36,840
Stupid golf clubs.
Why the hell am I doing this?

251
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:43,347
Whoa--must be Burt Reynolds
or something.

252
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,351
Good morning!

253
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:52,022
Isn't this great? Blue skies,
fresh-cut grass, birds chirping.

254
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:56,777
You going to recite me a poem?
Geez, you love this golf stuff.

255
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,781
A guy your size--why not play
a real sport, like football?

256
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:04,201
My mama wouldn't let me.
Said it was too dangerous.

257
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:06,203
Yeah, good call.

258
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,455
Hey, who's that?

259
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,877
The shorter guy is Doug Thompson,
president of the Tour.

260
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,298
The other guy is Shooter McGavin,
leading money winner this year.

261
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:18,799
Who's the girl?

262
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,720
I'm Virginia Venit, Director
of Public Relations for the Tour.

263
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,474
Of course. I've heard you've done
some really interesting things.

264
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:30,561
Right now I'm working
on a promotion--

265
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:34,398
You know what would be great?
lf I could get a Pepsi.

266
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:35,983
Sure.

267
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:39,069
Oh, miss?

268
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:40,654
Diet.

269
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:42,907
Right.

270
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:46,827
Hey, thanks for dressing up.

271
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:50,748
If I wore clothes like those,
I'd have to kick my own ass.

272
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,416
Good morning, everyone.

273
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,421
Welcome to the Waterbury Open.
Before we begin, I have a treat for you.

274
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,924
Ladies and gentlemen,
Shooter McGavin.

275
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:09,683
Thank you, Doug.
I saw Doug play yesterday.

276
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:13,354
He spends more time in the sand
than David Hasselhoff.

277
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,273
Let me get serious.
You're all aware...

278
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:20,694
...today's winner will be invited
to join the Pro Tour.

279
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,697
Although only one will become
my colleague...

280
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,116
...all of you are now my friends.

281
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:32,122
Thank you.
Now go get 'em!

282
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,630
Next up: Lafferty, Daniel
and Gilmore...Happy.

283
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,301
Where you taking
those clubs, punk?!

284
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,389
Mr. Gilmore,
I'm your caddy.

285
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:51,141
Sorry. I'll carry these.

286
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,310
They're my grandfather's.
They're pretty old.

287
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:56,313
What should I do then?

288
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,816
Why don't you just watch me...

289
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,819
...and make sure
I don't do anything stupid?

290
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:07,241
Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Lafferty
is teeing off now.

291
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,493
Okay. Good luck, buddy.

292
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,746
Get out of the way.

293
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:23,173
Where were you that time,
dipshit?

294
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:39,356
Probably the best I'll hit
all day.

295
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,525
Mr. Gilmore, you're up.

296
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:04,798
Damn it!

297
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:07,968
Time!

298
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,972
Relax. Do what we discussed.
Don't look at the green.

299
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:15,392
Hit the ball. There's no goalie
anywhere to block it.

300
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:19,230
Remember, it's all in the hip.
Come on. Work with me.

301
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,900
It's all in the hips.
All in the hips.

302
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,736
It's all in the hips.

303
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,071
Get off me!

304
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,324
Just easing the tension.
Just easing the tension.

305
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:32,826
Well, ease it on someone else.

306
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:52,930
What the hell?

307
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,103
Good. Now we just worry
about putting.

308
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:00,938
Oh, yeah. Putting.

309
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,942
Remember what I said.

310
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:08,112
Use your shoulders
to push the ball, not the arms.

311
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,030
Don't break the wrist.

312
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:14,618
Whoa, you're confusing me.
Just let me put the ball in the hole.

313
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:30,634
Is he kidding?

314
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:52,656
This is pathetic.

315
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:08,005
Good shot.

316
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:09,340
It's about time.

317
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:14,178
True. I just couldn't get the ball in
the hole. I wanted to, but I couldn't.

318
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,545
He shoots, he scores!

319
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:52,883
That was much easier than putting.
I should try and do that every time.

320
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,552
Good plan.

321
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:56,804
-Did you see that?
-Yes. Nice.

322
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,557
He got a hole in one
on a par four.

323
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,141
I said I saw it.

324
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:04,562
I hope he wins.
He's a publicist's dream.

325
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:09,233
A guy who can drive the ball
that far--he could really draw a crowd.

326
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:13,487
So could a golfer with an arm
growing out of his ass.

327
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:28,812
Now, you make this one
in four or less shots...

328
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:30,648
...you win the tournament.

329
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:31,815
Four shots.

330
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:36,820
Think of it this way. The other team
has pulled their goalie.

331
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:40,658
It's wide open.
All you have to do is tap it in.

332
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:42,993
I can do that.

333
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,515
Don't worry.
You're doing fine.

334
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:08,519
All you have to do is tap it in.
Just tap it in.

335
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,689
Just tap it in.

336
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:22,700
Just tap it in. Just tap it in.
Give it a little tappy.

337
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,535
Tap, tap, tap-a-roo.

338
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,374
Grandma, Grandma...

339
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,877
...Grandma, Grandma.

340
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,548
All right!

341
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,061
He's going to be on the Tour.
Super.

342
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:56,400
That's cute.

343
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:02,239
Mr. Gilmore, Virginia Venit.
I'm P.R. Director of the Tour.

344
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:03,574
Nice to meet you.

345
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,326
Congratulations.

346
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:09,330
I saw that hole in one on a par four.
That must be a record.

347
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,582
I got a hockey record.

348
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:15,586
I tried to stab someone with my skate.
Nobody else ever did that.

349
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:17,421
That's wonderful.

350
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:20,674
I am a bit bummed.
I thought we got money for this.

351
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:25,930
Cheer up. Next week in Portland,
the winner takes home $216,000.

352
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,265
And the guy
who comes in last?

353
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:30,267
$2,400.

354
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:33,187
So no matter what,
I'll get some money.

355
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:40,277
Yeah. Well, I'll see you
next week then.

356
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:42,112
Bye.

357
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:48,285
I hate to admit this,
but this is my first trophy.

358
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,121
I wish that goofy golf guy
wasn't on top.

359
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:53,541
Maybe I'll put a hockey guy
on instead.

360
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,626
Happy, shut your trap.

361
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:58,462
-You were great out there today.
-Thank you.

362
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:01,632
But not that great.
A lot of that was luck.

363
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:04,718
Some might call it luck.
I like to call it...

364
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,971
...well, luck, I guess.
So what?

365
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:09,139
Don't join the Pro Tour yet.

366
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,309
We got work to do
before you go against professionals.

367
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,229
Forget it.
I'll pick up the rest as I go.

368
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:19,483
Don't be a fool! People would kill
to hit the long ball like you.

369
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,486
You got an advantage
over any other golfer.

370
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:25,072
By developing the rest
of your game...

371
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:26,991
...you'd be unstoppable.

372
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,660
You're right,
but I need money.

373
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:34,665
Don't be an asshole. Give me six
months. I'll work with you every day.

374
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:40,170
No, I got to go. I appreciate
everything. Wish me luck.

375
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:46,594
Best of luck, kid.
Best of luck.

376
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:49,847
Marty, shut up
and I'll tell you.

377
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,683
The price is $200 per quilt.

378
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,603
Well, this is handmade
quality shit.

379
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,689
When do you need them by?
Okay.

380
00:28:59,023 --> 00:29:00,691
Good doing business
with you.

381
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:04,278
Okay, everyone. Turn up your volumes.
Announcement.

382
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:07,698
Good news--arts and crafts time
is extended 4 hours.

383
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:09,617
My fingers hurt.

384
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,285
What's that?

385
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:13,704
My fingers hurt.

386
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:19,877
Well, soon your back will hurt
because you just got landscaping duty.

387
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:22,046
Anyone else's fingers hurt?

388
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,299
I didn't think so.

389
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,054
Why do you make me act
like that, huh?

390
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:33,390
Mr. Gilmore!
Toidy's to the right, dear.

391
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:36,560
-How's Grandma?
-Super. It's arts and crafts time.

392
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,562
Grandma is quite a quilter.

393
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,649
That's a tremendous trophy.

394
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:44,401
Happy, I'm so glad to see you.

395
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,153
I'm glad to see you, too.

396
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:48,739
I think about you all the time.

397
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:51,742
Looks like everyone's
having fun here.

398
00:29:56,747 --> 00:30:00,084
Good news--I made
the Professional Golfers' Tour.

399
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,502
That's lovely.

400
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,255
You know what else is lovely?

401
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:08,759
If I can beat those other guys...
we'll get the house back.

402
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:13,347
Oh, thank God! I can't stand to live
in this place another minute!

403
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:15,432
I thought you liked it here.

404
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:18,435
That orderly is nice.
Don't you like him?

405
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:20,104
Oh, I do.

406
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:24,859
It's just that the air conditioner's
broken. I'm getting a little warm.

407
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:27,278
Let the kid fix it for you.

408
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:30,281
Get the little twisty knobs.

409
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:34,285
That ain't doing it. Okay.

410
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:39,623
Mister! Mister!

411
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:42,293
Get this off of me! Mister!

412
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,128
I'll be right down!

413
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:48,966
You know that "Mister, mister" lady?
I think I killed her.

414
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:05,649
Norman spends more time in the sand
than David Hasselhoff.

415
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:08,235
Come on, that was funny.

416
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:11,155
-It was the first time I heard it.
-Drink up.

417
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:15,993
Anyone tapped the keg yet?
I'll pump. I'm Happy Gilmore.

418
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,412
Mark Lye.
Welcome to the Tour.

419
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:22,082
I heard about the ace you had
on a par four. Impressive.

420
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,001
You heard about that?

421
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:26,670
Cool. That's a nice jacket.

422
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:29,840
You get one if you win
the Tour Championship.

423
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,092
Oh, yeah? What's that?

424
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:34,678
Only the biggest tournament
of the year.

425
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:37,598
Oh, really? Where's yours?

426
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:41,685
Good one. He's funny.
I'll have mine in three months.

427
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:43,687
Not if I have anything
to do with it.

428
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:46,023
Whoa, look out.

429
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:47,858
You better look out.

430
00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:51,362
If you're free, join us at 9:00
on the ninth green.

431
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,448
-What happens there?
-Secret of the pros.

432
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:56,200
All right, cool.

433
00:31:56,534 --> 00:32:01,539
I'm out of here. I hear the Asteroids
machine calling my name. Peace.

434
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,542
And, Happy...dress nice, huh?

435
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,544
All right, all right.

436
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:18,722
Almost nine o'clock.

437
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,998
Public relations lady,
you seen Shooter McGavin?

438
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:46,917
-No. Why?
-I need to beat the piss out of him.

439
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:50,337
Let me guess--the ninth green
at nine trick.

440
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:52,256
It would appear so.

441
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:54,091
He does deserve a beating.

442
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:58,345
But if you beat him up,
I'll have to explain to the papers...

443
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:02,766
...why the new guy beat up
Shooter McGavin. More work for me.

444
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:04,435
I don't want to do that.

445
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:07,855
Forget about Shooter.
He's just threatened by you.

446
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,441
He's afraid you'll steal
his thunder.

447
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,610
That's nice of you to say.

448
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:18,115
So, I'm going to go change now.

449
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:23,537
My girlfriend's dead. She fell off
a cliff and died on impact.

450
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:26,040
Really?
I'm sorry to hear that.

451
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:32,379
You should get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.

452
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:34,465
You're right. It is.

453
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:48,812
Hello. I'm Verne Lundquist,
with Jack Beard.

454
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:53,067
We have a nice crowd here
on this sun-sational April morning...

455
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:55,986
...for the 22nd annual
AT&T lnvitational.

456
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,490
Here today are elite golfers
from around the world.

457
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,994
The favorite is Shooter McGavin.
He's won three of the last four.

458
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:09,500
Thanks, man.

459
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:11,669
Here's my last buck.

460
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,587
This is the last time.

461
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:17,675
He's just trying to make some money.
Leave him alone.

462
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,679
I don't know why I'm winning.

463
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:25,099
I'm in the zone.
The hole seems to get bigger.

464
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:26,767
You like being the favorite?

465
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:30,437
I'm not. With the great players here,
anyone could win.

466
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,189
I'll just do my best.

467
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:36,277
The real favorite is Portland. Every
time I visit, it's harder to leave.

468
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:39,530
Must be something in the water.
Well, time to play golf.

469
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,031
Good luck.

470
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,785
I'm a hockey player
playing golf today.

471
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:46,036
Name?

472
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:47,454
Happy Gilmore.

473
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:49,540
The guy with the long drive.

474
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,793
-Caddy's name?
-You haven't given me one yet.

475
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:55,379
On the Pro Tour,
you provide your own.

476
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,214
Really?

477
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:00,217
Okay.

478
00:35:02,386 --> 00:35:05,222
Easy with those clubs.
They're antiques.

479
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:10,394
Gary Potter. Great to have you
on the Tour.

480
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:15,149
I feel a lot of solid energy coming
out of you. Good positive aura.

481
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,067
Nice to meet you.

482
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:20,738
Is it always like this--TV cameras,
people and stuff?

483
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,490
Yeah, a lot of pressure.
Rise above it.

484
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,660
Harness in the good energy,
block out the bad.

485
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:29,079
Harness energy, block bad.

486
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:32,082
Feel the flow, Happy.
It's circular.

487
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,918
It's like a carousel.

488
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:37,171
You get on the horse.
It goes up, down and around.

489
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:41,592
Circular. Circle. With the music,
the flow. All good things.

490
00:35:42,092 --> 00:35:45,262
Okay. Well, great. Thanks.
Nice to meet you.

491
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:47,431
Psycho.

492
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:50,267
Next to tee off,
Happy Gilmore.

493
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,604
Give me a club.

494
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:56,774
I'll get it.

495
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:12,289
Fu--, sh--, fu--, ass--

496
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,800
Sorry.

497
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:28,806
Psycho.

498
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:47,825
What a shot
by Happy Gilmore!

499
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:49,994
Who the hell is
Happy Gilmore?

500
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:14,059
Oh, yeah!

501
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:17,062
I got it!

502
00:37:18,898 --> 00:37:19,899
Like that, baby?

503
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,818
Plenty more
where that came from!

504
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:27,156
Get Virginia Venit in here, now.

505
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:28,908
Use a five iron.

506
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,577
You think so?
Give me my wedge.

507
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:48,761
Five iron, huh?
You're fired. Bye-bye.

508
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:07,863
What are you doing, Happy--riding
a bull? You're acting like a damn fool!

509
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:17,623
Doing the bull dance.
Feeling the flow. Working it.

510
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:21,126
On the 18th green, Shooter McGavin
putts for the win.

511
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:25,631
His crowd seems unusually small
for this type of moment.

512
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:34,139
Most people are over watching
Happy Gilmore.

513
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,058
He's the talk of the course...

514
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:39,728
...with his huge drives
and bizarre behavior.

515
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:44,316
He's on the 17th green right now,
having trouble closing out his day.

516
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,154
Happy, the ball has its own energy
or life force, if you will.

517
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:52,491
Its natural environment
is in the hole.

518
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:54,493
Why don't you send him home?

519
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,997
His bags are packed.
He has his plane ticket.

520
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,999
Bring him to the airport.

521
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,750
Send him home.

522
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,671
Send him home.
I'll send him home.

523
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:08,507
It's time to go home, ball.

524
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:15,598
Son of a bitch ball!
Why didn't you go home?!

525
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:20,019
That's your home! Are you too good
for your home?! Answer me!

526
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:22,771
Suck my white ass, ball!

527
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:33,032
Draft a press release stating Gilmore
is being thrown off the Tour.

528
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:34,950
I want to see it by 6:00 p.m.

529
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:39,371
You're right--his behavior is
completely unacceptable.

530
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:43,042
But golf has been waiting
for a player like this.

531
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:46,045
A colorful, emotional,
working class hero.

532
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:49,465
I will not tolerate this behavior.
Gilmore is gone.

533
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:51,550
I got a call
from the Dallas Open.

534
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,471
They're deluged with calls
from people who want to see Happy.

535
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:57,723
-They sold out.
-Already?

536
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:01,310
I know he's a little rough.
Let me work with him.

537
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:07,066
Okay. Fine.
But he's your responsibility.

538
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:09,401
If he cleans up, he can stay.

539
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,904
If he doesn't, it's your ass.

540
00:40:12,238 --> 00:40:13,906
And any more of this...

541
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:18,911
...and he's gone.

542
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,254
Shooter! Shooter!

543
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,673
What do you think
of Happy Gilmore?

544
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:34,176
I didn't see him play.
I was too busy winning.

545
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,595
But a 450-yard drive
is impressive.

546
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:41,267
Yeah. Where did he finish again?
Dead last? Yeah, he had a good day.

547
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,185
Did he really make
a 450-yard ace?

548
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:44,770
Where's my check?

549
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,355
We mail them next week.

550
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:47,940
I want mine now.

551
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,525
I don't have any checks.

552
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:53,279
He got one. Give me
one of them big ones, I don't care.

553
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:56,782
Give me a beer, pal.

554
00:40:57,116 --> 00:40:58,450
Put that on my tab.

555
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:01,537
You were the talk
of the tournament, Gilmore.

556
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:03,372
Wow, thanks a lot.

557
00:41:03,622 --> 00:41:07,960
You sure crush the ball at the tee.
You'd do well in a long-drive contest.

558
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,964
You'd make good money, traveling,
hustling at driving ranges.

559
00:41:12,214 --> 00:41:14,884
I know what you're doing
right now...

560
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:20,139
...and I don't like it. So just shut
your trap before I put my foot in it.

561
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:26,478
Don't turn your back on me.
Listen, this is Shooter's tour.

562
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:29,982
I worked hard, paid my dues--
now it's Shooter's turn.

563
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:34,486
Shooter won't let his reign at the top
be spoiled by some freak.

564
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,238
Did you call me a freak?

565
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:39,408
I was on this tour for one reason--
money.

566
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:41,827
Now I got a new one--
kicking your ass.

567
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,663
I'd like to see you try.

568
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:46,665
Let's do it.

569
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,168
I meant at golf.

570
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:51,086
What's going on here?

571
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:54,089
I was looking for the other half
of this bottle.

572
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,176
Oh, there's some of it
right there.

573
00:41:57,426 --> 00:41:59,762
-Why don't you put it down?
-I know.

574
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:04,850
Just stay out of my way.
Or you'll pay. Listen to what I say.

575
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:07,353
Why don't I go eat some hay?

576
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:10,940
I could make things out of clay
and lay by the bay.

577
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,691
What do you say?

578
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,199
Calm down or you'll get kicked
off the Tour.

579
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:23,536
-That can't happen.
-It can, and I don't want it to.

580
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,371
You could be a big star.

581
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:27,623
I just want to make
some money.

582
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:31,210
You won't be around long enough
to do that if you don't behave.

583
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,295
What do you mean by "behave"?

584
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:35,881
No swearing,
no throwing clubs...

585
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:38,801
...and especially no hitting
other players.

586
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:40,886
You mean no fun.

587
00:42:41,136 --> 00:42:42,721
You can have fun.

588
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:47,643
That's why I think people come
to see you. But keep it within reason.

589
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:53,566
I will work on what you call behaving.
But I won't act like a stiff.

590
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:56,068
Fine. Thank you.

591
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,071
Hey, um...

592
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:01,240
...you want to get some food?

593
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:04,243
No, thanks.
I don't date golfers.

594
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:06,495
Good. I'm a hockey player.

595
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:11,250
Just behave, okay?

596
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,591
Happy Gilmore approaches the tee
in the 72nd annual Cleveland Classic.

597
00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:21,927
Happy Gilmore!
Drive it 400 yards!

598
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:25,931
I can't believe I have fans.
I waited all my life for that.

599
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:29,602
Don't be alarmed,
Mr. Gilmore.

600
00:43:29,852 --> 00:43:33,022
I know we had our problems,
but I'm proud of you.

601
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:35,024
Thanks a lot, Mr. Larson.

602
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:37,276
It's good to see you again.

603
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,945
How's that, uh, thing feeling?

604
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:42,615
Terrific. The nail comes out
next week.

605
00:43:42,948 --> 00:43:45,117
Well, you hardly even notice it.

606
00:43:49,288 --> 00:43:51,123
Let's make a little noise here.

607
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:55,794
Come on!
I can't hear you!

608
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:24,323
Trying to reach
the green from here?

609
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:25,991
That's not possible, sir.

610
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:27,326
I beg to differ.

611
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:31,330
Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat
no more than an hour ago.

612
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:35,501
Well, moron, good for Happy--
Oh, my God!

613
00:44:46,011 --> 00:44:47,096
Oh, my God.

614
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:58,357
Hey, Shooter,
you forgot your nine iron.

615
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:07,116
A large and economically diverse crowd
here at the Michelob lnvitational.

616
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:10,035
It's the tour sensation,
Happy Gilmore...

617
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:15,124
...who's attracting all types
to this course. I even saw one guy...

618
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:18,794
...wearing one of those
beer-dispensing helmets.

619
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,723
Damn you people.
Go back to your shanties.

620
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:35,227
This is a biggie, pal.
I got to make some real money.

621
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:37,897
What do you think?
Slightly downhill?

622
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:39,315
And slanting left.

623
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,651
No, you think that
'cause you only got one shoe on.

624
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:45,571
Oh, yeah.

625
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:01,086
Happy Gilmore

626
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:33,202
You got the ball?

627
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:44,630
Happy Gilmore from nine feet.

628
00:46:44,964 --> 00:46:46,799
Here comes the putter throw.

629
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:51,971
Wait. He's restrained himself.
Maybe this is a new Happy Gilmore.

630
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:59,728
Another tournament here in Dallas,
and Shooter McGavin wins again.

631
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:02,314
He's won here 3 years in a row.

632
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:17,413
That son of a bitch!

633
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,001
Give me my ball! Give it here!
Cough it up, you dirty bastard!

634
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:23,669
I'll rip it out of you!

635
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:24,920
Give me--

636
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:27,006
Give me the ball.

637
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:33,762
You have one eye.

638
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:36,682
Chubbs.

639
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:38,517
You took his hand.

640
00:48:21,227 --> 00:48:24,563
That Happy Gilmore is a real crack-up.
He's a hoot!

641
00:48:24,813 --> 00:48:27,816
He's bringing in
some big crowds.

642
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,238
Today, one of his fans mooned me.
He had "HAPPY" written on his ass.

643
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:35,908
"HA" was on one cheek
and "PPY" on the other.

644
00:48:36,158 --> 00:48:37,910
I love what he's doing for golf.

645
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,997
-Well, I'm starting to come around.
-Everyone is.

646
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:43,749
Well, I'm not, Doug!!

647
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:45,668
This man is destroying golf.

648
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:49,088
I saw two fat bikers in the woods
off 17 having sex.

649
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:51,340
How can I chip
with that going on?

650
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,594
-Kick him off the Tour.
-He hasn't broken any rules.

651
00:48:55,928 --> 00:48:57,346
He's a disgrace to the game!

652
00:48:57,596 --> 00:49:02,268
Yes, but our ratings are up.
We're attracting new, youthful sponsors.

653
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,270
I'm sorry, Shooter.

654
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,021
There's nothing I can do.

655
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:12,528
Then I'll have to take care of this
myself.

656
00:49:13,445 --> 00:49:17,116
Grandma, I came in 9th place.
I won $35,000.

657
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:19,034
So we'll get the house back?

658
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:21,954
As long as I don't place last
the next two times...

659
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:23,706
...we'll get the money in time.

660
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:25,958
That's wonderful, Happy.

661
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,793
I love you, Grandma. Bye.

662
00:49:28,127 --> 00:49:29,628
Good-bye, darling.

663
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:38,137
We should go on that date.
I've been pretty good lately.

664
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:41,724
Oh? I hear you broke a rake
and threw it in the woods.

665
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:45,644
I didn't break it.
I was testing its durability.

666
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:48,898
I put it in the woods
because it's made of wood...

667
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:50,900
...and he should be
with his family.

668
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:54,236
At least I didn't punch anyone.

669
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:59,158
Okay, we'll go on a date.
But just as friends.

670
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:02,661
Slow down. I don't want to be
more than friends.

671
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:04,580
I just met you.

672
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,002
Fit you okay?

673
00:50:10,294 --> 00:50:13,297
I haven't skated
since I was a little kid.

674
00:50:15,507 --> 00:50:18,344
Can we get a little time here?

675
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:22,515
For Happy Gilmore, anything.

676
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,520
You played ice hockey?

677
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:29,021
Shut up.

678
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:32,858
Oh, my God...power failure.

679
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:35,319
It's very scary in here.

680
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:36,737
Did you plan this?

681
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:38,322
No.

682
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,496
I thought we were going to be
just friends.

683
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,583
What? Friends listen to "Endless Love"
in the dark.

684
00:51:03,597 --> 00:51:07,434
This song reminds me
of seventh grade.

685
00:51:07,685 --> 00:51:10,187
It reminds me
of my grandmother.

686
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:11,772
That's kind of weird.

687
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:14,108
She took me to see this movie.

688
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:16,944
I had the biggest crush
on Brooke Shields.

689
00:51:18,112 --> 00:51:22,116
My grandma told me I should
write her a letter, so I did.

690
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:25,369
I got a letter back
from Brooke two weeks later.

691
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,289
But it was in my grandmother's
handwriting.

692
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:30,791
Your grandma sounds sweet.

693
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:34,795
She is sweet.
That's why I feel so terrible.

694
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:36,297
Why?

695
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:39,633
No, forget it.

696
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:42,636
You can tell me.

697
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:47,808
She's stuck in a nursing home.
The IRS repossessed her house.

698
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:49,727
That's awful.

699
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,478
That's why I joined the Tour.

700
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:54,148
I'm close to getting
her house back.

701
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:57,234
Don't tell anyone.
I'm kind of embarrassed.

702
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:01,071
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

703
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:04,825
I'll make you a bet.

704
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:07,494
Do you always carry a puck?

705
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:08,746
Yeah.

706
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:14,335
Now, if you get that puck
in the net over there...

707
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:17,671
...l'll never bother you again.

708
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:20,841
But if you miss...

709
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:24,512
...you have to give me
a big, fat kiss.

710
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,514
And you have to pretend
you like it.

711
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:28,182
Really?

712
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:29,767
Good luck.

713
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,365
Shit.

714
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,618
Talk about your all-time backfires.

715
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:50,037
Happy...

716
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:55,376
...l didn't see it go in.

717
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:11,892
I'll give it all to you

718
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:16,564
My love, my love, my love

719
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:19,900
My endless love

720
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,795
Welcome to soggy San Francisco...

721
00:53:40,129 --> 00:53:42,464
...site of this year's Pepsi Pro-Am.

722
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,301
Hello, Happy.
I'm Bob Barker.

723
00:53:45,634 --> 00:53:47,636
What an honor.
Nice to meet you.

724
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:50,139
We're playing together today.

725
00:53:51,056 --> 00:53:53,642
That's funny.
Who am I really playing with?

726
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:56,729
In a Pro-Am, each golfer plays
with a celebrity.

727
00:53:56,896 --> 00:53:57,897
Wow.

728
00:53:58,063 --> 00:54:02,318
Nick Faldo and I won last year.
I'd like to win this year.

729
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:04,403
I'll do my best.

730
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:06,488
Hey, Gilmore?

731
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:09,325
You suck, you jackass.

732
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:11,076
Shut the hell up.

733
00:54:13,412 --> 00:54:17,166
I'd love to punch that guy in the face,
but I'd get in trouble.

734
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,418
You get this
on "Let's Make A Deal"?

735
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:21,086
"The Price ls Right", Happy.

736
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:22,922
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

737
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:25,591
It happens.
Let's play some golf.

738
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:32,348
Jackass.

739
00:54:36,268 --> 00:54:38,020
The club went further
than the ball.

740
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:41,357
What was that all about?

741
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:46,612
It's just that it's rainy
and that guy.... It just slipped.

742
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:58,207
Get a blanket and suntan lotion,
'cause you'll never get off that beach.

743
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:02,962
Just the way you never got
into the NHL, you jackass!

744
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:11,387
The green's that way.

745
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:21,981
You will not make this putt,
you jackass.

746
00:55:27,736 --> 00:55:29,321
Nice shooting, soldier.

747
00:55:33,742 --> 00:55:35,744
All right, Happy...

748
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,247
...nice and easy.

749
00:55:43,419 --> 00:55:45,754
That was not nice and easy.

750
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:52,344
That guy is driving me crazy.

751
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:56,432
What's driving me crazy is
you not getting the ball in the hole.

752
00:55:56,765 --> 00:55:59,602
Don't push me, Bob.
Now's not the time.

753
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,774
Jackass.

754
00:56:10,613 --> 00:56:12,448
This guy sucks!

755
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:17,703
We haven't seen Gilmore play this badly
since his first day on tour.

756
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:21,040
He and Bob Barker
are now dead last.

757
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:25,461
You should be working at the snack bar,
not playing golf.

758
00:56:25,711 --> 00:56:27,046
Relax, Bob.

759
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:31,800
There is no way you could have been
as bad at hockey as you are at golf.

760
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:33,802
Okay, let's go.

761
00:56:35,137 --> 00:56:38,140
You like that, old man?!
You want a piece of me?

762
00:56:38,974 --> 00:56:42,061
I don't want a piece of you.
I want the whole thing!

763
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,578
Now you're gonna get it,
Bobby!

764
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,934
The price is wrong, bitch.

765
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:34,780
I think you've had enough.

766
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:36,866
No?

767
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:41,537
Now you've had enough.

768
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:43,706
Bitch.

769
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,168
That couldn't have gone better.

770
00:57:48,252 --> 00:57:50,963
Instead of hitting you,
he hits Bob Barker.

771
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:52,214
Perfect.

772
00:57:52,464 --> 00:57:54,550
So, see you
at the next tournament?

773
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,804
No need. This was on national TV.
Gilmore is gone.

774
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:02,892
Let's get something at the Red Lobster.
My treat.

775
00:58:03,142 --> 00:58:04,476
Some other time.

776
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:06,562
I thought we were friends.

777
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:09,231
We are. I just have to go.

778
00:58:09,565 --> 00:58:13,402
I'll be at the Red Lobster
in case you change your mind.

779
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:15,237
God bless!

780
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,156
There you are.

781
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,825
Happy Gilmore,
come on down!

782
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:22,161
Thank you, Shooter.
Sit down.

783
00:58:22,912 --> 00:58:26,749
So you got in a fight with a game show
host on national TV.

784
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:28,667
That is not entertainment.

785
00:58:28,918 --> 00:58:32,171
This is not hockey,
no matter how much you want it to be.

786
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,590
I know that and I'm sorry.

787
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:36,926
But there was a guy out there...

788
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:40,346
...giving me crap. It took all I had
not to hit him.

789
00:58:40,596 --> 00:58:44,266
So you head-butt Bob Barker?
Who won that fight, anyway?

790
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,601
Enough, Shooter.

791
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:48,020
The board has done the following:

792
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,106
Fined you $25,000
and suspended you for one month.

793
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:54,443
-What?! I got to play!
-What?! Kick him off the Tour.

794
00:58:54,944 --> 00:58:57,780
The board thinks
that might be extreme...

795
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:01,367
...considering the fact
that our ratings were...

796
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:03,536
...the highest we've ever had.

797
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:06,455
My grandmother's house
got repossessed.

798
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:10,626
If I don't win more prize money,
they'll sell it to someone else.

799
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,295
Whoop-dee-doo.
Get out.

800
00:59:18,634 --> 00:59:23,138
It's over. My grandmother
will never see her house again.

801
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:27,726
But you've made a lot of money.
You could buy her a nice condo.

802
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:31,730
My grandfather didn't build
any condos with his bare hands.

803
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:34,567
Damn it,
I hate that Bob Barker.

804
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:37,987
There must be
another way to get the $50,000.

805
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:42,074
I don't want to talk about it.
I failed, okay?

806
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:45,828
Let me just enjoy the one thing
that makes me a bit happy...

807
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:48,747
...this fresh, delicious, tasty...

808
00:59:48,998 --> 00:59:51,250
...meaty, turkey-filled...

809
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,338
...Cold Cut Combo. I eat three
every day just to keep me strong.

810
00:59:56,589 --> 00:59:57,923
Hey, Happy...

811
00:59:58,173 --> 00:59:59,842
...can I have one of those?

812
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:01,844
Coming right up!

813
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:09,685
Talk about a hole in one.

814
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:13,189
Subway sandwiches
will drive away your hunger.

815
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:15,274
What do you think?

816
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:18,777
I love it. He looks so handsome.
And it makes me hungry.

817
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:22,698
They gave me a card
that gives us free Subway for life.

818
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:24,116
That's lovely.

819
01:00:24,366 --> 01:00:26,368
You know what else is lovely?

820
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:29,955
That commercial puts us up
to $275,000.

821
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,374
Let's go get your house back.

822
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:43,802
What the hell?

823
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:50,309
What's going on here?

824
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,396
It's exciting. We're auctioning off
your grandmother's house.

825
01:00:54,647 --> 01:00:57,983
You said if we got the money,
we could buy it back.

826
01:00:58,234 --> 01:00:59,568
You can buy it back.

827
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:02,821
Bidding will start at $100,000.
Do I hear 100?

828
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:05,407
This is the exciting part.
Have fun.

829
01:01:06,742 --> 01:01:10,412
Look at all these people.
What's going on, Happy?

830
01:01:10,746 --> 01:01:12,081
Thank you, two.

831
01:01:12,414 --> 01:01:14,083
They're auctioning it off.

832
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:17,169
Good. We'll get it cheaper
than we thought.

833
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:19,421
Two fifty, thank you.

834
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:22,258
Maybe not. Two seventy-five!

835
01:01:22,508 --> 01:01:24,760
Two seventy-five. And three.

836
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:26,428
Three fifty down front.

837
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:30,099
I have three fifty.
Seventy-five anywhere?

838
01:01:30,432 --> 01:01:33,936
Three fifty--sold to the gentleman
in the white sweater.

839
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,855
What just happened, Happy?

840
01:01:37,523 --> 01:01:39,358
Go wait in the car, Grandma.

841
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:43,279
What the hell
is wrong with you?

842
01:01:43,529 --> 01:01:45,614
I enjoy real estate speculation.

843
01:01:47,032 --> 01:01:51,036
You touch me, I burn the house down
and piss on the ashes.

844
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:52,955
What do you want for it?

845
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:54,540
You know what.

846
01:01:54,957 --> 01:01:56,959
You off the Tour.

847
01:01:57,209 --> 01:01:59,712
Quit, and the house is yours.

848
01:01:59,962 --> 01:02:01,046
Fine. I quit.

849
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,299
No way. Happy, come here.

850
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:07,386
He's right. I don't belong in golf.
I'm a hockey player.

851
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:10,055
-What team do you play for?
-Easy.

852
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:13,225
Face it, Happy.
You are a golfer.

853
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:18,564
I did this to get Grandma's house back.
Now I can. No regrets.

854
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:23,986
What do you think she wants more--to
get her house back or see you succeed?

855
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:29,825
Maybe she can have both.
Hey, Shooter.

856
01:02:30,492 --> 01:02:32,745
The Tour Championship
is next week.

857
01:02:33,495 --> 01:02:37,166
If I beat you, I get the house.
You beat me, I'll quit.

858
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:40,336
You're going to beat me?
At golf?

859
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:43,756
You're on.

860
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,927
But you're in trouble. I eat pieces
of shit like you for breakfast.

861
01:02:48,177 --> 01:02:50,429
You eat pieces of shit
for breakfast?

862
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:53,516
No.

863
01:02:58,354 --> 01:03:01,524
That was great.
I know you will kick his ass.

864
01:03:01,857 --> 01:03:03,526
That makes one of us.

865
01:03:03,776 --> 01:03:06,529
Take care of Grandma.
I'll walk from here.

866
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:09,865
-Where are you going?
-To learn to play golf.

867
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:15,037
I'm stupid, you're smart.

868
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:17,706
I was wrong,
you were right.

869
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,709
You're the best,
I'm the worst.

870
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:24,880
You're very good-looking,
I'm not attractive.

871
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:28,801
Okay, as long as you're willing
to admit that. Now...

872
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:32,888
...are you ready to work
and do what I tell you?

873
01:03:33,222 --> 01:03:34,807
Believe me, I'm ready.

874
01:03:35,891 --> 01:03:37,560
Then let's get to work.

875
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:41,981
I'm sorry. Here.

876
01:03:43,065 --> 01:03:44,567
Here's your pinky.

877
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:54,076
"Happyland", just like me.

878
01:03:54,326 --> 01:03:56,662
Don't get excited.
I've been here before.

879
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:03,419
This is embarrassing. I'm a
professional golfer, for God's sake.

880
01:04:03,669 --> 01:04:07,506
No, it's your short game
that's embarrassing. Let's go.

881
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:26,108
Just line up the putt.
Don't even look at the hole.

882
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:30,946
Aim for a spot six inches
in front of the hole. Line up with that.

883
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,282
Okay. Six inches.

884
01:04:56,305 --> 01:04:58,307
This one's very tough.

885
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:04,980
He's laughing, having fun.

886
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:07,566
Yeah, laugh it up.
Enjoy your night.

887
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:10,319
Happy, concentrate.

888
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:18,994
I hate that clown.

889
01:05:19,245 --> 01:05:23,916
Easy. If you can't beat the clown,
how will you beat Shooter McGavin?

890
01:05:32,424 --> 01:05:34,093
You're gonna die, clown!

891
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,014
Is that funny? I don't hear you
laughing now!

892
01:05:39,348 --> 01:05:40,516
Enough.

893
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:42,351
What? I can't do it!

894
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:46,021
Come with me, Happy.
Come on!

895
01:05:46,355 --> 01:05:48,440
You suck, you stupid clown!

896
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:52,528
Remember, this isn't hockey.

897
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:57,032
You don't play with raw emotion.
You can't putt angry.

898
01:05:57,366 --> 01:06:01,203
You must clear your mind
of everything else and stay focused.

899
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:07,877
How can I do that?

900
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:11,380
Think of a place
that's really perfect.

901
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:13,883
Your own happy place.

902
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:17,386
Go there and all your anger
will disappear.

903
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,054
Then putt.

904
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:21,223
Happy place.

905
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:23,392
Happy place.

906
01:06:23,726 --> 01:06:25,561
Your happy place.

907
01:06:55,508 --> 01:06:56,509
Now how do you feel?

908
01:06:56,759 --> 01:06:57,760
Better.

909
01:06:58,427 --> 01:06:59,428
Now putt.

910
01:07:22,117 --> 01:07:23,452
Your happy place.

911
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:32,962
We took some giant steps
tonight.

912
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:35,464
I'm really proud of you.

913
01:07:35,965 --> 01:07:37,132
Here.

914
01:07:38,133 --> 01:07:40,469
I got something special
for you.

915
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:41,804
Thanks, Chubbs.

916
01:07:42,054 --> 01:07:46,809
It's the putter I used when I played--
slightly modified, of course.

917
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:49,645
Man, this is excellent.

918
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:55,734
You got the spirit of a hockey player
in you, so I figured--why fight it?

919
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:58,320
I got something for you, too.

920
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:01,991
If not for you, none of this
would have happened...

921
01:08:02,241 --> 01:08:04,577
...so I wanted to show
my appreciation.

922
01:08:08,497 --> 01:08:10,499
This looks nice.
What is it?

923
01:08:10,749 --> 01:08:11,750
Open it.

924
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,002
Shit.

925
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:14,753
Oh, man.

926
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:17,089
Remember the 'gator
that got your hand?

927
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:19,008
I got his head.

928
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,190
First my dad and now Chubbs.

929
01:08:34,523 --> 01:08:38,027
Anyone I get close to, dies.
If I were you, I'd run.

930
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,863
You can't blame yourself
for this.

931
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:44,366
I guess that alligator
finally finished the job.

932
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,452
I'm going to miss you, pal.

933
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:56,879
How am I going to play today?

934
01:08:57,129 --> 01:08:58,881
Just remember
what he taught you.

935
01:08:59,131 --> 01:09:03,135
Congratulations, murderer.
You killed a golf legend.

936
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:04,470
Beat it, McGavin.

937
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,225
I'm dedicating my performance at the
Tour Championship to Chubbs' memory.

938
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:11,560
I'm playing for Chubbs.

939
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:13,395
I called it first.

940
01:09:13,812 --> 01:09:17,149
You want to beat him?
Beat him on the course.

941
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:20,069
Yeah, I'm gonna beat your ass
out there.

942
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,571
Right. And Grizzly Adams
had a beard.

943
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:24,573
Grizzly Adams did have a beard.

944
01:09:27,952 --> 01:09:29,745
The golfers
of the Tour Championship...

945
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,499
...are ready to begin.
There may be 63 professionals...

946
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,292
...vying for the title
of world's best...

947
01:09:35,334 --> 01:09:38,754
but in the minds of the spectators,
there are only two.

948
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:41,006
Tour kingpin Shooter McGavin...

949
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:44,593
...and bad boy Happy Gilmore,
just off suspension.

950
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:47,847
Wouldn't you know it?
They've been paired together.

951
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:51,767
I have some good interior design ideas
for Grandma's house.

952
01:09:52,017 --> 01:09:54,436
You know the bedroom
next to the stairs?

953
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:56,021
Yeah, that was my room.

954
01:09:56,272 --> 01:09:58,858
I'm turning it
into my trophy room.

955
01:10:11,704 --> 01:10:13,455
It just may not be
big enough.

956
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:15,958
All right.

957
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:34,059
You know what's pathetic?
You've been playing golf all your life.

958
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:41,233
Let me show you
how we do it in the pros.

959
01:10:48,574 --> 01:10:49,909
That's got to hurt.

960
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:01,837
Happy learned how to putt.
Uh-oh.

961
01:11:03,756 --> 01:11:05,382
Here's a free lesson.

962
01:11:11,722 --> 01:11:13,724
Can't learn that
on a hockey rink.

963
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,613
Somebody's closer.

964
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,576
After one day,
Shooter McGavin is leading.

965
01:11:32,785 --> 01:11:35,955
But the big surprise
is young Happy Gilmore...

966
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:39,959
...nipping at his heels,
trailing by only one stroke.

967
01:11:41,585 --> 01:11:42,920
Shooter from the sand.

968
01:11:43,128 --> 01:11:45,798
Playing like he really wants
that jacket.

969
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:54,598
Happy Gilmore answers back
with a birdie.

970
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,156
Happy with a long eagle opportunity.

971
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:14,493
It's good!

972
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,162
And Shooter can't believe it!

973
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:20,499
He is now tied
with Happy Gilmore!

974
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:26,672
Uh-oh. A little too much zip
on that one.

975
01:12:28,174 --> 01:12:31,177
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

976
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,845
No!

977
01:12:36,682 --> 01:12:40,686
I didn't see that. Did it go in?
I wasn't watching.

978
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:45,524
I wasn't watching. I saw it go up.
Did it go back in?

979
01:12:46,025 --> 01:12:49,153
At the end of day three,
Happy Gilmore has the lead.

980
01:12:49,486 --> 01:12:53,699
One has to be impressed with the vast
improvement in his short game.

981
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:14,887
Donald, it's Shooter.

982
01:13:15,221 --> 01:13:17,890
Shooter!
It's great to hear from you!

983
01:13:18,182 --> 01:13:20,392
Want to go to Sizzler
and get some grub?

984
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:22,353
No, thanks. Not hungry.

985
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:27,066
This call is about business.
I need you here in the morning.

986
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:29,652
It's the final day
of the Tour Championship...

987
01:13:29,693 --> 01:13:31,904
...and it promises to be
a classic.

988
01:13:32,363 --> 01:13:34,406
Happy Gilmore leads the pack.

989
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:38,911
Is this a changing of the guard?
We'll know in 18 holes.

990
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:48,254
Happy is really on today.

991
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,226
There he is.

992
01:14:02,768 --> 01:14:04,103
That worm.

993
01:14:04,603 --> 01:14:06,272
Happy, look out!

994
01:14:12,403 --> 01:14:13,404
Are you okay?

995
01:14:13,612 --> 01:14:15,281
Volkswagen.

996
01:14:15,573 --> 01:14:17,241
Jackass!

997
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:34,466
Jackass!

998
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:39,138
You have no serious injuries.
Just keep off your feet for a few days.

999
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,140
Forget it.
I have to finish.

1000
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:44,268
Do what you like. What do I know?
I'm just a doctor.

1001
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:45,978
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1002
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:49,440
There is no shame
in throwing in the towel.

1003
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,817
You must be careful
with your health.

1004
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:53,986
Let's just play some golf.

1005
01:14:54,778 --> 01:14:56,447
I knew Happy Gilmore
was tough...

1006
01:14:56,655 --> 01:15:00,326
...but I can't believe he's playing
after being hit by a car.

1007
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:02,995
Let's hope it doesn't affect
his game.

1008
01:15:06,957 --> 01:15:10,461
That's the first time he's failed
to outdrive McGavin.

1009
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:14,340
Well, well, well. Happy Gilmore is
human after all.

1010
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:19,678
Happy Gilmore is in trouble
if he can't hit the long ball.

1011
01:15:20,012 --> 01:15:21,347
If he has a chance...

1012
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:24,850
...of winning today, he must do it
on the green.

1013
01:15:30,523 --> 01:15:35,194
He has to focus now.
He has to save this one for par.

1014
01:15:38,364 --> 01:15:41,158
That bogey drops him
out of the lead.

1015
01:15:41,534 --> 01:15:44,370
If he wants to stay in this thing...

1016
01:15:44,662 --> 01:15:46,163
...he has to calm down.

1017
01:15:53,045 --> 01:15:56,882
Don't worry about your grandma.
She can live with me--be my maid.

1018
01:16:03,347 --> 01:16:05,349
Look at the cabbage
he's in now.

1019
01:16:05,558 --> 01:16:09,228
Things just keep getting worse
for Happy Gilmore.

1020
01:16:11,897 --> 01:16:14,400
Just remember what Chubbs said.

1021
01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:16,735
"Go to a happy place."

1022
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:19,405
"Go to a happy place."

1023
01:16:57,109 --> 01:16:58,444
God!

1024
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:13,709
This looks like the end
for Happy Gilmore.

1025
01:17:13,751 --> 01:17:16,128
Shooter now has
a commanding lead.

1026
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:37,483
Happy, look who's here.

1027
01:17:37,816 --> 01:17:39,151
Grandma.

1028
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:42,655
Happy, you look upset.
What's wrong?

1029
01:17:42,988 --> 01:17:45,783
I stink.
I'm not going to win.

1030
01:17:45,991 --> 01:17:50,663
Don't worry, sweetheart. The house
isn't important. It's just a house.

1031
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:53,332
Stop fraternizing with the help,
Gilmore.

1032
01:17:53,624 --> 01:17:56,627
Just hit your ball,
if you can find it.

1033
01:17:57,169 --> 01:17:58,337
Hi, Grandma.

1034
01:17:59,338 --> 01:18:03,843
Forget him. I just want you
to be happy, darling.

1035
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,805
All right, Grandma.

1036
01:18:14,353 --> 01:18:17,189
Grandma wants me
to be happy.

1037
01:18:38,544 --> 01:18:41,881
Chin up, Happy.
Don't feel bad about me.

1038
01:18:42,214 --> 01:18:44,049
I got my hand back, see?

1039
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:49,054
We've only just begun

1040
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:53,893
To live

1041
01:18:55,728 --> 01:18:58,731
White lace and promises

1042
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:04,904
A kiss for luck
and we're on our way

1043
01:19:14,413 --> 01:19:19,084
It ain't over yet, McGavin. The way
I see it, we've only just begun.

1044
01:19:46,737 --> 01:19:49,907
Happy, the gold jacket's yours.
Shooter will choke.

1045
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:56,372
Unbelievable!

1046
01:20:08,634 --> 01:20:12,805
Damn you people!
This is golf, not a rock concert!

1047
01:20:19,645 --> 01:20:20,813
Putz!

1048
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:41,500
Happy...

1049
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,669
...rules!

1050
01:20:57,349 --> 01:20:59,977
Happy Gilmore has charged
in the back nine...

1051
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,354
...and is now even
with Shooter McGavin.

1052
01:21:02,688 --> 01:21:06,025
If Shooter doesn't get
out of the funk he's in...

1053
01:21:06,358 --> 01:21:08,694
...he may miss out
on the gold jacket.

1054
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:13,324
Ladies and gentlemen, the 18th hole
is a par three, 160 yards.

1055
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:16,368
In the event of a tie,
there will be a play-off.

1056
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,163
Mr. Gilmore,
you have the honors.

1057
01:21:20,372 --> 01:21:22,708
No matter what,
I'm having fun.

1058
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:25,377
You're starting
to sound like a golfer.

1059
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:27,505
I know. Keep it down.

1060
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:51,195
Nice shot! Fifteen feet
short of the hole.

1061
01:22:03,082 --> 01:22:05,084
Shooter's ball is
in the woods.

1062
01:22:05,376 --> 01:22:09,088
Happy's on the 18th green,
where a car driven by a crazed fan...

1063
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,048
...rammed the TV tower.

1064
01:22:13,926 --> 01:22:16,387
Let me through--
I'm looking for my ball.

1065
01:22:16,595 --> 01:22:20,599
This is golf, okay? Excuse me.
Thank you.

1066
01:22:26,438 --> 01:22:27,606
Is this your ball?

1067
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,067
Yes, it is.

1068
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:32,111
It struck my foot.

1069
01:22:32,444 --> 01:22:33,779
Doug!

1070
01:22:35,114 --> 01:22:36,615
Do I get a drop?

1071
01:22:37,783 --> 01:22:39,952
The rule says,
"Play it as it lies."

1072
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:05,311
That's two so far, Shooter.

1073
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:07,813
You can count.
Good for you.

1074
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:12,318
And you can count on me waiting
for you in the parking lot.

1075
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:27,500
You're still away.

1076
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,835
I'm aware of that.
Thank you.

1077
01:23:30,961 --> 01:23:31,962
I can't see.

1078
01:23:32,171 --> 01:23:33,297
Hey, up here.

1079
01:23:46,852 --> 01:23:49,355
Shooter needs this
to put pressure on Happy.

1080
01:23:49,647 --> 01:23:52,191
If he misses, Happy can two-putt
to victory.

1081
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:04,828
Choke on that, baby!

1082
01:24:14,713 --> 01:24:15,881
Shooter.

1083
01:24:24,723 --> 01:24:28,727
If Gilmore sinks this, it will cap
an amazing comeback.

1084
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:49,248
Great. Now I have a tower
blocking my ball.

1085
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:53,043
We'll get it moved and you'll finish
tomorrow. Right, Doug?

1086
01:24:53,252 --> 01:24:56,922
No, he has to hit it now.
"Play it as it lies."

1087
01:24:57,256 --> 01:25:01,760
I hit it off Frankenstein's fat foot.
Those are the rules.

1088
01:25:02,094 --> 01:25:04,889
He's right.
Take your shot, Mr. Gilmore.

1089
01:25:06,098 --> 01:25:09,935
Virginia, just so you know,
my jacket size is 44 long.

1090
01:25:10,227 --> 01:25:13,564
And my right arm is a bit longer
than my left.

1091
01:25:14,106 --> 01:25:18,611
Hit it around the tower, sink your putt
and we'll go to sudden death.

1092
01:25:25,951 --> 01:25:27,953
Nah, I'll just beat him now.

1093
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,581
Good luck.

1094
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:38,464
Chubbs, I know
you'll help me here.

1095
01:26:13,999 --> 01:26:16,168
Oh, my God.

1096
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:20,840
Incredible!
Happy Gilmore wins the gold jacket.

1097
01:26:24,009 --> 01:26:26,345
I love you. I love you.

1098
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:28,347
And I love you.

1099
01:26:29,014 --> 01:26:31,350
Doug! It's impossible!

1100
01:26:31,684 --> 01:26:34,520
That's my jacket!
It's mine!

1101
01:26:35,354 --> 01:26:37,189
He stole my jacket!

1102
01:26:37,857 --> 01:26:40,025
I believe that's Mr. Gilmore's.

1103
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:04,383
I will get you, Shooter!

1104
01:27:05,885 --> 01:27:07,553
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:10,222
Be still!

1106
01:27:10,556 --> 01:27:11,682
Don't!!!

1107
01:27:24,737 --> 01:27:26,071
-Coming?
-You bet.

1108
01:27:26,405 --> 01:27:27,740
All right.

1109
01:27:41,253 --> 01:27:43,923
Here's to Chubbs,
wherever he is.

1110
01:27:47,426 --> 01:27:48,928
Hey, Happy.

1111
01:27:51,597 --> 01:27:53,098
Nice jacket.

1112
01:27:55,935 --> 01:27:58,103
Who are you waving at,
Happy?

1113
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:02,441
Nobody, Grandma.
Let's go home.
