<i>Spirit of love and child of peace</i>

7
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:11,514
Can I open them yet?

8
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,348
- No.
- Hurry up.

9
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,683
Keep them closed.

10
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,811
- What is this?
- Keep them closed.

11
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:17,911
Okay.

12
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:20,573
- What is it?
- No peeking. No peeking.

13
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,806
And... Open.

14
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,701
Oh. Great.

15
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,247
You think I need another hat?

16
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,584
- Guess again.
- Um...

17
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,127
A scarf?

18
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:36,204
You think I'd make you
keep your eyes closed for a scarf?

19
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,457
What have you wanted your entire life?

20
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:41,009
Besides me, of course.

21
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:44,337
Oh, so modest. I don't know...

22
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:45,437
Oh.

23
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
Oh!

24
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,602
A puppy! Oh.

25
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,888
- Hi! Aw.
- Well, Darling, what do you think?

26
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:57,977
Oh, Jim Dear, she's a perfect little
lady.

27
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:01,155
Welcome to the family. Hi.

28
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:04,908
Hi! Mwah!

29
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:08,204
And that should be nice.

30
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,415
Sweet dreams.

31
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:15,419
Oh, and one more thing.

32
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,673
That should do it.

33
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:26,097
Oh, you silly, silly girl.

34
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,974
Sleep tight, Lady.

35
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,019
Goodnight, Lady.

36
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,015
Oh.

37
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:17,355
No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:18,814
Jim.

39
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,903
All right. Come here, baby.

40
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,906
Come on. All right, go to sleep.

41
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:29,576
What?

42
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,196
How did you do that?

43
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:33,488
How did that happen?

44
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,165
- Okay, Lady, that's...
- No.

45
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,716
Okay, now watch.

46
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,387
See, this is where you sleep, all right?

47
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:51,098
See how daddy does it? Just like this.

48
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,682
See?

49
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:56,853
Huh?

50
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,406
Come on, Jim.
Look at her, please, let her stay.

51
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,326
- All right, just for one night, Lady.
- Yay!

52
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:16,832
Get him. Go, get him.

53
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:40,230
Huh. Another perfect day.
Better get them up.

54
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,863
Oh, who needs an alarm clock
when they have you around?

55
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,774
Oh, hello, Lady.

56
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,942
All right, I'm up.

57
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:54,245
Today's your big day.

58
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:57,247
Lady, let's get you ready. Come on.

59
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:01,668
Here you go. Yeah, that's a good girl.

60
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:05,622
Let's get you clean.
Does that feel good?

61
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:06,723
Aah!

62
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:20,605
Now you're official.

63
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,065
You wanna go show Jock and Trusty?

64
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,690
Yeah?

65
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,826
I got it! I got the...

66
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,536
Collar.

67
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,627
What?

68
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,290
You! If you don't want trouble,

69
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,625
and I think you know
what trouble looks like,

70
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,052
then you better... Hey!

71
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,189
I hope I made myself clear!

72
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,197
Trusty!

73
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,492
Trusty? Are you over there? Hey!

74
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,908
Trusty! Trusty, guess what?

75
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,704
Huh? What's all the commotion?

76
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:28,204
That rat came back, you know the...

77
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:29,904
The rat?

78
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,459
- Where?
- No, it's actually...

79
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,437
- Stay calm.
- Trusty, it's all taken care of.

80
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,338
Me and Ol' Reliable
will pick up the scent.

81
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:37,432
But he... But he's... He's gone,
actually.

82
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:39,675
Hey, guess what, okay, I just...

83
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:42,394
Shh. Can't rush the process.

84
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:45,805
Trusty, focus. I gotta tell you
something.
Where's Jock?

85
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,308
She's working.

86
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:50,144
Detective work...

87
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:54,398
What is going on over there?
What're they talking about?

88
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:58,069
Uh-uh-uh.
Don't fidget, my sweet Jacqueline.

89
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:02,874
Stay still,
just a little bit longer. We
are finished.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Whoo.

91
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,036
What do you think? <i>Bellissima,</i> huh?

92
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,790
Oh, all right, you can go
play with your friends.

93
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,000
But for five minutes, Jacqueline.

94
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,711
Mommy needs a new canvas.
Five minutes!

95
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,839
I have so much to do.

96
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,350
Wait for me! What's goin' on?

97
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:27,973
Oh, sprinting in this sweater
was a big mistake.

98
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,360
Your mistake was putting that thing on
in the first place.

99
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,540
- You've got incontinence from your
mouth.
- Guys, guys, guys,

100
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,856
something very special
happened this morning.

101
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,484
Something you won't believe.

102
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,942
- I got...
- You got your collar!

103
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,580
I got my collar. Yep.
I got it!

104
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,240
Oh, Lady, it's beautiful!

105
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,826
- I told you it would happen.
- You were right.

106
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,998
Here I am, officially part of the
family.
Forever.

107
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,097
You've earned it.

108
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:55,418
You know what would go great
with that collar?

109
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:58,921
- A twinkly tiara to sit upon your head.
- And that's my cue.

110
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,965
I'm gonna go track that rat.

111
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:04,719
Which is what you should be doing
instead of playing dress-up.

112
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:06,520
Ay, ay, Officer Trusty.

113
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,356
Oh, yeah, he's not gonna find anything.

114
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,144
- Well, not intentionally.
- Found the gate.

115
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,980
Oh, Jocky-Wocky! Jacqueline!

116
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,191
Where's my little model?

117
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,485
Who's the greatest magician
in the world?

118
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:26,532
Well, I have got to go.
Congrats on the new collar.

119
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:29,418
Crivens, good family you've got there,
eh?

120
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,505
I know. Really couldn't get any better.

121
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,311
This feels nice.

122
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:48,769
Mmm.

123
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,399
And it's only gonna get better.

124
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,364
Clear the line!
Clear the line!

125
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,860
- Come on. Keep it moving!
- That's good. Hold it there.

126
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,288
Put it out of the wagon, boys.

127
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,543
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

128
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:33,307
All right,
you need a hand with that?

129
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,527
Ah! Looks like it's gonna be
another perfect day.

130
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,980
Hey! I thought I told you,
you can't sleep in here!

131
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,407
Ah, perfect.

132
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,451
Hey, Spot.

133
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,706
- Coming behind you.
- All right, go ahead then.

134
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:55,120
Come here, you mangy mutt!

135
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,673
I'm tired of kicking you
out of here, street dog.

136
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,397
Get back to work!

137
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,485
All right, hold on!

138
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,153
Whoa!

139
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,567
Time to steal some breakfast.

140
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:30,248
- Ooh.
- Hey, there, sonny boy. See you around.

141
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,227
Hello!

142
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,152
Pfft, this is too easy.

143
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,195
Hello.

144
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,198
- How dare you!
- Ma'am!

145
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,125
Your mother
would be ashamed of you!

146
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,629
Aah! Ow! Ma'am!

147
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,716
I'd feel bad if I wasn't so hungry.

148
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,341
Ah.

149
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,177
Ugh! Let me guess, left in a box
by the side of the road?

150
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:35,261
You know what?
I've heard it before, so beat it.

151
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,932
- You gotta earn your lunch.
- I hungry.

152
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:40,058
There is no way your voice is that cute.

153
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,186
- What's your real voice?
- Please?

154
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:43,613
That's your voice?

155
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,615
All right, you know what? Fine.

156
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:54,865
Look, I'm not buying the hustle,
but I respect the effort.

157
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:56,783
But take it from me, in about six
months,

158
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:58,878
that voice is gonna drop
and the bit's dead.

159
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:02,798
That was too easy.

160
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:13,509
Oh, no. My favorite dog catcher.

161
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,552
There are other dogs
in this town, you know.

162
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:16,886
Hey! Over here!

163
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:20,015
It's Peg and Bull. Wanna talk to ya.

164
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:23,226
Oh, man! Maybe if I just act
like I don't see them...

165
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,229
Oh, don't act like you don't see us.

166
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:27,407
Help! We got caught!

167
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:37,450
Good day, sir. Just posting bills.
No need for alarm.

168
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,201
I already cleared this block
of dangerous animals.

169
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,620
But I'm still looking
for a cunning street dog.

170
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,424
- May I hang this on your window?
- No, you cannot.

171
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,469
- There's no charge for helping me.
- No.

172
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,011
He has demon eyes
and teeth like a shark.

173
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,789
SHOPKEEPER You still talking about a
dog?

174
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,557
All right, what happened?

175
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:04,393
- We robbed the butcher shop.
- Again?

176
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:09,190
Bull ate seven pounds of beef,
four lamb chops, and a whole meatloaf.

177
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:11,359
- I threw up everywhere.
- Yeah.

178
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,027
Best day of my life!

179
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:16,197
God, I keep telling ya
the butcher's shop's a one-man-job.

180
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,948
You're always gonna get caught
if you don't learn to split up!

181
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:20,241
Are you mad?

182
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:23,245
We'd rather be locked up together,
than out on the streets alone.

183
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,789
Alone? Uh, I think you mean free?

184
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:27,832
See, while you're locked up together,

185
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:31,253
I'm free to be myself,
and I'm free to be by myself.

186
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,463
- Yeah, yeah, we know.
- Ya say it all the time.

187
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:35,883
Since you feel so free,
feel free to bust us outta here.

188
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:39,595
Oh, no, no, no. You guys don't
understand.
I can't mess with this guy
again.

189
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,972
Oh, but ya love
makin' him look like a fool.

190
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:44,225
I'm sorry, guys, you're on your own.

191
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,851
Oh, you can do it.
Just bust. Bust. Bust.

192
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,395
- Bust. Bust.
- Bust. Bust.

193
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,981
- Okay! I'll do it. Stop yelling.
- Yeah! He's gonna do it.

194
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:54,034
- Yeah! He'll do it, Peg.
- No... Shh! He's coming over.

195
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:04,169
I don't feel so good.

196
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:08,298
- What's he doin'?
- Don't ask me. I can't see anything.

197
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,801
What is that?

198
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:17,475
Well, well, well,
just the dog I was looking for.

199
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:18,892
Ah.

200
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,885
What are you, sick?

201
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:24,557
Oh, no, he's sick. Just throw up.
You'll feel much better once you eat it.

202
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,657
I got you.

203
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,615
They never thought I'd get ya.

204
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,943
Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey!

205
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:39,404
Hey! Not again!

206
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,283
That's it.
I'm giving up the life of crime.

207
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:44,368
Or we can go back to the butcher.

208
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,467
I could eat. Yeah.

209
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,621
- Come back here! Hey!
- Whoa!

210
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:51,216
Hey, excuse me! Hey!
Hot stuff, coming through!

211
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,047
Hey, hi. Are you two, uh, twins?

212
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,974
- I'm her husband, pal.
- A-ha.

213
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:02,477
- Clear a path! Halt!
- Yeah. Yeah, well, congratulations!

214
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,816
Hey, come back here!

215
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,744
Grab him!

216
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:16,408
Somebody stop him! Come on! Dirty
mangy...

217
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,119
Phil, watch out!

218
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,008
You have got to try this.

219
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,677
How's it going?

220
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Yeah.

221
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,715
Mm, isn't it time for my walk?

222
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,759
Look at these cute booties I got.

223
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,177
- Oh, wow.
- So pretty!

224
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:44,886
I didn't know you were coming.

225
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:48,349
There's gonna be screaming,
crying, vomiting.

226
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:50,183
And then, there's the baby.

227
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:52,519
Here let me top you off. Fair enough.

228
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,648
Congratulations is in order,
to the father to be.

229
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,158
- To Jim!
- Cheers. Everybody.

230
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,913
That was weird.

231
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:06,166
- Oh, thank you!
- You're welcome.

232
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,752
It's not a rattle. Don't worry.

233
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,086
Oh!

234
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,789
- Oh, it's adorable.
- You like it?

235
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,807
- Oh, my goodness.
- That is not gonna fit her.

236
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:16,794
Where is my favorite niece?

237
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:19,130
- Could you just? Yes. There you go.
- Oh. Sure.

238
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,550
Oh, where is she? Oh, there she is!

239
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:26,436
- Aunt Sarah! You made it!
- Of course!

240
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:30,598
- Oh.
- This is for you.

241
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,652
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- I know.

242
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,771
- Oh, wow. Oh, it's...
- Yes, it's an original Majolica.

243
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:38,732
Oh, it's gonna do wonders for this room

244
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,536
and I knew Jim couldn't afford one
with the salary of a, uh...

245
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,372
- Musician?
- If you say so, dear.

246
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,711
- Thank you.
- I'm sure the baby will love it.

247
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:54,965
- This is priceless!
- Down, down!

248
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,200
No! Bad dog!

249
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,296
That dog needs to be trained.

250
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,640
She's, uh, normally really good.

251
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,726
I think you're thinking of cats.

252
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:11,648
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

253
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:15,278
We're stopping? Ugh.
Some getaway driver you are.

254
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,228
Here we go.

255
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:21,366
All right, I'll hop out here.

256
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,036
D'oh!

257
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:27,957
Whoa! Snob hill. Huh

258
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,922
Oh, my gosh! This guy's obsessed with
me.

259
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,468
All right, I gotta lay low for a while.

260
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,769
"Bad dog"?

261
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,605
What did I do wrong?

262
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,904
Hey, Trusty!

263
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,690
- Hmm?
- Trusty?

264
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,409
Uh... Um... Yeah? Yes?

265
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,863
Something strange is going on,
and I really need to talk to a friend.

266
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,573
All these people are in the house,

267
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:11,826
there's a bunch of toys,
none of them are for me.

268
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,494
I haven't even been brushed
since this morning.

269
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:16,005
I'm getting tangly.

270
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,790
And my afternoon snack was cold. Cold!

271
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,584
Oh, boy. Sounds rough.

272
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:24,046
And, I can't even remember the last time
that Darling gave me a belly rub.

273
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:27,424
Speaking of bellies,
Darling's tummy is getting really big.

274
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:30,678
I'm pretty sure it's gas, too many
treats.
We've all been there.

275
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,054
Oh, wow.

276
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,765
And Jim Dear, I don't know,
he seems normal but...

277
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,852
You know what?
I smell fear on him all the time.

278
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,869
- Mm-hmm.
- So, I guess that's not that normal.

279
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,855
- I don't know.
- Yeah, that sounds bad.

280
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:42,955
Huh?

281
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,492
You sound...

282
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:49,238
- Hey, you're... You're not Trusty.
- Hey.

283
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:52,052
- Correct. But, you...
- Did you just
hear everything that I said?

284
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:53,616
- Yes.
- Where is your collar?

285
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:55,273
- Yeah, long story.
- Where is Trusty?

286
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,078
Um, Trusty, I'm sure, is somewhere.

287
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,080
- What are you doing in there?
- Trusty?

288
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,499
- Get out of there!
- Trusty?

289
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:02,167
Hey, I'm gonna warn
my people inside.

290
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,387
What? No, no. Hey. Whoa.
Let's not warn the people, okay?

291
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,342
Now, I would get out but I can't,
and I'm not here to make trouble,

292
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,926
I'm the one in trouble
and you could help me out here.

293
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,221
- I'm gonna bark.
- No, please just... I can explain.

294
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,891
- Just gimme a second. I'm comin' over.
- Here?

295
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,734
What do you think you're doing?

296
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:22,063
- Hey! I'm gonna bark.
- No. Please, do not do that!

297
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:23,647
- I'm gonna bark.
- Don't bark.

298
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:26,525
Stop. Hey, hey! Shh! Stop it!

299
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,744
Don't tell me what to do.

300
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,830
Hmm.

301
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:38,461
What?

302
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,288
Wait... Hang on!

303
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:41,832
All right. You know what?

304
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:44,626
I heard what you said back there
and you're not overreacting.

305
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,002
Come on. Please, please!

306
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:49,548
Look, if you keep it down,
I will tell
you the truth about that baby!

307
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:51,768
That... What?

308
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:55,229
Oh, man!

309
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,575
Everything all right, Lady?

310
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,036
That your dog barking?

311
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,655
- What?
- That your dog barking?

312
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah. She's mine.

313
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,046
Seen anything else? I'm looking for
a dangerous animal around here.

314
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,006
Like a bear?

315
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,209
Worse, a stray dog.

316
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,002
Grey male, about two-foot four.

317
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:30,881
- Mangy, dirty, dangerous.
- Please, don't.

318
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,849
You barking at a stray, Lady?

319
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,894
I'm begging you.

320
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,145
Fine.

321
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:43,978
Everything seems to be fine.

322
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:47,772
You sure now? He's mangy, and dirty...

323
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,858
- And dangerous?
- Dangerous.

324
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,118
Yes, right.

325
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,280
Actually, you know, we've been having
a bit of a rat problem, recently.

326
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,381
A rodent?

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,701
He's been getting into the yard,
and spoiling our food, things like that.

328
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,211
The neighbors too.

329
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,874
I don't associate myself with vermin.
They carry disease.

330
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:06,299
Ah, right. Well...

331
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,721
Then, um... Then thank you.

332
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,597
For...

333
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,351
Whatever this was.

334
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:17,803
Commitment.

335
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,903
Okay.

336
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,858
Oh, my!

337
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,865
Hmm.

338
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,039
Ah.

339
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,454
Phew!

340
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:39,866
Thanks. Well, can't say it's been fun.
Bye!

341
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,119
Oh, not so fast. What did you mean
back there, about the baby?

342
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,455
Oh, so now you want my help?

343
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,215
Do you want me to bark again?

344
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,876
Oh, fine. How can I put this?

345
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:50,977
Um...

346
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,588
You're the center
of your people's universe, right?

347
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,965
- You could say that.
- They shampoo you in the bathtub,

348
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:58,023
- let you sleep in the bed?
- You mean, our bed?

349
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:02,932
- Build you this 40/40 bathroom right
here?
- Gross. I have walks for that.

350
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,183
- Well, that's basically all over now.
- What?

351
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,818
You're about to be replaced.

352
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,075
- Replaced? Me?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,152
I don't think so. You can leave.

354
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,288
Lady! Are you okay?

355
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,991
- Stay back, mongrel!
- What is that?

356
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:22,951
I'll be right over.
I'm callin' the cops!

357
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:26,955
I think you can be on your way now.
Thanks for your help.

358
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:29,916
Whoa! You asked for my help.

359
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:33,753
Now look, you may not wanna hear this,
but I know people, okay?

360
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,798
And people are not loyal,

361
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:39,343
and the sooner you start looking out
for yourself,

362
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,511
and I mean, only yourself, the better.

363
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:44,973
Wow, that is incredibly depressing
and also not true.

364
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,808
So, thanks for nothing. Bye.

365
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,729
Lady, you and your friend
better be careful.

366
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,480
I smell an intruder afoot.

367
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,732
That's him, Trusty!

368
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,651
Leave the police work to me.

369
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,363
Oh, no! It's Officer Trusty, help.
Just in the nick of time.

370
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:02,282
- Hey! Don't push it!
- Keep your scarf on, killer.

371
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:05,744
Okay, you two, thank you for the back-up
but he was just leaving.

372
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,954
Weren't you, street dog?

373
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:10,842
Street dog? Oh, I got it.

374
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:14,336
I'll go, but only because
I'm free to leave

375
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:17,006
while all of you are stuck
behind your fences.

376
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:20,017
Just remember, when the baby moves in,

377
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,395
the dog moves out.

378
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:26,566
I'm stealing this by the way.

379
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,326
Hey, I let you steal that!

380
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:41,447
- Replaced by a baby?
- Makes no sense.

381
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,547
- None.
- No way.

382
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:44,325
I mean, can a baby fetch slippers?

383
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:45,617
- Doubtful.
- Don't be daft.

384
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,036
Or pick up the paper.

385
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:48,334
- Not a chance.
- Ridiculous.

386
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,038
Can a baby provide Jim and Darling

387
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:52,750
with the sense of wholeness
and a reason to live?

388
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:54,376
- Uh...
- Well...

389
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:56,721
My point exactly.

390
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,903
Oh, uh, Doc, actually just wanted to
say,
thank you so much.

391
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,530
- I just can't believe it. Did you see
her?
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,490
I just can't believe how perfect she is.

393
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,451
I mean, have you ever seen
a more beautiful baby girl?

394
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:35,009
No. In my 38 years of delivering babies,
your baby is the most beautiful baby.

395
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:37,752
- Really?
- Good night!

396
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:40,013
- Oh, uh, I'll walk you out.
- No, thank you.

397
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:42,924
Darling, did you hear that?

398
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,268
I still can't believe it.

399
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:54,569
Good luck.

400
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,335
<i>La la lu, la la lu</i>

401
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:20,712
<i>Oh, my little star sweeper</i>

402
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:25,727
<i>I'll sweep the stardust for you</i>

403
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:29,555
<i>La la lu, la la lu</i>

404
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,892
<i>Little soft fluffy sleeper</i>

405
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:37,363
<i>Here comes a pink cloud for you</i>

406
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,107
<i>La la lu, la la lu</i>

407
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,612
<i>Little wandering angel</i>

408
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:46,572
<i>Fold up your wings</i>

409
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,672
<i>Close your eyes</i>

410
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:53,453
<i>La la lu, la la lu</i>

411
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:57,333
<i>And may love be your keeper</i>

412
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:03,032
<i>La la lu, la la lu, la la lu</i>

413
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:06,682
Shh.

414
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:09,186
Lady, not now. This is the baby's room.

415
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,441
Baby.

416
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:29,832
That's a good boy, Trusty.
Want some?

417
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,169
One for me, one for Trusty...

418
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:37,839
How's that, buddy?

419
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:48,300
Commander of
the entire British army, yes, she is!

420
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:51,895
What adventures is Jock going to get
into?

421
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,182
Here we go. And one, two, three...

422
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:59,353
And! Oh, that was it, Jocky!

423
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:01,188
Oh, that's my good girl.

424
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:06,201
Oh, give mommy kisses. Who's my big
star?
I love you, too. I love you, too.

425
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:09,246
What?

426
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,338
Oh, no.

427
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:32,936
Lady! The baby is sleeping!

428
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,795
When the baby moves in, the dog moves
out.

429
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,633
Coming.

430
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,381
Ah, Aunt Sarah. Thank you for...
Oh. Oh. Oh!

431
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Oh!

432
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,934
- There she is!
- Yes, of course, don't mind me.

433
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:17,847
Looking just like her mommy.
Positively glowing.

434
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:21,477
And you. Only a month
and your figure's already returning.

435
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,613
- It's just lovely.
- Thank you.

436
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:25,772
And you look the same.

437
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:30,528
Uh, thank you, Aunt Sarah,
for watching Lady while we're gone.

438
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:31,627
Lady?

439
00:29:33,998 --> 00:29:34,998
Uh...

440
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:38,411
Dog-sitting?
I thought I'd be with little Lulu.

441
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:43,082
Well, Jim's sister, she was insistent
that we bring her along.

442
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,333
Was she now?

443
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:46,126
Thank you so much for your help.

444
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:49,380
I mean, if we could've bothered
anyone else, believe me, we would have.

445
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,680
Right.

446
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,643
- But thanks again.
- Uh, yeah.

447
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,722
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Lady.

448
00:29:58,823 --> 00:30:00,775
You be a good girl.

449
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,779
I didn't even get to hold her.

450
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,278
Come on, dear. Bye!

451
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,404
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

452
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,115
Hello. Bye-bye.

453
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,615
Are you coming back?

454
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,086
- Bye-bye!
- Toodeloo.

455
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,054
Dog-sitting.
You've got to be kidding me.

456
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:33,849
I'm not even dressed for this.
They just took the baby?

457
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:39,813
Huh?

458
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:12,386
What?

459
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:13,813
Oh.

460
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:15,548
Cats. Okay.

461
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:17,634
Ugh. Look at this place.

462
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:21,480
- Yeah, we'll need to make some changes.
- What a shame.

463
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:25,977
Okay, we have a few rules here. Oh, boy.

464
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:28,895
<i>Now sit right there and take a seat</i>

465
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,897
<i>I'm sure you're glad we came</i>

466
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:35,068
<i>But we've got some cleaning up to do
We'll need to rearrange</i>

467
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,444
That tickles.

468
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:41,075
<i>We'll take care of this furniture
If to you it's all the same</i>

469
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:43,076
No, that...
That's not something that we do...

470
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:46,663
<i>But if you don't like how we decorate
Well, that's too bad, what a shame</i>

471
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:49,458
No, no, don't.
Please, those are fragile. Don't!

472
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:51,751
<i>Well, that's too bad
What a shame</i>

473
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:52,920
Okay. That's it!

474
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:57,182
<i>I think that we could reupholster here
This figurine is so last year</i>

475
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,471
Lady! Quiet!

476
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:07,018
<i>These tables need refurbishing
These curtains need a change</i>

477
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:12,105
<i>But if you don't like our artistic flair
Well, that's too bad, what a shame</i>

478
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:14,325
I'm telling!

479
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:18,121
Lady! I said be quiet!

480
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:22,325
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

481
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:27,246
<i>Why are you so miffed
We gave your living room a modern twist</i>

482
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:30,374
<i>And we gon' want some credit for this
Not blame</i>

483
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:32,500
<i>Are you mad?
What a shame</i>

484
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:36,012
- Hey! That's mine.
- Yes, and?

485
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:40,800
- <i>That's better.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

486
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:42,302
<i>It really holds the room together</i>

487
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:43,596
No, no, no.

488
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,021
<i>Flowers, really?</i>

489
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,560
<i>The color scheme in here is cuckoo
Aw, did we make a boo-boo?</i>

490
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:52,938
<i>It's time to break this thing on down</i>

491
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,359
<i>As soon as we get done
then we'll bid you auf Wiedersehen</i>

492
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,363
- <i>But if things go wrong</i>
- <i>Then we'll be gone</i>

493
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:03,115
<i>And that's too bad, what a shame</i>

494
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,214
Oh!

495
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,327
<i>I gotta do somethin' about this vase</i>

496
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:08,746
Hey, get down from there!

497
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,789
<i>Yeah, it's just a tiny bit out of place</i>

498
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,718
- <i>Oh, don't let it fall on your face</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah</i>

499
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,972
No, no, no. Don't.

500
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:21,183
Oh, no. Oh, no.

501
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,320
My babies.

502
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:39,492
Lady!

503
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:44,948
Howdy?

504
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,627
- Excuse me. Hello.
- Good day.

505
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,255
Yes ma'am.
I can help you with that!

506
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,717
- Good afternoon, ma'am!
- Good afternoon.

507
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:59,672
Welcome. Don't mind Polly. May I help
you?

508
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,771
I hope so.

509
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,261
Who is this precious little angel?

510
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:09,639
Her name is Lady, though I daresay
the name doesn't suit her.

511
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,739
No?

512
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,811
I need to keep her
from terrorizing us any longer.

513
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:18,065
Ah, yes.
Well, how about a training harness?

514
00:34:18,164 --> 00:34:19,317
Woof, woof.

515
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,985
She can't be trained.

516
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:25,123
Well, then how about, uh... A chew toy?

517
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,994
You think she needs to be rewarded?

518
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:32,547
What about that?

519
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,376
No, no, no. Are you sure
that's absolutely necessary?

520
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:38,501
Oh, yes.

521
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,054
Right away.

522
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:44,474
All right, then. Here, sweet thing.

523
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,416
I know.

524
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,476
Be a good girl.

525
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:56,061
- Oh! Ma'am, she doesn't want it.
- I want it!

526
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,063
- I know. I'm so sorry.
- Well, hold her!

527
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,358
- I'm doing my... Whoa!
- Can you hold... Aah!

528
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,784
- Get her!
- My birds! Sorry!

529
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:05,454
Why do you please...
Catch everything...

530
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,115
- Catch everything... Ahh!
- Oh, no!

531
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:11,543
Do you sell birds? Oh! Oh! Oh!

532
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,213
All right, everybody, here we go!

533
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,804
Hey! Watch out there!

534
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,224
Watch out!

535
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:37,945
Phew!

536
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,407
This is crazy. This is crazy.

537
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,612
Of course. A dead end.

538
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,625
Hey! I own this alley.

539
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,952
Oh, hi.
At least you don't live here.

540
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,746
I also live here.

541
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:56,846
Ooh.

542
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:58,623
I am so sorry.

543
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,335
Looking at it again,
it's a beautiful space.

544
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:04,547
Back away from my stuff, thief.

545
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:08,259
Thief? I have never stolen
a thing in my life, thank you.

546
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:09,358
And I'm not gonna start

547
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,885
with this garbage.

548
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,596
That's my food.

549
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:14,849
Food? Oh, okay...

550
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:19,862
You trying to make a fool out of me?
'Cause that's not easy to do.

551
00:36:20,153 --> 00:36:22,440
Oh, okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna go.

552
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:23,940
I realize I've been an imposition.

553
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,327
No, you're not going anywhere.

554
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:29,530
- Stop!
- What?

555
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,630
Just stop.

556
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:34,327
Oh, great. It's the tramp.

557
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:38,873
Don't make any sudden moves.
You're dealing with a killer here.

558
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:41,541
Yeah, lap dog. A killer.

559
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:45,920
- Stay calm. I'm not talking about you.
- Huh?

560
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,465
- I'm talking about her.
- What?

561
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:48,565
- What?
- Who?

562
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,581
- Don't let those floppy ears fool you.
- What?

563
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,681
Aren't you wondering

564
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,304
- why she's wearing a muzzle?
- Huh.

565
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:57,182
Why such a tiny, annoying,
little dog would come into your home?

566
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,726
- Annoying?
- Yeah. You know,

567
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:00,561
I was wondering about that.

568
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:02,320
This dog is rabid.

569
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:04,449
She's a rabbit?

570
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:09,152
- You know what rabid means, right?
- Yeah?

571
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:11,204
Like, rabies, you know?

572
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:12,907
Like, when you act dangerous

573
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,492
- and contagious and scary.
- Huh?

574
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,702
- Hmm.
- Like, you're gonna kill someone.

575
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,289
Oh. I have rabies!

576
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:24,543
- I am acting dangerous!
- Oh, my goodness!

577
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,795
- Easy, easy.
- And contagious!

578
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,673
And sometimes, it's even a little more
subtle than that.

579
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:32,851
- Rabies! Rabies! Rabies!
- And sometimes, it's not.

580
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:37,059
- She's got it bad, doesn't she?
- Look out! She's headed for your stash!

581
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,349
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

582
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:43,688
Oh, right! Yes, I am!
I'm getting rabies everywhere!

583
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:45,313
Even the sausages?

584
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:46,648
Oh, yeah!

585
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:49,068
- What?
- Yes, especially on the sausages.

586
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:51,487
- These are rabies sausages now.
- What do we do?

587
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:52,905
Quick, run! Save yourself!

588
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:54,155
What about my sausages?

589
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:55,992
Just go! Just leave it!

590
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:58,577
- Here she comes!
- Wait, stop! I think she's got me!

591
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:01,163
Sorry, you're on your own.

592
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:03,423
Wow. I feel alive.

593
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:06,074
Rabies!

594
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:10,005
Wait, I seem to remember
you calling me a street dog,

595
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:12,757
but here you are out on the streets.

596
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:17,137
Strange. Let me guess,
baby moves in, dog moves out?

597
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:19,097
No, not at all!

598
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,025
This here...
This is not what it looks like.

599
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:24,519
Uh-huh. You're welcome
for saving your life, by the way.

600
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,440
And in exchange, I got you a free meal.
So, I think we're even.

601
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,943
That's the craziest "thank you"
I've ever gotten.

602
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,235
Maybe you do have rabies.

603
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:34,655
Hilarious. Okay, well,
seeing as I'm the reason

604
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:38,159
that you got that garbage,
help me get this thing off my face.

605
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:41,619
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

606
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,539
I think I got a friend who can help.

607
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,791
Now, he's a little stiff.
Kinda reminds me of you.

608
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,802
I'm already regretting this.

609
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:55,175
This is your friend?

610
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:58,971
Please. Don't be ridiculous.
This is my friend.

611
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,349
- Of course it is.
- Come on.

612
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:03,851
You just need to hook that wire
onto his teeth.

613
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:07,146
- Is your plan for him to bite it off?
- Would you just do it?

614
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:09,190
Like this?

615
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:12,735
- This doesn't feel like progress.
- Do you want me to help you or not?

616
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:14,778
Just lean back
so this thing doesn't move...

617
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:15,878
Just make it quick.

618
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,894
...while I work this thing loose.
What is this?

619
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:21,085
- That's my ear, please.
- What? Could you stop moving so much?

620
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,246
- Ow. You stepped on my paw.
- Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to.

621
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:26,623
This is not awkward at all.

622
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:30,293
On my count, we're both gonna need to
pull
as hard as we can. You ready?

623
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:31,836
- Yeah.
- One...

624
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,755
- Two.
- My count.

625
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:36,266
- Okay.
- Two... Three.

626
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:43,731
Oh.

627
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:53,275
- Told you it would work.
- Yep. Well, thanks for your help.

628
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,737
- Thank you. I mean, yeah, you're
welcome.
- Yeah... Thank you, too.

629
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:59,864
Have fun at home, baby.
I mean, with the baby.

630
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:00,965
What?

631
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:03,126
No, uh... Never mind.

632
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:05,788
Well, this is goodbye, I think.

633
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,498
- Yep.
- Bye.

634
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:08,597
Bye.

635
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:14,922
I'm thinking about
getting one for us.

636
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,090
Maybe tomorrow?

637
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,340
Yes, why not?

638
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,467
You, um... You look lost.

639
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:23,764
I think I am capable of finding
my own way home, thank you very much.

640
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:25,108
Oh, okay.

641
00:40:26,983 --> 00:40:29,853
I guess I won't bother telling you
that's the, uh, wrong way.

642
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:32,440
I mean, if you're going home,
that would be the wrong way.

643
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:35,108
No, I know. I just wanted to see
what was over there.

644
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,619
- Now, I'm going home.
- Okay.

645
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:41,407
That's also the completely wrong way.

646
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:43,951
Okay, yes, I am lost.

647
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,621
So, you just gonna stand there and mock
me
or are you gonna help me out?

648
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:49,873
Is that an either or question?
Because ideally...

649
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:51,791
Just point. I'll be on my way, okay?

650
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:53,960
It's that way. Now, listen,
this isn't a backyard.

651
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:56,588
There are rules. Lesson one.
Always look both ways.

652
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,882
- Catch up!
- Lesson two.

653
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,268
Cars are heavy and they hurt!

654
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:13,563
Don't you know any shortcuts?

655
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,148
We're taking the scenic route.

656
00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:16,942
I would like to get home eventually.

657
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,443
Why do you even want to go home?

658
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,543
I told you.

659
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,030
- This is just one big misunderstanding.
- Mm-hmm.

660
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,159
Jim Dear and Darling must be worried
sick
about me by now.

661
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,619
Uh-huh. Yeah, no, sure.

662
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,036
What is that look?

663
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,579
Look, I hate to break it to you,

664
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,873
I'm just not seeing
a lot of "lost dog" posters up...

665
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:35,503
You may think that you know people,
but you don't know my people, okay?

666
00:41:35,603 --> 00:41:37,922
They would never let me
wind up on the streets.

667
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:39,222
Not on purpose.

668
00:41:39,974 --> 00:41:41,516
Okay, fair enough.

669
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:44,804
But you're walking around on the street.
You have no collar.

670
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:48,264
You are off leash.
You smell a tweensy bit like trash.

671
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:51,184
- Rude.
- Which means, to that dog catcher...

672
00:41:51,284 --> 00:41:52,769
I'm looking for a street dog.

673
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:55,815
Really scruffy face. Unpredictable.

674
00:41:55,914 --> 00:42:00,652
You're a street dog, so that's why
we're sticking to the scenic route.

675
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:02,621
Come on. You might even have fun.

676
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,373
Floppy ears?

677
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:06,784
- That's the one.
- Yeah, I know that dog.

678
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:08,869
- That dog's a menace.
- Yes.

679
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:10,670
Sleeps in my train yard.

680
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:14,425
- Show me.
- Come on.

681
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:20,389
Go ahead and just stow it all away.

682
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:26,929
Come on! We gotta get across the river.

683
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,028
On that?

684
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,974
Have you never been on a boat before?

685
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:34,728
I've never seen a boat before.
How are we supposed to get on?

686
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:36,489
Come on, follow me!

687
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:42,777
Here. Just a quick little jump.

688
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:44,195
No way.

689
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,791
Oh, come on, it's easy. I'll show you.

690
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,483
Ow! Ow!

691
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,331
Yeah, it's totally safe.
Careful about the wet spot.

692
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:56,791
- Someone might've spilled something.
Ow.
- Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.

693
00:42:56,891 --> 00:42:59,094
Come on!
You know how to swim, right?

694
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:04,307
Welcome aboard.

695
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:07,927
- How do you do?
- Hello, ticket please?

696
00:43:08,027 --> 00:43:09,512
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

697
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:13,601
Oh, good afternoon, ticket please.
Well, aren't you just lovely?

698
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,695
And such gorgeous ears.

699
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:21,992
Hmm.

700
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:23,659
Well.

701
00:43:24,077 --> 00:43:26,277
All aboard!

702
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:46,141
- Goodbye!
- Bye now! Have a nice trip!

703
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,766
Not bad. Maybe I was wrong about you.

704
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:57,519
Yeah, maybe next time
you should ask me if I have any ideas

705
00:43:57,619 --> 00:43:59,438
before you risk your life unnecessarily.

706
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:03,025
Ooh. Was this your way of saying
that you don't want me to die?

707
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,125
I didn't say that.

708
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,822
- Oh, so now you want me to die?
- And I didn't say that either.

709
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:09,699
- Not buyin' it, kid.
- It's Lady.

710
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:11,617
Oh. Nice to meet ya, Lady.

711
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,202
Nice to meet you, too...

712
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:15,996
Oh, I never asked you your name.
What's your name?

713
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:17,581
Oh, I get called a lot of things.

714
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:22,210
You know, I get Buddy or Pooch
or Spot or Butch or Scram

715
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:24,463
or Hey, get out of the trash.

716
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:27,800
Who needs a name, you know?
I'm free to be whoever I wanna be.

717
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,094
Free to be myself
and free to be by myself.

718
00:44:31,195 --> 00:44:36,192
Sky's my roof. Walk wherever I wanna
walk.
I walk however I wanna walk.

719
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:40,271
You're crazy.

720
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:42,364
You don't know the half of it.

721
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:46,869
- Hey, you wanna hear something great?
- Sure!

722
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:13,887
Wow! They're amazing.

723
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:16,898
Oh, yeah? Well, the singer's even
better.
Listen to this.

724
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:23,146
- Self-taught, by the way.
- No.

725
00:45:23,246 --> 00:45:24,940
I'm not the best technical singer.

726
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,400
But sometimes it's not
about pitch or tone.

727
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:29,152
- It's just about...
- Volume?

728
00:45:29,253 --> 00:45:31,447
Volume. Volume helps. Obviously.

729
00:45:31,547 --> 00:45:33,384
- Sure.
- 'Cause you want people to hear you.

730
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,659
Well, you have that part down.

731
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,536
- That's about all you have down.
- What? How dare you?

732
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:40,172
It's an A for effort, I think...

733
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:47,045
See? Being a street dog
isn't so bad at all.

734
00:45:47,146 --> 00:45:49,389
And it comes with a view.

735
00:45:52,476 --> 00:45:54,061
Okay, you can stop now.

736
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:01,768
See, there's plenty to do out here
in this big, old world.

737
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:03,646
Yeah. I'll bet there is.

738
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:06,898
Hey. That park is pretty.

739
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,402
Ugh, there's a lot of bones
buried in that park.

740
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,487
Dogs died?

741
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:13,822
No, that's just where we used to bury
all our bones.

742
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:14,922
Oh.

743
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:17,867
And on your left
is the oldest fire hydrant in the city.

744
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:20,746
- Kind of a landmark around here.
- Why is that?

745
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:23,039
Seriously? It's a fire hydrant.

746
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:25,842
- Oh, right. Gross.
- Dogs, fire hydrant.

747
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:30,505
And just beyond this bridge here
is where I had a run-in with a skunk.

748
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:31,965
Do you smell that?

749
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:35,219
No, no, no. This was years ago.
I was, like, a puppy. It was...

750
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:37,554
No, no, no, no. Whoa!

751
00:46:37,655 --> 00:46:39,264
What is all this?

752
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,143
This? This is, like,
my favorite part of town.

753
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:43,393
It's Restaurant Row.

754
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:44,936
Restaurant Row?

755
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:48,815
Yeah, they got French scraps,
Chinese scraps, meat and potato scraps.

756
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,985
- They got it all.
- And they just give it to you?

757
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:54,362
No, not just anyone. But to me, yes.

758
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,208
Okay.
Well, let's give it a try.

759
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,501
Don't we have to get you home?

760
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:00,751
Oh.

761
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:03,704
Yeah. Home.

762
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:06,467
You okay?

763
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:08,510
I, uh...

764
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:11,431
What's wrong?

765
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:15,893
I'm not so sure
I still have a home to get back to.

766
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:18,061
Oh.

767
00:47:19,355 --> 00:47:21,974
Hey, I'm... I'm sure it'll be okay.

768
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:23,483
No, you were right.

769
00:47:24,068 --> 00:47:25,978
Baby moves in and the dog moves out.

770
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,447
It happened just the way
that you said it would.

771
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:36,447
I know you probably think
that's what I wanted to hear, but it...

772
00:47:36,547 --> 00:47:37,914
It wasn't.

773
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,543
You know what?

774
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:43,963
Let's get something to eat.

775
00:47:44,672 --> 00:47:47,132
And I think I know just the place.

776
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,128
Tony's. My favorite place in town.

777
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:55,048
It smells amazing.
Do we just walk right in?

778
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:58,260
Actually I kinda use my own
private entrance. Follow me.

779
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,469
Wait up.

780
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,056
Wow, I am so hungry I could eat a shoe.

781
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:04,849
Ugh. Done it before. Overrated.

782
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:07,152
Okay, you stay hidden. Dinner's on me.

783
00:48:10,614 --> 00:48:14,193
Oh. Hey, Butch. I'm sorry, my friend.
Bad timing.

784
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:15,994
It's a full house in there, you know?

785
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:18,581
Whoa.

786
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:20,583
Who is this?

787
00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:25,329
<i>Hola, mi amor. Buenas noches.</i>

788
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:28,123
Oh, wow. Okay, let me see
what I can do for you, okay?

789
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:30,927
Joe? We got tables waiting.

790
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:32,878
Yes. Sorry, boss.

791
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:36,632
- We're dying in there.
- I know, I
know! You think I don't know?

792
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:37,731
Huh?

793
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,726
Are you kidding me?

794
00:48:45,108 --> 00:48:46,108
Mmm.

795
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:48,235
Why didn't you say so?

796
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:51,572
She's way too good
for you, Butch.

797
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:55,201
She's a Cockerel Spanish girl, huh?

798
00:48:57,077 --> 00:48:58,737
- Joe?
- Yes?

799
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:00,831
- Joe, listen, I...
- Uh, way ahead of you.

800
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:03,492
Bones! What's the matter with you?

801
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:06,619
Tonight, Butch gets the best in the
house.

802
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:08,164
I love it, best in the house.

803
00:49:08,264 --> 00:49:10,750
Come on, we can do this. Go on.
One moment, please.

804
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,001
What's happening?

805
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:13,168
You're asking me?

806
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:14,429
- Come on!
- Okay.

807
00:49:16,556 --> 00:49:17,757
Hurry up, hurry up.

808
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:18,974
What do I do... What do I...

809
00:49:19,074 --> 00:49:20,672
- Get a candle. Bread sticks.
- Uh-huh.

810
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:21,771
I got it.

811
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:24,021
All right.

812
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,878
- Can you light the candle?
- Yes.

813
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:26,978
Light the candle.

814
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:28,568
I'm-a going. I only have-a two hands.

815
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:34,574
The best table in the house.
And now, your table is ready.

816
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,822
Take it from me,

817
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:45,159
you'll want Tony's <i>speciale.</i>

818
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:47,461
Joe, Butch says
he wants two spaghetti special.

819
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,797
And heavy on the meatballs.

820
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:55,010
Are you silly, Tony?
Dogs don't talk. Yeah?

821
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:57,170
Well, he's talkin' to me.

822
00:49:57,271 --> 00:49:58,797
- Wow.
- Eh? Eh?

823
00:49:58,898 --> 00:50:00,800
- Two specials coming right up.
- Hurry.

824
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,393
I'm so sorry. Yeah I'm going.

825
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:05,637
Street life, huh?

826
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:07,847
Oh, yeah.
You know, I won't even eat unless

827
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:11,184
I have a table, and a table cloth,
and a candle, and a menu.

828
00:50:11,284 --> 00:50:13,061
This is because you're here.

829
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:14,572
Come on. Come on.

830
00:50:18,826 --> 00:50:23,780
For our boy, Butch,
and his nice new lady friend.

831
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
Huh?

832
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,057
- Yes.
- Come on. Come on.

833
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,168
- Okay.
- Come on.

834
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:28,668
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

835
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,713
They told me they were out of the
special.

836
00:50:33,132 --> 00:50:35,751
God, I thought those two
were gonna sit down and join us.

837
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:38,003
Ah, don't worry. They won't bother us...

838
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:39,679
And they're back.

839
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:48,648
<i>Oh, this is the night</i>

840
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:52,318
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

841
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:54,894
<i>And we call it</i>

842
00:50:54,994 --> 00:50:57,195
<i>Bella notte</i>

843
00:51:00,284 --> 00:51:03,570
<i>Look at the skies</i>

844
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:06,916
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

845
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:12,992
<i>On this lovely bella notte</i>

846
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:16,375
<i>Side by side</i>

847
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:19,052
<i>With your loved one</i>

848
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:25,612
<i>You'll find enchantment here</i>

849
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:31,273
<i>The night will weave its magic spell</i>

850
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:37,271
<i>When the one you love is near</i>

851
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:38,371
<i>For</i>

852
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:42,233
<i>This is the night</i>

853
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:47,072
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

854
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:54,130
- <i>On this lovely bella notte</i>
- <i>Lovely bella notte</i>

855
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:07,927
<i>This is the night</i>

856
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:11,813
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

857
00:52:12,356 --> 00:52:14,557
<i>And we call it</i>

858
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:16,858
<i>Bella notte</i>

859
00:52:20,614 --> 00:52:23,567
<i>Look at the skies</i>

860
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:27,570
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

861
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,471
<i>On this lovely</i>

862
00:52:30,632 --> 00:52:32,833
<i>Bella notte</i>

863
00:52:36,672 --> 00:52:41,010
<i>Side by side with your loved one</i>

864
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:47,934
<i>You'll find enchantment here</i>

865
00:52:49,434 --> 00:52:54,181
<i>The night will weave its magic spell</i>

866
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,478
<i>When the one you love is near</i>

867
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:03,858
<i>Oh, this is the night...</i>

868
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,775
Come on, I wanna show you something.

869
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:09,454
<i>...heavens are right</i>

870
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:16,032
<i>On this lovely bella notte</i>

871
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,009
Wow.

872
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:31,561
Lady, the world.

873
00:53:32,603 --> 00:53:34,605
World, Lady.

874
00:53:35,398 --> 00:53:37,733
I think you two are gonna get along
just great.

875
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:40,311
I sleep over there in the train yard

876
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:44,990
so, you know, sometimes I come up here
just for the view.

877
00:53:47,076 --> 00:53:49,619
'Course you see more in the daylight
but,
you know,

878
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:54,784
there's something about the night,
outside, under the stars.

879
00:53:54,884 --> 00:54:00,422
I've seen them from the yard before,
but this is... This is something else.

880
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:07,213
Now you try.

881
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:08,681
I don't know if I can.

882
00:54:09,474 --> 00:54:10,474
Of course you can.

883
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:12,760
I've never howled before.

884
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,860
What?

885
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:15,027
What?

886
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,931
Okay, look, you just
gotta reach down deep,

887
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:20,518
and you gotta find
that inner wolf inside you.

888
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:21,643
Go ahead.

889
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,155
Okay, give me a minute.
It might be buried deep.

890
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:31,695
That was... That was great.

891
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:34,831
That was great. Was that a real attempt,
or were you just kinda warming up?

892
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:38,119
Uh, hey!
Come on, I've never done this before.

893
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:40,246
Not coming to me as naturally
as rabies did.

894
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:41,922
Let me try again.

895
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:49,588
There you go! Did that feel good?

896
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:51,507
- That felt pretty good.
- Yeah.

897
00:54:51,606 --> 00:54:53,675
I think we just need to work on your...

898
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:56,679
My volume? Is that what
you were gonna say?

899
00:54:56,778 --> 00:54:58,106
Exactly.

900
00:54:59,481 --> 00:55:01,809
I've never seen the town
from this high up.

901
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:03,735
I wonder if I can see my...

902
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:06,739
My house.

903
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:14,664
Hey. It's not so bad.

904
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:18,793
Look at you now. You're up here,
you're howling at the moon!

905
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:23,621
Yesterday, the only experiences you had
were from behind a fence.

906
00:55:23,722 --> 00:55:26,467
Yeah, I know! I know.

907
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,679
But there was a lot behind that fence.

908
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:32,931
You know?

909
00:55:33,516 --> 00:55:36,226
My life was full of love and meaning.

910
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,646
I was a part of something special.

911
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:42,567
We were a family.

912
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:47,697
It doesn't matter how much howling I do,
I feel bad about leaving them.

913
00:55:49,574 --> 00:55:51,701
You don't have to worry
about leaving them.

914
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,447
They already left you. I mean, look,
I know how much it hurts...

915
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:59,458
No, how? How would you know?

916
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:03,963
I just do.

917
00:56:07,507 --> 00:56:08,507
Oh.

918
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:10,302
You do know.

919
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:16,842
You did have a home, didn't you?

920
00:56:16,942 --> 00:56:17,942
Yeah.

921
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:20,103
I did.

922
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:24,983
<i>I had a home.</i>

923
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,322
<i>I had a family.</i>

924
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:36,871
<i>Oh, I had it all.</i>

925
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:41,291
<i>They loved me.</i>

926
00:56:44,586 --> 00:56:46,172
<i>And I loved them.</i>

927
00:56:56,264 --> 00:56:59,101
<i>And then one day it all changed.</i>

928
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:12,489
I waited in that spot all day...

929
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:15,409
And all night.

930
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:18,663
I'm so sorry.

931
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:22,331
I...

932
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,293
I didn't know.

933
00:57:25,293 --> 00:57:26,420
Eh, forget it.

934
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,007
Every dog's gotta learn someday, right?

935
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:33,510
People just don't do loyalty.

936
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:36,847
Not like us dogs.

937
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,268
And if I were still with 'em,
I wouldn't have met you.

938
00:57:42,436 --> 00:57:45,972
And we wouldn't have had this amazing
day.

939
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:47,525
And night.

940
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:52,405
Every day could be an adventure.
You and me, no leashes or fences...

941
00:57:53,197 --> 00:57:54,990
No loyalty to anyone.

942
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,454
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

943
00:58:02,164 --> 00:58:03,164
I found you!

944
00:58:03,264 --> 00:58:04,282
- He found me!
- What?

945
00:58:04,382 --> 00:58:05,951
Run! We gotta run. Right now!

946
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,086
Hey, get back here!

947
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,260
You're not getting away this time!
Not this time!

948
00:58:17,512 --> 00:58:19,097
Come on! Through here!

949
00:58:23,186 --> 00:58:25,137
We need to split up. Quick. Go that way.

950
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:28,099
What? No, that's crazy.
We have to stay together!

951
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:30,601
He's after me anyway.
We're better off alone.

952
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:32,903
Trust me! You are wrong about this.

953
00:58:34,655 --> 00:58:35,655
Run!

954
00:58:40,327 --> 00:58:42,128
Hey! Hey!

955
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:01,715
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

956
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:05,018
Let's split up.
We're gonna flush him out. Be ready.

957
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:06,938
Oh, I will be.

958
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:14,112
Here, boy.

959
00:59:16,197 --> 00:59:18,699
You're all alone now, street dog.

960
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:22,161
Come on out.

961
00:59:25,164 --> 00:59:26,331
Aren't you tired?

962
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:31,168
Oh.

963
00:59:32,045 --> 00:59:33,539
Wrap it up. I'm closing shop.

964
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,458
- I'm almost done.
- Let's get out.

965
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:36,791
- Come on.
- Let's go.

966
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:38,085
Wait, wait, wait.

967
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:39,302
Shut the door!

968
00:59:41,054 --> 00:59:42,054
Hey!

969
00:59:42,764 --> 00:59:43,932
Don't run away from me.

970
00:59:45,643 --> 00:59:46,643
Stop!

971
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:48,980
He's heading your way.

972
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:52,108
I don't see him.

973
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:05,538
Here, boy.

974
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:08,458
Come on out.

975
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:12,253
Dang it.

976
01:00:13,295 --> 01:00:14,297
A-ha!

977
01:00:15,797 --> 01:00:16,797
Now!

978
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,099
I got him.

979
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:23,172
Don't let him get by.

980
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:24,271
Not a chance.

981
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:29,771
That's it, nice and easy.

982
01:00:32,356 --> 01:00:33,356
Lady!

983
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:37,353
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What're you doing?

984
01:00:37,452 --> 01:00:38,487
Lady, let's go!

985
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,530
Get her!

986
01:00:41,114 --> 01:00:42,115
Run for it!

987
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:50,500
That was incredible! We made it!

988
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:53,376
Lady?

989
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,081
Quit your whining.

990
01:00:58,181 --> 01:00:59,181
Lady!

991
01:01:02,637 --> 01:01:03,804
Lady, I'm gonna...

992
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:08,349
I...

993
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:22,364
I'm so sorry, Lady.

994
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:49,849
Boo!

995
01:01:51,978 --> 01:01:53,771
You lost, kid?

996
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:57,150
She looks scared.

997
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:00,235
Aw!

998
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:28,472
Don't let 'em scare you, honey.

999
01:02:29,766 --> 01:02:31,266
We're all friends in here.

1000
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:34,603
Arko, is that how you treat our guest?

1001
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:38,682
You know better than that.

1002
01:02:38,782 --> 01:02:42,527
First time, love?
Don't get many family dogs in here.

1003
01:02:44,072 --> 01:02:46,565
Ah, smells like she's had a bath, too.

1004
01:02:46,664 --> 01:02:49,034
I can't remember the last time
I had a bath.

1005
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,653
This is the pound, isn't it?

1006
01:02:51,753 --> 01:02:54,239
Not used to digs like these,
are ya, honey?

1007
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,333
January! Just remembered.

1008
01:02:56,751 --> 01:03:00,454
Don't worry.
Here they've got two types of dogs.

1009
01:03:00,554 --> 01:03:02,632
Adoptable, which is you,

1010
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:04,842
and the rest of us.

1011
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:08,003
Why aren't you adoptable?

1012
01:03:08,103 --> 01:03:10,380
Baby, we're street dogs.

1013
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:11,548
We're strays.

1014
01:03:11,648 --> 01:03:13,259
Some of us are criminals.

1015
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:14,518
Allegedly.

1016
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:21,309
Hey, you guys, listen. The boat's back.

1017
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,436
How did you end up here anyway?

1018
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:28,481
Well, a friend and I ran into trouble
and got split up.

1019
01:03:28,581 --> 01:03:33,161
Hang on. Did you say friend?
Like a "friend" friend? Or a "friend"?

1020
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:35,614
- Whoa-oh.
- (LAUGHING

1021
01:03:35,713 --> 01:03:37,875
Well, I went back to help him,
but I... I...

1022
01:03:38,626 --> 01:03:39,869
I guess he couldn't help me.

1023
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:42,088
Couldn't or wouldn't?

1024
01:03:42,588 --> 01:03:43,588
Oh.

1025
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,465
Does this friend have a name?

1026
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,460
He said he had a lot of names.

1027
01:03:48,561 --> 01:03:52,213
Oh, boy! Let me guess. Butch? Spot?

1028
01:03:52,313 --> 01:03:53,849
Or, Hey, get out the trash?

1029
01:03:55,476 --> 01:03:56,811
Did you have to split up?

1030
01:03:57,728 --> 01:04:00,097
Or did he just say
you're better off alone?

1031
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:03,016
Wait. How did you know that?

1032
01:04:03,117 --> 01:04:04,893
'Cause the guy we know...

1033
01:04:04,994 --> 01:04:06,353
He's a lone wolf!

1034
01:04:06,454 --> 01:04:08,155
He's a solo act!

1035
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:12,860
<i>He's a tramp
but we love him</i>

1036
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,239
<i>Pulls a new scam every day</i>

1037
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:19,041
<i>He's a tramp</i>

1038
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:21,409
<i>We adore him</i>

1039
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:25,914
<i>And we know he'll always stay that way</i>

1040
01:04:26,014 --> 01:04:28,041
<i>He's a tramp</i>

1041
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:30,126
<i>He's a charmer</i>

1042
01:04:30,226 --> 01:04:34,215
<i>He's a sly one
And he's a ball</i>

1043
01:04:34,315 --> 01:04:38,510
<i>He's a tramp
And we love him</i>

1044
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,472
<i>Oh, just don't expect him
at your beck and call</i>

1045
01:04:42,572 --> 01:04:48,061
<i>Listen, you can never tell
when he'll show up</i>

1046
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:52,733
<i>He gives you plenty of trouble</i>

1047
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:57,237
<i>I guess he's just a no 'count pup</i>

1048
01:04:57,338 --> 01:05:00,240
<i>Who will ditch you on the double</i>

1049
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,576
<i>He's a tramp</i>

1050
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:04,753
<i>He's a loner</i>

1051
01:05:05,713 --> 01:05:08,623
<i>And there's nothing more to say</i>

1052
01:05:08,724 --> 01:05:10,960
<i>If he's a tramp</i>

1053
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:13,170
<i>Then who needs him?</i>

1054
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:16,423
<i>Oh, I know he'll always stay that way</i>

1055
01:05:16,523 --> 01:05:18,050
- <i>He never changes</i>
- <i>Listen, darling</i>

1056
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,760
<i>We know he'll always stay that way</i>

1057
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,179
<i>We're trying to help ya</i>

1058
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:27,235
<i>We know
He'll always stay that way!</i>

1059
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:34,242
Huh. A tramp.

1060
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:02,719
Come on. It's time to go.

1061
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,230
It's Nutsy.

1062
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:12,320
Is he going home?

1063
01:06:22,414 --> 01:06:24,240
Where're they taking him?

1064
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,293
Through the one-way door.

1065
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:59,242
Come on, it's time to go.

1066
01:07:07,918 --> 01:07:08,952
Lady! Are you okay?

1067
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:10,204
Lady, we're so sorry.

1068
01:07:10,304 --> 01:07:11,304
I'm so glad to see you.

1069
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,248
Oh, you must've been terrified!

1070
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:15,126
The street's no place for a dog.

1071
01:07:15,226 --> 01:07:17,969
Don't worry. We're going home.

1072
01:07:25,394 --> 01:07:26,762
Let's get you home.

1073
01:07:26,862 --> 01:07:28,398
I'm glad you're okay.

1074
01:07:49,876 --> 01:07:51,003
Home, sweet home.

1075
01:07:54,715 --> 01:07:56,717
We're not a family without you.

1076
01:07:59,429 --> 01:08:00,429
Home.

1077
01:08:03,432 --> 01:08:04,891
Oh, look at you.

1078
01:08:05,893 --> 01:08:09,347
I can't believe
you've been running
around town all alone.

1079
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:11,139
That's just awful.

1080
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:12,266
Welcome home.

1081
01:08:12,365 --> 01:08:14,393
I tried my best to tidy up.

1082
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:16,604
Oh, you found her!

1083
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:19,023
Thank goodness she's safe and sound.

1084
01:08:19,122 --> 01:08:22,568
Wish you hadn't run off like that, Lady.
You upset everyone.

1085
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,654
Oh, that's okay, Lady.

1086
01:08:24,753 --> 01:08:27,864
What Aunt Sarah meant to say
was she's sorry.

1087
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:30,167
And she was just leaving.

1088
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:33,119
Tsk. Oh, well you know what?

1089
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:36,340
Just so happens that I do have
a very
important engagement to attend to.

1090
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:43,838
You know, if I were you,
I would think long and hard

1091
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:47,009
about letting that dog get close
to that sweet baby.

1092
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:49,720
- I mean, next time we can...
- Oh, there won't be a next time.

1093
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:50,896
Excuse me?

1094
01:08:51,855 --> 01:08:53,608
How dare you!

1095
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:57,360
Well...

1096
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:02,867
Aunt Sarah does have a point
about letting you get close to the baby.

1097
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:07,704
It's all right, Lady. Come on.

1098
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:09,539
- Come on, Lady.
- Come on.

1099
01:09:12,627 --> 01:09:13,786
Lady, this is Lulu.

1100
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:16,588
She's part
of the family now, too.

1101
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:22,177
Go on.

1102
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:26,599
Oh, there you go.

1103
01:09:37,234 --> 01:09:38,360
Are you playing?

1104
01:09:39,194 --> 01:09:40,795
Oh. Hey!

1105
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:06,756
Isn't it nice to have everything
back to normal?

1106
01:10:06,855 --> 01:10:09,341
Says the dog in a dress.

1107
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:12,927
Oh, for goodness sake, watch your drool!
I've already had a bath today.

1108
01:10:13,028 --> 01:10:15,139
Oh, I really missed you guys.

1109
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:17,766
And things with Jim Dear
and Darling are, uh...

1110
01:10:17,867 --> 01:10:20,853
Well, I'm not
the center of their world anymore,

1111
01:10:20,953 --> 01:10:23,864
but our world is just bigger.

1112
01:10:24,614 --> 01:10:26,900
That's all. We have Lulu now.

1113
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:28,944
Oh, sounds exhausting.

1114
01:10:29,043 --> 01:10:33,823
We're just glad you're off the street.
Away from that dirty street dog.

1115
01:10:33,923 --> 01:10:35,960
Yeah, guess you all were right about
him.

1116
01:10:37,252 --> 01:10:38,662
Although it wasn't all bad.

1117
01:10:38,762 --> 01:10:40,922
You know, street dogs,
they're just like us.

1118
01:10:41,548 --> 01:10:43,458
They just aren't lucky enough
to have homes.

1119
01:10:43,559 --> 01:10:44,752
That's all.

1120
01:10:44,851 --> 01:10:48,672
Then it's a darn good thing
you made it back to yours, innit?

1121
01:10:48,773 --> 01:10:49,773
Yeah.

1122
01:10:50,106 --> 01:10:52,717
I cannot imagine life on the street!

1123
01:10:52,818 --> 01:10:57,555
Scrappin' about for your next meal,
no fences to make you feel safe.

1124
01:10:57,655 --> 01:11:01,685
It is the oddest, most bizarre life
I can imagine.

1125
01:11:01,786 --> 01:11:04,729
Jock! Jacqueline!

1126
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:07,524
Who's ready to entertain the court?

1127
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:11,069
That's my cue. Hope I break a leg.

1128
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,570
Yeah, wouldn't that be a shame.

1129
01:11:12,671 --> 01:11:16,042
Don't push it, Mister. I may be small,
but I am mighty.

1130
01:11:18,293 --> 01:11:20,171
Good to have you home, Lady.

1131
01:12:07,467 --> 01:12:09,753
Look what the cat dragged in.

1132
01:12:09,854 --> 01:12:13,298
I don't know. This guy, he looks too
blue
to be the Tramp.

1133
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:16,926
Oh, hey, guys.
Why are you wearing collars?

1134
01:12:17,027 --> 01:12:19,180
Turns out we're adoptable.

1135
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:22,190
There's my two. I hope you're hungry.

1136
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,268
Here you go.

1137
01:12:24,368 --> 01:12:26,145
Just a little snack before dinner.

1138
01:12:26,244 --> 01:12:27,244
What?

1139
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:30,158
Save some room. Stay.

1140
01:12:31,826 --> 01:12:33,402
You believe that?

1141
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:36,113
The butcher just gives it to him.

1142
01:12:36,212 --> 01:12:39,324
Hey, wait, wait. Hang on.
You two, adopted?

1143
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:41,661
Never really took you two for family
dogs.

1144
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:44,663
In a way, we've always been family dogs.

1145
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:45,997
At least to each other.

1146
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:49,210
What is the world coming to?
Everybody's living with people!

1147
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:52,003
Easy. What're you so upset about?

1148
01:12:52,104 --> 01:12:55,800
This wouldn't have anything to do with
that girl we met in the pound, would it?

1149
01:12:55,899 --> 01:12:58,844
What? Who? Lady? But, did you meet her?

1150
01:12:58,944 --> 01:13:03,099
No. I'm not thinking about her.
I'm doing good. I'm doing really good!

1151
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:06,101
Are you sure? 'Cause you seem
like you're doing terrible.

1152
01:13:06,202 --> 01:13:09,689
No, Bull, you got it all wrong.
He's doin' great.

1153
01:13:09,788 --> 01:13:12,984
He got what he always wanted,
and was right about everything.

1154
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:14,734
Are we looking at the same dog?

1155
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:17,070
Yep. He's free to be himself,

1156
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:19,957
- and free to be by himself.
- By myself.

1157
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:24,744
- I screwed up, didn't I?
- Yep, sure did.

1158
01:13:24,845 --> 01:13:25,912
What's goin' on, Peg?

1159
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:27,172
Doesn't matter. It's...

1160
01:13:27,756 --> 01:13:28,757
It's too late.

1161
01:13:29,466 --> 01:13:31,010
Her family came back for her.

1162
01:13:31,469 --> 01:13:34,755
You mean like she did... for you?

1163
01:13:34,854 --> 01:13:35,890
Oh, man.

1164
01:13:36,974 --> 01:13:42,220
I gotta fix it. I don't know if I can,
but I... I gotta try. I have to.

1165
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,972
- We get it.
- I don't!

1166
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:45,565
Just let her know how you feel.

1167
01:13:47,025 --> 01:13:49,779
- Okay!
- Peggy, fill me in. What just happened?

1168
01:13:51,988 --> 01:13:53,565
I'm stealing this, okay?

1169
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,993
No, it's not okay! Thief!

1170
01:14:30,987 --> 01:14:31,987
Hey.

1171
01:14:35,658 --> 01:14:39,244
What do you know? It's the Tramp.

1172
01:14:41,204 --> 01:14:42,372
Brought you somethin'.

1173
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:46,251
Here.

1174
01:14:46,635 --> 01:14:48,045
Picked it out, special.

1175
01:14:49,756 --> 01:14:51,247
Did you steal that one, too?

1176
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:52,347
No.

1177
01:14:52,766 --> 01:14:53,792
It was a gift.

1178
01:14:53,893 --> 01:14:57,128
A borrowed gift that, um...

1179
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,421
Okay, yep, I stole it.

1180
01:14:58,521 --> 01:14:59,556
Uh-huh.

1181
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:02,676
Look, um...

1182
01:15:02,777 --> 01:15:04,061
Back at the train yard...

1183
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,481
I'm so sorry for, um...

1184
01:15:08,483 --> 01:15:10,559
I never should've left your side.

1185
01:15:10,658 --> 01:15:11,819
You said it yourself.

1186
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:15,064
Nobody else is loyal,
so why should you be?

1187
01:15:15,163 --> 01:15:16,649
I should've just believed you.

1188
01:15:16,748 --> 01:15:19,577
No. You shouldn't have believed me.

1189
01:15:20,787 --> 01:15:24,664
Whatever I said about that, about,
you know, being free and...

1190
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,542
That was not true.

1191
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:32,297
Because being free without you there,
now it's just...

1192
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:35,842
That's just... being alone.

1193
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:43,842
Look, um, you know I'm a street dog.
And I don't have much value to anyone...

1194
01:15:43,943 --> 01:15:45,435
Don't you say that.

1195
01:15:47,688 --> 01:15:49,148
You have value to me.

1196
01:15:51,525 --> 01:15:52,693
I missed you.

1197
01:15:53,528 --> 01:15:54,529
Missed you, too.

1198
01:15:55,988 --> 01:15:59,867
Sometimes I come outside at night
just to howl at the moon.

1199
01:16:00,451 --> 01:16:03,537
Well, that...
That doesn't have to end.

1200
01:16:04,538 --> 01:16:07,240
We could howl again. We can run free.

1201
01:16:07,341 --> 01:16:08,408
Have more adventures.

1202
01:16:08,509 --> 01:16:10,420
It's... It's not too late for that.

1203
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:12,796
Is it?

1204
01:16:14,756 --> 01:16:17,260
Sorry... but it is.

1205
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:23,807
I belong here... with Jim Dear,
and Darling, and Lulu. We're a family.

1206
01:16:24,766 --> 01:16:26,394
They depend on me.

1207
01:16:28,395 --> 01:16:29,939
And I'm loyal to them.

1208
01:16:31,274 --> 01:16:33,141
Yeah, you're...

1209
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:34,242
You're right.

1210
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,904
You deserve it, Lady.

1211
01:16:38,363 --> 01:16:39,990
You deserve it, too.

1212
01:16:41,242 --> 01:16:43,034
You deserve love.

1213
01:16:43,953 --> 01:16:46,581
I'm just sorry that it can't be with me.

1214
01:16:53,962 --> 01:16:56,841
Lady! Come inside.

1215
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:02,679
I'll go.

1216
01:17:02,778 --> 01:17:03,778
Um...

1217
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:07,769
You belong with your family.

1218
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:23,076
Lady! Come in out of the rain.

1219
01:17:28,163 --> 01:17:29,164
It's...

1220
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,363
Lulu!

1221
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:10,448
The stray I'm after was running around
the streets with your dog.

1222
01:18:10,547 --> 01:18:11,614
- Lady!
- Lady!

1223
01:18:11,715 --> 01:18:13,993
I know he's coming here.
And she knows it, too!

1224
01:18:14,092 --> 01:18:16,244
- Whoa! Lady!
- It's all right. You know what?

1225
01:18:16,345 --> 01:18:18,502
- No. Please.
- I'm gonna let her calm down. Come on.

1226
01:18:18,601 --> 01:18:20,291
That's obviously
why she's barking.

1227
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:23,210
There, there. It's all right.

1228
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:28,173
No, actually I think she's still
upset about her experience at the pound.

1229
01:18:28,274 --> 01:18:30,801
Well, clearly she learned nothing
from her time there.

1230
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,354
Just for a minute, Lady.

1231
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:36,399
So strong. She...

1232
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:48,118
Lady?

1233
01:18:51,122 --> 01:18:54,158
It's so late.
It's a good thing we heard the door.

1234
01:18:54,257 --> 01:18:56,118
- We were about to get into bed.
- Oh, yeah.

1235
01:18:56,217 --> 01:18:59,212
It sure is, ma'am.
Safety can't wait till morning.

1236
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:15,229
Lady?

1237
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,640
Lady? It's me!

1238
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,643
Thank goodness! You came back!

1239
01:19:20,743 --> 01:19:22,103
Are you okay? What's wrong?

1240
01:19:22,203 --> 01:19:25,480
There's a rat in Lulu's room.
But I can't get out of here.

1241
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:27,358
- I'll take care of it.
- You will?

1242
01:19:27,457 --> 01:19:30,036
Okay. But be careful.
The dog catcher's in there.

1243
01:19:31,453 --> 01:19:33,247
Don't worry. I got this.

1244
01:19:33,747 --> 01:19:34,748
Hurry!

1245
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:41,913
I've been tracking
this street dog for hours.

1246
01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:44,166
If he isn't here already, he will be.

1247
01:19:44,265 --> 01:19:47,168
This is the same stray
that you were looking for before?

1248
01:19:47,269 --> 01:19:48,503
The very one.

1249
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:50,806
Hmm.
And you still haven't caught him?

1250
01:19:52,225 --> 01:19:53,717
Is that the back of your property?

1251
01:19:53,818 --> 01:19:56,011
- Uh...
- What... What... Please, come right in.

1252
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:58,189
Uh, what's... Hold on.

1253
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,016
What? I'm sorry.

1254
01:20:01,117 --> 01:20:03,351
And you're sure he's headed this way?
Ow!

1255
01:20:03,452 --> 01:20:06,146
Yes. And for your safety,
I better wait for him.

1256
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:07,898
And you'd better make some coffee.

1257
01:20:07,997 --> 01:20:09,817
Jim, you heard the man.

1258
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,027
Right away, Darling.

1259
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:13,203
Coffee without cake
is the devil's work.

1260
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:03,996
What is going on up there?

1261
01:21:04,095 --> 01:21:05,840
I'm telling you, I had him...

1262
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:08,384
Inches from custody.

1263
01:21:10,052 --> 01:21:16,091
And keep in mind, this dog is mangy,
dirty, dangerous.

1264
01:21:16,192 --> 01:21:17,192
Hmm.

1265
01:21:28,945 --> 01:21:29,945
Huh?

1266
01:21:39,457 --> 01:21:40,457
Aw!

1267
01:21:55,555 --> 01:21:56,807
Ow! Get off me!

1268
01:22:19,831 --> 01:22:20,831
Huh?

1269
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,771
No! Stay away from the baby!

1270
01:22:46,606 --> 01:22:47,606
No!

1271
01:22:49,152 --> 01:22:50,444
In the trial...

1272
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:03,457
Oh, you're okay.

1273
01:23:08,087 --> 01:23:09,463
Wait, is that Lulu?

1274
01:23:14,844 --> 01:23:16,345
Oh, God.

1275
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:30,484
Hey, hey!

1276
01:23:31,069 --> 01:23:32,069
Lulu?

1277
01:23:32,368 --> 01:23:33,604
Get away! Get away from her!

1278
01:23:33,703 --> 01:23:36,106
All right, stay back! Get back! Back up!

1279
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:37,774
- Lu!
- He's here!

1280
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,150
- Lulu!
- Get the baby!

1281
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:40,778
- Is she all right?
- I don't know!

1282
01:23:40,877 --> 01:23:42,079
Stay! Stay!

1283
01:23:43,622 --> 01:23:46,000
We're okay. He's here! The dog's here!

1284
01:23:51,797 --> 01:23:54,917
You got very lucky there.
This one's a real menace.

1285
01:23:55,016 --> 01:23:57,336
Careful.
Uh, are you sure you've got him?

1286
01:23:57,435 --> 01:23:59,680
Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere.

1287
01:24:03,893 --> 01:24:06,554
This is so strange. I've never seen
this dog before in my life.

1288
01:24:06,654 --> 01:24:08,305
I don't know how he got inside.

1289
01:24:08,405 --> 01:24:10,474
Dogs can be dangerous.

1290
01:24:10,573 --> 01:24:13,476
This is exactly the kinda thing
we try to prevent in my profession.

1291
01:24:13,577 --> 01:24:14,945
Of course.

1292
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:23,445
You know, I must say, I...

1293
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:25,414
I didn't take you seriously at first.

1294
01:24:25,997 --> 01:24:27,041
I get that a lot.

1295
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,202
But you're safe now.

1296
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:31,912
He's off the streets,

1297
01:24:32,011 --> 01:24:35,298
and we've got strict rules on what
happens
to dogs that attack humans.

1298
01:24:37,926 --> 01:24:40,054
Well, thank you very much for your time.

1299
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,390
- Good night.
- Good night.

1300
01:24:52,483 --> 01:24:55,185
- Did you hear all that ruckus?
- Mm-hmm.

1301
01:24:55,286 --> 01:24:58,146
Do you really think he went after
the wee baby?

1302
01:24:58,247 --> 01:25:02,452
I never trusted him,
but I never thought he'd do that.

1303
01:25:09,082 --> 01:25:11,002
Lady, I'm so sorry.

1304
01:25:11,793 --> 01:25:13,953
You were just trying to warn us
about that dog...

1305
01:25:14,054 --> 01:25:15,881
Oh. Lady! Lady!

1306
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,510
Lady?

1307
01:25:21,436 --> 01:25:23,436
Hey! Lady!

1308
01:25:25,015 --> 01:25:26,015
Lady!

1309
01:25:28,144 --> 01:25:29,144
What?

1310
01:25:31,855 --> 01:25:32,931
Darling!

1311
01:25:33,032 --> 01:25:34,032
Jim, come here!

1312
01:25:34,984 --> 01:25:35,984
What?

1313
01:25:40,363 --> 01:25:41,363
Oh.

1314
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:44,402
Oh, God. What is it?

1315
01:25:44,502 --> 01:25:45,944
It's a... It's a rat.

1316
01:25:46,045 --> 01:25:47,045
Oh.

1317
01:25:47,371 --> 01:25:48,997
Oh, no. I've...

1318
01:25:54,252 --> 01:25:55,328
Where'd he go?

1319
01:25:55,429 --> 01:25:57,247
Dog catcher took him to the pokey.

1320
01:25:57,347 --> 01:25:59,082
- I've gotta stop them!
- What happened?

1321
01:25:59,182 --> 01:26:01,335
It was the rat!

1322
01:26:01,435 --> 01:26:03,796
Trusty! Maybe we misjudged him.

1323
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:06,423
Lady didn't. We gotta help her.

1324
01:26:06,524 --> 01:26:08,551
I can't run in my kilt!

1325
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:10,144
You're gonna have to try.

1326
01:26:13,648 --> 01:26:14,648
Oh, no!

1327
01:26:14,747 --> 01:26:16,182
What is she doing?

1328
01:26:16,283 --> 01:26:17,283
Lady!

1329
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,944
- Lady!
- Lady!

1330
01:26:20,863 --> 01:26:21,980
- Lady!
- Let's go get her!

1331
01:26:22,081 --> 01:26:24,074
Let's go get her. Come on. Come on!

1332
01:26:24,533 --> 01:26:26,152
We've gotta stop that wagon.

1333
01:26:26,252 --> 01:26:27,819
I'm not built for speed, you know?

1334
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,697
You can do it, little doggie.

1335
01:26:29,796 --> 01:26:30,796
Oh, my wee legs!

1336
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,710
Everyone thought I was crazy.

1337
01:26:35,377 --> 01:26:37,337
But I don't look so crazy now, do I?

1338
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:45,011
Come on! Keep going!

1339
01:26:45,805 --> 01:26:47,922
In the name of the wee man!
I'm naked.

1340
01:26:48,023 --> 01:26:49,475
Nah, you're just faster.

1341
01:26:56,690 --> 01:27:00,060
What has gotten into her?
Why would she be chasing that stray?

1342
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:02,395
Jim, Lulu's fine.

1343
01:27:02,496 --> 01:27:04,939
Did we actually see that dog attack her?

1344
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:06,039
Yes!

1345
01:27:07,534 --> 01:27:08,534
No?

1346
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:11,579
Huh.

1347
01:27:23,717 --> 01:27:26,127
- Which way did they go?
- I didn't see it!

1348
01:27:26,228 --> 01:27:30,224
Fear not, the bloodhound
sees with his snout.

1349
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:32,643
Not this again!

1350
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:35,637
You can do it, Trusty.
We believe in you.

1351
01:27:35,738 --> 01:27:37,555
We've no got time for this!

1352
01:27:37,655 --> 01:27:41,060
Quiet! I can't hear myself smell.

1353
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:42,435
This is your moment, Trusty.

1354
01:27:42,536 --> 01:27:44,479
Come on, Ol' Reliable.

1355
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:45,981
You can do it, Trusty.

1356
01:27:46,082 --> 01:27:47,492
I got somethin'.

1357
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:52,570
Snapper! Darn it!

1358
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:55,282
Sorry, Lady, I'm wrong.

1359
01:27:55,381 --> 01:28:00,121
Truth is, Ol' Reliable is old
and not that reliable.

1360
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,707
Trusty! Now you listen to me!

1361
01:28:02,806 --> 01:28:04,958
I want you to focus on me.

1362
01:28:05,059 --> 01:28:09,880
I have not listened to you witter on
about "Ol' Reliable"

1363
01:28:09,979 --> 01:28:14,217
for half of my short life just
to see you quit when we need you!

1364
01:28:14,318 --> 01:28:18,014
Now if I can run through the streets
stark naked with these wee, tiny legs,

1365
01:28:18,113 --> 01:28:20,349
you can smell a dog in a wagon!

1366
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:21,692
Now, do it!

1367
01:28:22,318 --> 01:28:23,444
Yes, ma'am.

1368
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:26,113
Use your skills, bloodhound!

1369
01:28:27,114 --> 01:28:28,114
Come on.

1370
01:28:28,213 --> 01:28:30,192
Banana peel... Trash...

1371
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:32,235
- You can do it, Trusty.
- Cat dung.

1372
01:28:32,336 --> 01:28:33,621
Smell hard!

1373
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:36,323
I did it?

1374
01:28:36,423 --> 01:28:39,368
I did it! This way. Come on!

1375
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:41,753
- Come on!
- Oh, well. Here we go.

1376
01:28:44,381 --> 01:28:46,958
Look, there it is, Trusty!
You did it!

1377
01:28:47,059 --> 01:28:49,211
Ol' Reliable strikes again!

1378
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:51,305
I never doubted you for a second!

1379
01:28:58,604 --> 01:29:00,021
Come on! Through here!

1380
01:29:13,911 --> 01:29:15,310
Lady...

1381
01:29:15,546 --> 01:29:16,956
No! What are you doing?

1382
01:29:17,664 --> 01:29:19,000
Come on!

1383
01:29:21,127 --> 01:29:22,484
Don't worry, we're gonna save you.

1384
01:29:22,585 --> 01:29:24,622
Lady! No! It's too dangerous.

1385
01:29:24,721 --> 01:29:27,341
You crazy dog.
What are you doing?

1386
01:29:30,636 --> 01:29:32,046
Easy! Whoa!

1387
01:29:32,145 --> 01:29:34,056
Slow down! Whoa!

1388
01:29:35,099 --> 01:29:36,300
Easy! Easy!

1389
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:37,551
Come on!

1390
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:39,345
My legs can't go any quicker!

1391
01:29:39,444 --> 01:29:40,762
Sorry, Lady...

1392
01:29:40,863 --> 01:29:42,899
Oh, no! We're losing them.

1393
01:29:57,997 --> 01:29:59,039
Lady! No!

1394
01:30:03,336 --> 01:30:04,337
Whoa!

1395
01:30:10,426 --> 01:30:13,720
No! No, no, no! No!

1396
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,131
Oh, no.

1397
01:30:34,908 --> 01:30:37,944
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1398
01:30:38,045 --> 01:30:39,195
Oh, come on.

1399
01:30:39,296 --> 01:30:40,296
You're okay.

1400
01:30:41,957 --> 01:30:42,958
Get up.

1401
01:30:44,502 --> 01:30:46,962
Come on. Please?

1402
01:30:47,712 --> 01:30:49,090
Just wake up.

1403
01:30:50,173 --> 01:30:51,300
Please?

1404
01:30:52,592 --> 01:30:54,462
You can't go.

1405
01:30:54,561 --> 01:30:58,390
We... have places to go,
adventures to... take.

1406
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,811
Just wake up. Please?

1407
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:21,163
Pretty good, kid.

1408
01:31:22,582 --> 01:31:24,458
We still need to work on your volume.

1409
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,960
Okay.

1410
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:29,372
Ah, he's okay.

1411
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:31,215
Oh, I think I might faint.

1412
01:31:36,179 --> 01:31:38,639
- What happened?
- Oh, no! Lady!

1413
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:40,474
Lady!

1414
01:31:40,573 --> 01:31:41,573
Is she hurt?

1415
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:44,095
- Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
- Sorry.

1416
01:31:44,194 --> 01:31:46,972
- It's all right. We're okay.
- Jim, he's bleeding.

1417
01:31:47,073 --> 01:31:50,025
Oh, he got hurt
protecting Lulu from the rat.

1418
01:31:50,609 --> 01:31:51,609
How'd this happen?

1419
01:31:51,708 --> 01:31:53,626
- Come on. You're still coming with me.
- Whoa!

1420
01:31:54,905 --> 01:31:56,564
Jim? Hey!

1421
01:31:56,664 --> 01:31:58,567
Hey, Lady, it's all right.

1422
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,653
- Calm down, calm down.
- Hey! Let him go!

1423
01:32:00,752 --> 01:32:04,122
I don't care what it takes.
I'll walk you to the pound if I have to.

1424
01:32:05,373 --> 01:32:06,617
What? Okay. Okay.

1425
01:32:06,716 --> 01:32:08,661
- We have to do something.
- Okay.

1426
01:32:08,761 --> 01:32:11,797
Stop! Stop it! You can't do this!

1427
01:32:13,381 --> 01:32:15,876
What? He was attacking your baby!

1428
01:32:15,975 --> 01:32:17,962
No, he was protecting our baby.

1429
01:32:18,061 --> 01:32:22,225
Ma'am, any unlicensed dog without a home
will be immediately impounded!

1430
01:32:22,975 --> 01:32:23,975
He...

1431
01:32:25,435 --> 01:32:26,436
He has a home.

1432
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:30,599
He's a street dog!

1433
01:32:30,698 --> 01:32:34,569
No, he's not. He has a home.

1434
01:32:35,613 --> 01:32:36,613
What?

1435
01:32:37,907 --> 01:32:41,034
That's our dog, sir.
He's coming home with us.

1436
01:32:51,462 --> 01:32:53,747
Hi. Come here, boy.

1437
01:32:53,847 --> 01:32:54,847
Hey, buddy.

1438
01:32:59,095 --> 01:33:00,930
- Come here.
- Hey, buddy.

1439
01:33:08,395 --> 01:33:10,014
- Hey, come here. Come on.
- It's okay.

1440
01:33:10,113 --> 01:33:13,275
It's all right. Come on.

1441
01:33:14,402 --> 01:33:15,728
Good boy.

1442
01:33:15,828 --> 01:33:17,228
Hi. Hi.

1443
01:33:23,286 --> 01:33:25,445
There. That's better.

1444
01:33:25,546 --> 01:33:27,739
You're okay now, boy.

1445
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,375
Thank you for helping Lulu.

1446
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:31,252
What a good boy.

1447
01:33:34,337 --> 01:33:35,337
Aw!

1448
01:33:53,483 --> 01:33:57,060
I just figured out what I'm gettin' you
for the holidays.

1449
01:33:57,161 --> 01:33:59,313
- Dignity.
- Ugh!

1450
01:33:59,412 --> 01:34:01,856
Auntie Jock, come play with us!

1451
01:34:01,957 --> 01:34:03,442
Well, who do we have here?

1452
01:34:03,542 --> 01:34:06,237
Now this is a look I approve of.

1453
01:34:06,337 --> 01:34:07,654
Thank you, Trusty.

1454
01:34:07,755 --> 01:34:10,032
They're from the pound.

1455
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:12,493
Sally was inspired by Lady's new friend.

1456
01:34:12,592 --> 01:34:15,537
I wasn't so sure at first but,
you know, it's like Lady said,

1457
01:34:15,637 --> 01:34:18,039
"Our world is bigger now."

1458
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:20,667
And I must admit,

1459
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:23,845
they are... very, very soft.

1460
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:28,050
Hey, cadets. I'm your Uncle Trusty.

1461
01:34:28,149 --> 01:34:30,176
Hi, Uncle Trusty.

1462
01:34:30,277 --> 01:34:33,096
Y'all wanna hear a tale of Ol' Reliable?

1463
01:34:33,197 --> 01:34:36,309
About the time I sniffed out
a dog catcher?

1464
01:34:36,408 --> 01:34:39,561
Saved a poor stray with a heart of gold.

1465
01:34:39,662 --> 01:34:42,189
Yeah! Tell us, Uncle Trusty.

1466
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:43,983
Yeah, tell us.

1467
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:46,277
Gather around, pups.

1468
01:34:46,377 --> 01:34:47,377
Yay.

1469
01:34:48,087 --> 01:34:50,530
Story of a Ol' Reliable.

1470
01:34:50,631 --> 01:34:53,501
No. Old Reliable.

1471
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,921
Okay. I wonder who this one is for?

1472
01:34:59,047 --> 01:35:00,047
Wow!

1473
01:35:00,146 --> 01:35:01,146
Look at that.

1474
01:35:01,717 --> 01:35:03,627
Wow, look at that. What is it?

1475
01:35:03,728 --> 01:35:06,838
All right. Come here, boy.
It's time we made you official.

1476
01:35:06,939 --> 01:35:07,939
Aw!

1477
01:35:08,106 --> 01:35:09,382
Look at that.

1478
01:35:09,483 --> 01:35:11,551
- Welcome to the family.
- There you go.

1479
01:35:11,652 --> 01:35:12,979
Hey, what do you think, Lady?

1480
01:35:14,771 --> 01:35:15,771
- You like it?
- Yeah?

1481
01:35:15,871 --> 01:35:16,983
Yeah, Lu?

1482
01:35:19,068 --> 01:35:20,770
Why don't you open Lulu's present?

1483
01:35:20,869 --> 01:35:22,938
Wow, look at you with a collar.

1484
01:35:23,037 --> 01:35:25,733
You almost look like a family dog.

1485
01:35:25,832 --> 01:35:27,068
Can you believe it?

1486
01:35:27,167 --> 01:35:30,404
Well, you'll always be the Tramp to me.

1487
01:35:30,503 --> 01:35:31,613
Ha, ha.

1488
01:35:31,713 --> 01:35:34,742
So, how does it feel?

1489
01:35:34,841 --> 01:35:36,911
You know, it kinda feels...

1490
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:38,953
What, too tight? Too itchy?

1491
01:35:39,054 --> 01:35:40,054
No, um...

1492
01:35:40,756 --> 01:35:42,382
Might take some gettin' used to.

1493
01:35:42,759 --> 01:35:43,759
Hmm.

1494
01:35:43,858 --> 01:35:46,929
Was gonna say, it kinda feels, um...

1495
01:35:47,846 --> 01:35:48,847
like home.
