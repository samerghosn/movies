1
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,243
This is Will Robinson
of the 24th Colonist Group.

2
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,039
I'm making a record of this
because it seems...

3
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:28,712
I'm the first human to discover evidence
of an alien intelligence.

4
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,966
This appears to be
the first known work of art

5
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,804
of an artificial intelligence
of alien origin.

6
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,599
What would you like to call
your masterpiece?

7
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:41,518
Danger.

8
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,313
Let's try something else.

9
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,741
- That's the low oxygen warning.
- Yeah.

10
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,497
So we've only got
two hours of air left.

11
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,332
That's right.

12
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,586
Great.

13
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,341
How'd we all get caught up in the idea
that launching into space

14
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:59,052
like the most primitive astronauts
in history was somehow genius?

15
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,848
-Are we doing this again?
-If only you'd gone left.

16
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,975
Look, Maureen didn't answer,
which isn't like her.

17
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:10,397
Left or right. It's a 50/50 shot.
In my world, those are great odds.

18
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,193
A 50% chance of dying are terrible odds.

19
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,069
You never eject a man into outer space
without his permission.

20
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,780
It's common courtesy.

21
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,329
Hey. We still have a couple of hours.

22
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,582
We had a 50/50 shot.

23
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,295
Hey, we got work to do.
Pick it up.

24
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,799
Ready? One, two, three.

25
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,563
-The tremors are getting worse.
-Yeah.

26
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,699
That's all of them.

27
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,286
Almost all of them.

28
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,830
Hiroki's gonna be pretty upset
when he figures out we snuck off his ship.

29
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:12,669
Well, Robinsons stick together.

30
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,466
Once Mom and Judy get back,
we'll be all set to go?

31
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,470
They haven't called in a while.
They should be back by now.

32
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,475
Is that Dad back in range?

33
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,060
Yeah.

34
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,903
-It's Morse code.
-What's he spelling?

35
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,197
-F.
-Okay.

36
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,951
U.

37
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,538
That's his message? "FU"?
This is how your kids talk?

38
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,456
E.

39
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,207
Okay, that changes everything.

40
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,168
L.

41
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,255
- Fuel. They have fuel.
- Hey, they got fuel!

42
00:04:58,338 --> 00:04:59,173
Yeah.

43
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:00,841
Yeah.

44
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,761
If we'd waited a couple of hours,
we wouldn't be here.

45
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,764
Great.

46
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,935
Do you hear that?

47
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,531
-Mom, Judy, I have amazing news.
-No, it can wait.

48
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,952
- Stay calm.
- What is she doing here?

49
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,497
I live here, in case you've forgotten.

50
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,249
Yeah. There's four of us and one of you.

51
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,793
Actually, there's two of me.

52
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,963
You're alive.

53
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,800
I want you to restrain Dr. Smith.

54
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,427
Will, he's not the same.

55
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,762
Robot, come here.

56
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,558
Stop! I said stop.

57
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,314
Will, are you okay?

58
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,985
It's hers now.

59
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,826
I saved him this time
from what you did to him.

60
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,454
Friends don't make friends
walk off cliffs.

61
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,000
-Leave him alone.
-I'm just being honest. Right, Will?

62
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,211
That's how we've always been
with each other.

63
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,798
So what now? What do you want?

64
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,050
What we all want.
To fly up to the  Resolute.

65
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,012
I'm not holding any grudges.
And you shouldn't either.

66
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,223
Will?

67
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:33,600
What is that annoying noise?

68
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,937
-Will, is it...
-Yeah.

69
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,146
-Is it what I think it is?
-Yeah.

70
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,106
Think what is?

71
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,985
It's Dad. He's okay.
He and Don are up there in orbit.

72
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,447
That's such great news.

73
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,624
My Morse code's a little rusty.
What's he saying?

74
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,923
"Mugu."

75
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:09,928
-Point Mugu. It's a state park.
-I used to love that place.

76
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,264
But why is he talking about it?

77
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:13,098
It's a message.
He's trying to tell us something.

78
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,810
What do you guys remember most
about going there?

79
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,978
Uh, we used to build bonfires
on the beach.

80
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,980
-Yeah, I remember that.
-Okay, bonfire.

81
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,317
Why would that have
anything to do with anything?

82
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,362
Could he build one up in space?

83
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,449
Yes, I think so.

84
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,869
He's trying to tell us where he is.

85
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,413
Let's search the atmosphere
for a heat signature.

86
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,417
Wait. We had a plan.

87
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,920
-Same plan, slight detour.
-I've had enough detours in my life.

88
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,096
You said that you didn't want
to hurt John. Was that true?

89
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,683
Be honest.

90
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,564
How long before the  Resolute
leaves for good?

91
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,860
88 minutes.

92
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,843
So exactly what is the plan
to make this signal fire?

93
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,471
Still got some fuel oxidizer in the lines.

94
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,850
I can rig it to blow a stream
of burning gas.

95
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,769
You think it'll be enough for
the  Jupiter's  thermal sensors to pick up?

96
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,731
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

97
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,277
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

98
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,446
There's something in my eyes.
Stings like hell.

99
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,655
Okay, let me see.

100
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,661
Oh, yeah. Some of the anti-fogging agent
must have dried up and flaked off.

101
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,996
Yeah, well, I can't see.
I'll just have to feel around and wing it.

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,668
Whoa!

103
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:08,255
Hey, you can't do this blind.

104
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,423
-Then who's gonna do it. You?
-Yeah.

105
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:14,928
I assume you're comfortable identifying
compression-loaded orthogrid cylinders.

106
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,389
Just gonna have to talk me through it.
Okay?

107
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:19,850
How hard can it be?

108
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,230
There are four hexagonal bolts.
Start unscrewing.

109
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,106
You do know what a hexagon is?

110
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:32,196
Launch will commence
in T-minus ten minutes.

111
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,255
Hi.

112
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:56,721
It's okay.

113
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,936
Remember this?

114
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,383
Hey.

115
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,514
You and me are still friends.

116
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,434
So that means you and the robot
can still be friends.

117
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,691
It's not my friend.

118
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:04,955
You said "it," not "he."

119
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,917
I guess I did.

120
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:14,465
We're gonna fix him, okay?
We'll get him back to the way he was.

121
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,302
It's not coming back.

122
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,441
Pop-outs secured.

123
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:36,070
Smith really gonna let us
rescue Dad and Don?

124
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,032
-She hasn't said no yet.
-I wish we could leave her here.

125
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,784
Launch will commence
in T-minus seven minutes.

126
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:47,081
Be thankful she's not leaving us.
Be thankful she can't pilot the ship.

127
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,460
Can we really let Smith bring that robot
to the  Resolute?

128
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,296
With all those people there?
Who knows what she's gonna do.

129
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,715
We'll deal with one problem at a time.

130
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,307
Volcano? Where did that come from?

131
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,394
It was always there.
It was just disguised as a mountain.

132
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,188
- Strap in now.
- Will.

133
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,075
The volcano's gonna create
significant top winds.

134
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,869
Liftoff's gonna get pretty bumpy.

135
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,787
How bumpy?

136
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,293
The hub is the safest place on the ship.
You're free to stay here...

137
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,962
or you can ride up front with me.
Your choice.

138
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:42,302
I go where you go.

139
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,556
Not that I don't trust you.

140
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,398
Okay, helmets on.

141
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,076
Launch will commence
in T-minus two minutes.

142
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,543
Excuse me,
I need to perform pre-launch checks.

143
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,128
It's okay.

144
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,719
I usually have a co-pilot.

145
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,014
You seem to be doing fine on your own.

146
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,100
But then, you've had years of practice

147
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,561
of having to do everything
all by yourself.

148
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:36,231
Are you sure we need to go out of our way
to pick up your husband?

149
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:40,568
Do you ever feel guilty
about anything you do?

150
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,072
Launch will commence
in T-minus one minute.

151
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,615
Guilt is like a stomachache
from overeating.

152
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:49,662
You make all sorts of promises
while you're feeling it,

153
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,706
but once it passes,
you just get hungry again.

154
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,250
Most people are not like you.

155
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:57,711
Everybody's like me.
I'm just not in denial.

156
00:13:58,294 --> 00:13:59,922
Denial about what?

157
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,591
I just wanna look out for myself.

158
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:07,221
You think you're so different?
You love John because he protects you.

159
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,515
You fight for your kids
because it gives you purpose.

160
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,393
Even Will, all that sweetness...

161
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,230
it's only because he's scared
and he wants to feel safe.

162
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,231
Don't you dare talk to me about my son.

163
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,734
Launch will commence
in T-minus 30 seconds.

164
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,445
He's a perfectly fine kid,
but he's no angel.

165
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:26,823
He's not selfless. Nobody is.

166
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,794
Launch will commence
in T-minus ten, nine,

167
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,465
eight, seven, six, five...

168
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,009
- I'm not gonna miss this place.
- ...four, three,

169
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:48,261
-two, one.
-Well, we've got that in common.

170
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,461
Okay, planet that we never
bothered to name,

171
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,796
this is between us now.

172
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,676
We're leaving.

173
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:49,990
Judy, Penny, Will, we're clear.

174
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,327
It's pretty up here.

175
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,624
But I guess everything looks pretty
from far enough away.

176
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,974
-Isn't it supposed to float?
-Yes.

177
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,433
Mom, things just got weird.

178
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,690
Are we in orbit?

179
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,359
Yes, we are.

180
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,614
And no, I don't know why
there's gravity on the ship.

181
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:48,590
Jupiter 2, this is
Victor Dhar calling you from the Resolute.

182
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:52,427
I repeat.  Jupiter 2,  this is Victor Dhar
calling you from the  Resolute.

183
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,890
I don't know if you can hear us,

184
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,811
but every one of the other Jupiters
made it here safely.

185
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,563
And for that,
we owe you a debt of gratitude.

186
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,402
However, as you're well aware,
there's a black hole

187
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:10,445
making this section of space
extremely treacherous.

188
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:15,409
You now have 63 minutes to join us.

189
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:19,121
I hope you will.

190
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,124
Because after that time,
we simply can't wait any longer.

191
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,626
Resolute,  out.

192
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,463
63 minutes?

193
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,760
-That's plenty of time to get John.
-Oh, yeah, that's right.

194
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:39,098
I'll program in a search pattern now.

195
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:42,352
Course correction
required. Insufficient fuel.

196
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:43,895
"Insufficient fuel"?

197
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,067
Don't pay any attention to that.
The system isn't properly calibrated.

198
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,612
Because it sounds a lot like
we won't have enough fuel

199
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,740
to go find your husband
and still make it back to the  Resolute.

200
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,992
-I'll tighten the search perimeters.
-That's insufficient.

201
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,371
It's time for you to put aside
your personal feelings

202
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:04,374
and get your priorities straight.

203
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,669
Sometimes you have to let people go.

204
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,090
Set a course for the  Resolute.

205
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,425
No.

206
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,137
Set a course for the  Resolute

207
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:20,265
and you and your kids
can go there with me.

208
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,938
Or I'll throw you off the ship
and find a way to get there myself.

209
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:30,817
-You think you hold all the cards?
-I know I do.

210
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,112
-Are you sure?
-I have a robot.

211
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:41,202
Warning.
Entry angle exceeding parameters.

212
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,038
-Mom?
-Trust her.

213
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,998
Five hundred.
Approaching minimums.

214
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,000
Are you crazy? You'd commit suicide
with your kids?

215
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,752
Four hundred.
Approaching minimums.

216
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:53,548
We're Robinsons.
Live together or die together.

217
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,344
- Would you do something?
- Danger, Dr. Smith.

218
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,805
- What're you doing?
- Danger, Dr. Smith.

219
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,097
She's bluffing.

220
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,643
- Out of the hub, now.
- Let's go!

221
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,769
One hundred.
Approaching minimums.

222
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,896
Danger, Dr. Smith.

223
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,066
Stop it.

224
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,069
Minimums. Minimums. Minimums.

225
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:16,529
This is what she wants.

226
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,365
Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.

227
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,782
Come on.

228
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:26,582
Pull up. Pull up.
Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.

229
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,834
Orbit stabilized.

230
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:52,273
Open the door! Get me out of here!

231
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,460
You're in the safest room on the ship.

232
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,171
It was designed to survive
an asteroid collision.

233
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,548
It was designed to withstand solar flares.

234
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,384
It was designed to repel temperatures
that drop to absolute zero.

235
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,846
And do you know who designed it? Me.

236
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
So don't expect to get out any time soon.

237
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,484
Break the glass.

238
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,663
-You can't keep me in here forever.
-That's true.

239
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,664
But you'll be in there for long enough.

240
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,875
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to find my husband.

241
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:02,301
You do realize you can never
criticize us for being reckless again.

242
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:05,346
Of course I can. I'm your mother.
You and Judy get the harpoon ready.

243
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,724
- Wait, we have a harpoon?
- Will, you're with me.

244
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,730
We're almost there.
Find the green wire?

245
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,150
-There is no green wire.
-Okay, find the black wire.

246
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,028
-There's no black wire.
-What do you see?

247
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,571
Whole bunch of wires,
none of which are green or black.

248
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,991
Whoever installed this
must've swapped out this unit

249
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,952
with another controller to cut corners.
It was probably that Williamson,

250
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,122
-that cheap son of a bitch.
-So what do I do here?

251
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,125
There are a thousand possible scenarios
to choose from,

252
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,961
only one of which would work.
I'd know if I saw it.

253
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:41,508
Okay. Okay.
You're just gonna have to see it.

254
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,012
As it happens, our eyes have the ability
to generate liquid. They're called tears.

255
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,888
-You want me to cry?
-Yeah.

256
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,141
Well, how?

257
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,271
Well, I don't know, I mean, I...
Think of something sad.

258
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,191
-That seems to work for most people.
-I can't cry out of nowhere.

259
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,444
Okay, okay.

260
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,448
Picture all your family and friends
that you left behind on Earth

261
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,199
that you may never see again.

262
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,243
There's no one I really care about.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have left.

263
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:12,455
I've been on my own ever since
before I could tie my shoelaces.

264
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:13,832
Which I taught myself.

265
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,751
I've seen a lot of orphans.

266
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,463
Who says I'm an orphan?
My parents are alive and well.

267
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,340
Somewhere, I guess.

268
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,093
I'm sorry they ditched you.

269
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,555
Must be tough knowing
that they never loved you.

270
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,268
That they thought
you were a worthless piece of--

271
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,688
Hey, what the hell, man? Why do you--
Oh, I see what you're doing.

272
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,398
Trying to make me cry.
You have to do better than that.

273
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:44,403
You know what? Forget about it.
I'll figure it out myself.

274
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,913
We actually have a harpoon gun.

275
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,415
All my life, I feel like I've been
missing out on harpooning things.

276
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,752
All this talk of harpooning
reminds me,

277
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,755
we never got to finish  Moby-Dick.

278
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:04,090
-Only got to, like, page 30.
-The whale kills Ahab.

279
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,842
Spoiler alert.

280
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:09,971
It was written in 1851. You had your shot.

281
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,227
Diving towards the planet
must have used a lot of fuel.

282
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,019
Do we still have enough to find Dad?

283
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:19,522
I'm starting another infrared sweep.

284
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,777
If he can get that bonfire lit soon,
we should be okay.

285
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,830
I never should have saved him.
Should have let him die in that tree.

286
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:43,712
The robot is only as good as its master.
You are a very good person.

287
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,300
The robot saved Judy because of you.

288
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:52,138
-Because of me?
-That's right.

289
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,682
Judy was trapped in the ice because of me.

290
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:56,893
No one blames you for that.

291
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,478
I should have been able to swim down.

292
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:00,480
If I would've swam down
and gotten the battery,

293
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,897
everything would have been fine.

294
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:02,941
Enough.

295
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,028
We have plenty of problems to solve now
without rehashing the past.

296
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,675
-I didn't pass the test, did I?
-What test?

297
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,554
The stress test to get accepted
into the colony program.

298
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,640
I didn't pass.

299
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,769
No, you didn't.

300
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,147
Then how am I here?

301
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,652
You deserve to be at the colony.

302
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,279
There's no test
that could convince me otherwise.

303
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,573
But how am I here?

304
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,951
I pulled some strings.

305
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:01,374
-You did something wrong.
-No, not wrong.

306
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,046
Illegal. There's a big difference.

307
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,590
You would have been better off
if I'd stayed behind.

308
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,480
Can't you hit it any harder?

309
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,736
I know you, Maureen.

310
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:33,323
You didn't design this as a cage.

311
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:36,701
You designed this
to protect your children.

312
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:43,165
Yes. You would absolutely have built in
a way for them to get out.

313
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:49,381
"Jupiter Class Interplanetary Craft Manual
of Operations."

314
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,884
I may have skipped orientation,
but I am a quick learner.

315
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,931
If you make yourself throw up,

316
00:25:58,013 --> 00:26:00,349
you're gonna have a bigger problem
than blindness.

317
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,979
It's not working anyway.

318
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:09,984
So let me guess, we're down to what?
One hour of air?

319
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,570
There's not enough time for me
to try every combination of wires.

320
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:14,990
I need your eyes, Don.

321
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:20,244
Hey, seriously though,

322
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,124
the thought of dying
doesn't make you feel sad?

323
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,959
Don't you have any regrets?

324
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,877
I don't believe in looking back.
That's how you crash into things.

325
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:35,926
There was a time all I ever thought about
was the things I never did.

326
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:42,517
Birthday card I forgot to mail.
Birthday card I forgot to buy.

327
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,732
Birthdays... just came and went.

328
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,156
But then, I came to realize

329
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,994
it was all the days in between
I was really missing out on.

330
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:06,458
Breakfast before school,
driving carpool to soccer practice,

331
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,211
skinned knees that I was never there
to put Band-Aids on...

332
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:16,675
Regular days.
Yeah, that's what really mattered.

333
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,474
I had three great kids
that I thought I'd lost forever.

334
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:27,729
But you know, crashing on this planet
is the best thing that ever happened to me

335
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,147
because it helped me find them again.

336
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:37,822
I love Penny 'cause she gives me lip.

337
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,992
But she tries harder
than anyone will ever give her credit for.

338
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:47,374
I love Will 'cause
he sees things that I can't see.

339
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,334
Anyway, he's smarter than I am.

340
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:54,547
I love Judy 'cause even though
I'm not her biological dad,

341
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,092
she's exactly like me.

342
00:27:57,174 --> 00:28:00,761
I mean, she's strong, fearless.

343
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,474
Ah. Maybe I just wish I was more like her.

344
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,647
Hey.

345
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,236
I wish I'd had a father like you.

346
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,117
Why don't you quit blubbering
and get our signal fire lit, huh?

347
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,624
-What the hell did you do here?
-Yeah, sorry about that.

348
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,835
Give me a minute.

349
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,093
-Hang on to something.
-Yeah? Why?

350
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,679
We might blow up.

351
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:45,181
Whoa!

352
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,017
I'm picking up something hot.

353
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,311
-You girls ready with the harpoon?
-Ready.

354
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:17,463
I see them!

355
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,843
Hey. Nice hydrazine fire you've got there.

356
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:24,345
Hey! I knew you'd find us.

357
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,637
It was a group effort.

358
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,182
Say hi to the group.

359
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,348
Hi, there.

360
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,934
-Dad?
-Dad.

361
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,854
- Hey, Dad.
- Dad. Hi, Dad!

362
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,064
You're not allowed to
do that to us again, okay?

363
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,483
I knew you'd be fine.

364
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,527
Um...

365
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,403
Hey, everybody.

366
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,784
-Are you... Were you crying?
-No. Maybe. I mean--

367
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:47,242
- Tears of joy.
- Yeah.

368
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:48,827
So what happened?

369
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,038
Where to begin?

370
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,750
Let's just get you out of the cold.

371
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,886
-We close enough?
-Almost in range.

372
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,388
Target in range in 30 seconds.

373
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,224
Listen.

374
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,354
When did the pounding stop?

375
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,065
Target in range

376
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,482
-in 20 seconds.
-Come on, come on.

377
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,704
Eight, seven, six...

378
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,835
- Target out of range.
-We gotta run.

379
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,301
It doesn't reach.

380
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,806
Hey, Maureen! Maureen!

381
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,809
You stabbed me in the back, Maureen.

382
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,815
Our fuel's gone.

383
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:02,192
The  Resolute's  gone.

384
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:09,075
I'm stuck here,
drifting nowhere till I die.

385
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,788
Hey, Maureen!
You missed.

386
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,458
And all because of you.

387
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,259
You and your family.

388
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,616
Come on.

389
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,089
- Hurry.
- Hey.

390
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:07,674
- What happened?
- Get in the Chariot.

391
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,676
What do you mean? What's going on?

392
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,220
- It got out.
- What?

393
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,474
-Mom?
-Get in now.

394
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,563
Seal the doors.
It'll maintain pressure long enough.

395
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,023
-Mom, we can help you.
-Stay in there!

396
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,613
Hey, where's Will?

397
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,417
No, get out of there! No! Will! Hide!

398
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:47,714
You know who I am. It's me.

399
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,637
- It's Will Robinson.
- What do we do?

400
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,061
And we're friends.

401
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,030
No!

402
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,124
Get away from my kids!

403
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,962
Go! Tie yourself onto there.

404
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:35,471
-Hold on tight. Okay?
-Yeah.

405
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:56,366
No! No! No!

406
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,554
Air pressure stabilized.

407
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:24,853
Maybe I can jump for it.

408
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,940
No, wait! Look.

409
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,121
What the hell is that?

410
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:51,338
-Did the seals hold?
-Yeah.

411
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,173
Yeah. Yeah, Mom. They held.

412
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:11,025
What is that?

413
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:34,632
Judy!

414
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:52,983
-Why is it pointing at us?
-Go!

415
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,735
You stay away from them!

416
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,951
- Mom!
- Mom!

417
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,157
I knew it was still you.

418
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:26,284
Friends, Will Robinson.

419
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,456
Yeah. Yeah, friends.

420
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,644
Ship's oxygen loss
will reach critical levels

421
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:36,646
-in T-minus two minutes.
-Mom.

422
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,900
-Will, are you okay?
-Yeah, I will be.

423
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:47,365
Mom, Will!

424
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,619
There's a crack in the glass.
We're losing air.

425
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:53,706
It's not gonna hold.

426
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:58,585
- The ramp won't close.
- The hydraulics are damaged.

427
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,088
Okay.

428
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,340
There's a manual crank outside.

429
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,552
Will, you can't.

430
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,514
-I have to.
-Will, you can't!

431
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:17,271
What good is protecting me my whole life

432
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,567
if I can't grow up to protect you?

433
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,409
You be careful.

434
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:41,396
Once I shut the door,
I'll climb over to the rear airlock.

435
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,481
That's a long climb.

436
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,900
He knows.

437
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,070
It's gonna work.

438
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,635
Oxygen loss evaded.

439
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:13,929
You did it.

440
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,851
I did do it, didn't I?

441
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,398
I'll be waiting for you at the hatch.

442
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,306
No! No!

443
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,726
Will, are you okay?

444
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,900
Will?

445
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:25,125
-Dad!
-I gotcha. I gotcha, buddy.

446
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,255
Come on. Let's go home.

447
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,726
I think it's kind of cool.

448
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:48,315
I have a scar too, buddy.
Wraps all the way from my waist--

449
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,233
-All right. No. Uh-uh.
-No!

450
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,360
Seventeen stitches.

451
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:54,362
Used my best bottle of whiskey
to clean it up.

452
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:56,614
- I was passed out.
- Story time is over now.

453
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,284
Blood everywhere. No, listen to me.

454
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:15,509
There's no sign of the  Resolute.

455
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,639
They're long gone. We're on our own.

456
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,393
At least we're all together.

457
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:28,230
We almost weren't.

458
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,275
-If you hadn't caught Will--
-I wouldn't have been able to

459
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,070
if you hadn't shot the harpoon
the second time.

460
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,199
Second time?

461
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:02,764
Why did you do that?

462
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:11,148
Do what?

463
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:14,818
Shoot the harpoon again
so John could climb back on the ship.

464
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:20,907
Because I was sorry.

465
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,081
I still am. About everything.

466
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,041
Are you, really?

467
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,838
I said it 'cause
it was the right thing to say.

468
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,800
It's what I do.

469
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:44,181
There's no way I'm letting you out again.

470
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,777
We'll see.

471
00:45:19,132 --> 00:45:22,177
So, what are our options?

472
00:45:26,472 --> 00:45:30,518
If we ration our supplies,
we could maybe survive long enough

473
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:34,523
for the heat to subside
and we could land again.

474
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:39,570
Land back down there?

475
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:43,614
It would actually be more of a crash.

476
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,340
Maureen.

477
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,268
It's the  Resolute !

478
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,860
Robinsons, Jupiter 2,
you are clear to dock.

479
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,527
You waited for us.

480
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:26,867
John, I represent every member
of this colonist group, even you.

481
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:32,498
Victor...

482
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,458
thank you.

483
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,043
You're welcome.

484
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:40,297
Sir, we're near the orbit--

485
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,673
Quickly, please.
We've stayed longer than we should.

486
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,427
Actually, we're out of fuel.

487
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,804
Hold tight. We'll come to you.

488
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,952
It's the noise the robot's ship
was making.

489
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:13,371
So why is our ship making it?

490
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:35,476
What's going on?
Why... Why are we turning around?

491
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,981
Jupiter 2, is everything okay?

492
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,360
I don't know.
It's like we lost control of the ship.

493
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,239
- Wait, where are we now?
- I have no idea.

494
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,704
I do.

495
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:45,130
I think we're here.

496
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:47,507
Where's "here"?

497
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:57,476
Danger.
