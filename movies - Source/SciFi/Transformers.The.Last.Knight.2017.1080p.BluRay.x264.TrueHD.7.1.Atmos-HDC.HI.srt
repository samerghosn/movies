(SHRIEKING)

2576
02:21:21,556 --> 02:21:23,891
HOUND: Oh, we're going weightless.
Weightless!

2577
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:30,565
- CADE: Grab my hand.
- Yes!

2578
02:21:40,825 --> 02:21:42,284
Don't let it go!

2579
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,835
OPTIMUS: Quintessa, get off our planet!

2580
02:21:51,585 --> 02:21:53,422

2582
02:21:56,591 --> 02:21:58,801
Say hello to my friend,

2583
02:21:59,468 --> 02:22:01,430
Bumblebee.

2584
02:22:07,352 --> 02:22:09,603
Sting like a bee.

2585
02:22:11,605 --> 02:22:13,149
(GRUNTS)

2586
02:22:19,448 --> 02:22:21,365
(ALL CHEERING)

2587
02:22:27,371 --> 02:22:28,998

(BOTH YELLING)

2589
02:22:35,129 --> 02:22:36,465
I stop the time.

2590
02:23:33,313 --> 02:23:35,022
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

2591
02:23:44,907 --> 02:23:46,743
Is it tomorrow yet?

2592
02:23:51,497 --> 02:23:54,000
<i>OPTIMUS: At the heart of every legend,</i>

2593
02:23:54,459 --> 02:23:56,128
<i>there is truth.</i>

2594
02:23:58,046 --> 02:24:00,549
<i>A few brave souls unite</i>

2595
02:24:01,466 --> 02:24:03,551
<i>to save their worlds.</i>

<i>We can be heroes in our own lives,</i>

2597
02:24:08,722 --> 02:24:10,015
<i>every one of us,</i>

2598
02:24:10,391 --> 02:24:14,478
<i>if we only have the courage to try.</i>

2599
02:24:15,229 --> 02:24:17,273
You saved Prime.

2600
02:24:18,566 --> 02:24:21,778
<i>OPTIMUS: Our fates
were always intertwined.</i>

2601
02:24:22,236 --> 02:24:26,740
<i>But now our worlds are joined as one.</i>

2602
02:24:27,533 --> 02:24:29,786
<i>We need to repair our planets.</i>

2603
02:24:30,662 --> 02:24:32,246
<i>Work together...</i>

2604
02:24:32,329 --> 02:24:34,958
<i>If we wish to survive.</i>

2605
02:24:36,041 --> 02:24:37,752
Crazy family, huh?

2606
02:24:37,835 --> 02:24:38,920
(CHUCKLES)

2607
02:24:39,921 --> 02:24:42,424
You did good, bro. Real good.

<i>OPTIMUS: A dangerous secret
is buried deep inside the Earth.</i>

2609

<i>There is more to this planet
than meets the eye.</i>

2610
02:24:55,395 --> 02:24:57,689
<i>I am Optimus Prime,</i>

2611
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,941

<i>It is time</i>

2613
02:25:04,486 --> 02:25:06,488
<i>to come home.</i>

2614
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,250
Are you lost?

2615
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:03,337
I wouldn't do that.

2616
02:26:04,213 --> 02:26:06,006
Don't touch him.

2617
02:26:07,174 --> 02:26:08,843
He doesn't like it.

2618
02:26:09,551 --> 02:26:11,179
Who doesn't like what?

2619
02:26:12,596 --> 02:26:14,182
Unicron.

2620
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:17,519
But I could show you how to kill him.
