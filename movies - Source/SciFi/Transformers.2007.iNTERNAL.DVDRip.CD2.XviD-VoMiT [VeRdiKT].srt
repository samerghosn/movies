1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:06,021
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

2
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:10,821
It's a bad dream.

3
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,458
Are you username LadiesMan217?

4
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:15,724
I don't know what you're talking about!

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:18,198
Are you username LadiesMan217?

6
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:19,427
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:21,969
Where is eBay item 21153?

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:23,766
Where are the glasses?

9
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,613
Get back!

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,487
Stop!

11
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,591
God!

12
00:00:43,492 --> 00:00:45,255
What is your problem, Sam?

13
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,352
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

14
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:51,900
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

15
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:00,599
Sam, what is that thing?

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,075
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

17
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,271
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,749
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

19
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:21,694
Go, go, go, go!

20
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,099
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

21
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:29,762
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

22
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:32,170
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

23
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:34,207
Oh, my God! No!

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,607
We're gonna die!

25
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,016
Oh, my God!

26
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:01,562
We're locked in.

27
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,509
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

28
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,508
Okay.

29
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:17,551
Time to start.

30
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,214
He's got me! Oh, God!

31
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,624
He's going to kill me!

32
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,425
No. No, no, no!

33
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,207
Get off!

34
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:07,886
Kill it! Kill it!

35
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,555
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

36
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,373
Not so tough without a head, are you?

37
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:25,779
Here, come on.

38
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,096
What is it?

39
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,932
It's a robot.

40
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:47,632
But like a...

41
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,262
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

42
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,074
It's probably Japanese.

43
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,576
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

44
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,875
What are you doing?

45
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,679
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

46
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:06,084
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

47
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:09,589
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,123
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

49
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,721
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

50
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,364
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

51
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,031
- Can you talk?
- <i>XM Satellite Radio...</i>

52
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,700
<i>Digital cable brings you...</i>
<i>... Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

53
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,572
So you... You talk through the radio?

54
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:31,578
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.</i>
<i>You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

55
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,671
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

56
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,249
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

57
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,410
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness</i>
<i>of space...</i>

58
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,488
<i>Angels will rain down</i>
<i>like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

59
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,715
Visitors from heaven? What...

60
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,951
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

61
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,256
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

62
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,096
He wants us to get in the car.

63
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,605
And go where?

64
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,370
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

65
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,569
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

66
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,771
This car's a pretty good driver.

67
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,037
I know.

68
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,682
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

69
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,977
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

70
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,143
Yeah.

71
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,055
You're right.

72
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,560
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

73
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:56,494
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

74
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,966
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

75
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,627
- Yeah.
- Okay.

76
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:06,097
There, see? That's better.

77
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:07,807
- Okay.
- Okay.

78
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:14,880
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

79
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,918
Thank you.

80
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:20,114
You know what I don't understand?

81
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,282
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

82
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:25,986
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

83
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:28,726
Whoa! Whoa!

84
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,595
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

85
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,758
Move it, you moron!

86
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,893
Great, now... See?

87
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:37,431
Fantastic.

88
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,404
Now you pissed him off.

89
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,175
That car is sensitive.

90
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:43,472
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

91
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,717
What?

92
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,855
This is you...

93
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,896
Oh, my God!

94
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,834
Come on, let's go.

95
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,943
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

96
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,507
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than <i>Armageddon.</i> I swear to God!

97
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,847
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

98
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,462
Whoa! Sweet!

99
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,697
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

100
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,068
'cause he is so boned!

101
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,309
What is that?

102
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,438
There's something in the tree, dude.

103
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,675
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

104
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,115
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

105
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,011
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

106
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,624
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

107
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,218
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

108
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:24,954
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

109
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,596
They know your name.

110
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:27,891
They know your name.

111
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,797
Yeah.

112
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:32,332
My name is Optimus Prime.

113
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:36,495
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

114
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,972
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

115
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:45,442
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

116
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:49,074
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

117
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:51,516
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

118
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,215
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

119
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,193
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

120
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:03,656
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

121
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:06,996
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

122
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,397
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

123
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:14,635
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

124
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:20,378
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

125
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,277
Bumblebee, right?

126
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,079
<i>Check on the rep</i>
<i>Yep, second to none</i>

127
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,552
So you're my guardian, huh?

128
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,854
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

129
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,063
Why are you here?

130
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:43,399
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

131
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,172
Mega-what?

132
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,347
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,</i>
<i>peaceful and just,</i>

133
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:06,258
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,</i>
<i>leader of the Decepticons.</i>

134
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:10,627
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

135
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:16,830
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,</i>
<i>and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

136
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:23,802
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,</i>
<i>where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

137
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,675
My grandfather.

138
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,980
<i>It was an accident</i>
<i>that intertwined our fates.</i>

139
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,747
Come back!

140
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,853
I think the dogs have found something.

141
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,693
The ice is cracking!

142
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,101
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

143
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,836
I'm all right, lads!

144
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,643
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

145
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:15,122
<i>Megatron crash-landed</i>
<i>before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

146
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,158
Men! We've made a discovery!

147
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,673
<i>He accidentally activated</i>
<i>his navigation system.</i>

148
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:46,091
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location</i>
<i>on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

149
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:48,219
How'd you know about his glasses?

150
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,560
- EBay.
- EBay.

151
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,828
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

152
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:59,771
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

153
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,276
And the human race
will be extinguished.

154
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:08,839
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

155
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:15,022
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

156
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,396
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

157
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,488
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

158
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,861
Melted right through.

159
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:29,164
Hey, aren't sabots hot-Ioaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

160
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,499
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

161
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:33,801
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

162
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,201
- Heads up!
- Oh!

163
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:39,607
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

164
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,746
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

165
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,183
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

166
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,551
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

167
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,123
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

168
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:56,053
You want that piece?

169
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,459
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

170
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,623
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

171
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:05,065
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

172
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,729
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

173
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,306
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

174
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:14,242
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

175
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:15,505
It's me and you.

176
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,446
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

177
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,522
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

178
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,260
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

179
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,359
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

180
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,437
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

181
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:42,768
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

182
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:47,572
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

183
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:48,645
Okay, so what?

184
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:50,839
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

185
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,643
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

186
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,717
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

187
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:57,652
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

188
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:02,050
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

189
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,751
See? So can I go home now?

190
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:06,091
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

191
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:09,894
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

192
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:12,333
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

193
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:16,031
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

194
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,869
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

195
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,273
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

196
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,211
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky</i>
<i>ended up right behind...</i>

197
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:24,906
- What did he say?
- What?

198
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,483
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

199
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:29,144
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

200
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,652
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

201
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,858
<i>Still no official word as to</i>
<i>what happened. You can see...</i>

202
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,156
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- Call Sam.

203
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:40,821
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

204
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,228
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

205
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,858
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

206
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,596
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

207
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,309
I need you to stay here, all right?

208
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:54,571
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

209
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:55,646
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

210
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:56,735
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

211
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:57,814
Five minutes, all right?

212
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:01,485
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

213
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:03,553
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

214
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:05,281
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

215
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:07,687
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

216
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:11,455
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

217
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,120
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

218
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,097
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

219
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,760
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

220
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:19,961
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

221
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,538
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

222
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,106
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

223
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:24,572
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

224
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:25,903
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

225
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,910
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

226
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:31,880
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

227
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,348
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

228
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,419
The...

229
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,856
I love you. God, I love you

230
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:41,686
just so much right now.

231
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,225
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

232
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:44,851
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

233
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,793
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

234
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:48,262
because you're such a swell guy.

235
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,492
One more thing, huh?

236
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,660
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

237
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:54,864
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

238
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:58,270
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

239
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:01,243
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

240
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:03,779
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

241
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:05,849
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

242
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,783
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

243
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:14,047
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

244
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:18,151
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

245
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:21,829
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

246
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,958
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

247
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,833
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

248
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,736
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

249
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,810
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

250
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,105
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

251
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,373
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

252
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:40,678
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

253
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:43,481
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

254
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:49,153
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

255
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,750
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

256
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,419
That's all it is.

257
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,328
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

258
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,732
Okay, okay.

259
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,564
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

260
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:06,333
Autobots, recon.

261
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,873
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

262
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:12,744
Got some ice on his nose.

263
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,284
I had to slap him around a little bit.

264
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,751
You did not.

265
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:20,149
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

266
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,451
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

267
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,156
Come on, come on.

268
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:35,063
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

269
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:37,766
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

270
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,536
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

271
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:41,634
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

272
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:45,004
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

273
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,139
My glasses were in the bag.

274
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,081
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

275
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:49,743
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

276
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:50,912
So what I think you should do is
you should...

277
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,216
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

278
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:56,259
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

279
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,794
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

280
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,329
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

281
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:01,398
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

282
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,864
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

283
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,663
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

284
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,703
I'm already stressed out enough.

285
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,295
Okay. What now?

286
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:15,145
No. No, no. No, no, no.

287
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:19,205
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

288
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,305
Oh, God. Oh!

289
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:24,547
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed</i>
<i>right here and now it's gone.</i>

290
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,953
<i>My moped's under there, man!</i>
<i>Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

291
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,154
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

292
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:33,196
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

293
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,889
What? Oh, no, no, no.

294
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,057
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

295
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,394
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

296
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,492
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

297
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:41,070
My mother's got a temper, okay?

298
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,729
We must have the glasses.

299
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,398
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

300
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:46,738
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

301
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:47,936
Keep searching.

302
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:49,706
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

303
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:51,041
Ten minutes. Okay?

304
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:52,911
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

305
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:55,008
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

306
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,143
Calm down, calm down.

307
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:57,948
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

308
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:00,717
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

309
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,689
Good? Good? Okay.

310
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:03,953
- Move!
- Get away!

311
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:05,756
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

312
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:07,763
He wants us to be quiet.

313
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:15,402
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

314
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,206
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

315
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:19,369
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

316
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:21,307
How did you get over there so fast?

317
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,142
Wow! That was tingly!

318
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,649
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

319
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,514
- Sam?
- Sammy?

320
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:39,623
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

321
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:42,193
- Sam?
- That's weird.

322
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,028
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

323
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:46,694
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

324
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,862
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

325
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:49,872
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

326
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:51,134
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

327
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,299
How come the door's locked?

328
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,038
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

329
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,340
You know he'll start counting

330
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:58,847
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

331
00:23:58,949 --> 00:23:59,938
Oh, dear.

332
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,779
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

333
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,284
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

334
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:04,354
- Oh, my.
- Two.

335
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,514
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

336
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:10,687
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

337
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:13,786
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

338
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:15,489
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

339
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,829
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

340
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,800
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

341
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:21,700
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

342
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:23,295
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

343
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,669
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

344
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,800
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

345
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,275
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

346
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,401
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

347
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:30,878
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

348
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,448
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

349
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:33,982
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

350
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:36,450
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

351
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:41,013
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

352
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:43,951
- Judy.
- Was I...

353
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:45,028
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

354
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:46,460
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

355
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:47,587
That's not something for you
to bring up.

356
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:49,222
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

357
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,166
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

358
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:55,898
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

359
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:57,997
- Happy time?
...my special alone time...

360
00:24:58,108 --> 00:24:59,075
- Stop.
- Mom.

361
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:00,165
- Judy, stop.
...with myself.

362
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:01,301
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

363
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,710
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

364
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:05,839
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

365
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:07,712
Oh, parents.

366
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,417
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

367
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:16,117
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

368
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,495
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

369
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:18,859
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

370
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:19,951
Oh, I hate these.

371
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:21,326
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

372
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,456
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

373
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:24,090
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

374
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:25,532
Can't you take safety seriously?

375
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:28,901
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

376
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:31,907
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

377
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:40,506
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

378
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:43,108
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

379
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,450
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

380
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:47,251
Trashed. Gone.

381
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,025
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

382
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,151
The parents are very irritating.

383
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,956
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

384
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:55,793
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

385
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,093
What is with you?

386
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:00,534
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

387
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:02,298
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

388
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,806
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

389
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:06,705
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

390
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,742
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

391
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:13,945
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

392
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:16,918
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

393
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,080
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

394
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,680
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

395
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:22,952
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

396
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,643
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

397
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:45,738
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

398
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:46,816
I want you to distract my parents

399
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:49,215
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

400
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,719
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

401
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,853
We're the government. Sector Seven.

402
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:02,090
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

403
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,724
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

404
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:05,961
It's Witwicky.

405
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:09,300
May I enter the premises, sir?

406
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:12,341
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

407
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:13,409
What the heck is going on here?

408
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,637
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

409
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:18,010
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

410
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:19,548
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

411
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,708
That's right. National security.

412
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:22,410
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

413
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,885
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

414
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,785
Could you stay off the grass?

415
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,323
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

416
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,052
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

417
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,391
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

418
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:34,964
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

419
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:36,396
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

420
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,831
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

421
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:40,096
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

422
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:43,230
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

423
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,399
- No!
- What is this?

424
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:48,239
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

425
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:49,812
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

426
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:51,141
Whoa, way out of line.

427
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:55,275
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

428
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,285
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

429
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:58,445
You gonna try to get rough with us?

430
00:27:58,555 --> 00:27:59,749
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

431
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:02,052
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

432
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,855
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

433
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:08,921
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

434
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:11,262
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

435
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:13,928
I think direct contact.

436
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,934
- Son?
- Yeah.

437
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:24,913
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

438
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:32,154
Fourteen rads.

439
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:35,224
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

440
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,859
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

441
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:39,656
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

442
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:41,287
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

443
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,263
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

444
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:48,697
So,

445
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,598
LadiesMan217.

446
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,146
That is your eBay username, right?

447
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,579
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

448
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:00,650
What do you make of this?

449
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:03,311
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?</i>
<i>And my...</i>

450
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,546
Is that you?

451
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,850
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

452
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:11,792
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

453
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,462
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

454
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:20,025
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

455
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:22,264
- Really?
...from me, from my home,

456
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:25,341
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

457
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,171
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

458
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:30,713
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

459
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,442
That's funny. That is so funny.

460
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:38,043
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

461
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:41,986
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, <i>E. T.?</i> No.

462
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:43,582
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

463
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:44,820
You see this?

464
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:47,522
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

465
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:50,395
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

466
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,728
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

467
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:54,235
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

468
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:57,398
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

469
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,600
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

470
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,109
What? Parole?

471
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,544
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

472
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:06,639
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

473
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,479
Well, they... They weren't always his.

474
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:09,677
You stole cars?

475
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:11,481
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

476
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:13,385
so sometimes he had to take me along.

477
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,788
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

478
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:18,520
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

479
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:24,293
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

480
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:26,699
It is time to talk!

481
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:34,876
Big! It's big!

482
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,584
Go, go, go, go!

483
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,647
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

484
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,188
All right! All right!

485
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:03,069
You A-holes are in trouble now.

486
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:09,703
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

487
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:15,714
Taking the children was a bad move.

488
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:19,220
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

489
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:24,555
Freeze!

490
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:26,594
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

491
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:27,754
Whoa!

492
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,257
Whoa!

493
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:42,375
Hi, there.

494
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,412
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

495
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:53,055
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

496
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:54,954
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

497
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,288
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

498
00:31:57,394 --> 00:31:59,988
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

499
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,756
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

500
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,355
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

501
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:06,834
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

502
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:10,429
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

503
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,064
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

504
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:13,164
How you doing?

505
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:15,005
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

506
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:17,273
- Yeah.
- This is real.

507
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,543
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

508
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,416
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

509
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:29,185
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

510
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,421
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

511
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:35,396
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

512
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,990
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

513
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:40,331
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

514
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:42,428
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

515
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,404
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

516
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,237
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

517
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:49,176
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

518
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,476
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

519
00:32:57,754 --> 00:32:58,721
Hey!

520
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:01,757
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

521
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,917
Get that thing to stop, huh?

522
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:08,561
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

523
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:11,361
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

524
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,433
For threatening my dad.

525
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:23,412
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

526
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:26,843
You're a criminal.

527
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:30,315
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

528
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:34,621
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

529
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:35,713
All right.

530
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:37,918
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

531
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:41,863
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

532
00:33:41,998 --> 00:33:44,159
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

533
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,529
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

534
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:50,072
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

535
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,547
Optimus! Incoming!

536
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:07,484
Roll out.

537
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:17,730
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings</i>
<i>under that bridge right down there.</i>

538
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:24,005
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad</i>
<i>readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

539
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:25,438
Up you get.

540
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,114
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

541
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,746
<i>Really strong readings right down</i>
<i>below us. There he is.</i>

542
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:41,016
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

543
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,720
<i>That's it, right there.</i>
<i>Mark him, mark him.</i>

544
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:48,093
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.</i>
<i>Right off the nose.</i>

545
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:50,190
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

546
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:55,704
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

547
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,870
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

548
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:09,043
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.</i>
<i>Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

549
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:11,547
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

550
00:35:12,122 --> 00:35:14,113
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

551
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:38,337
Easy, you two.

552
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:50,955
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

553
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:54,620
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

554
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:57,924
- Hold on!
- No!

555
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:02,866
Sam!

556
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:11,606
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.</i>
<i>We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

557
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:12,977
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

558
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,516
Stop! Stop!

559
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,516
Wait! No!

560
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,484
- <i>Take the shot, get him.</i>
- <i>Take the shot.</i>

561
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,254
No!

562
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,437
No! Stop!

563
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:45,344
Stop!

564
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:49,385
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!</i>
<i>Get down!</i>

565
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:51,718
What? Okay.

566
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,751
Look, he's not fighting back!

567
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,554
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

568
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,492
Stop hurting him!

569
00:37:15,912 --> 00:37:17,607
Don't let him move!

570
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:19,906
I got him here!

571
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:44,164
No!

572
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:49,975
Happy to see me again?

573
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,211
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

574
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:03,149
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

575
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:13,598
Hang back. Let me check it out.

576
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,838
Optimus,

577
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:22,644
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

578
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:26,442
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

579
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:29,347
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

580
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:43,730
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

581
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:44,959
in the western Pacific.

582
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:47,263
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

583
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,134
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

584
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:57,344
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

585
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:58,778
of cruise missile range.

586
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:02,409
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

587
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,487
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

588
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,953
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

589
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:15,258
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

590
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,892
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

591
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:27,203
Sit rep! Talk to me!

592
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,710
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

593
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,473
The virus was coded to shut us down.

594
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,015
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

595
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:36,018
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

596
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,111
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

597
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:40,314
The blackout's global.

598
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:43,256
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

599
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,887
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

600
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:58,136
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

601
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:02,509
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

602
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:07,140
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

603
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,343
you won't understand right away.

604
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:12,785
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

605
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:16,290
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

606
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,256
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

607
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:26,631
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

608
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:29,503
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

609
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:32,631
This was classified above top secret.

610
00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:50,252
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

611
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,988
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

612
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:56,356
This is the image from Mars.

613
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,964
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

614
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,832
from the base attack.

615
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:05,699
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

616
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:09,340
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

617
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:12,408
Are we talking about an invasion?

618
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:15,609
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

619
00:41:15,718 --> 00:41:19,051
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

620
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:20,884
That's why the virus shut us down,

621
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,289
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

622
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:28,888
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

623
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:35,101
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

624
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:38,605
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

625
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:42,041
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

626
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:45,114
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

627
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:58,589
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

628
00:41:58,695 --> 00:41:59,662
Let's go!

629
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:06,191
She's in here.

630
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:08,230
What's going on?

631
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:10,602
You're coming with me.

632
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,736
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

633
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:16,075
Who's this?

634
00:42:16,846 --> 00:42:19,940
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

635
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,718
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

636
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:39,063
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

637
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,135
Wow.

638
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:41,929
Who knew?

639
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,621
Make a hole! Watch your back!

640
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:14,164
Please, let this work.

641
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:17,471
Fire it up, Optimus.

642
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,931
The code.

643
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:25,446
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

644
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,050
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

645
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:33,984
They must know it's here, as well.

646
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,421
What about Bumblebee?

647
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:39,586
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

648
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:43,688
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

649
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,032
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

650
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:51,072
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

651
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:55,842
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

652
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:00,172
Were we so different?

653
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:05,452
<i>They're a young species.</i>
<i>They have much to learn.</i>

654
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:08,353
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

655
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:12,621
<i>Freedom is the right of</i>
<i>all sentient beings.</i>

656
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:16,960
<i>You all know there's only one way</i>
<i>to end this war.</i>

657
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:19,762
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

658
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:25,132
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

659
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:26,572
That's suicide.

660
00:44:26,676 --> 00:44:30,476
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

661
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,040
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

662
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:38,450
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

663
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:42,618
It's been an honor serving with you all.

664
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:46,525
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

665
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:01,737
Team attention! Present arms!

666
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:06,643
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

667
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:08,444
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

668
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,678
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

669
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:12,048
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

670
00:45:12,154 --> 00:45:15,248
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

671
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:17,987
Hey, kid.

672
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:21,723
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

673
00:45:22,265 --> 00:45:23,357
You must be hungry?

674
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:25,457
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

675
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:27,195
Where's my car?

676
00:45:27,303 --> 00:45:30,864
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

677
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:33,069
People can die here.

678
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:36,138
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

679
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:37,439
Okay.

680
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:41,277
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

681
00:45:41,384 --> 00:45:46,083
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

682
00:45:47,723 --> 00:45:50,692
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

683
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:52,090
Thank you.

684
00:45:53,562 --> 00:45:55,291
The man's an extortionist.

685
00:45:57,033 --> 00:45:58,364
All right, here's the situation.

686
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,867
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

687
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,062
NBEs?

688
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:05,766
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

689
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:09,504
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

690
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:19,255
Dear God. What is this?

691
00:46:19,255 --> 00:46:20,517
Dear God. What is this?

692
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:25,356
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

693
00:46:25,461 --> 00:46:28,897
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

694
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:32,991
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

695
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:36,367
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

696
00:46:36,472 --> 00:46:38,872
We call him NBE One.

697
00:46:38,975 --> 00:46:41,341
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

698
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:43,844
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

699
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:46,945
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

700
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:50,382
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

701
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:53,944
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

702
00:46:54,056 --> 00:46:55,489
in the history of mankind.

703
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:58,526
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

704
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:05,465
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

705
00:47:05,568 --> 00:47:09,368
NBE One. That's what we call it.

706
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:12,567
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

707
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:15,041
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

708
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:19,137
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

709
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:21,113
Well, you got one now.

710
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:24,451
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

711
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:26,077
All Spark? What is that?

712
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:28,748
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-Iooking thing.

713
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:33,625
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

714
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:36,163
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

715
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:39,359
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

716
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:40,992
That's their plan.

717
00:47:41,103 --> 00:47:43,503
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

718
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:48,105
You guys know where it is, don't you?

719
00:47:49,545 --> 00:47:50,671
Follow me.

720
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:56,807
You're about to see our crown jewel.

721
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:09,322
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

722
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:13,861
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

723
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:18,571
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

724
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:20,198
as well as NBE One.

725
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:22,869
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

726
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:25,344
Four football fields thick of concrete.

727
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:28,781
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

728
00:48:28,884 --> 00:48:32,479
or any alien species on the outside.

729
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:15,093
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

730
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,222
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

731
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:25,672
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

732
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,241
Oh, wow.

733
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:35,374
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

734
00:49:35,484 --> 00:49:36,678
Oh, no, man.

735
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:41,279
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

736
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,325
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

737
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:48,887
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

738
00:49:48,998 --> 00:49:50,431
I got a phone.

739
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:56,230
Nokias are real nasty.

740
00:49:56,338 --> 00:50:00,775
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

741
00:50:01,577 --> 00:50:03,704
Nokia's from Finland.

742
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:08,374
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

743
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:16,716
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

744
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:33,705
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

745
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:37,472
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

746
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,355
He's breaking the box.

747
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:09,470
Go! Go! Go!

748
00:51:09,578 --> 00:51:10,670
Move!

749
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:21,849
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

750
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,956
Banachek. What's going on?

751
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:25,890
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...
