1
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:33,587
"I want to go to Mars.

2
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:38,703
"Not just to visit. I want to live there.

3
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:40,539
"Because then
I'd be living proof

4
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:43,858
"that life on
Mars was possible.

5
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:47,019
"Proof that
if we had to,

6
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:50,861
"mankind could make
a fresh start.

7
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,778
"We're in trouble,
and it's our fault.

8
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:59,941
"And we're running out of time
and Mother Nature doesn't negotiate.

9
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:03,296
"We can't give up. Not now.

10
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:08,620
"Mars is a planet ripe
and ready for life.

11
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:11,580
"Earth's resources
may be depleted,

12
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:16,216
"but there's one resource
we must never neglect.

13
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:18,896
"It's the most valuable

14
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,097
"and it's the one
without limits.

15
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:26,859
"Courage. "

16
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,176
I wrote those words...

17
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,899
I wrote those words
when I was 12 years old.

18
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:44,182
My letter to the White House.

19
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,902
Never did I imagine
the president

20
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,741
would read them aloud
to a nation

21
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,094
mourning the loss of yet
another crew of astronauts.

22
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,574
Never did I dream

23
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:57,340
that I would be proclaimed
an "Emblem of Fortitude, "

24
00:02:57,412 --> 00:03:00,973
a "Young Man with
a Singular Vision. "

25
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,981
And the rest is, well...

26
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,171
It's not history.

27
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,860
Just the beginning.

28
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:14,614
So, here we all are.

29
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,933
Thanks to Genesis
Space Technologies,

30
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,141
in 20 hours the Magellan-61
will travel six astronauts
to Mars,

31
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,860
not to visit,
but to live there.

32
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:28,218
The first true
citizens of Mars!

33
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:35,177
From a childhood vision
to the greatest space endeavor

34
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,616
the world has ever attempted,

35
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:40,531
the settlement known
as East Texas, Mars.

36
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,061
Come on, say it with me.

37
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,531
Just add water!

38
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,691
Yes!

39
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,890
Well, whatever I am,

40
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:05,578
I cannot begin to compare
to these six heroes,

41
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,811
living examples of
courage without limits.

42
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:12,889
And on that note,

43
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,093
I would like to
hand things off

44
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,170
to the mission head
of this historic expedition,

45
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,334
Lead Astronaut Sarah Elliot.

46
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:46,011
Sorry if we only have time
for a couple of questions.

47
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,096
You know what it's like
the night before a trip.

48
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,536
Scott Hubbard,
Aerospace Times.

49
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:53,608
Miss Elliot,

50
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:58,528
how does it feel to sacrifice
the next four years of
your life to Mars?

51
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:02,728
It's not a sacrifice.
It's an opportunity.

52
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:09,213
I feel humbled,
excited, and grateful for
the chance to be a pioneer.

53
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:20,372
Miss Elliot,
aren't you scared,

54
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,812
given the history,
given the dangers?

55
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:24,766
Of course.

56
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,615
I'm scared that I might let
the mission down in some way.

57
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:36,209
I was taught that people who
took risks without fear were brave.

58
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,567
Well, far braver are
those that take risks
despite their fear.

59
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:44,329
Courage is fear that has said its prayers.

60
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,285
T minus ten.

61
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,286
Nine. Eight.

62
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:32,808
Seven. Six.

63
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,808
Five. Four.

64
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,564
Three. Two.

65
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,889
One. Zero.

66
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,363
Ignition.

67
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,213
Liftoff.

68
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:55,526
Liftoff for Magellan-61 .

69
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,524
Stand by for docking
to Mars transfer vehicle.

70
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,451
Magellan speed is good.

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,685
Watch your drift, Sarah.

72
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,201
Contact.

73
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:44,887
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet.

74
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,771
Manual capture is confirmed.

75
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,043
Let's go to Mars!
Let's go to Mars!

76
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,599
You okay?

77
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:53,999
Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,918
Sarah, can I have a word?

79
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:00,643
What's up?

80
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:04,881
Show it to me.

81
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,356
We can't just turn
the mission around,
correct?

82
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,642
Doctor,
how's she doing, anyway?

83
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,081
You mean, aside
from being mortified?

84
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:24,123
She's fine.

85
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,960
Oh, this is a disaster.

86
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,403
Nathaniel, she's due
shortly after they arrive.

87
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,485
We need to get out
in front of this.

88
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,125
An astronaut
behaved irresponsibly

89
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:34,886
and NASA will make
a decision what to do
as soon as the baby's born.

90
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:36,686
Decision about what?

91
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:38,957
About when to bring them back.

92
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,879
Tom, there's
a bigger issue here.

93
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:47,683
Subjecting a fetus
to zero gravity during
its entire gestation. . .

94
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,241
It's uncharted territory.

95
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:00,076
We do not go to press.

96
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:01,839
We keep
this internal for now.

97
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,076
We need to gather
more information.

98
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,235
What are you saying?

99
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,595
I'm saying,
we go short-term contingency.

100
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,756
We have Dr. Loh deliver
the baby on Mars.

101
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:12,442
We keep this quiet.
We wait this out.

102
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,200
Sarah may have
behaved irresponsibly,

103
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,923
but she's no longer
just an astronaut

104
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:20,236
and it's not just
a Genesis decision.

105
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:24,724
She's a mother now.

106
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:29,604
It's her decision, too.

107
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:25,312
Big, deep breath. Push, push, push!

108
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,313
Good. All right, big, deep breath.
Here we go.

109
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,440
And, push, push ! Good.

110
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,434
Okay, good. Good job, Sarah.

111
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,672
Keep breathing.

112
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,990
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

113
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,356
One final push !

114
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,796
Come on,
come on, big, deep breath.

115
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:46,601
Is he okay?

116
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,991
Well done.

117
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,190
He looks great.

118
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,039
Sarah. Sarah?

119
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:18,235
Sarah?
Her heart rate is dropping.

120
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,389
Hey, something's wrong !

121
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:20,788
It's postpartum preeclampsia.

122
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:22,633
Push two milligrams of lorazepam, stat.

123
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,472
Take it easy. Take him.

124
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:25,960
You got him? You got him?

125
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,629
Sarah, breathe.

126
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:36,394
She's still not responding.
Give her 20 milligrams of. . .

127
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,190
Hurry, she's coding.

128
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,308
Come on, Sarah, breathe.

129
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:54,749
How long?

130
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:56,352
30 minutes
without a heartbeat.

131
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:59,351
Stop. Stop.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

132
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:01,509
She's gone. She's gone.

133
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:03,589
She's gone.

134
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:29,951
Mr. Shepherd, are you there?

135
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:33,355
We lost her.

136
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:05,673
Okay. Here's what we know.

137
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:09,307
Two-thirds less gravity
will alter the child's
internal organs.

138
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:13,514
The heart will
simply not be conditioned
to have the strength to pump

139
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,229
in the Earth's gravity.

140
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:18,354
Bones will be brittle,
probably oversized.

141
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:19,989
The child would
never survive the trip
back to Earth.

142
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:22,835
Yeah, but, Nathaniel,
in the eyes of the world,

143
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,475
isn't this whole mission,
East Texas, an experiment?

144
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,945
And wouldn't we be forgiven?
Experiment?

145
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:32,586
Tom, this isn't a mouse.
This is not a monkey.

146
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:33,825
This is a human being.

147
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:35,024
And in the eyes of the world,

148
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,952
the lead astronaut of
the Genesis Mars Mission

149
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:40,426
not only got pregnant,
but died in childbirth,

150
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,870
sentencing a baby to a motherless
existence in outer space.

151
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,788
Imagine the bloody outcry.

152
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:51,551
East Texas runs on money,
science, good faith,

153
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:54,182
and above all, good PR.

154
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:55,868
We're not only talking
about a secret,

155
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,354
we're talking
about a cover-up.

156
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:00,264
It will bring
the company down.

157
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,703
Unless.

158
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,991
Unless what?

159
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,951
Unless we don't cover up,
we take full responsibility.

160
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,511
We face it head-on.

161
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,033
Tom,

162
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:17,306
I wanna be on
the next mission.

163
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,712
As a passenger?
Yes.

164
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,989
Nathaniel, for the love of. . .
Oh, here we go.

165
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,222
No, actually, he's right.

166
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,628
There would be
no better show of support.

167
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:24,827
Thank you, Alice. Exactly.

168
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:26,232
You can imagine
their morale right now.

169
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,462
They've just
lost their leader.

170
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,465
Nathaniel,
it is out of the question.

171
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,032
And you know it.

172
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:35,903
Am I missing something here?

173
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,903
Doctor, will you
enlighten Alice, please?

174
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:40,381
Hydrocephalus.

175
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,152
We found it on
Mr. Shepherd's
very first medical.

176
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,423
A congenital brain disorder.
It's basically benign.

177
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:49,424
Benign unless he wants
to go into outer space,
and then nobody knows. . .

178
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,264
And what if I'm willing
to take that risk?

179
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,423
Sorry. Not happening.

180
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,261
So the child remains on Mars?

181
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,181
I don't. . .

182
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,750
We don't have a choice.

183
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,548
Say we come clean
and we lose our financing.

184
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,341
Say we give up
everything we fought for.

185
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,701
Say we bring everyone home.
You heard the doctor.

186
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,179
The child wouldn't
even make the trip.

187
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,748
Keeping this a secret
saves the company,

188
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:35,863
which saves East Texas,
which saves the child.

189
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,585
So the child
remains classified?

190
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:46,298
Yes.

191
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,138
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:51,823
Yes.

193
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:11,377
Can I bring your car around,
Mr. Shepherd?

194
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:37,021
Entering stratospheric flight.

195
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,542
Entering stratospheric flight.

196
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:42,936
Entering exospheric flight.

197
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,858
Entering exospheric flight.

198
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,537
Altitude limit.
Altitude limit.

199
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,699
- Approaching outer space.
- Yes!

200
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,857
Decrease velocity.
Danger. Over speed.

201
00:17:57,016 --> 00:18:00,701
Decrease velocity.
Danger. Danger.

202
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,499
All perish.

203
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,614
Ha! There you are.

204
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,375
Centaur,
can you make me a map?

205
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,377
And what is it you'd like
a map of, Gardner Elliot?

206
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,103
A pathway through
the ventilation system

207
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:13,772
from my quarters
to the storage facility
on East Texas.

208
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:15,933
And why would you
like that information?

209
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:17,942
That's none of your business.

210
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,739
It is my business.
I'm your best friend.

211
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:24,863
No. You're a machine
with rudimentary
artificial intelligence.

212
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:26,981
A machine which
I helped to build.

213
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,258
That hurts my feelings.

214
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:29,782
You don't have feelings.

215
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,622
I do have feelings.
I'm your best friend.

216
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:34,622
I'm your teacher.
I'm your homie.
Hug it out.

217
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,292
Get me a map of
the ventilation system.

218
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:40,101
Information classified.

219
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:41,892
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,981
No. I'm sorry.

221
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:46,894
Information classified.

222
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,461
Gardner, don't.

223
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:50,817
I'm your friend.
Gardner, stop.

224
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:53,815
Once upon a time,
deep in the 15-acre wood,

225
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,815
Frogsy found Owl
sitting on his doorstep.

226
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,497
The flood had
taken away his entire...

227
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,050
Centaur,
look who just bypassed

228
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,654
the East Texas infrastructure
firewall program.

229
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:15,851
Mission number.

230
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,455
We're running
out of time and...

231
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,180
''Mother Nature
doesn't negotiate.''

232
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,336
...doesn't negotiate.

233
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,173
Letter to the White House,
and he's 1 2 years old.
Blah, blah. . .

234
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,772
Sorry if we only have time...
Hey, Mom.

235
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:38,213
...for a couple of questions.

236
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,972
You know what it's like
the night before a trip.

237
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,374
To be continued.

238
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,459
Colony 52 Bravo,

239
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:56,893
report to
the automatic air lock.

240
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:01,048
Colony 52 Bravo, report to
the automatic air lock.

241
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,009
You're late.

242
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:11,576
Hey, Kendra.

243
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,412
Hey.
What's up?

244
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,057
Have you seen this? I mean. . .

245
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,536
Just, uh, so cool. I mean. . .

246
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,847
Works better if you turn it on.

247
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:20,887
Right.

248
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,814
The irrigator on 23 is blocked.

249
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,694
By the way, I can't reach Centaur.

250
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:28,577
What have you done with him this time?

251
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:30,087
Are you checking up on me?

252
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,248
Here you go, Kendra.
Thanks, Tony.

253
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,932
No. I'm checking up on Centaur.

254
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,577
Yeah, who checks up on me.

255
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:38,412
You don't fool me, Gardner Elliot.

256
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,574
You never have.

257
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:42,895
Okay. Uh, 23 should be clear.

258
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:45,686
Really?

259
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,086
Thanks a lot.

260
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,409
Here.
Thanks.

261
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,090
Okay, get on 1 7 now.

262
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,607
We'll make you
indispensable yet.

263
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:02,606
What?

264
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:05,576
How can I be indispensable
if no one knows I exist?

265
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:21,811
Okay.

266
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:31,923
Open.

267
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:35,202
Play.

268
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:40,011
Virtual visit.

269
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,608
Hey! Come on!

270
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:57,009
Come on. Come on. Come on.

271
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:00,202
Want it? Come get it,
get it! Go fetch!

272
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,049
You go fetch it!
Hey!

273
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,930
What would you do
without me?

274
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,250
I'm gonna miss you.

275
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,490
I'm gonna miss you, too.

276
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,763
Come on.

277
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,480
Replay.

278
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,240
Memo.

279
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,880
Print.

280
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,288
Centaur, some privacy.

281
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:58,759
Again? All you ever ask for
is privacy these days.

282
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,448
I remember a time
when you and I...

283
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:03,919
Where's the code?

284
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:24,242
Hey, Tulsa.

285
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,678
Say it with me.

286
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:30,959
Why?
Because misery loves company.

287
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:32,481
Why are you miserable?

288
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:35,800
Just dealing with
the basic people of
the school.

289
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:37,926
You know, everybody's
always frontin'.

290
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:39,323
Nobody's ever real,
you know?

291
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,402
Tell me about it.

292
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:47,926
Anyway, the second I turn 18,
I am so outta here.

293
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:49,156
Emancipation...

294
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:51,159
"Emancipation,
mobility, music. "

295
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,166
Are you making
fun of me, Gardner?

296
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:56,683
No, Tulsa. I just wish
I could go with you.

297
00:25:57,316 --> 00:26:00,000
You've been saying that
since last summer. And you can.

298
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:01,843
No, I can't.

299
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,998
Oh, right. You can't
leave your house.

300
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:07,442
It's not a house,
it's a penthouse
on Park Avenue.

301
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:10,520
I can't leave
because of my disease.

302
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:14,202
Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

303
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,517
Yeah.
Still don't believe you.

304
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:19,278
Wouldn’t your
foster dad be unhappy?

305
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:22,358
Yeah. No more checks
from the state.

306
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,757
Study lab is over. Gotta go.

307
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,439
See ya in
the funny papers.

308
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:29,356
What does that mean?
Hmm?

309
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,162
You always say that.
What does it mean?

310
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,444
I don't know,
I had a foster sister

311
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:36,038
in Oklahoma who used
to say it all the time.

312
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,557
Just a different way
of saying goodbye.

313
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:41,040
I like it.
Talk tomorrow?

314
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:45,563
I'm not going anywhere.

315
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:11,837
Where'd you get
this movie?

316
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:15,840
One of the German scientists
who was here last month
left it behind.

317
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:20,041
How do you know
what's going on?

318
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,078
Excuse me?

319
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:24,233
It's easy.

320
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,231
You see those men there?
They're angels.

321
00:27:27,432 --> 00:27:30,241
They look over the people
on Earth and make sure
they're okay.

322
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,002
You see that angel?
Mmm-hmm.

323
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:37,077
He's gonna fall
in love with her
and fall to Earth.

324
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:40,195
You're a romantic.

325
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:43,199
Then he won't be
an angel anymore.

326
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,276
He'll be just like her.

327
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,471
Hey, Tulsa,
give us a ride, you slut!

328
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,677
I got a Harley
you can ride.

329
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:40,319
Tulsa! Come here!

330
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:42,479
Come back here, you slut!

331
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:17,628
Hey, boy!

332
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:25,672
What up, Chuck?

333
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:27,871
Don't get up 'cause of me.

334
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:32,551
''Hey, honey, how was your day?
Make any new friends yet?''

335
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:36,108
Oh, you bet.
Boy, am I fighting them off.

336
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:39,317
I'm the most popular girl
in my class.

337
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,436
Hey, did you get Thursday's check yet?
'Cause I wouldn't want you. . .

338
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:43,554
Wait a second, it's Thursday!

339
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,709
Hey, hey, Chuck! Chuck, wake up!

340
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,152
You gotta do the Sanders farm.

341
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,387
Hey, come on,
come on, wake up.

342
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,354
Listen to me.
You have one single property.

343
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:55,237
It's pretty simple, all right?
1 5 minutes, tops.

344
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,355
Okay, the starter.

345
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:56,104
Let's try the brakes.
It doesn't have brakes.

346
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:58,872
All right.
Now check the sprays.

347
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:01,704
Check.

348
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,070
Not while I'm standing
behind the plane!

349
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,630
Okay, we are gonna
lose another property.

350
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,784
You do it.

351
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:08,943
What?

352
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:11,265
You can fly this thing.
You do it.

353
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:15,624
Awesome parenting.
Seriously.

354
00:31:15,782 --> 00:31:18,832
Risk my life for 1 90 bucks.

355
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,989
Good to know what
my life's worth to ya!

356
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,823
It's okay. I got ya.

357
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:48,750
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. I'm right here.

358
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:52,744
Are you insane?

359
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:55,185
Do you think
the exit protocol
doesn't apply to you?

360
00:32:55,858 --> 00:32:57,748
You could've caused
an atmospheric breach,

361
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,502
not to mention, died.

362
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:02,058
Nobody rides unaccompanied,
no matter who they are!

363
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:07,268
Gardner,
what's going on here?
This isn't like you.

364
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,864
You wouldn't understand.
My mother's out there.

365
00:33:10,018 --> 00:33:11,701
How did you get past
the electronic lock?

366
00:33:13,178 --> 00:33:16,421
Okay, that magnetic implant
is there to monitor
the growth of your organs,

367
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,182
not serve as a passkey.

368
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:19,863
And how did you even
learn how to do that?

369
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:23,342
Raised by scientists,
in a bubble.

370
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:42,218
Open.

371
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,740
That plaque for
your mother,

372
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:52,867
it's just a piece of
metal in the ground, okay?

373
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:56,541
Her ashes were spread
across the Pacific Ocean.

374
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,299
You deserve to know that.

375
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:04,221
She's not out there,
Gardner.

376
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:07,586
She's in you.

377
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:16,735
I don't like to go to
sleep with us in a fight.

378
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,101
We're not in a fight.

379
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:25,655
Okay.

380
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:03,016
This is how you greet
an old friend?

381
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,501
If he's unannounced, yes.

382
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:09,141
It's about the boy.

383
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:14,777
Mr. Shepherd,
you have no idea
how smart he is.

384
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:17,014
He's being denied connection.

385
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:19,693
Not to do this,
at this point...

386
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,297
I'm sorry,
but it would be inhumane.

387
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:24,853
Miss Wyndham, I'm touched by
your concern, I really am.

388
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:27,784
But none of this matters
if he can't survive.

389
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:29,702
We've been through this.

390
00:35:29,893 --> 00:35:32,976
For starters,
we would have to add carbon nanotubes

391
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,259
to strengthen
his bone density.

392
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,300
It's a very
complex procedure.

393
00:35:36,652 --> 00:35:39,222
It's too risky. I'm sorry.

394
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:41,811
Tom, I can't sign on to this.

395
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:45,498
With all due respect,
Nathaniel, I'm not asking.
I'm telling.

396
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:47,416
You've been gone
for 1 6 years.

397
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:48,572
You've dropped off
the face of the Earth.

398
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:49,938
Have you run this by NASA?

399
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:52,902
NASA has always felt
conflicted over this.

400
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:55,896
They wanna do
the right thing,
which this is.

401
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,862
They wanna bring
the boy home.

402
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:03,735
Look, this is our chance
to turn bad PR into good PR.

403
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:05,416
Wait a minute,
this has nothing
to do with PR.

404
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,811
I'm talking about
a boy's life.

405
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,931
Hang on, hang on.

406
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,253
Like it or not,
I'm still the founder.

407
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:14,097
Like it or not,
East Texas is still
my brainchild.

408
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:18,811
You know, you've got a lot
more faith in how the public
will respond than I do.

409
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,771
Gardner.

410
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:30,454
I have some news.

411
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:36,936
Guess what?

412
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,614
You're taking me
to Bora-Bora?

413
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,452
That was a joke.
As you were.

414
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:48,219
They may have found
a cure for my disease.

415
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:51,577
Okay, mine was closer
to the truth.

416
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:53,059
But mine is the truth.

417
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:57,135
It will involve
an operation.

418
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:59,652
And some physical therapy.

419
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,413
Pick it up,
pick it up, pick it up.

420
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:04,088
You got it. You got it.
Keep going. There you go.

421
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:05,579
Remember what
you're running for.

422
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:12,298
Assuming
all goes well,

423
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:14,333
I'm coming to see you.

424
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:18,728
Cool.
When is this happening?

425
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:20,494
In a few months.

426
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:22,291
There's a lot of
travel involved.

427
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:23,574
Well,
don't take forever.

428
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:26,128
Once foster care
spits me out, I'm gone.

429
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,331
See you in
the funny papers.

430
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:38,014
File 32,
human courtship.

431
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:42,289
Here we are.
Allow me, won't you?

432
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:44,768
Well, I guess
chivalry’s not entirely dead.

433
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,530
At least not in Nantucket.

434
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,336
At least not in Nantucket.

435
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:49,688
Repeat.

436
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:52,007
Here we are.
Here we are.

437
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:54,088
Allow me, won't you?
Allow me, won't you?

438
00:37:54,246 --> 00:37:55,612
Well, I guess
chivalry’s not entirely dead.

439
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:56,768
Chivalry's not entirely dead.

440
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,931
At least not in Nantucket.
At least not in Nantucket.

441
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:02,088
Bravo. Well done.

442
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:33,409
Are you gonna visit
your ex-husband?

443
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,567
I hacked into
the scientist records.

444
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,532
Aren't you the clever
computer stalker.

445
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:45,251
Why'd you get divorced?

446
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:49,731
Well, he changed
when we found out I
couldn't have children.

447
00:38:50,485 --> 00:38:53,726
Uh, did that make you sad,
that you couldn't have
children?

448
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:56,735
That's a tough one.

449
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:59,088
Meant I didn't have
to choose.

450
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:03,574
And, uh, motherhood
wasn't a dream I was
chasing at that time.

451
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,525
My father is somewhere
on that thing.

452
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:18,443
Earth.

453
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,606
We could go and find him.

454
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:22,925
We don't have
to tell him who I am.

455
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:24,851
I could just
see him, you know?

456
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:26,766
Maybe I could
ask for the time.

457
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:28,373
No one has to know.

458
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,206
Do you know
where he lives?

459
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,449
No.
His name?

460
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,043
Gardner, I promise,

461
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,773
I don't know
anything about him.
Nobody does.

462
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:46,804
How am I supposed
to act on Earth,
with the people?

463
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,726
Mr. Shepherd?

464
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,969
Your coffee.

465
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,199
Excuse me, sir.

466
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:06,123
Do you have
an appointment? Sir!

467
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,724
Tom !
Sir!

468
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,199
Tom !
Nathaniel.

469
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:10,360
Stop!

470
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:11,849
What are you doing here?

471
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:13,329
I'm here to meet him.

472
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,639
Impossible.

473
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:20,202
No. No, what's impossible
is shuttling back
and forth to Mars.

474
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,440
What's impossible
is building
our salvation there.

475
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:24,168
But I made
those things happen.

476
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,565
So don't tell me
what's impossible.

477
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:06,476
Gardner?
Gardner, how are you feeling?

478
00:43:06,594 --> 00:43:07,641
Water.

479
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,278
You okay?

480
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:11,275
It's water.

481
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:14,235
Are you thirsty?

482
00:43:14,753 --> 00:43:16,994
No. No, there's. . .
Let's get this back on.

483
00:43:17,153 --> 00:43:19,521
There's water everywhere.

484
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:24,282
All right.
I feel so heavy.

485
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:27,918
But light.
Is that normal?

486
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,360
I believe the term is "euphoria.''

487
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,121
Sorry about
the quarantine.

488
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:11,114
It's to protect you
from us, not us from you.

489
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:14,519
Same bubble, different planet.
Nothing's changed, has it?

490
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,195
Well, except that.

491
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:18,641
It's so blue.

492
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,717
And green.

493
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,880
There's so many colors.

494
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:28,074
I'm Nathaniel Shepherd.
How you doing?

495
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:31,871
I'm fine.
I just weigh so much.

496
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,880
I know who you are.

497
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,195
I want to be them.

498
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:42,070
That's funny.

499
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:43,920
Because they wanna be you.

500
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,751
I got so many questions
about Mars.

501
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:50,000
Not as many as
I have about Earth.

502
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,514
Oh, you'd be surprised.

503
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:53,351
I'll go first.

504
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:56,670
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

505
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,838
Uh, rain. My turn.

506
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:03,434
What's your favorite
thing to do on Mars?

507
00:45:03,588 --> 00:45:05,829
To pretend it's Earth.
My turn.

508
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:07,717
Did you see
my mother die?

509
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:09,114
No.

510
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:14,389
Yes.

511
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:20,112
Yes. I'm sorry.

512
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:21,710
What scares you?

513
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,715
You. You're very disarming.

514
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,949
Are you gonna keep
going out of turn?
Yes.

515
00:45:28,788 --> 00:45:30,027
Can I stay on Earth?

516
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:31,878
I can't answer that.

517
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:34,108
Why rain?

518
00:45:34,188 --> 00:45:36,077
Because it washes
everything clean.

519
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:37,268
Gardner. . .

520
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,153
Kendra.

521
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:41,309
Hello.

522
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,438
We meet in person.
Hmm.

523
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,108
How you feel?

524
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:48,469
Heavy.

525
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:55,393
So what's
giving me some concern
are these inconsistencies

526
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:57,309
in this last batch of tests.
What about blood?

527
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,990
Blood work is
virtually normal.

528
00:45:59,146 --> 00:46:01,434
But if we're
going to be sure. . .
Virtually? Virtually?

529
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:03,827
Is that what we do
around here now?
Virtually?

530
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:05,715
Because I like to think
the importance of our work

531
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:07,835
subscribes more to "definitely.''
Meaning?

532
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:12,992
Meaning, troponin.
Testing for troponin
is my point.

533
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,269
Run the test for
troponin, please.

534
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:19,429
Troponin.
Troponin it is.

535
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:29,427
Hey.

536
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:33,268
They need to do more tests.

537
00:46:34,346 --> 00:46:37,269
They already did their tests.
They said I'm fine.

538
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:39,030
I know. I know.
I'm more than fine.

539
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:40,146
Hey.

540
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:43,429
They're sending me back
to Mars, aren't they?

541
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:44,869
They didn't say that.

542
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,032
Well, they don't have to.

543
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,347
There's been a breach.
Where?

544
00:47:12,503 --> 00:47:13,710
Quarantine.

545
00:47:14,983 --> 00:47:18,067
Word of warning, guys.
These are the real deal.

546
00:47:18,224 --> 00:47:20,829
The boots are weighted
for gravity compensation,

547
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:23,349
as if you were from Mars
returning to Earth.

548
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:26,590
It's going to feel
very different.

549
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:32,509
I don't believe this.
He's tipped the pressure!

550
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:34,505
Raised by scientists.

551
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:36,983
Lock it down.
This is not a drill.

552
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:41,264
There he is!

553
00:47:45,382 --> 00:47:46,429
Where's that go?

554
00:47:46,902 --> 00:47:49,269
Zone H. He's headed
to Service.

555
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:51,512
Relax. It's a dead end.

556
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,461
Okay.

557
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:40,061
He changed.

558
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:41,710
Okay, guys, check
the loading dock.

559
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,501
Thanks.

560
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:09,467
All right,
you can go.

561
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,864
I have to talk to you.

562
00:49:27,018 --> 00:49:29,146
Gardner trusts me,
he doesn't trust you.

563
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:30,425
Kendra, give me a minute.

564
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,097
We need teams at
the Washington
Avenue Amtrak Station,

565
00:49:33,177 --> 00:49:35,260
the airport, and cover
the bus stations, yeah?

566
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:36,338
You got it.

567
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:37,539
I'm coming with you.

568
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:39,706
Kendra, thank you,
but I am good.

569
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,826
State police are helping
with blockades.

570
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,219
They've been told
he needs a heart transplant

571
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:46,181
and a donor's suddenly
become available.

572
00:49:46,378 --> 00:49:48,664
I promise I will
keep you updated.

573
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,626
You claim to be concerned
about Gardner's health,

574
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:53,018
but I think you care more
about keeping him secret.

575
00:49:56,697 --> 00:49:58,027
You were saying?

576
00:49:59,177 --> 00:50:01,657
It's one of
four ambulances.

577
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:03,023
Come on !

578
00:51:01,695 --> 00:51:03,583
You found Waldo.

579
00:51:04,534 --> 00:51:06,423
I'm Gardner.

580
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:12,496
This fire, it's so warm.

581
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:14,625
I like your shades.

582
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:16,139
I like yours.

583
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:21,300
You wanna trade?

584
00:51:25,534 --> 00:51:27,615
Do you know
where Colorado is?

585
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:29,545
Used to.

586
00:51:29,614 --> 00:51:33,141
Greyhound station's
about a three iron in
that direction.

587
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:35,980
Golf reference.
Do you play?

588
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:37,418
Used to.

589
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:47,340
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

590
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:50,940
Dreaming. How 'bout you?

591
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:53,976
So far, uh,

592
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:55,778
meeting you.

593
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:05,981
Weird kid.

594
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:36,653
Oh, this is so cool !

595
00:52:41,771 --> 00:52:42,771
Open.

596
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,215
Close. Open.
Open. Open, open.

597
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:51,371
Close.

598
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:04,139
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

599
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:26,014
How do
we know for sure
he's going to see her?

600
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,048
Because she's
the only person
he knows on Earth.

601
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,018
Right. Read that to me.

602
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:32,932
Here she is. Uh. . .

603
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:36,931
She was left
at the Tulsa, Oklahoma
Child Welfare Services

604
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,577
when she was
four years old.

605
00:53:38,768 --> 00:53:41,771
A girl named Tulsa
happened to be
abandoned in Tulsa?

606
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,009
It's a nickname.
Right.

607
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:46,251
She's lived in
five foster homes
over the last 1 2 years.

608
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:47,454
She know his story?

609
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:50,896
He told her
he was confined to
a Park Avenue penthouse

610
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:53,619
and had
Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

611
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:55,289
Brittle bones.

612
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:57,210
Put the address
in the Sat-Trac.

613
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,291
We'll land close,
but not too close.

614
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:00,853
I don't wanna spook him.

615
00:54:24,646 --> 00:54:25,648
Hi.

616
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:30,896
Hi. Hello.
Get away from me.

617
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:32,047
Okay.

618
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:35,887
Gentlemen.

619
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,847
Tulsa? Tulsa.

620
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:05,766
It's me.

621
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:09,528
It's Gardner.

622
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,695
Ow! What was that for?

623
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:18,527
Why did you
ghost me like that?

624
00:55:18,603 --> 00:55:19,605
Ghost?

625
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:20,684
Yeah, you completely
blew me off.

626
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:22,094
You didn't return
any of my messages.

627
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:23,934
I told you,
I was taking a trip.

628
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:25,773
For seven months?
People have phones,
you know?

629
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:27,130
You can text, email.

630
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:28,489
I couldn't contact you.

631
00:55:28,603 --> 00:55:31,210
It was a very
specific type of travel.

632
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:34,369
Very specific type of travel?
Who even talks like that?

633
00:55:34,523 --> 00:55:37,050
Tulsa, can you slow down,
'cause gravity is very heavy.

634
00:55:37,204 --> 00:55:39,969
Oh, I'm sorry that
this is heavy for you, but
I really do not appreciate

635
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:42,284
being blown off
by the one person
who I don't. . .

636
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:46,052
Tulsa, I would
never ghost on you.

637
00:55:46,882 --> 00:55:49,693
Okay,
I've actually gone through
quite a lot to get here.

638
00:55:51,163 --> 00:55:53,164
The only person who what?

639
00:55:54,963 --> 00:55:56,567
Who I don't hate.

640
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:00,246
You're taller than
I thought you'd be.

641
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,132
You're meaner than
I thought you'd be.

642
00:56:04,003 --> 00:56:06,572
What are you wearing?
This is so weird.

643
00:56:07,402 --> 00:56:10,326
Look, I have a lab, okay?
So, I don't know.

644
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:13,565
Um. . . Can you just
stay here, all right?

645
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:16,009
Do not move, Gardner.

646
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:41,608
And those were the highlights
of the 1 9th century
Industrial Revolution.

647
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,001
Now, the 20th century
had some of
the greatest inventions. . .

648
00:56:45,721 --> 00:56:47,246
Hello.

649
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,402
Hello.

650
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:50,289
And you are?
Gardner.

651
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,523
Are you
a transfer student?
Okay.

652
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,760
Where are you from, Gardner?

653
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,960
East Texas.

654
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,610
I don't think
I have you on my roster.

655
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:00,047
Okay.

656
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,882
All right, folks.
Telephone, phonograph. . .

657
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,927
I told you
to wait for me.

658
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,047
. . .movie camera,
light bulb. . .

659
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:09,086
I've waited long enough.

660
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,161
. . .were all inventions
of one father.

661
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:11,286
Who is he?

662
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,360
Thomas Edison.

663
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,568
Good. Give me one fact
about Thomas Edison.

664
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,643
The dude was bad-ass.

665
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,608
Edison wasn't a bad-ass.

666
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:20,679
Excuse me?

667
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,568
Edison invented
direct current,

668
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,643
but it was Nikola Tesla
who invented
alternating current.

669
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:28,804
Edison got jealous
and claimed AC
electrocuted pets.

670
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:31,326
To prove it,
he electrocuted an elephant.

671
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,001
That's not bad-ass,
that's a bad person.

672
00:57:38,398 --> 00:57:40,969
You see, folks?
You learn something
new every day.

673
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:43,126
Thank you, uh. . .

674
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:45,920
Excuse me.
That's our emergency
eye wash station.

675
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:50,639
Okay.

676
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,679
Oh, dear.

677
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,001
So the operation worked.
You're all better now?

678
00:57:57,637 --> 00:57:59,242
Yeah. Yeah.

679
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:01,168
Tell me where
you're really from.

680
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:02,599
Mars.

681
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:04,838
You're from Mars?

682
00:58:04,998 --> 00:58:05,998
Yeah.

683
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:08,519
All right, fine,
don't tell me.

684
00:58:09,516 --> 00:58:13,681
Okay, look at this.
This is my mother.

685
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:16,199
She died.
I'm sorry.

686
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:18,644
What for?
It wasn't your fault.

687
00:58:18,797 --> 00:58:20,367
It was mine.
I killed her.

688
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:24,679
But this is my father.
You're gonna help me find him.

689
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,367
I don't know
where he is, but. . .

690
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:30,447
Well, you have
your father's smile.

691
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:46,396
I found the house.

692
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,798
Route 1 4, latitude 40,
34 longitude.

693
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:04,922
All right.
You stay here.

694
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:28,594
Gardner!

695
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:32,757
Gardner, you need
to come with me now!

696
00:59:33,193 --> 00:59:34,195
No.

697
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,199
We're here to help!

698
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:38,594
You're putting yourself
in great danger!

699
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:40,835
Why can't you just
leave me alone!

700
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:42,114
This is my life!

701
00:59:42,273 --> 00:59:43,559
Gardner.
Gardner, please.

702
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:45,358
Come on,
just come with us. . .
I'm going to find my father.

703
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:46,434
He's all I have.

704
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:47,719
Is there
another way around?

705
00:59:47,913 --> 00:59:49,277
That's not true.
You have me.

706
00:59:49,432 --> 00:59:50,434
No, I don't.

707
00:59:50,592 --> 00:59:54,199
Kendra, you told me yourself,
you don't want children.

708
00:59:55,432 --> 00:59:57,242
Gardner,
that's not what I meant.
You know that.

709
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,599
You never
wanted children.

710
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:01,643
And I'm sorry you had
to raise me at all.

711
01:00:19,632 --> 01:00:20,918
Hey.

712
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,313
Yeah?
I'll get the van.
You go.

713
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:25,552
Okay.
Go!

714
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,751
Duck!
Ah !

715
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,592
Sorry!

716
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:01,351
Okay. All right,
you're gonna need
to get in.

717
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:02,755
Hurry! Come on !

718
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:07,358
Gardner, let's go!

719
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:12,635
Go faster!

720
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm trying to help him !

721
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,070
Just jump!

722
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:22,670
Come on.
All right, get in.

723
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:24,559
There you go!
There you go!

724
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:28,552
All right,
you may wanna hop in.

725
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:31,398
Whoo-hoo!

726
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:32,710
No!

727
01:01:33,028 --> 01:01:36,192
Gardner,
take a seat, please.

728
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:37,510
- Okay.
- Gardner!

729
01:01:38,548 --> 01:01:40,597
There you go.
All right.

730
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,195
Come on !

731
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:09,429
You know how to
fly this, right?

732
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:12,351
Nope.

733
01:02:14,987 --> 01:02:15,987
Wow.

734
01:02:22,827 --> 01:02:23,827
Whoa!

735
01:03:03,425 --> 01:03:04,391
Oh, no.

736
01:03:04,465 --> 01:03:05,590
Ah. . .

737
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:07,431
The pressure!

738
01:03:08,425 --> 01:03:09,585
I know, right?

739
01:03:10,105 --> 01:03:12,585
No, Gardner,
the oil pressure!

740
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:21,666
All right, I got 'em.

741
01:03:22,824 --> 01:03:24,269
My God,
they're landing
on a freeway.

742
01:03:26,065 --> 01:03:29,068
Okay. All right, um,
it's gonna be a little tricky.

743
01:03:29,224 --> 01:03:31,510
I usually have
a landing strip.

744
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:38,826
Coordinates.
I need coordinates.

745
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:42,744
Tulsa.

746
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:44,668
Tulsa, pull up! Pull up!

747
01:03:53,342 --> 01:03:54,309
Ah. . .

748
01:03:56,023 --> 01:03:57,865
Brake! Brake!

749
01:03:58,023 --> 01:03:59,309
It doesn't
have brakes!

750
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:06,744
Whoa!

751
01:04:11,782 --> 01:04:13,706
We're gonna have to jump.
Let's jump!

752
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:32,025
Oh, no.

753
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:34,103
Oh.

754
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,623
No.

755
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,231
Holy crap.

756
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:51,746
All right, we gotta go.
Come on. Come on.

757
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,905
No bodies.

758
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,063
What?
Are you sure?

759
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:34,505
Positive.
The fellas went through

760
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:35,784
the wreckage with
a fine-tooth comb.

761
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:36,940
They're alive.

762
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:38,905
Somewhere.

763
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:43,704
You had one job!

764
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:47,469
One job,
to protect Gardner!

765
01:05:48,259 --> 01:05:51,626
To keep him
from making contact
with the outside world.

766
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:55,306
Preventing exactly
this kind of eventuality.

767
01:05:56,378 --> 01:05:59,063
You're hanging this on me?

768
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,505
I admired you
more than anyone.

769
01:06:10,378 --> 01:06:11,378
And you wanna know what?

770
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:14,143
We've been shouldering
East Texas for you.

771
01:06:14,378 --> 01:06:15,378
For years.

772
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:16,579
What are you trying
to say, Kendra?

773
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,978
I'm trying to say
the whole mission
was your job,

774
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:21,222
your responsibility.

775
01:06:21,336 --> 01:06:24,784
You just gave up.
And where were you?

776
01:06:34,297 --> 01:06:35,422
Hey.

777
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:37,782
When's the Beemer
gonna be ready?

778
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:39,177
Later.

779
01:06:39,936 --> 01:06:42,940
All right, well, can you
get the paperwork started?

780
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:46,860
Please.

781
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:48,336
Sir?

782
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:52,137
This is stealing.

783
01:06:52,295 --> 01:06:53,297
Yeah, whatever.

784
01:06:53,936 --> 01:06:54,983
It's wrong.

785
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:57,536
How do you suppose
we find your father?

786
01:06:57,856 --> 01:06:59,983
You got the paperwork
on this BMW?

787
01:07:00,695 --> 01:07:02,858
Okay.

788
01:07:03,016 --> 01:07:04,380
You know, right and
wrong seem to change

789
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:05,695
when you really
need something.

790
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:07,347
Don't worry, I'll get it.

791
01:07:08,096 --> 01:07:09,096
All right.

792
01:07:14,855 --> 01:07:16,016
Friend of yours?

793
01:07:44,414 --> 01:07:45,653
Where are we going?

794
01:07:46,373 --> 01:07:47,420
Anywhere off the grid.

795
01:07:48,373 --> 01:07:50,740
Disabling the phone.

796
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:53,418
Okay.

797
01:07:53,494 --> 01:07:55,336
So, uh, Gardner,

798
01:07:55,414 --> 01:07:57,655
when you said that
you killed your mother,

799
01:07:57,733 --> 01:07:59,222
what exactly did
you mean by that?

800
01:07:59,733 --> 01:08:01,576
She died giving birth to me.

801
01:08:03,492 --> 01:08:05,335
That doesn't mean
that you killed her.

802
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:06,733
So, who's that guy?

803
01:08:06,893 --> 01:08:09,179
He founded East Texas.
Where I'm from.

804
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,936
Well, I thought you said
you were from New York.

805
01:08:12,373 --> 01:08:15,182
Who was the woman?
Kendra?
She's an astronaut.

806
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:18,373
Who you know from Mars?
Yeah.

807
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:22,103
You know what, get out.

808
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:24,412
Get out.

809
01:08:25,452 --> 01:08:26,578
Get out!

810
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:33,092
I don't understand. . .

811
01:08:33,252 --> 01:08:35,300
You know, I don't like
to be played, Gardner.

812
01:08:35,771 --> 01:08:38,935
That's what it is. Mars?
Some weird disease?

813
01:08:39,131 --> 01:08:41,612
People have been lying
to me my entire life,

814
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:44,537
which is whatever,
'cause people suck.
They suck. They lie.

815
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:45,943
They use you to
get what they want,

816
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:47,421
and then they just
throw you away.

817
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:50,619
And the thing is,
I didn't even like Calculus.

818
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,381
No, just Mr. Hall's
always drunk

819
01:08:52,451 --> 01:08:53,737
and nobody can understand
what he's saying,

820
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,336
but he doesn't care
what we do on our computers.

821
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:57,340
Tulsa. . .
So that's what
I looked forward to.

822
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:59,618
Tulsa, I'm not. . .
To Calculus.
To talking to you.

823
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,976
So get out!

824
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:06,980
Tulsa, I'm not lying to you.

825
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:09,577
My mother was an astronaut.
She made a mistake.

826
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,051
I was born on Mars.

827
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:15,460
Just because people
lied to you before,
it doesn't mean I'm lying now.

828
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,016
And just because
something sounds
crazy to you,

829
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,494
doesn't mean it's not true.

830
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:24,172
So if you really
wanna get rid of me,
you have to get out.

831
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:25,939
Because I'm gonna
find my father.

832
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:31,850
You know, when people
talk to me that way,
they get their ass kicked.

833
01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:35,333
Try it. I'm rockin'
this gravity.

834
01:09:37,408 --> 01:09:40,140
Okay. Maybe you actually
believe it yourself.

835
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:45,090
What?

836
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:47,618
I'm sorry.

837
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:48,770
For what?

838
01:09:48,929 --> 01:09:52,536
For people lying.
For people sucking things.

839
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,975
I'm sorry you're angry.

840
01:09:55,128 --> 01:09:56,698
I'm not angry.

841
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:00,689
No.

842
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:02,768
Allow me, won't you?

843
01:10:03,608 --> 01:10:04,689
What are you doing?

844
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:08,056
Chivalry's not dead.
At least not in Nantucket.

845
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:22,331
I'm on a road trip
with an insane person.

846
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:23,729
Whoa!

847
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:25,377
What is. . .

848
01:10:31,046 --> 01:10:32,537
It's just a horse.

849
01:10:58,565 --> 01:10:59,930
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

850
01:11:04,086 --> 01:11:05,610
We should not
be doing this.

851
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:07,211
Well, we need a device
that's not being traced.

852
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:09,448
You wanna know where
your father is, right?

853
01:11:10,685 --> 01:11:11,766
Okay.

854
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:14,613
Hey, it's unlocked.
Consider yourself lucky.

855
01:11:14,765 --> 01:11:16,733
I consider myself
a criminal.

856
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,805
Okay.

857
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:21,132
Well,
there was a Sarah Elliot
who was an astronaut.

858
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:22,451
Yeah.
I'll give ya that.

859
01:11:22,564 --> 01:11:23,690
It says
she died tragically

860
01:11:23,765 --> 01:11:25,733
from pressure suit failure
shortly after arriving.

861
01:11:25,885 --> 01:11:27,125
Well, I'm a secret.

862
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:30,095
Yeah. Of course you are.
And I'm an enigma.

863
01:11:31,364 --> 01:11:32,445
Same person.

864
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:33,890
I know.
That's what I've been. . .

865
01:11:33,965 --> 01:11:35,614
Damn it!
We lost connection.

866
01:11:35,965 --> 01:11:36,966
Yup, they're
pretty cheap here.

867
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,206
Your best option
is disabling
all the decoys

868
01:11:39,283 --> 01:11:41,252
and piggybacking off
the firehouse next door.

869
01:11:42,243 --> 01:11:43,244
Right.

870
01:11:44,963 --> 01:11:46,203
Oh, cool. Thanks.

871
01:11:46,283 --> 01:11:48,252
Pay for my wrap
and I won't tell.

872
01:11:49,123 --> 01:11:50,932
No, no, no, we don't
have money. I'm sorry.

873
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,085
We have money.

874
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:53,404
Great. Why don't
you say that louder?

875
01:11:53,564 --> 01:11:54,564
We have money!

876
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:58,809
No, no. Sorry, sorry,
he doesn't speak sarcasm.

877
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:01,489
Here, take it.

878
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:04,813
My mother was wearing this
when she died.

879
01:12:04,962 --> 01:12:07,613
It's some sort
of ring, I think.

880
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:11,006
It's like half a ring.
Part of a bigger ring?

881
01:12:11,603 --> 01:12:13,014
There's words on it.
Let's see.

882
01:12:16,842 --> 01:12:18,412
These words are
in Havasupai.

883
01:12:19,162 --> 01:12:20,766
An Indian tribe
in Arizona.

884
01:12:25,962 --> 01:12:28,771
Yup. It's signed.
Shaman Neka.

885
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:32,162
Gardner, I think this is
some kind of wedding ring.

886
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:34,444
And he married them.
That's Shaman Neka.

887
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:36,842
All right.
How far is Arizona?

888
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:38,730
Smile.

889
01:12:40,002 --> 01:12:42,003
Oh, no.

890
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:46,967
Oh, not smiling.
Running. Come on.
Let's go.

891
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:53,685
Two teenagers
spotted last night.

892
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:55,001
We think
they're still in there.

893
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,282
Where is he?

894
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,442
- Sir, you gotta calm. . .
- Stop it!

895
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,688
What have. . .
Let her go!

896
01:13:08,841 --> 01:13:10,809
- Hey!
- We got him.

897
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,801
Are you okay?

898
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:21,845
Nathaniel. Nathaniel.

899
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,880
Talk to me.

900
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,045
What's going on?

901
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:34,925
You're right, Kendra.

902
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:37,730
I gave up.

903
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,201
I withdrew.

904
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:44,685
And the greater
the pressure to reemerge,
the more I retreated.

905
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:51,050
As long as he was
just a face, on the screen,
I could almost handle it,

906
01:13:51,759 --> 01:13:54,409
sentencing a boy to a life
he never asked for.

907
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:58,760
But it's like
the malignancy of any secret,
it just kept getting worse.

908
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,442
Every time I go
over it, what I did,
the choices I made. . .

909
01:14:04,599 --> 01:14:06,203
I swear, I couldn't
have done anything else.

910
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:08,006
But that's not the point.

911
01:14:09,037 --> 01:14:10,846
I dealt with the problem.

912
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:14,966
I just had no idea what
the solution would do to me.

913
01:14:19,518 --> 01:14:20,757
It killed me.

914
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:24,599
And it's still killing me.

915
01:14:25,118 --> 01:14:26,961
I need to make this right.

916
01:14:32,636 --> 01:14:33,717
Yes.

917
01:14:33,796 --> 01:14:37,085
Gardner's blood
has elevated levels
of troponin.

918
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:38,921
The news is
not good, Kendra.

919
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:40,963
Thank you.

920
01:14:45,396 --> 01:14:46,966
Talk to me about troponin.

921
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:50,318
What?

922
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:52,717
Elevated troponin
and Gardner.

923
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:53,797
Oh.

924
01:14:54,317 --> 01:14:56,886
His myositic pool
was depleted.

925
01:14:56,996 --> 01:14:58,157
I read the chart.

926
01:14:58,315 --> 01:14:59,761
It's not necessarily
a problem on its own,

927
01:14:59,876 --> 01:15:03,846
but in conjunction
with elevated levels
of troponin. . .

928
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:06,956
He's suffering
from an enlarged heart.

929
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,645
His heart can't handle
our atmosphere.

930
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:12,237
Our gravity.

931
01:15:13,796 --> 01:15:15,524
He's running out of time.

932
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:33,996
Is that a balloon?

933
01:15:35,354 --> 01:15:37,163
Tulsa, there's a balloon !
Yeah.

934
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:39,521
Tulsa, there's a balloon
up there!

935
01:15:39,595 --> 01:15:40,676
All right, all right.

936
01:15:40,835 --> 01:15:41,881
Wow, it's huge!

937
01:15:43,314 --> 01:15:44,963
Burgers and balloons.

938
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:47,162
You really gotta slow down.
That's your fifth?

939
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:48,600
These taste so good.

940
01:15:49,873 --> 01:15:51,319
Hey, uh,
can you check in there,

941
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:53,043
just see
if there's any cash?

942
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:55,673
In here?
Yup.

943
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:58,002
Cowboys always
stash away a few bucks.

944
01:16:02,554 --> 01:16:05,524
No, that's for your mouth.
You just gotta blow in it.

945
01:16:07,033 --> 01:16:09,036
No, you gotta. . . Yeah.

946
01:16:09,552 --> 01:16:10,554
There ya go.
So cool.

947
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:14,833
Nice.

948
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,841
There ya go.

949
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:20,154
Uh. . .

950
01:16:20,233 --> 01:16:24,203
You got schmutz
on your face.

951
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:25,634
All right.

952
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:30,077
Thanks.
Yeah.

953
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:53,037
All right. Go change.

954
01:16:53,271 --> 01:16:56,515
Relax, this place has
like a million stores
and a trillion dollars.

955
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:57,592
No, there are cameras. . .

956
01:16:57,671 --> 01:16:58,671
All right,
all right, all right.

957
01:16:58,831 --> 01:17:00,117
But, look, this is
the last of our money.

958
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:04,195
So, we'll buy the clothes,
then change.

959
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:05,671
Hey.

960
01:17:50,588 --> 01:17:52,636
Break my heart

961
01:17:53,309 --> 01:17:55,595
Break my hands

962
01:17:56,628 --> 01:18:02,318
You can take anything
but my plans

963
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:10,154
I've got big things to do

964
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:16,354
You can laugh

965
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,636
Have your fun

966
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:24,270
I’ll be standing right here
when you're done

967
01:18:25,028 --> 01:18:26,518
Oh, oh...

968
01:18:28,028 --> 01:18:31,510
I've got big things...

969
01:18:34,028 --> 01:18:35,029
Yo.

970
01:18:35,347 --> 01:18:36,587
Is that your song?

971
01:18:37,306 --> 01:18:38,354
Maybe.

972
01:18:38,627 --> 01:18:39,707
It's beautiful.

973
01:18:40,186 --> 01:18:41,188
Whatever.

974
01:18:50,787 --> 01:18:52,515
What goes on in there?

975
01:18:55,466 --> 01:18:56,707
I don't know.

976
01:18:58,306 --> 01:18:59,717
Got us some sleeping bags.

977
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:02,356
Ready?
Yeah.

978
01:19:03,225 --> 01:19:05,307
Oh, and I'm driving
this time.

979
01:19:05,386 --> 01:19:06,831
In your dreams.

980
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:09,796
Excuse me, sir.

981
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:20,989
Play that again.

982
01:19:24,985 --> 01:19:26,350
They're moving aimlessly.

983
01:19:27,704 --> 01:19:29,707
Why New Mexico?

984
01:19:48,265 --> 01:19:52,109
Both hands on the wheel.
Both eyes on the road.

985
01:19:56,783 --> 01:19:59,024
Dude, do you have a problem?

986
01:19:59,104 --> 01:20:01,425
'Cause you've definitely
been looking at me for
the last four hours

987
01:20:01,543 --> 01:20:03,511
and it's starting
to freak me out.

988
01:20:04,783 --> 01:20:05,909
You're so beautiful.

989
01:20:07,104 --> 01:20:10,551
And then you blurt that out,
just like that? What?

990
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:12,194
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

991
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:16,313
Uh. . . Because you may wanna
just play it cool, you know?

992
01:20:16,462 --> 01:20:18,591
Ease yourself
into the love game.

993
01:20:18,743 --> 01:20:20,426
But I do think
you're beautiful.

994
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:23,511
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

995
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:25,311
Okay, just
slow your roll, kid.

996
01:20:27,103 --> 01:20:28,514
You gotta calm down.

997
01:20:28,582 --> 01:20:30,346
I don't wanna calm down.

998
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,791
And I don't understand
why this is making you
so upset.

999
01:20:32,943 --> 01:20:34,707
Hey, first of all,
I'm not upset.

1000
01:20:34,783 --> 01:20:36,273
I am uncomfortable.
There's a difference.

1001
01:20:36,422 --> 01:20:38,152
Secondly,
people don't go around

1002
01:20:38,222 --> 01:20:40,064
saying what they feel
whenever they feel it.

1003
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:44,306
They have guards and shields
and other metaphors.

1004
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:46,988
Why?
Because we're all messed up

1005
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:49,144
and scared and trying to be
something that we're not.

1006
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:51,828
And if we all went
around just declaring
our innermost desires

1007
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:53,143
to the exact people
we felt them for,

1008
01:20:53,301 --> 01:20:55,987
well, then we'd all end up
happy, or something.

1009
01:21:01,341 --> 01:21:02,467
Look, Gardner. . .

1010
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:06,787
I'm happy that
you think I'm beautiful

1011
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:10,145
and I've kind of had
an amazing time with you.

1012
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:12,507
But the last thing I'm gonna
do is actually tell you that.

1013
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:14,822
You just did.

1014
01:21:17,661 --> 01:21:18,662
You're blushing.

1015
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,582
I'm not blushing.

1016
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:45,384
Both hands on the wheel?

1017
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,027
No.

1018
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:57,060
What is happening?

1019
01:21:58,378 --> 01:22:01,144
This is. . .
I believe the term is "euphoria."

1020
01:22:11,578 --> 01:22:13,307
I got an idea.

1021
01:22:25,018 --> 01:22:27,668
Hail in the southern desert,
extending from Las...

1022
01:23:11,216 --> 01:23:12,456
Close your eyes.

1023
01:23:41,135 --> 01:23:44,617
How did you just
become more beautiful
in 20 seconds?

1024
01:23:46,494 --> 01:23:47,655
Do you wanna kiss me?

1025
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:51,655
Yeah.

1026
01:23:52,734 --> 01:23:54,338
But I don't know how.

1027
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,184
You will.

1028
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:20,015
You don't understand.

1029
01:24:20,134 --> 01:24:23,181
On Mars, people,
they didn't do this.

1030
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:29,099
We just had scientists
and they studied
ground samples.

1031
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:31,456
Shut up, Gardner.

1032
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:35,222
I thought about you
every day, up there.

1033
01:24:42,972 --> 01:24:44,304
I know
what's gonna happen.

1034
01:24:44,893 --> 01:24:45,893
What?

1035
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:49,293
I'm gonna fall
in love with you
and I'll fall to Earth.

1036
01:24:49,372 --> 01:24:50,975
I'll be just like you.

1037
01:24:51,532 --> 01:24:52,976
That old line.

1038
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,576
Okay, I'll shut up now.
No, no, no.

1039
01:24:59,332 --> 01:25:00,662
Hold that thought.

1040
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:06,257
To myself?

1041
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:01,613
All my life,
I couldn't feel anything.

1042
01:26:03,448 --> 01:26:07,135
I couldn't feel water.
I couldn't feel a fire.

1043
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:09,939
I couldn't feel
wind on my face.

1044
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:12,893
And now I can.

1045
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:18,052
That's nothing compared to
what I feel with you.

1046
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:22,810
I was so scared

1047
01:26:22,929 --> 01:26:24,975
I wouldn't know
how to be human.

1048
01:26:29,087 --> 01:26:31,773
You make me human, Tulsa.

1049
01:27:07,646 --> 01:27:09,694
Well, that's incredible.

1050
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:11,453
I know, right?

1051
01:27:11,686 --> 01:27:13,176
It has so many legs.

1052
01:27:15,926 --> 01:27:16,926
Oh.

1053
01:27:17,006 --> 01:27:18,814
Everything's cool !

1054
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:20,975
This is reservation property.

1055
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:24,295
The tourist lookout
is 1 5 miles that way.

1056
01:27:24,445 --> 01:27:25,447
Yeah, we know. Um. . .

1057
01:27:25,605 --> 01:27:26,891
And we hope
we're not intruding,

1058
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:28,814
but we're looking
for Shaman Neka.

1059
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:31,377
Right on !

1060
01:27:32,525 --> 01:27:35,131
When you know, you know!

1061
01:27:35,845 --> 01:27:38,734
Know what?
I am not sure.

1062
01:27:38,885 --> 01:27:40,216
Come on !

1063
01:27:50,484 --> 01:27:52,487
I've married many couples.

1064
01:27:52,645 --> 01:27:54,726
Well, there were
no state records.

1065
01:27:54,885 --> 01:27:56,569
Um. . . Do you keep any?

1066
01:27:58,725 --> 01:28:00,055
I'd keep her.

1067
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:03,175
What was her name?

1068
01:28:03,564 --> 01:28:05,213
Sarah Elliot.

1069
01:28:05,804 --> 01:28:07,168
Sarah.

1070
01:28:08,724 --> 01:28:12,854
So, I made this
ring 1 6 years ago.
Stop. Stop!

1071
01:28:13,644 --> 01:28:16,408
The other half of this ring
is with your father.

1072
01:28:18,243 --> 01:28:20,326
This is the check.

1073
01:28:21,764 --> 01:28:22,845
It doesn't say his name.

1074
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,369
No, she paid.
That's her address.

1075
01:28:25,564 --> 01:28:26,609
Do you have that photo?

1076
01:28:26,762 --> 01:28:28,094
Do you mind if
I borrow your computer?

1077
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:29,203
Not at all.
Okay, great.

1078
01:28:31,922 --> 01:28:33,048
Okay.

1079
01:28:37,243 --> 01:28:40,247
Summerland, California.

1080
01:28:40,603 --> 01:28:41,604
Huh.

1081
01:28:46,762 --> 01:28:48,287
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1082
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:55,292
I think this is it.

1083
01:28:55,362 --> 01:28:56,966
Yeah, one second,
I think that's. . .

1084
01:28:57,681 --> 01:28:58,729
We found it.

1085
01:29:00,962 --> 01:29:01,962
Well, let's go.

1086
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,484
You look like crap.
You okay?

1087
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:41,841
Yeah.

1088
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,171
Do you know
where we're going?

1089
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,801
Oh, yeah.

1090
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,128
Paris, Venice,
and Cairo.

1091
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,841
Hello. Checking in?

1092
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,921
Hi. Uh, we just left
the keys in the ignition.

1093
01:30:05,998 --> 01:30:07,329
Checking in.
Thank you.

1094
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:08,479
You're welcome.

1095
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:11,921
Well, you wanted
to see the world.

1096
01:30:12,038 --> 01:30:13,564
Here you have it.

1097
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,920
It's like a big toy.

1098
01:30:18,198 --> 01:30:20,247
No, no, no, look.

1099
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:23,050
That's Paris.
New York. Shanghai.

1100
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:24,922
And look over there,
Venice.

1101
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:27,849
It feels weird.

1102
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,006
I mean,
it's not real, you know?

1103
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:35,367
It's not
how I pictured it.

1104
01:30:35,717 --> 01:30:37,880
It's hurting my head
to see it like this.

1105
01:30:38,078 --> 01:30:39,488
Well, I'm sorry,
Gardner,

1106
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:42,880
but the world doesn't
always give you exactly
what you want.

1107
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:45,038
It gave me you.

1108
01:30:45,637 --> 01:30:47,800
All right, let me be
cynical for one second.

1109
01:30:58,237 --> 01:31:00,319
Tulsa, just because
your parents are gone,

1110
01:31:00,396 --> 01:31:02,764
it doesn't mean
you can't have a family.

1111
01:31:03,077 --> 01:31:05,238
We can be
each other's family.

1112
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,403
'Cause this isn't. . .

1113
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:11,603
This isn't real,
but we can be real.

1114
01:31:12,077 --> 01:31:13,078
Okay.

1115
01:31:13,997 --> 01:31:16,045
I think it's time to go.
Let's get you to California.

1116
01:31:16,197 --> 01:31:17,243
You hear what I said?

1117
01:31:18,277 --> 01:31:19,801
Whoa. Yeah, I did. Uh. . .

1118
01:31:19,876 --> 01:31:21,162
But, Gardner,
I think you're sick.

1119
01:31:21,235 --> 01:31:23,283
None of this was how it was
in my head.

1120
01:31:23,435 --> 01:31:24,403
You need to
go to the hospital.

1121
01:31:24,515 --> 01:31:26,006
Except you.
We need to get you
to a hospital.

1122
01:31:26,076 --> 01:31:27,077
Something's wrong with you.

1123
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:28,765
Gardner. Gardner.

1124
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,283
No, no! Gardner,
Gardner, Gardner!

1125
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:32,721
You're okay,
you're okay.

1126
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:34,042
Please help!

1127
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:39,277
I wanna scan him.

1128
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:40,601
Okay. Radiology, stat.

1129
01:31:44,074 --> 01:31:45,201
What's his name?

1130
01:31:45,715 --> 01:31:46,716
Gardner.

1131
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:48,479
What's his last name?

1132
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:51,284
I don't know.

1133
01:31:51,515 --> 01:31:53,358
Well, where's he from?
Uh. . .

1134
01:31:54,395 --> 01:31:55,395
Uh. . .

1135
01:31:55,954 --> 01:31:57,604
I don't know.

1136
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:07,635
What the. . .

1137
01:32:08,873 --> 01:32:09,954
Look at this.

1138
01:32:10,314 --> 01:32:11,804
I've never seen
anything like it before.

1139
01:32:12,474 --> 01:32:14,475
Oh, my God,
what is that?

1140
01:32:16,793 --> 01:32:19,001
His heart is
grossly enlarged.

1141
01:32:20,154 --> 01:32:22,077
I gave him
some valsartan, but. . .

1142
01:32:24,113 --> 01:32:25,639
It doesn't look good.

1143
01:32:27,234 --> 01:32:28,917
He wasn't lying.

1144
01:32:32,432 --> 01:32:33,434
Gardner.

1145
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:36,277
Gardner, I have to go.

1146
01:32:38,073 --> 01:32:39,643
Social Services are coming.

1147
01:32:42,073 --> 01:32:43,962
But I'm gonna
go to Summerland.

1148
01:32:45,832 --> 01:32:47,358
I'm gonna find your father.

1149
01:32:48,472 --> 01:32:50,918
And I'm gonna tell him
how amazing you are.

1150
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:52,923
How much you think about him

1151
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:56,600
and how badly
you wanted
to go there. Okay?

1152
01:32:59,271 --> 01:33:00,273
I promise.

1153
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:08,514
Hey. Hey.

1154
01:33:11,032 --> 01:33:12,033
- We need to go.
- No, no.

1155
01:33:12,192 --> 01:33:13,681
We need to go.
You can't. You can't.

1156
01:33:15,271 --> 01:33:16,273
You have to stay here.

1157
01:33:16,832 --> 01:33:17,832
Gardner.

1158
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,795
Do you even know
why you're sick?

1159
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:29,471
'Cause your heart's too big.

1160
01:33:29,631 --> 01:33:30,631
We are going to Summerland.

1161
01:33:30,711 --> 01:33:32,554
You can't.
They're gonna help you.

1162
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:35,395
There's nothing they can do.

1163
01:33:35,831 --> 01:33:37,560
They can't. Don't you see?

1164
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:41,315
No matter how much
I want Earth,

1165
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,552
Earth doesn't want me.

1166
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:56,515
Hold on a sec.
I'll get my bag.

1167
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:03,350
Hang on, Pop.

1168
01:34:25,229 --> 01:34:27,118
Social Services.
Thank God.

1169
01:34:40,587 --> 01:34:43,113
They used a credit card
the owner left in the car.

1170
01:34:43,908 --> 01:34:46,114
They're headed north,
in California.

1171
01:34:46,427 --> 01:34:47,872
I know where they're going.

1172
01:34:48,108 --> 01:34:49,109
Good evening.

1173
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:00,912
Gardner?

1174
01:35:02,587 --> 01:35:03,587
Gardner!

1175
01:35:04,747 --> 01:35:06,112
I'm not dead.

1176
01:35:10,226 --> 01:35:11,387
Scared me.

1177
01:35:12,747 --> 01:35:16,274
You act like you hate
the world so much, Tulsa.

1178
01:35:18,106 --> 01:35:19,471
Save your strength.

1179
01:35:20,386 --> 01:35:21,797
It's all an act.

1180
01:35:23,667 --> 01:35:26,670
The beautiful music you make
gives you away.

1181
01:36:04,704 --> 01:36:06,194
Gardner, we're here.

1182
01:36:07,185 --> 01:36:08,185
Hey.

1183
01:36:10,704 --> 01:36:12,867
Hey, we're here.

1184
01:36:15,823 --> 01:36:17,314
Will you help me?

1185
01:36:18,224 --> 01:36:19,713
Yeah, of course.

1186
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,024
Help you what?

1187
01:36:21,783 --> 01:36:23,354
Just look better.

1188
01:36:38,743 --> 01:36:39,743
Here.

1189
01:36:56,983 --> 01:36:59,350
This is the best place
I've been so far.

1190
01:37:04,582 --> 01:37:06,185
You ready?

1191
01:37:09,862 --> 01:37:11,101
Yeah.

1192
01:37:14,221 --> 01:37:15,587
He's gonna love you.

1193
01:37:34,621 --> 01:37:35,622
Hello?

1194
01:38:05,979 --> 01:38:07,310
Hello?
Hi.

1195
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:10,509
Can I help you?

1196
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,426
Now would be
a good time
to say something.

1197
01:38:17,819 --> 01:38:18,819
Um. . .

1198
01:38:30,099 --> 01:38:31,588
Where did you get this photo?

1199
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:34,024
East Texas.

1200
01:38:34,179 --> 01:38:35,510
That's impossible.

1201
01:38:35,658 --> 01:38:38,742
My mother was Sarah Elliot.
She died giving birth to me.

1202
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:42,783
Sarah Elliot died
from pressure suit failure.

1203
01:38:42,938 --> 01:38:45,100
That's not. . .
That's what
they said, but. . .

1204
01:38:51,537 --> 01:38:53,108
You're my father.

1205
01:38:55,257 --> 01:38:56,543
Is this some kind of scam?

1206
01:38:56,698 --> 01:38:58,779
No, he's not lying.
It's the truth, I swear.

1207
01:38:58,858 --> 01:39:00,097
I just wanted
to meet you.

1208
01:39:00,297 --> 01:39:01,823
Why are you doing this to me?

1209
01:39:02,778 --> 01:39:05,019
I'm not your father.
I'm calling the police.

1210
01:39:05,217 --> 01:39:06,707
Okay, just stay
right here.

1211
01:39:07,537 --> 01:39:09,505
Stop being a dick! Okay.

1212
01:39:09,577 --> 01:39:10,578
Look, he risked his life

1213
01:39:10,697 --> 01:39:12,779
to leave the one place
he's ever known, all alone,

1214
01:39:12,976 --> 01:39:15,264
didn't know anybody,
never set foot on this planet.

1215
01:39:15,337 --> 01:39:16,940
I mean, how scary is that?
What do you want from me?

1216
01:39:17,016 --> 01:39:18,018
I could never do that.

1217
01:39:18,176 --> 01:39:19,905
Look. . .
Just to meet you.

1218
01:39:19,976 --> 01:39:21,502
And he's dying.

1219
01:39:22,296 --> 01:39:25,061
I don't know who you are,
or why you're doing this.

1220
01:39:25,216 --> 01:39:26,217
I am not his father.

1221
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:28,538
Well, then who are you,
because that is you
in the photo,

1222
01:39:28,737 --> 01:39:31,023
and that is this house.
Yes, this is the house.

1223
01:39:31,176 --> 01:39:33,064
Our parents left it to us.

1224
01:39:36,055 --> 01:39:38,217
Sarah Elliot was my sister.

1225
01:39:41,576 --> 01:39:43,896
Oh. You gotta get some help.
Please, get some help!

1226
01:39:44,015 --> 01:39:45,016
Gardner!

1227
01:39:46,735 --> 01:39:47,737
Gardner!

1228
01:39:49,576 --> 01:39:50,737
Gardner!

1229
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:55,416
Gardner!

1230
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:59,064
No, he's not
your father.

1231
01:40:00,095 --> 01:40:01,823
He's not your father.
He's your uncle.

1232
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:03,623
It doesn't matter anymore.

1233
01:40:04,095 --> 01:40:05,744
There's no time left, Tulsa.

1234
01:40:06,335 --> 01:40:08,099
Okay, let's just go back.
He's gonna
call the ambulance.

1235
01:40:08,255 --> 01:40:10,256
You'll get better.
My mother's here.

1236
01:40:12,055 --> 01:40:13,783
I can feel her.

1237
01:40:15,414 --> 01:40:18,463
I didn't get to choose
where I was born.

1238
01:40:20,094 --> 01:40:22,095
But I get to choose
where I die.

1239
01:40:31,774 --> 01:40:32,774
Tulsa.

1240
01:40:33,533 --> 01:40:34,774
Yes, Gardner?

1241
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:40,622
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

1242
01:40:41,694 --> 01:40:43,820
You are, Gardner.

1243
01:41:00,212 --> 01:41:02,055
See you in the funny papers.

1244
01:41:03,052 --> 01:41:05,215
Gardner! Gardner!

1245
01:41:05,412 --> 01:41:08,064
No, no! Gardner!
No, Gardner!

1246
01:41:08,652 --> 01:41:10,096
No, Gardner, no!

1247
01:41:16,171 --> 01:41:18,095
No, Gardner!

1248
01:41:32,492 --> 01:41:35,699
I got him !

1249
01:41:40,091 --> 01:41:43,253
Kendra! Help me!

1250
01:41:54,211 --> 01:41:55,975
Okay.
Let's move him over.

1251
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,060
- There we go.
- Turn him over.

1252
01:41:59,449 --> 01:42:00,610
Come on.

1253
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:02,613
Okay, come on.

1254
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:03,895
Gardner.
You can do it.

1255
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:06,496
Gardner! Gardner!

1256
01:42:06,649 --> 01:42:08,175
Gardner, stay with me.

1257
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:09,451
Don't leave us!

1258
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:11,613
Come on. Come on.

1259
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:18,175
What was she like?

1260
01:42:21,729 --> 01:42:23,219
My mother.

1261
01:42:29,729 --> 01:42:31,253
She was fearless.

1262
01:42:32,328 --> 01:42:34,057
She was kind.

1263
01:42:35,248 --> 01:42:39,731
And she just
seemed so invincible.

1264
01:42:43,248 --> 01:42:46,490
And she made me wanna
give up living when she died.

1265
01:42:50,087 --> 01:42:51,213
You loved her.

1266
01:42:52,927 --> 01:42:53,929
Yes.

1267
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,212
You're my father.

1268
01:42:59,768 --> 01:43:00,734
Yes.

1269
01:43:04,167 --> 01:43:05,168
There they are!

1270
01:43:05,768 --> 01:43:08,373
Hurry! There's no time!

1271
01:43:10,528 --> 01:43:12,291
I knew I would find you.

1272
01:43:12,447 --> 01:43:14,211
You're gonna be okay.

1273
01:43:14,766 --> 01:43:16,097
You're not alone.

1274
01:43:16,846 --> 01:43:18,257
Stay with me, Gardner.

1275
01:43:19,686 --> 01:43:20,768
Hurry!

1276
01:43:57,886 --> 01:43:59,934
It's taking too long.

1277
01:44:00,126 --> 01:44:01,286
His blood pressure's
dropping.

1278
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:03,253
We have to get him
out of our gravity.

1279
01:44:06,805 --> 01:44:08,488
You have to take
the plane higher.

1280
01:44:09,404 --> 01:44:10,975
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1281
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:12,251
You know I can't do that.

1282
01:44:12,324 --> 01:44:14,407
That's against
all regulations.

1283
01:44:17,845 --> 01:44:19,256
I'm taking control.

1284
01:44:22,484 --> 01:44:23,610
What are you doing?

1285
01:44:24,284 --> 01:44:25,409
I'm taking us into
the stratosphere.

1286
01:44:25,524 --> 01:44:26,524
Excuse me?

1287
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:30,813
Yeah, don't worry.
She can handle it.

1288
01:44:31,524 --> 01:44:34,811
Although I warn you,
one of you may need
to take over.

1289
01:44:34,963 --> 01:44:35,930
One of us may need to. . .

1290
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:37,813
Yeah, there's a chance
that I may die.

1291
01:44:38,444 --> 01:44:39,969
But you've done
this before?
Yes.

1292
01:44:40,163 --> 01:44:41,369
All the time.

1293
01:44:42,444 --> 01:44:43,444
Virtually.

1294
01:44:43,604 --> 01:44:44,844
Great.

1295
01:44:45,043 --> 01:44:46,454
Buckle in.

1296
01:44:47,203 --> 01:44:48,854
All right,
let's buckle you in.

1297
01:44:49,443 --> 01:44:50,604
Uh. . .
Yeah, just get ready.
Come on.

1298
01:44:50,682 --> 01:44:51,969
Grab this strap
right there.

1299
01:44:52,122 --> 01:44:54,125
I have the aircraft.

1300
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:21,532
No, we gotta go higher.

1301
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,283
Try and wake him up.

1302
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:23,203
Gardner. Gardner,
wake up! Gardner!

1303
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,769
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1304
01:46:28,918 --> 01:46:30,488
Stay in. Stay in.
I've got him.

1305
01:46:59,797 --> 01:47:01,083
Are we on my planet?

1306
01:47:02,118 --> 01:47:03,118
No.

1307
01:47:03,557 --> 01:47:05,560
Are we on yours?

1308
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:07,918
No.

1309
01:47:10,997 --> 01:47:13,000
Are you ever gonna
stop slapping me?

1310
01:47:25,676 --> 01:47:26,962
You have to go back.

1311
01:47:27,157 --> 01:47:30,206
No, Tulsa, don't. . .
I hate it. I hate it.

1312
01:47:31,476 --> 01:47:33,046
But, Gardner, we both know

1313
01:47:34,837 --> 01:47:36,520
you have to go back.

1314
01:47:38,596 --> 01:47:40,122
I love you, Tulsa.

1315
01:47:41,595 --> 01:47:43,519
And I love you.

1316
01:48:03,716 --> 01:48:04,716
How's he doing?

1317
01:48:05,836 --> 01:48:07,564
Stable, for now.

1318
01:48:07,715 --> 01:48:09,637
It should buy us
the time we need.

1319
01:48:09,795 --> 01:48:11,877
And you? You okay?

1320
01:48:13,715 --> 01:48:15,637
Apparently.

1321
01:48:16,635 --> 01:48:18,557
This is good to know.
Uh-huh.

1322
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:51,563
I'm gonna miss you, Gardner.

1323
01:48:52,434 --> 01:48:54,675
More than anything else
in the world.

1324
01:48:58,832 --> 01:48:59,880
Me too.

1325
01:49:01,672 --> 01:49:03,561
You're the best mom
I never had.

1326
01:49:07,193 --> 01:49:09,354
Safe travels, okay?

1327
01:49:17,273 --> 01:49:18,957
Oh, miss. Hold up, miss.
Hey!

1328
01:49:19,113 --> 01:49:20,954
Miss, you can't
go up there.

1329
01:49:25,712 --> 01:49:27,122
Nice ride.

1330
01:49:29,551 --> 01:49:31,395
Are you gonna be okay?

1331
01:49:35,631 --> 01:49:37,282
You're amazing.

1332
01:49:38,712 --> 01:49:40,713
And I had the time
of my life with you.

1333
01:49:43,551 --> 01:49:47,158
But the last
thing I'm gonna do is
actually tell you that.

1334
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:51,154
You just did.

1335
01:50:02,751 --> 01:50:06,676
T-minus ten. Nine. Eight.

1336
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:11,354
Seven. Six. Five.

1337
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:14,912
Four. Three. Two.

1338
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:18,275
One. Zero.

1339
01:50:18,829 --> 01:50:21,673
Ignition. Liftoff.

1340
01:50:52,788 --> 01:50:55,029
Same time tomorrow?

1341
01:50:55,229 --> 01:50:56,878
Works for me.

1342
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,069
Tulsa.

1343
01:51:00,307 --> 01:51:02,072
You have a visitor.

1344
01:51:03,587 --> 01:51:04,588
Um. . .

1345
01:51:05,228 --> 01:51:06,229
Bye.

1346
01:51:06,387 --> 01:51:07,548
Gotta go.

1347
01:51:15,828 --> 01:51:17,511
Hey.
Hi.

1348
01:51:20,307 --> 01:51:22,547
So, as you probably know,
I've retired from NASA.

1349
01:51:23,027 --> 01:51:24,676
Well, not really.

1350
01:51:24,747 --> 01:51:26,908
I'm running
their training program now.

1351
01:51:27,226 --> 01:51:28,752
And it's been great.

1352
01:51:28,987 --> 01:51:32,547
I mean, getting re-accustomed
to living on this planet's
been a little trying.

1353
01:51:33,907 --> 01:51:35,908
Anyway, um,
I'm getting off track. Um. . .

1354
01:51:36,827 --> 01:51:38,670
Since I couldn't
spend any money on Mars,

1355
01:51:38,747 --> 01:51:41,068
and I was up there
for six years,

1356
01:51:41,226 --> 01:51:43,115
it turns out
I actually have a lot of it.

1357
01:51:43,266 --> 01:51:47,430
So, I bought a ranch house
in Boulder, Colorado.

1358
01:51:47,666 --> 01:51:50,953
Mmm.
I like to ski and
the people are really nice.

1359
01:51:52,065 --> 01:51:55,787
Yeah,
it's a pretty big house.
Gets lonely at times.

1360
01:51:57,105 --> 01:51:59,234
Would you like to
come live with me there?

1361
01:52:04,345 --> 01:52:05,791
Are you getting paid?

1362
01:52:06,905 --> 01:52:08,032
To take me?

1363
01:52:08,865 --> 01:52:09,947
Oh, God, no.

1364
01:52:10,786 --> 01:52:12,389
No.

1365
01:52:12,465 --> 01:52:14,786
'Cause I age out
in a month.

1366
01:52:16,265 --> 01:52:18,551
Who said anything
about only a month?

1367
01:52:40,904 --> 01:52:42,667
I wanted to go to Earth.

1368
01:52:44,304 --> 01:52:46,988
Not just to visit,
but to live there.

1369
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:49,748
It turns out,

1370
01:52:49,904 --> 01:52:52,145
people from Earth
want exactly the same thing

1371
01:52:52,304 --> 01:52:53,590
as people from Mars.

1372
01:52:55,104 --> 01:52:58,586
And I should know,
because I'm pretty sure
I'm the only one.

1373
01:52:59,144 --> 01:53:00,270
So far.

1374
01:53:02,783 --> 01:53:06,469
I don't know which is better,
but here's what I do know.

1375
01:53:07,983 --> 01:53:09,587
It's good to be home.
