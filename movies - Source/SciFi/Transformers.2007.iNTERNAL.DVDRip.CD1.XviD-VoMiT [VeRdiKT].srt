1
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,485
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,151
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,495
<i>only that it holds the power</i>
<i>to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
<i>but like all great power,</i>
<i>some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
<i>a war that ravaged our planet</i>
<i>until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
<i>and the Cube was lost</i>
<i>to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,</i>
<i>hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,</i>
<i>message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,980
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
A plate of mama's alligators <i>étouffée.</i>

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
I understand.

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,375
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,375
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,570
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,895
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,371
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,606
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are</i>
<i>in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,037
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,577
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,239
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,748
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,912
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

53
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,990
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,591
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you</i>
<i>to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,027
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
- My ladies!
- <i>Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,373
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
<i>Look at those cheeks.</i>
<i>I just wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,439
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,677
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,152
but, wow, we made
one good-Iooking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,018
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,717
- <i>She laughed?</i>
- Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,255
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,682
- <i>Will?</i>
- Sarah?

73
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,191
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,623
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,322
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

76
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

77
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

78
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,619
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

79
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
My God.

80
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,143
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

81
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,344
Go! Move! Move!

82
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
It's going after the files!

83
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
Cut the hard lines!

84
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
I need a key! It's locked!

85
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,022
Move! Move!

86
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,735
Here, come here! Come here!

87
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,781
Here, hide in here!

88
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,986
Oh, my God. Okay.

89
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
No!

90
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Oh!

91
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,236
What the...

92
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
Epps, let's go!

93
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

94
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

95
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
Watch.

96
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
Okay.

97
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
For my family...

98
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

99
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Okay.

100
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
So, for my family genealogy report,

101
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

102
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Very famous explorer.

104
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

105
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors</i>
<i>straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

106
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

107
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

108
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

109
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

110
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
So that's the story, right?

111
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

112
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
used by 19th-century seamen.

113
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

114
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
It's all for sale, by the way.

115
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

116
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

117
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

118
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
Are you going to sell me his liver?

119
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

120
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
I don't think your grandfather would be

121
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
particularly proud of what you're doing.

122
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

123
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

124
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
Cold hard cash works, too.

125
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

126
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
- Sam!
- Sorry.

127
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

128
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

129
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
drawing these strange symbols

130
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

131
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346
that he thought he'd discovered.

132
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

133
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

134
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

135
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
Okay. Pretty good, right?

136
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
I'd say a solid B-.

137
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
A B-?

138
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,963
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

139
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,234
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

140
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

141
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

142
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

144
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
And a man's promise to that boy.

145
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

146
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

147
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

148
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

149
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

150
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
Yes! Yes, yes.

151
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
So?

152
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
A-. It's an A, though.

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

154
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

155
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

156
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
Yeah, a little surprise.

157
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

158
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

159
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

160
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

161
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

162
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
a Porsche for your first car?

163
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

164
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

165
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
- Manny!
- What?

166
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

167
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
He's having a heat stroke again.

168
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
Scaring white folks.

169
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

170
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

171
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

172
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

174
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
- You ever see <i>40-Year-Old Virgin?</i>
- Yeah.

175
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

176
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

177
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

178
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

179
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

181
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
How can I help you?

182
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

183
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

184
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

185
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

186
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

187
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

188
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
The car'll pick the driver.

189
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

190
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

191
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

192
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

193
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

194
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

195
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
This ain't bad.

196
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
It got racing...

198
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

199
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
I don't know nothing about this car.

200
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
- Manny!
- What?

201
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

202
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's <i>loco!</i>

203
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

204
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
Feels good.

205
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
- How much?
- Well,

206
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

207
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

208
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

209
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
It's custom faded?

210
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

211
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

212
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

213
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

214
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

215
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

216
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

217
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

218
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
This is a classic engine right here.

219
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
I sold a car the other day...

220
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
Gee. Holy cow.

221
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

222
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

223
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

224
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

225
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,109
<i>... greater than man...</i>

226
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

227
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,530
$4,000.

228
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,336
Steve.

229
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

230
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,941
They're so young.

231
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

232
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

233
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,022
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

234
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
I am so underdressed.

235
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

236
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
Please be seated.

237
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
I'm John Keller.

238
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

239
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

240
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations</i>
<i>Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

241
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

242
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

243
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

244
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

245
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

246
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

247
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

249
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

250
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
and intercept further communications,

251
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,486
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

252
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

253
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,492
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

254
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,192
The President has dispatched
battle groups

255
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,464
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.</i>
<i>This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

256
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,198
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you</i>
<i>to your officer-in-charge.</i>

257
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

258
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
Good luck to us all.

259
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

260
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

261
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
Zero bids.

262
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
Great. Broke.

263
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

264
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
No. Premature.

265
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
Good. What's up?

266
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

267
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
It's like clockwork.

268
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

269
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

270
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

271
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

272
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
This one is wobbly.

273
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

274
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
- Sam...
- What?

275
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I do not like footprints on my grass.

276
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

277
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

278
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

279
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

281
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

282
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
That's his bling.

283
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

285
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

286
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
<i>At this time, we can't confirm</i>
<i>whether there were any survivors.</i>

290
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
Oh, my God.

291
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,</i>
<i>at DEFCON Delta,</i>

292
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

293
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>But our prayers are with the families</i>
<i>of the brave men and women...</i>

296
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

303
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

313
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
- <i>I got no communication with aerial.</i>
- <i>Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

314
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

321
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

322
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
Okay.

323
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
Oh, hi.

325
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

330
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

331
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

337
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

339
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
That's funny.

341
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

343
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

345
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
What are you doing?

346
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

350
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
Okay.

353
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
You'll call me.

354
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

355
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

360
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

362
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,274
<i>Who's gonna come around</i>
<i>when you break?</i>

369
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,040
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
You sure?

373
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,542
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
There you go.

376
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
So...

377
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,234
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,367
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,808
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,446
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,117
Big arms?

384
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,857
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah.

388
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,443
Oh, no, no.

390
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,582
Yeah, a long time.

393
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
Well, do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,246
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

395
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,222
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,764
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,328
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

400
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,869
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

401
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,870
No, no, no. No. Come on.

402
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,677
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,240
<i>When I get that feeling</i>
<i>I want sexual healing</i>

404
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,079
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,880
<i>Sexual healing</i>

406
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,217
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

407
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,028
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,463
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,627
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

413
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,231
<i>I feel good</i>

414
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,738
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,370
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,041
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,705
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,216
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

419
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,546
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,349
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:32,160
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,227
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,774
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

426
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,070
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,166
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,837
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,973
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,711
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,686
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,323
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

434
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,622
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

435
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,165
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,028
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,799
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,266
All right.

439
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,674
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,346
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,284
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

443
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,855
<i>Baby come back</i>
<i>any kind of fool could see</i>

444
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,219
Hey!

445
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,256
<i>There was something</i>
<i>in everything about you</i>

446
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,458
<i>Baby come back</i>
<i>you can blame it all on me</i>

447
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,900
Hey!

448
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
Wait a second!

449
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,800
<i>I was wrong</i>
<i>and I just can't live without you</i>

450
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,971
There it is.

451
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,450
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

452
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,485
I think you're... No, no, no.

454
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,195
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,135
Okay.

456
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,104
Yeah.

457
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,730
All right, I'll see you at school.

458
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,899
All right.

459
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281
That's stupid.

460
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
Oh, God.

463
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
Oh, my God. I love my car.

464
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,867
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

465
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,640
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,513
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,213
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,722
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.</i>
<i>And when we do,</i>

470
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

471
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,309
<i>Apparently, there are</i>
<i>very few survivors.</i>

473
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,612
Yes, Mr. President?

474
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,655
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,862
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,198
Shoot.

477
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,903
Gross.

478
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,769
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,304
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,293
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,233
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,328
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

484
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,748
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,377
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,289
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

494
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,204
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,776
What the...

498
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.</i>
<i>Repeat, shots fired.</i>

499
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,586
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

500
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,803
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,007
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,242
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

505
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,376
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,152
No!

507
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,026
Dad, call the cops!

509
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,932
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,772
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,336
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

512
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,013
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,036
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,075
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,906
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

518
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
and if you find <i>Busty Beauties</i>
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

519
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,473
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,212
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

522
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,004
Oh, my God.

524
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,099
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
Oh, my God.

526
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,414
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

527
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

528
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,363
Listen, listen, listen.

530
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

531
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

535
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,949
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

536
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,687
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,923
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,395
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,564
It's become the system.

542
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,536
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

545
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,983
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,483
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,622
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

550
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,356
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,126
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,963
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,537
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

565
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

567
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

568
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

575
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
What was that?

579
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
Hey, heads up!

585
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,098
English, dude. English.

588
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,634
Whoa!

589
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,800
Watch out!

590
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,552
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

591
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,711
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,948
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

593
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,462
Get up! Get up! Come on!

594
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,371
Go! Move it!

595
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,782
Take cover!

596
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,151
Fig! Cover the rear!

597
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,699
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,827
Come on! Give me a mag!

599
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,663
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

600
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,865
Papa!

601
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,738
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

602
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,210
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

603
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,905
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

604
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,277
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,350
Fire!

606
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,145
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

607
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,745
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,752
I don't have a credit card!

609
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,959
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

610
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,761
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:15,168
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,804
Ammo!

613
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,537
I need a credit card!

614
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,277
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

615
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,646
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

616
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,950
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,952
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

618
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,051
Okay, it's Visa.

619
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,557
Also, sir, have you heard about

620
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,756
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

621
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,997
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

622
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,269
Give me a status.

623
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,236
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

624
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,040
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,113
Survivors?

626
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,612

to the nearest AWACS.

630

Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

631
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,462
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,179
Hey! Make way!

633
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,111
- What is that?
- I don't know.

634
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,088

659
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,846
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!

660
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,620
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!

661
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,817
Get a medic!

662
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,017
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

663
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,321
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

664
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,294
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

665
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,731
Bring them home.

666
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,505
<i>You get those men stateside right now.</i>

667
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,704
<i>I want them debriefed in 10 hours.</i>

668
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,852
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

669
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,994
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

670
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,799
I am sorry to bother you.

671
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,733
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

672
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,834
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

673
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,606
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

674
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,840
Shut up, Grandma!

675
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,383
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

676
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,578
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,083
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

678
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,592
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

679
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,036
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

680
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,971
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:22,244
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

682
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,177
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,513
- Please.
- Sorry.

684
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,676
Hey, man, save my game.

685
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,651
How classified?

686
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,050
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,294
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,891
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

690
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,560
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

691
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,936
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,702
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,448
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,110
in less than a minute.

697
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,415
- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,327
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
"Project Iceman"?

700
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,537
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,406
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,601
Cops! Cops!

703
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,408
FBI! Clear right!

704
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,344
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,021
Cops!

706
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,448
Lock it down.

707
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,048
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,722
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,458
Especially police!

710
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,831
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here</i>
<i>an hour ago</i>

711
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,804
<i>when over 40 C-17 s lifted off</i>
<i>of this very base.</i>

712
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,466
<i>We're not told where they're going.</i>

713
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:00,565
Morning, Mo.

714
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,975
<i>The government has been very quiet</i>
<i>about what's going on but in our...</i>

715
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,707
- Mojo. Mojo.
- <i>They were headed directly</i>

716
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,339
<i>towards North Korea.</i>

717
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,317
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

718
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,686
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

719
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,817
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

720
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,829
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

721
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,729
Stop!

722
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,569
No, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,207
Oh, my God!

724
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,017
Sam?

725
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,088
Hi.

726
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,654
That was... That was really awesome.

727
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,852
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

728
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,952
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

729
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,928
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

730
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,262
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

731
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,725
Oh, great. Cops.

732
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,034
Officer!

733
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,439
Listen!

734
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,947
Oh, that hurt.

735
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,173
Listen to me!

736
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,152
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

737
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,917
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

738
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,619
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

739
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:04,190
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

740
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,994
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,175
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

742
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,112
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

743
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:24,852
Okay.

744
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,861
Oh, God, no! No!
