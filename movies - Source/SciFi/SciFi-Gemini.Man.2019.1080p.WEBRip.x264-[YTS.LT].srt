1
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,917
Car number 6, we are moving.

2
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,132
"4 alpha", repeat, "4 alpha".

3
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,109
Window seat, his
team's on all sides.

4
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,292
Copy that.

5
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,409
Speed?

6
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,324
238 km/h and holding steady.

7
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,390
You alright over there?

8
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,990
I do love getting
me some bad guys.

9
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,860
Wait! Wait!
Civilian in play, I repeat

10
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,163
civilian in play.

11
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,061
- Clear.
- Confirm.

12
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:37,628
Confirmed.
Clear, code green.

13
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,099
Are we shipping to
the same place?

14
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,129
Yes, sir.

15
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:53,569
Alright.

16
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:55,801
That was your best ever.

17
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,242
I was... I was impressed.

18
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:58,865
Where I hit him?

19
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,247
Neck.

20
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,614
On a moving train.

21
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,978
- You took a video?
- Yeah, I took video.

22
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,641
Man, meet everybody else, look.

23
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:17,795
- Delete it.
- Henry.

24
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:19,403
Come on, listen.

25
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:22,072
4 shooters wift on this guy
before you got the call.

26
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,161
Alright, 4.

27
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,521
All of 'em studs.

28
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,439
And you bring him off.

29
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,199
That was beautiful, alright.

30
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,773
I got emotional, tear fell.

31
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,103
Delete it.

32
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,411
I'll delete it.

33
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,199
I'll delete it, alright.

34
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:23,711
Can't do this.

35
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:27,199
What's up, my brother?

36
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,555
You alright?

37
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:32,600
I got him in his neck.

38
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,862
But I was aiming at his head.

39
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:37,555
Other lines of work
you can lose a step.

40
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:38,465
Not this one.

41
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:41,096
You still the best we got.
Best anyone's got.

42
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,874
Believe me, I keep track.

43
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:44,255
Not a soda, not today.

44
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,050
- Meaning?
- Give me a beer.

45
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,590
Are you sure?

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,480
- Are you really retiring?
- Yes, sir.

47
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,043
Then I'm sure.

48
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,199
Okay.

49
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,922
A lot of guys can shoot, Dell.

50
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:02,262
They aren't you, they don't
have the history you do.

51
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:04,081
Yeah, I think the... the history

52
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,529
might be the problem.

53
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:07,331
Henry.

54
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,682
We've been through a lot
together, you and me.

55
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:12,519
We do world safer.

56
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,139
I just not gonna trust a
new guy like I trust you.

57
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,329
There was a kid...

58
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,151
beautiful little girl.

59
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,120
Right next to him.

60
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,920
If I'm 6 inches off -

61
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:33,053
she's dead.

62
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,353
Understand?

63
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,384
This time

64
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,624
I got lucky.

65
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,504
I didn't feel the shot.

66
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,524
Not like I should have.

67
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,973
72 kills, Dell.

68
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,153
That shooot starts to
mess with you a little bit.

69
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,293
Deep down it's like...

70
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,528
my soul was hurt.

71
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,262
I just want some peace.

72
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,612
So, what do I do now?

73
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,812
Wish me well.

74
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,533
Good morning.

75
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,302
Hey, where's Jerry?

76
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,512
Jerry retired.

77
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:39,677
They couldn't take anymore
of his bustling pace.

78
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:40,817
I'm Danny.

79
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,483
Hey Danny, I'm Henry.

80
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:48,043
I owe you $23.46.

81
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:49,483
Okay, thank you, Henry.

82
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,682
So, what are you fishing for?

83
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,552
Peace and quiet

84
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,509
and mackerel.

85
00:07:58,098 --> 00:07:59,548
Head now to Preachers Point?

86
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,586
Is that what you recommend?

87
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,613
Well, seems like a
nice enough day for it.

88
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:14,672
Not much of a "live and let live"
guy, I take it.

89
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:16,865
I'm deathly allergic to bees.

90
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,427
You a student or
just a fish whisperer?

91
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,923
I'm working my way
to grad school.

92
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:23,923
Marine biology.

93
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,507
UGA, Darian?

94
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,207
Go dogs.

95
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,168
Well, you be careful around here.

96
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,210
There is some dogs out
on these docks too.

97
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,710
Nothing I can't handle.

98
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,576
Well, I guess I don't
have to ask how business is.

99
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:57,554
Could have been yours.

100
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,888
Only asked you 10 times.

101
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,618
Hey brother.

102
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:09,488
- It's good to see you, Henry.
- You too, Jack.

103
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:13,567
What you doing there?
Feeling sexy?

104
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,168
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Of course.

105
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:20,070
- You still married?
- Yup.

106
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,895
Wife's on a shopping
trip to Paris.

107
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,046
Son's in boarding school.

108
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:26,302
You?

109
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,192
No, no wife, no kids, no Paris.

110
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,985
Here's to the next war -

111
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,075
- which is no war.
- which is no war.

112
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,735
So, what've you got?

113
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,965
Recognise him?

114
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,094
Who's asking?

115
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,619
Your old friend who's afraid
you're in trouble.

116
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:56,488
Do you?

117
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,566
I AMF'ed him in Ličge.

118
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:01,355
They tell you who he was?

119
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,298
Valery Dormov.
Terrorist.

120
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,349
No.

121
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,794
Valery Dormov.
Molecular biologist.

122
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:12,873
Who worked here in the
States for 30 years.

123
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,328
I read his file.

124
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:16,958
Bio-terrorist.

125
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,562
The file was spiked.

126
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,477
I don't know by who.

127
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:23,280
Why?

128
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,126
I don't know that, either.

129
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:26,984
Where are you getting this from?

130
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,553
A friend.

131
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,144
From the other side.

132
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:31,833
Alright, well.

133
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:34,033
- I need to talk to him.
- Sure.

134
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:36,758
Skype? Facetime?

135
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,414
I need to talk to him, Jack.

136
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:44,085
Oh, what a hell.

137
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,745
He owes me.

138
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:52,918
I hope I'm wrong.

139
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:56,015
I just want you to be careful.

140
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:07,687
It's me got full of things
I didn't do in my DIA years.

141
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:12,255
You think you didn't do that
in your DIA years?

142
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,403
This guy.

143
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,543
They tell you who he was?

144
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,663
Valery Dormov.
Terrorist.

145
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,058
No.

146
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,001
Valery Dormov.
Molecular biologist.

147
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:34,779
Who worked here in
the States for 30 years.

148
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:39,378
You took a real
risk contacting me.

149
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:40,426
I wish you hadn't.

150
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,725
What was I supposed to do?

151
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,003
I love you, brother.

152
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,246
You too.

153
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,668
It's a pitty.

154
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,707
I've always liked Henry.

155
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,332
Henry is DIA, Clay.

156
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,605
He's one of mine.

157
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,116
He knows you lied to him.

158
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,523
We have a tail on him.

159
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:01,712
Standard protocol for retirement.
He'll be contained.

160
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,195
Contained?
Henry Brogan?

161
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:07,453
He has Dormov's contact.

162
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:12,331
He's gonna pull on that thread
until he's pointing a gun at our faces.

163
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:15,523
What about his handler,
the bald guy?

164
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:16,323
Patterson?

165
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:19,333
He won't be happy, but he
won't cross me, he'll fall in line.

166
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,099
I'll tie this off.

167
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:23,624
Make it look like a Russian op.

168
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,075
You'll do nothing!

169
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,028
I'll tell my team
that Henry's gone rogue.

170
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,213
I can handle this.

171
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,168
Right after you wift
4 times on Dormov.

172
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,123
No.
You need Gemini.

173
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:35,174
I will not let you do hints
on American soil.

174
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:38,196
You don't have anyone
who can take on Henry Brogan.

175
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,245
I do.

176
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,091
We'll clean up our
own messes, thank you.

177
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:49,135
Everything that we worked for is
at stake thanks to your failures.

178
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,767
You have one chance
not to screw this up.

179
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,701
Please.

180
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:56,581
Surprise me.

181
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,096
Any luck?

182
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,225
Okay.

183
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:51,498
Most guys try flowers or a
playlist they think I'll find romantic.

184
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:52,918
Are you DIA?

185
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:56,268
That depends what's DIA?

186
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,019
Dance Instructors of America.

187
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,609
Did Patterson send you
to surveil me?

188
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,791
- Patterson?
- Del Patterson?

189
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,331
Funny coincidence,
he was just here.

190
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,970
Look, you're burnt.

191
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,303
Your cover's blown.

192
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,559
Okay, well I was just...

193
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,969
in the middle of
Marvin Gaye song,

194
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,115
so I'm gonna go back to that.

195
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,409
Name 3 buildings on a
Darian Campus.

196
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,576
- Really?
- Come on, marine biologist.

197
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,811
Rhodes Hall, McCourter Hall, Rocker Hall.

198
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,047
Now I know you're DIA.

199
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,260
Civilian would've told
me to piss off.

200
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,076
Not a polite civilian.

201
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:31,095
You good, you good.

202
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,296
Where you live?

203
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:33,582
What?

204
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,491
No, I wanna see your place.

205
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,490
Excuse me?

206
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:40,706
Where, I am sure I
won't find a single book

207
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:41,840
on marine biology.

208
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:46,052
But I'm certain I'll find a
big ol' fold on Henry Brogan.

209
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,393
Excuse me?

210
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,493
Okay, this has been fun,
but I kinda have to do that job.

211
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:51,722
Sorry, sir.

212
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:53,331
Yeah, I got the
30-feet bowrider.

213
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,605
- Okay.
- Needs some gas and...

214
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:55,606
Hey, sir.

215
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:56,706
One sec.

216
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm sorry, I...

217
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,282
Can I buy you a drink?

218
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,354
Why, so you can keep
interrogating me?

219
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:08,854
No, I'm probably gonna
spend the whole time apologizing.

220
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,674
Pelican Point?

221
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:12,999
Sunday nights,
they have a great band.

222
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,860
Please, what time do
you get off work?

223
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,318
- 7
- Think I also need a 12-volt bilge pump.

224
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:24,799
Alright, I'll see you at 7.

225
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,907
Just leave the crazy
at home, please.

226
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,107
Alright.

227
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:50,996
Sorry about earlier.

228
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:54,065
Bad habits.
I don't trust people easily.

229
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:55,932
But I'm sure you don't either.

230
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:58,701
Why would you say that?

231
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:09,903
Where did you get that?

232
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:13,889
25 years of faithful service
you make some friends.

233
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,335
Now I'm burned.

234
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:19,873
Toast.

235
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,231
Is Patterson running you?

236
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,557
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

237
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:35,518
Boilermaker's a cop drink.
You got cops in your family?

238
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,033
My dad was FBI.

239
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,894
And pretty big on
serving our country.

240
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:41,969
Was?

241
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,937
Yeah, he died off duty.

242
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,668
Trying to stop a bank robbery.

243
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,427
Sorry about that.

244
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,100
File says you were 4 years Navy
"Fifth Fleet", Bahrain.

245
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,287
Yeah, did love the sea.

246
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:58,596
Didn't love being stuck in a tin can with
couple hundreds sailors, though.

247
00:16:58,908 --> 00:16:59,350
Yeah.

248
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,510
Beats a bunker in Mogadishu.

249
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,171
So, then DIA.

250
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
Defence Clandestine Services.

251
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,561
Recruiting, running assets.

252
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,576
Not a single demerit.

253
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I mean...

254
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:19,874
So then the Inspector General
sticks you on a dock

255
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:23,226
to watch a guy who
just wants to retire?

256
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,451
That doesn't bother you?

257
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,023
Well, this is adios, Henry.

258
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:35,539
It's been nice surveilling you.

259
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,145
I'll probably be sent somewhere
else tomorrow.

260
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:39,215
Yeah.

261
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,509
You... you want a ride home?

262
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:43,285
No, thanks, my apartment
is just right over there.

263
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,323
Henry, why are you retiring?

264
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:57,835
I'm finding myself avoiding
mirrors lately, so...

265
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,557
I'm gonna take that as a sign.

266
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,297
Watch your six out there.

267
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:04,431
You too.

268
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,951
Night, Toast.

269
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:19,762
You should come
look at the stars, Jack.

270
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,142
<i>- You have to work on your kick.
- Charlie.</i>

271
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:13,603
<i>- Concentrate, Henry.
- Come one!</i>

272
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,595
<i>You're 5 now
and this isn't hard.</i>

273
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:17,143
<i>Now.
Try again.</i>

274
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,375
Hi, this is Jack, I'm sailing.

275
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:17,267
Please tell me this means
we're back in business.

276
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:18,422
Where are you?

277
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,182
Just some goddamn surveillance.

278
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,182
Get out of there, now!

279
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,910
Do not go home, do not
go to your girl's house.

280
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:26,412
Go to the bus station,
get a ticket, in cash.

281
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:29,528
Do not use an ATM.
Go somewhere where nobody knows you.

282
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:31,258
You sure?

283
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:34,875
They're outside my window, sorry man
I made you a loose end.

284
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:35,999
Come on man, I'll be fine.

285
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,291
How do I contact with you?

286
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:39,333
You don't.
Don't contact anybody.

287
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:40,732
Especially anybody from the DIA.

288
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,653
And get rid of your phone, now.

289
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:44,411
Oh, come on, Henry.
Stop.

290
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:47,648
Marino?

291
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,375
It's not gun time.

292
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:20,790
It's coffee time.

293
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,031
Do you have a burn bag?

294
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,075
First, tell me what
you're doing here.

295
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,294
Somebody just sent
a team to kill me.

296
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:29,863
And you're still asleep.

297
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:32,442
That means you didn't
know about it, correct?

298
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,515
No, of course not.
I would've told you.

299
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,548
That means you're next.

300
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:42,322
Get dressed.

301
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,569
All the boats have dupe keys
in the office, right?

302
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:50,427
You got a fast one?

303
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,837
Feeling the call of the sea?

304
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:07,178
Where is he?

305
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,127
You can tell me now.

306
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:11,577
Hey, drop!

307
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,076
Bitch!

308
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,244
You can tell me now...

309
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,569
or you can tell me in 5 minutes,
minus your teeth.

310
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,076
But you gonna tell me.

311
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:39,402
I counted 3.

312
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:40,835
How many did you bring?

313
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,096
Who sent you?

314
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:10,457
You can tell me now or you
can tell me in 5 minutes...

315
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,938
minus your teeth.

316
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,138
You alright?

317
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:22,022
- It's Lassiter.
- How do you know?

318
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:38,489
You get on this boat,
you're leaving behind

319
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,444
everything and
everybody you've ever known.

320
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:41,688
Do you understand that?

321
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:56,565
Scared is good.

322
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,107
It means you're alert.

323
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,932
Never had anybody
try to kill me before.

324
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:03,194
Yeah, well, the important
thing is he didn't.

325
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:08,605
What scares you?
Other than bees.

326
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:10,536
Drowning.

327
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:41,238
So this is you,
cleaning up your own messes?

328
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,588
Spare me the lecture.

329
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,970
It's like watching the Hindenburg
crash into the Titanic.

330
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,940
Tell me what we're
going to do about Henry.

331
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:50,217
Henry Brogan is like
any other soldier.

332
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,064
When they're young and stupid
they believe anything you tell them.

333
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:54,422
Then they get older, they

334
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:55,548
wear out.

335
00:24:56,265 --> 00:24:57,931
Grow a conscious.

336
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:02,541
This is why we need
a new breed of soldier.

337
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,672
Gemini will handle this.

338
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,805
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

339
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:09,531
I'm not asking your permission.

340
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,721
You wanna go to your bosses?

341
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:13,921
I'm sure they'd love to hear
about our little rogue project.

342
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:18,122
I'll make it look
like a Russian hit.

343
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:20,430
You give Henry a state funeral.

344
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:23,641
Flag on the coffin.
21-gun salute.

345
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:26,719
You give a nice speech,
everyone cries.

346
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:28,778
He'll be remembered as a hero.

347
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:30,507
Life goes on.

348
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:32,769
- Not for Henry.
- Oh, come on.

349
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,814
Mutts like Henry were born
to be collateral damage.

350
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:37,827
Let's not pretend otherwise.

351
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,343
Do you have an asset in place?

352
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,521
I have the perfect asset.

353
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,067
- Alright
- Just...

354
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,340
No, I'm good.

355
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:55,851
You hungry?

356
00:25:56,492 --> 00:25:59,349
Yeah, I'm starving, but those
things expired 3 years ago.

357
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:02,095
Really?

358
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:04,250
Still taste good.

359
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:09,358
While he still had teeth
that guy said you were the rogue.

360
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:11,412
And you believed him?

361
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,010
99% sure he was lying.

362
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,771
That 1% sucks, doesn't it?

363
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:25,644
Henry, has this ever
happened to you before?

364
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:26,797
Which part?

365
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:29,192
Your own government
trying to kill you.

366
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:32,228
Nah, that's new.

367
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:36,327
You've been agency a while and
can't you guess what this is all about?

368
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:40,528
Trust me, if I could I would not be
on this lovely vacation with you.

369
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Well.

370
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:48,135
When I'm the head of the agency, we're
gonna handle retirement very differently.

371
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,450
My man.

372
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,953
Baron tour is here
to pick up Brogan.

373
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,207
Party of two.

374
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:25,963
- Good to see you man.
- You too.

375
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,165
Danny, meet the Baron.

376
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:31,381
Middle-aged reprobate and
best pilot I've ever known.

377
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,933
Danny, Baron.

378
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:34,135
Hey, Toast.

379
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,508
Got your appliances requested.

380
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,367
For now, you can hold
up to my place at Cartagena.

381
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:42,508
You'll be anonymous and safe.

382
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:45,712
Yeah, we're kinda
in the shooot here, man.

383
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,233
I think Jack is dead.

384
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:52,701
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

385
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,142
- Anyone follow you?
- No.

386
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:56,684
They will.
Let's go.

387
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:59,088
- Can I have one of those crackers?
- Sure.

388
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:00,396
Thanks.

389
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:12,446
Does he do this at home?

390
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:14,150
I don't think so, I don't know.

391
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,586
- Do you?
- No.

392
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:18,730
If it's inappropriate to do this
sort of thing at home.

393
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,412
Why would you think it's appropriate
to do it in your science class?

394
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,339
I don't know, probably because
science is so wicked boring.

395
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:30,977
Hello.

396
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:32,971
Guess you really didn't
want me to retire.

397
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:35,377
Henry, you're okay!
Thank God!

398
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:36,378
Stop it!

399
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,605
Is Marino dead?

400
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,458
Yes.

401
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:42,919
Jack Willis?

402
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:46,015
It wasn't me. None of this was
me Henry, I swear it.

403
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,246
I trusted you, Dell.

404
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,375
You still can. Let me call you
on another line.

405
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:56,253
You got 30 seconds.

406
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,359
Hey, excuse me.

407
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:03,682
Could I borrow your
phone for 5 minutes

408
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,683
if I give you a hundred bucks?

409
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:10,174
We'll start with who's idea
it was to send a team

410
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:13,171
to agent Zakarweski's apartment,
was that necessary?

411
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:16,531
Also not my call, she's working
for the Inspector General, not me.

412
00:29:16,602 --> 00:29:17,634
Is she with you?

413
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:18,374
Yes.

414
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,648
Not voluntarily.

415
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,125
Okay, listen, this is not something
I wanna say over the phone.

416
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,236
I'm at my kids, goddamn, school!

417
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,357
What a hell is all of this?!

418
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,188
We have a problem.

419
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,258
Gemini.

420
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:36,688
Your old friend, working with
Janet Lassiter and her people.

421
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,657
I can't stop them.

422
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:42,208
Okay, Dormov.

423
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:45,087
Did he have something
to do with Gemini?

424
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:48,988
Dormov, the guy that you had
me pop on the train.

425
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,338
Because you said he
was a Russian terrorist.

426
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,940
Was he working for Gemini?

427
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,578
Once upon a time.

428
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:00,323
So you got me pulling
triggers for Clay Verris.

429
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:04,101
Henry, I regret my
lack of candor, but listen...

430
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,105
How many other times
you do this to me, Dell?

431
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,492
How many times you spiked a file,

432
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,258
send me off to AMF somebody
who didn't deserve it?

433
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,690
Never, ever.
This was the one-off.

434
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,290
I swear on my son's life.

435
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:20,121
Alright, look.

436
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,553
Agent Zakarweski is
not a part of this.

437
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:25,713
Henry, we can fix this.
I swear, but I need

438
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,382
both of you to come back.

439
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:29,933
To what, Dell?

440
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:35,291
Okay, Gemini.

441
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,288
What do you know about it?

442
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:38,854
Privatized paramilitary
owned by Clay Verris.

443
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:40,593
Agency does a lot of
business with them.

444
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:41,594
Is there more?

445
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:44,732
Baron and I served under
Verris in the Marines...

446
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,758
in Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

447
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:51,022
After he left the military, he started
Gemini and tried to hire us.

448
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,125
We both told him "no".

449
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,556
Except I was smart enough
to move 1,500 miles away.

450
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:55,815
Yeah.

451
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:58,084
I blew that one.

452
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:16,942
Verris gets billions of
dollars a year to take

453
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:19,923
out targets in any
way he sees fit.

454
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:21,820
That's Gemini...

455
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:25,257
off-book kidnappings,
tortures.

456
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:28,710
They're who you call when
you need 12 Saudi princes

457
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:30,952
to quietly disappear.

458
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,833
Or you want somebody
to train your death squads.

459
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:37,324
6 weeks into Sniper School

460
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:40,202
Clay Verris takes me out
on this boat, about 5 miles.

461
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,852
Ties this weights to my ankles,
tosses me overboard.

462
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:46,447
Tells me tread water
as long as I can.

463
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:48,989
And he didn't know
about your fear of...

464
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,001
Of course did.
That was the point.

465
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,535
So what did you do?

466
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:00,426
I tread water for
as long as I could.

467
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:04,494
And then I drowned.

468
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:07,845
Dead.

469
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:13,095
He fished me out,
paddled my chest.

470
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:19,065
Told me I was now ready
to serve under his command.

471
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:24,595
A toast.

472
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:30,173
To the next war...

473
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:31,905
- which is no war.
- which is no war.

474
00:32:31,913 --> 00:32:32,913
No war.

475
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:35,040
We'll figure it out in the morning.

476
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,635
Right now we can
use some shut-eye.

477
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:38,960
Sure, you folks
want one room or...

478
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:40,490
Two.

479
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Two, two.

480
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,980
Yeah, I can put him
in the garage if you want.

481
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:51,582
Alright, two rooms will be fine.

482
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,565
Just giving you options.
Okay, right this way.

483
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,580
Sniper, rooftop, I leave,
he's gonna follow.

484
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:40,980
I need you to go with
Baron some place safe.

485
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,072
Alright?

486
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,503
Shooter, on the roof.

487
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,961
You are a shity house
guest, you know that?

488
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:55,300
- How the hell did they find us?
- She's good, she's really good.

489
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,315
She just doesn't know
what she doesn't know.

490
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,990
Take care of her, alright?

491
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,896
Stop right there!

492
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:22,925
Who are you?

493
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,648
I don't wanna shoot you!

494
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:28,545
Fine.

495
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:30,117
Don't shoot me.

496
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:32,219
But I'm gonna shoot you.

497
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,195
I could have killed
you on the roof.

498
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,333
Maybe you should have.

499
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:43,902
Did they show you a
picture of me?

500
00:36:44,862 --> 00:36:46,722
Yeah, you look old.

501
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,724
Kid, you take one step closer.

502
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:55,987
You gonna leave me no choice.

503
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,481
Get off! Get off!

504
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:21,286
Move, move!

505
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:34,132
Get out of the way!

506
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:26,590
Stop. Stop. Stop!

507
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,943
Hands up!

508
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:03,447
What the hell was that?

509
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,737
Brogan.

510
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:31,791
Thank you, sir.

511
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:34,298
- Thank you, Captain.
- No problem.

512
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:39,139
Your place is burned, give me
somewhere I can see him coming.

513
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:43,753
I wanted to go in
there guns blazing,

514
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:46,456
but she thought the diplomatic
approach made more sense.

515
00:42:46,987 --> 00:42:49,483
Yeah, gunfire might
have been kinder.

516
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:51,588
Great work in there.

517
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:52,989
What now?

518
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:54,748
I need you to get
me to Budapest.

519
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,059
- What's in Budapest?
- What's in Budapest?

520
00:42:57,447 --> 00:42:59,518
Jack's informer, Yuri.

521
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:04,315
These guys aren't trying to
kill me because I wanna retire.

522
00:43:04,402 --> 00:43:07,827
They're coming after me because they
think Jack told me something classified.

523
00:43:08,306 --> 00:43:09,840
Yuri ought to know about it.

524
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,559
I'm sorry, partner, but my Aztec
doesn't have that kind of range.

525
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,326
Well, I was hoping we would
borrow something that does.

526
00:43:16,914 --> 00:43:17,914
Maybe a G?

527
00:43:20,371 --> 00:43:22,061
Taking someone's Gulfstream?

528
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:24,985
I mean you... you'd really have
to love the guy to do that.

529
00:43:27,228 --> 00:43:29,858
I know just the fellow.
Give me a minute.

530
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:39,393
? Well, I got a woman, way over town?

531
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:43,862
? That's good to me, oh yeah?

532
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:48,777
? I got a woman, way over town?

533
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:53,543
? Good to me, oh yeah?

534
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:58,072
? She give me money when I'm in need?

535
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:04,791
Henry?

536
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,221
Did you ever have a kid?

537
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:10,355
No, why?

538
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,193
Guy on a motorcycle.

539
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:16,248
Did you notice anything
funny about him?

540
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:18,764
I noticed he was very good.

541
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:19,945
Right.

542
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,619
And the face?

543
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,079
Similarity?

544
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,483
Yeah, I noticed that too.

545
00:44:29,804 --> 00:44:30,804
So...

546
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:33,492
You never had a
long-term relationship?

547
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:34,556
No.

548
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,052
Unless we count you.

549
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,543
Is it possible that you
could've had kid without knowing it?

550
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:42,543
No.

551
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,606
- Then how do you explain...
- Danny.

552
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:50,387
Alright?

553
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:03,106
Thank you, by the way.

554
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:05,172
For?

555
00:45:05,476 --> 00:45:08,536
For leaving Baron's apartment,
so I wouldn't be a target.

556
00:45:09,862 --> 00:45:13,061
Coming and getting me in Georgia
when you could've just ran for you life.

557
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:14,628
I just...

558
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:19,548
wanted to put you on a private plane
and give you a free trip to Hungary.

559
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:22,398
Where I'm gonna find...?

560
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:24,449
"Hungarians".

561
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:27,079
Right.

562
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,858
When I saw him.

563
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,128
It was like I was
seeing a ghost.

564
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,958
Ghost with a gun.

565
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:43,028
Like...

566
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:45,628
every trigger I've ever pulled.

567
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:20,978
I told you to stay in Colombia
and wait for orders.

568
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:25,378
I wanted to talk to you.

569
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:40,728
He is very good.

570
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:42,728
He's the best.

571
00:46:43,545 --> 00:46:45,012
That's why I sent you.

572
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:52,469
He knew every move of
mine before I made it.

573
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:56,981
I'd have him, right there,
and... take the shot

574
00:46:57,675 --> 00:46:58,625
and...

575
00:46:58,626 --> 00:47:00,327
he'd be gone.

576
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:03,489
Like a ghost.

577
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:06,318
Did you get a look at his face?

578
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,789
Not really, I saw him
at the stairs through a dirty mirror.

579
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:13,938
I thought you were on the roof.

580
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:16,240
I was, he got a line on
me, I had to jump down.

581
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:17,842
What do we always drill?

582
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:21,565
You hold the high ground, you
put his back against the wall

583
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:23,108
and you don't let him go.

584
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:26,371
I know that.

585
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,617
Whole thing was weird.

586
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:32,757
Just...

587
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:33,882
wicky.

588
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:35,659
How?

589
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:37,655
I don't know, it was...

590
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:38,838
As if I were...

591
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,931
watching it all.

592
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,159
Who is he?

593
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:47,987
Junior, this thing, that you
are struggling with, this strangeness.

594
00:47:48,027 --> 00:47:49,487
It's fear.

595
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:51,268
Don't hate it,

596
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:53,648
lean into it.

597
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:55,668
Embraced it.

598
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:56,534
And then overcome it.

599
00:47:56,536 --> 00:48:00,505
You, are right in the threshold, son.

600
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,922
This cause.

601
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:09,092
You hungry?

602
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:12,961
Yes, sir.

603
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:15,961
Bowl of cereals hungry?

604
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,311
Yes, sir.

605
00:49:22,632 --> 00:49:25,096
Thank you. That's it. Hands up.

606
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:30,568
Over here, everybody
back to one.

607
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:31,934
Everybody back to one.

608
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,791
That's one, let's go!

609
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:46,855
- Lots of new faces.
- Yeap.

610
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,585
They'll be the first
boots on the ground in Yemen.

611
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:55,003
Do they understand the rules of
engagement, or, just...

612
00:49:55,003 --> 00:49:57,063
whatever moves, they shoot it?

613
00:49:57,711 --> 00:50:00,711
They are elite,
they're disciplined.

614
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:04,159
And if they get a clean shot at their
target through an apartment window

615
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,193
they'll take it.

616
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:10,398
You should think about
that on your way to Budapest.

617
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:14,047
Henry's just landed there.

618
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,168
You're moving out.

619
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,527
Aniko?

620
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:41,273
Thank you for your time.

621
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,329
Here are the samples.

622
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:51,797
Least I can do for you in...

623
00:50:52,235 --> 00:50:53,235
2 days.

624
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,150
This I need in 2 hours.

625
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,780
We have a meeting with Yuri.

626
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,980
He agreed to sit with us.

627
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,280
You alright?

628
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,280
I think I know why is
he as good as you, Henry.

629
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:16,952
He is you.

630
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:19,681
What?

631
00:51:20,802 --> 00:51:23,601
There's a DNA lab here,
I gave them samples.

632
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:27,251
Yours and the baseball
cap he was wearing.

633
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,552
He just, he looks so much like you.
I thought he had to be your son, so I...

634
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:35,501
They did 3 tests.

635
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:37,302
Your DNA and his.

636
00:51:38,222 --> 00:51:40,081
All 3 came back identical.

637
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,952
Not close, identical.

638
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:45,771
As in, same person.

639
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,141
He's your clone.

640
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,539
I thought I've made a mistake that I
gave them two samples of the same person.

641
00:51:55,563 --> 00:51:56,563
But I didn't.

642
00:51:58,481 --> 00:51:59,981
He is you.

643
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:01,813
How's that even possible?

644
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:04,081
It's complicated,
but it's doable.

645
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:06,778
All you'd really need is a
surrogate mother and a DNA sample.

646
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,719
If they could clone a person.

647
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:10,918
You'd think that
they'd clone more

648
00:52:10,976 --> 00:52:12,909
doctors or scientists, not...

649
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
me.

650
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:16,306
They could've cloned
Nelson Mandela.

651
00:52:16,364 --> 00:52:20,213
Nelson Mandela couldn't kill a man
on a moving train from 2 kilometers away.

652
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:40,706
Yuri?

653
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:45,572
Mr. Brogan?

654
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,804
Before we begin, I must confess.

655
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:01,206
I have admired your
work for many years.

656
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:05,826
Wait.
So you know who I am?

657
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:08,885
"Long time listener,
first time caller,"

658
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,885
as they say in your country.

659
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,577
I would congratulate you

660
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:16,668
on your retirement, but...

661
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:18,585
your last job has...

662
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:20,132
loose ends, yes?

663
00:53:20,157 --> 00:53:21,001
Yeah, well,

664
00:53:21,025 --> 00:53:22,833
My government lied to me,
then tried to kill me.

665
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:23,858
If that's what you mean.

666
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:25,173
Yes.

667
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:27,800
In Russia, you call
that "Tuesday".

668
00:53:28,257 --> 00:53:31,588
But Americans, it
hurts you feelings.

669
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:33,773
So.

670
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:36,481
So, why was Dormov trying
to go back to Russia?

671
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,940
And why was I sent to kill him?

672
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,391
Yeah, down to business.

673
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,076
Very American.

674
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:43,184
You are a busy man.

675
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,130
We were both friends with Jack.

676
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,300
He was a good man.

677
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,231
I mourn his death, like you.

678
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,675
But the reason you are here

679
00:53:54,677 --> 00:53:56,409
and I have not killed you

680
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
yet.

681
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,240
Is we share a common enemy.

682
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:03,070
Clay Verris.

683
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,871
He lured Dormov to the west,
funded his lab.

684
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,240
And now you have met the
fruits of their labor.

685
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,275
Dally the Sheep
was cloned in '96.

686
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:16,693
- But in '95...
- I was the sheep.

687
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,525
Take it as a compliment.

688
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:20,726
And you are the only one.

689
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:25,155
With your DNA, Verris raised
the boy as his own son.

690
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:28,108
Trained him to be
the perfect assassin.

691
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:31,409
So why was Dormov
trying to leave?

692
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,536
For years, we tried
to lure him back.

693
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,820
Nothing.

694
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,021
Then last year they
had a falling out.

695
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:39,697
Dormov got scared,
reached out to me.

696
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:40,367
So I...

697
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,532
That still doesn't explain
why I was sent to kill him.

698
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:47,702
We have indications Dormov
made a breakthrough.

699
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,001
Modified human DNA.

700
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:52,302
A path to mass production.

701
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:56,132
But Dormov wanted soldiers
to be stronger, smarter.

702
00:54:56,172 --> 00:54:57,722
Verris...

703
00:54:58,456 --> 00:55:00,786
Verris wanted something else.

704
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:04,003
What something else?

705
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,570
Mr. Brogan.

706
00:55:06,072 --> 00:55:08,621
You are the best at what you do.

707
00:55:09,114 --> 00:55:10,880
But still you get tired,

708
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:12,494
you have fears, doubts,

709
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:15,208
you feel pain, perhaps remorse.

710
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:17,786
You have a conscience.

711
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:20,271
This makes you human.

712
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:23,054
But sub-optimal as a soldier.

713
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:25,271
Less than perfect.

714
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:27,041
Less profitable.

715
00:55:29,992 --> 00:55:33,492
Clayton Verris is
playing God with DNA.

716
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:36,277
He must be stopped.

717
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,485
If he's that dangerous
why not send a missile?

718
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:42,096
Blow up his lab.

719
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:44,847
That is what we're doing.

720
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:45,998
Except...

721
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,460
you

722
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:49,606
are the missile.

723
00:55:50,425 --> 00:55:52,175
I wish you luck.

724
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,822
One last thing.

725
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:58,375
You escaped from
home two days ago?

726
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:01,590
Amazing work.

727
00:56:01,614 --> 00:56:03,775
I was on the edge of my seat.

728
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:06,153
Wait, what?

729
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,619
How the hell you
know about that?

730
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:13,317
I'm a big fan, what can I say?

731
00:56:18,038 --> 00:56:20,311
If even half of what
he's saying is true.

732
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:21,889
We gotta talk to this kid.

733
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:24,288
You're not gonna be
safe until you do.

734
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:27,041
So you think if your 50-year
old self showed up and told you

735
00:56:27,043 --> 00:56:28,992
you're her clone that
would make you calmer?

736
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:29,992
51.

737
00:56:30,903 --> 00:56:32,398
- What?
- Just saying, you're...

738
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:36,047
- You know you're 51, yeah?
- I rounded.

739
00:56:37,282 --> 00:56:39,862
He's the mirror you don't
want to look into, Henry.

740
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:43,041
But he's our best
shot in getting to Verris.

741
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,061
Janet Lassiter?

742
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:55,349
Who wants to know?

743
00:56:55,615 --> 00:56:56,856
I got a message for you, ma'am.

744
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:59,679
From a man who transferred $1,000
into my Feathercoin account

745
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:01,219
just to make sure you got it.

746
00:57:01,664 --> 00:57:03,088
Does this person have a name?

747
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:06,376
His name is "$1,000 into
my Feathercoin account".

748
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,775
<i>Hello, Janet.</i>

749
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,380
<i>Before you try to kill
me again, consider this.</i>

750
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:15,590
<i>Your home address
is 1362, Carol Grove.</i>

751
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:18,768
<i>The security alarm code is 1776.</i>

752
00:57:18,956 --> 00:57:21,117
<i>You awaken at 6:12
every morning.</i>

753
00:57:21,163 --> 00:57:24,652
<i>and stop for your decaf soy latte
with an extra shot by 6:42.</i>

754
00:57:25,197 --> 00:57:27,561
<i>Every night you stand in front
of your huge living room window,</i>

755
00:57:27,563 --> 00:57:29,695
<i>sipping a Jose Cuervo Margarita</i>

756
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,074
<i>with Forensic Files on the TV.</i>

757
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:35,652
<i>Wearing your nice,
comfy sweatpants.</i>

758
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:41,164
This is Lassiter.

759
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,643
There are shooters at
your 10 and 2.

760
00:57:43,643 --> 00:57:46,577
Get above of that chair,
you will be AMF'ed.

761
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:49,436
Now, if I thought the world
needed another me

762
00:57:49,436 --> 00:57:50,882
I would've had a kid.

763
00:57:51,663 --> 00:57:53,831
The program predates
my arrival at the agency,

764
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:54,882
You must know that.

765
00:57:54,882 --> 00:57:56,362
Yeah, perfect DC answer.

766
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:58,632
If something goes wrong - duck.

767
00:57:59,402 --> 00:58:01,422
Tip the bike guy.

768
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:03,135
You can go.

769
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,771
Now, I have your agent
with me against her will.

770
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,811
Danielle Zakarweski.

771
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:11,436
She wants to come in.

772
00:58:12,172 --> 00:58:13,172
Fine.

773
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:15,731
Now, like me, she is a patriot.

774
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:17,014
Unlike me,

775
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,597
she still wants to spend
the next couple decades

776
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:21,786
scoring touchdowns
for you assholes.

777
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,936
Her safety is non-negotiable.

778
00:58:25,478 --> 00:58:27,086
10 and 2, Janet.

779
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,117
Decaf soy latte,
an extra shot for Janet?

780
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:31,262
The only person I'll
turn her over to

781
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,804
is the guy you sent
after me in Cartagena.

782
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:36,266
Don't even think about
sending anybody else.

783
00:58:36,335 --> 00:58:38,916
Family reunion, very sweet.

784
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:39,789
Yeah.

785
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:42,990
Keep it up, you'll be the first
person I've ever killed for free.

786
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:45,644
How quickly can you
get him to Budapest?

787
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:48,625
5 minutes.

788
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,545
Good.

789
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:56,844
She'll be in the courtyard of the
Vajdahunyad Castle at midnight, tonight.

790
00:58:57,094 --> 00:58:58,744
Enjoy your latte.

791
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,916
What's AMF?

792
00:59:01,306 --> 00:59:02,574
Adios mother fucker.

793
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,615
How the hell does
he know we're here?

794
00:59:17,775 --> 00:59:19,679
This is gonna work, right?

795
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,260
Yes.

796
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:23,083
How do you know?

797
00:59:24,045 --> 00:59:26,224
I know his taste.

798
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,425
Wait, are you saying
you are attracted to me?

799
00:59:30,324 --> 00:59:31,324
Me?

800
00:59:31,744 --> 00:59:33,505
Now? Hell no.

801
00:59:33,592 --> 00:59:37,222
But the younger, less
mature version, maybe.

802
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,929
When I came for you in Georgia,

803
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,320
I didn't have to think
about that, it was instinct.

804
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:54,320
He was born with that too.

805
00:59:54,911 --> 00:59:57,472
Besides, he wants me.

806
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:07,891
Right.

807
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:16,641
Lovely courtyard.

808
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:19,536
I'm sorry, ma'am.

809
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:22,659
Before we go any further,
I'm gonna need you to strip.

810
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,556
I beg you pardon?

811
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:28,806
Need to be certain
you're not wearing a wire.

812
01:01:31,556 --> 01:01:33,056
Okay, first of all.

813
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:34,833
Ma'am?

814
01:01:35,353 --> 01:01:37,954
I was raised to respect my elders.

815
01:01:40,003 --> 01:01:42,003
Take off your clothes, please.

816
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,923
Turn around, please.

817
01:02:41,315 --> 01:02:42,864
I see you like to be thorough?

818
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:46,385
Caution is kept me alive.

819
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:52,206
Call this burner.

820
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:01,885
Thank you.

821
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,405
Brogan.

822
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:08,106
In 12 minutes, I'm putting 2
bullets in the back of her head.

823
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:10,706
Your orders are to
deliver her safely.

824
01:03:10,806 --> 01:03:12,755
My orders are to kill you.

825
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:16,385
Are you familiar with the
quartz chamber of the catacombs?

826
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:17,068
Negative.

827
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:19,885
We're doing this someplace
visible, where I can see you.

828
01:03:20,322 --> 01:03:22,152
Now you have 11 minutes.

829
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:27,282
Get dressed.
We're taking a ride.

830
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:41,844
Cab was a smart move.

831
01:03:43,077 --> 01:03:44,077
Where are you from?

832
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:47,333
Your formality, it's Southern.

833
01:03:53,036 --> 01:03:55,349
You know if you gonna use me
as bait and possible murder me

834
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:57,827
then the least you can do
is indulge me in some conversation.

835
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,862
Just outside Atlanta.

836
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:05,123
You two have a lot in common.

837
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:06,807
I doubt that.

838
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:08,916
You'd be surprised.

839
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:12,322
You know I started
following him too

840
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,548
just like you're doing.

841
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,065
Then I got to know him.

842
01:04:17,226 --> 01:04:18,710
He's got a big heart, like you.

843
01:04:21,012 --> 01:04:23,242
What do you know about my heart?

844
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:26,478
I know that you have one.

845
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,880
And I know that it's telling you
that something about the job

846
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:31,427
you've been given isn't right.

847
01:04:31,905 --> 01:04:33,373
A job is a job, ma'am.

848
01:04:46,972 --> 01:04:48,967
I wonder how much you
payed the custodian.

849
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:51,811
Wow.

850
01:04:52,407 --> 01:04:53,836
Left.

851
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:58,206
Undo the chain.

852
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:03,777
Basement.

853
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:06,230
You must really know the city.

854
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,871
I watch a lot of Nat Geo.

855
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,090
- It says "Off limits".
- Ma'am.

856
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:19,655
I wonder how many
people are buried down here.

857
01:05:19,835 --> 01:05:21,143
Stand over there.

858
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:51,835
Go.

859
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,157
If you knock out all the lights,

860
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:57,603
how are you gonna see your
own tripwire on the way out?

861
01:05:58,096 --> 01:06:00,422
A grenade is no joke,
I mean I get the idea.

862
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:04,344
Darkness neutralizes his biggest strength,
and close quarters favors you, right?

863
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:06,628
I mean he can't throw a
grenade without killing me too.

864
01:06:06,652 --> 01:06:08,490
But what if I tries gas?

865
01:06:08,626 --> 01:06:10,530
You know, or some
sort of sedative agent?

866
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:11,882
Way ahead of me.

867
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:13,858
Gas mask and night
vision, very smart.

868
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,378
- Over there.
- Zip ties!

869
01:06:15,378 --> 01:06:16,891
These must be for me?

870
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:18,985
But can I ask you something?

871
01:06:18,985 --> 01:06:22,083
Would you actually stop talking
long enough for me to answer?

872
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:23,903
How much do you know about him?

873
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,538
I mean, would they tell you
why they wanted him dead?

874
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:26,539
Guy cracked.

875
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,262
Killed 8 ops in a single
night and his spotter.

876
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,175
- That's what they told you?
- That's what he did.

877
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:32,177
No.

878
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:33,213
No, not exactly.

879
01:06:33,213 --> 01:06:34,530
I was there.

880
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:36,103
The night all those
operatives were hit.

881
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,507
They'd been sent to kill him,

882
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:39,338
and me, by Gemini.

883
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,811
And not that it matters,
but his spotter was shot in Virginia

884
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:44,204
and the rest of those
men went down in Savannah.

885
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:50,541
Henry can shoot long distance,
but he can't shoot that long.

886
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,771
Come on, just think.
Does that make any sense to you?

887
01:06:57,842 --> 01:07:00,512
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It doesn't...

888
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:02,242
Better.

889
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:03,581
flap you.

890
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:07,277
Get up.
Go.

891
01:08:21,387 --> 01:08:22,814
Stay right there.

892
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:32,479
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

893
01:08:33,018 --> 01:08:34,582
Do you know how to
light one of those?

894
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:35,582
Jesus, Henry.

895
01:08:43,921 --> 01:08:45,784
Thanks for the tip
on the grenade.

896
01:08:47,037 --> 01:08:48,863
You were talking to
him all the time?

897
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:49,863
Yeah.

898
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:51,635
You either search somebody.

899
01:08:51,793 --> 01:08:52,793
Or you don't.

900
01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:55,962
And for the record.

901
01:08:56,743 --> 01:08:58,804
I do not want to kill you.

902
01:08:59,144 --> 01:09:01,774
But I absolutely will
if I have to.

903
01:09:03,043 --> 01:09:05,184
What did Clay Verris
tell you about me?

904
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:09,623
Okay, let me tell you about him.

905
01:09:10,144 --> 01:09:12,774
Cause I know Mr. Verris well.

906
01:09:13,423 --> 01:09:14,961
How did he start you?

907
01:09:15,242 --> 01:09:16,875
Hunting birds, rabbit?

908
01:09:16,876 --> 01:09:19,498
About 12 years old,
he moved you up to deer.

909
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:22,198
I'm guessing 19 or 20 years old,

910
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:25,002
the first time he ordered
you to shoot a person.

911
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,829
Any of these ring a true?

912
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,030
Yeah.

913
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:32,859
He told you to
lean into your fear.

914
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:35,025
Because you were a warrior.

915
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:37,795
Blessed with great gifts
to defend the weak.

916
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:42,059
But he couldn't stop the noise.

917
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:47,059
That secret part of you that always felt
a little different than everybody else.

918
01:09:47,796 --> 01:09:49,827
Part that felt like a weirdo.

919
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:52,060
You don't know shooot.

920
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,461
Kid, I know your inside
out and backwards.

921
01:09:55,314 --> 01:09:57,998
You allergic to bees,
you hate cilantro.

922
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,002
You always sneeze 4 times.

923
01:10:00,765 --> 01:10:02,895
Everybody hates cilantro.

924
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:08,779
You're meticulous, thorough,
disciplined, relentless.

925
01:10:09,225 --> 01:10:10,359
You love puzzles.

926
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:14,692
You are a chess player, right?

927
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:16,560
Good too, I bet.

928
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:20,783
But you suffer from insomnia,
your mind never lets you sleep.

929
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:23,970
And even when it does, it
attacks you with nightmares.

930
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:26,529
I am talking about those
3 o'clock in the morning,

931
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:29,402
"somebody please save me"
kind of nightmares.

932
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,680
And then there's the doubts.

933
01:10:31,704 --> 01:10:33,074
And those are the worst.

934
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,884
You hate them, and you
hate yourself for having them.

935
01:10:35,885 --> 01:10:37,300
They make you feel weak.

936
01:10:37,627 --> 01:10:40,212
A real soldier doesn't doubt, right?

937
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:45,278
The only time you
ever truly feel happy

938
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:48,613
is when you're flat on your belly
about to squeeze a trigger.

939
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:53,243
And in that moment,
the world makes perfect sense.

940
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:56,753
How do you think I
know all of that?

941
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:58,692
I don't give a shooot
how you know anything.

942
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:01,291
Look at me, dummy!

943
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:03,442
Look at us!

944
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:08,131
25 years ago, your father took
my blood and he cloned me.

945
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:09,921
He made you

946
01:11:09,947 --> 01:11:11,259
from me.

947
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:13,457
Our DNA is identical.

948
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:15,551
He's telling you the truth.

949
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,646
Shut up!

950
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:19,265
He chose me cause there's
never been anybody like me,

951
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:22,472
and he knew one day I was
gonna get old and then you'd step in.

952
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,882
He's been lying to
you the whole time.

953
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,887
He told you, you were an orphan.

954
01:11:27,494 --> 01:11:30,966
And of all the people in the world to
come after me why would he send you?

955
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,390
Because I'm the best.

956
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:35,886
You are, obviously,
not the best.

957
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:40,332
You're a hard ass hit.

958
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:45,328
Guess this was supposed to
be your birthday or something that.

959
01:11:45,525 --> 01:11:48,461
I had to die, and
you had to do it.

960
01:11:48,774 --> 01:11:50,670
As long as I was alive somehow,

961
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,099
Clay's little experiment
was incomplete.

962
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:55,753
That's the maniac you're
pulling the trigger for.

963
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,895
Shut your mouth about him!

964
01:11:58,055 --> 01:11:59,328
You're just trying to rattle me.

965
01:11:59,351 --> 01:12:01,006
I'm trying to save you!

966
01:12:02,793 --> 01:12:05,262
What are you, 23?

967
01:12:05,844 --> 01:12:07,582
Still a virgin, right?

968
01:12:08,261 --> 01:12:09,261
Yeah.

969
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:11,853
Dying to be in a
relationship and connect,

970
01:12:11,854 --> 01:12:14,871
but terrified to
let anybody near you.

971
01:12:16,155 --> 01:12:20,507
Because what if somebody
actually saw who you are?

972
01:12:21,015 --> 01:12:22,780
How could they love you?

973
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,969
So, everybody's just targets.

974
01:12:26,327 --> 01:12:28,157
And you're just a weapon.

975
01:12:31,106 --> 01:12:32,106
Hey! Hey!

976
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,550
Hey!

977
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,989
Don't shoot him!

978
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:38,965
Don't shoot him!

979
01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:33,417
No! Don't!

980
01:14:33,655 --> 01:14:34,655
Drop it!

981
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:36,768
Drop it! I will shoot you!

982
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:39,228
No, you won't.

983
01:15:18,568 --> 01:15:20,467
Take your hands off of him!

984
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,322
Let him go!

985
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,090
Right now!

986
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,051
I'm not you!

987
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,400
You hear me, old man?

988
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,600
I'm not you!

989
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:46,577
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

990
01:15:46,907 --> 01:15:49,060
- Did you hit him?
- I think so, yeah.

991
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,809
- Where?
- Shoulder, I think.

992
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:56,206
Then he'll recover.

993
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,875
Is that a good thing?

994
01:16:17,797 --> 01:16:18,105
You know,

995
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:22,318
It's not every day you see a guy
get his ass kicked on 2 continents.

996
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:23,561
By himself.

997
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,182
Where to?

998
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:34,284
Georgia.

999
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,051
Is where Verris is.

1000
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,190
Man.

1001
01:16:54,033 --> 01:16:55,684
That poor kid.

1002
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:58,319
He must be terrified.

1003
01:16:59,354 --> 01:17:02,734
Then he's going home,
walking into a buzz saw.

1004
01:17:07,974 --> 01:17:11,203
I gonna get some sleep, you too.

1005
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,453
Not me, that's where
the ghosts are.

1006
01:17:16,354 --> 01:17:17,734
Sleep.

1007
01:17:43,154 --> 01:17:44,554
Tell me something.

1008
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:48,734
Why is it so hard
for you to kill this man?

1009
01:17:51,203 --> 01:17:55,304
You know how much I hate
Big Hammock Park, pop?

1010
01:17:56,654 --> 01:17:57,833
What?

1011
01:17:58,854 --> 01:18:02,134
Ever since I was
about 12 years old.

1012
01:18:02,654 --> 01:18:06,953
We were to shoot turkeys
there for my birthday.

1013
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:10,554
And I always hated it.

1014
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:13,087
But I was an orphan, right?

1015
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:14,298
So, how would we

1016
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,900
even know when my Birthday was?

1017
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,462
But you never seen me
notice so we just keep going.

1018
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,560
Okay, so...

1019
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,590
Next year we'll
try Chuck E. Cheese.

1020
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:28,385
Yeah.

1021
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:31,011
You, me

1022
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:32,750
and the lab guys,

1023
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:33,908
who made me.

1024
01:18:40,908 --> 01:18:41,938
Yeah.

1025
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:47,368
I...

1026
01:18:49,432 --> 01:18:51,462
Always believed

1027
01:18:52,835 --> 01:18:55,814
you'd be happier not knowing.

1028
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,694
Happy?

1029
01:19:01,234 --> 01:19:03,265
You know when I'm happy, pop?

1030
01:19:04,515 --> 01:19:06,614
When I'm flat on my belly,

1031
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,265
about to squeeze the trigger.

1032
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:13,164
It's the only time I'm happy.

1033
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:17,505
And this wasn't even a mistake.

1034
01:19:18,944 --> 01:19:21,387
It's not like you got
someone pregnant

1035
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:24,605
and then had to man
up and raise me.

1036
01:19:24,762 --> 01:19:26,140
No, you...

1037
01:19:26,573 --> 01:19:27,640
made a decision.

1038
01:19:28,734 --> 01:19:31,592
To have a scientist
make a person

1039
01:19:31,594 --> 01:19:32,975
out of another person.

1040
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,327
No, that's not what it was.

1041
01:19:34,328 --> 01:19:36,045
That's exactly what it was.

1042
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:39,094
Then you sent me

1043
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:41,601
to kill him.

1044
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:45,105
Of all the shooters in
the world, why would you send me?

1045
01:19:45,106 --> 01:19:48,957
It's your darkness, you had
to walk through this on your own.

1046
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:52,636
Maybe you're my darkness.

1047
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,537
That lie you told me.

1048
01:19:58,716 --> 01:20:01,037
That my parents

1049
01:20:01,987 --> 01:20:05,377
dumped me at a fire station.

1050
01:20:07,077 --> 01:20:08,787
And I believed that.

1051
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:12,296
Do you know how
that made me feel?

1052
01:20:12,367 --> 01:20:14,591
It was a necessary lie.

1053
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,047
None of this shooot is necessary!

1054
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:20,194
You made a choice
to do this to me.

1055
01:20:20,194 --> 01:20:24,444
- Can't you see how not okay I am?
- Bullshit!

1056
01:20:24,965 --> 01:20:27,295
You forget who you
are talking to, Junior.

1057
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,649
I've seen battle.

1058
01:20:29,203 --> 01:20:30,882
I've seen soldiers
go over the edge because

1059
01:20:31,005 --> 01:20:32,880
more of was being asked of
them than they can give.

1060
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:34,327
That's not you.

1061
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,042
Your world is stable
and dependable.

1062
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:38,273
I made sure of that.

1063
01:20:38,574 --> 01:20:41,177
You have something that
Henry himself never had.

1064
01:20:41,179 --> 01:20:45,295
You have a loving,
dedicated, present father.

1065
01:20:45,367 --> 01:20:49,015
Who tells you every, god-damned, day that
you are precious and that you matter.

1066
01:20:49,015 --> 01:20:50,969
Jesus, the whole
point of this thing.

1067
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,912
Was to give you all of Henry's
gifts without his pain, and I did.

1068
01:20:56,175 --> 01:20:59,488
Don't doubt, Junior.

1069
01:21:01,787 --> 01:21:03,738
You're better than that.

1070
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:15,488
Come here.

1071
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,730
I love you, son.

1072
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:28,631
Just don't let yourself down.

1073
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,970
Like so many of my encounters,
it was short, but sweet.

1074
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,841
Thanks, baby.

1075
01:22:15,841 --> 01:22:18,091
It should be truck
here somewhere.

1076
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:28,360
Don't move.

1077
01:22:33,621 --> 01:22:34,695
What was in that?

1078
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:36,368
Bee venom.

1079
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:43,037
You can't do that.

1080
01:22:43,637 --> 01:22:45,225
You can't do that,
he's allergic.

1081
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:47,375
Henry, can you breathe?

1082
01:22:47,807 --> 01:22:48,994
Henry, try to breathe.

1083
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,201
- You okay?
- Please.

1084
01:22:51,364 --> 01:22:53,618
Henry, Henry, can you breathe?

1085
01:22:53,783 --> 01:22:54,783
Please!

1086
01:22:55,029 --> 01:22:56,944
Try to breathe, Henry.
Henry!

1087
01:22:58,274 --> 01:22:59,543
Breathe!

1088
01:22:59,912 --> 01:23:01,716
- Why are you doing this?
- Come on!

1089
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:07,021
- Why are you doing this?
- Henry, Henry, breathe!

1090
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,220
Come on!

1091
01:23:08,694 --> 01:23:09,694
Hey, hey.

1092
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:11,289
Breathe, Henry.

1093
01:23:22,534 --> 01:23:24,420
Epinephrine antihistamine.

1094
01:23:27,637 --> 01:23:28,898
You'll be fine.

1095
01:23:32,953 --> 01:23:33,953
I'm sorry.

1096
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:36,487
I had to be sure.

1097
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:38,815
No, it's all good.

1098
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:41,456
It's whole shooot's
been a little difficult.

1099
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,497
I hate to break up
the party, but

1100
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:46,261
how the hell do you always
know where we are?

1101
01:23:48,367 --> 01:23:50,037
They're tracking you.

1102
01:23:53,037 --> 01:23:54,707
Do you trust me?

1103
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:21,713
They chipped you.
During your surgery 3 years ago.

1104
01:24:26,547 --> 01:24:27,597
Verris.

1105
01:24:29,585 --> 01:24:31,135
You know him too?

1106
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:34,061
Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

1107
01:24:34,481 --> 01:24:36,261
Can you take us to him?

1108
01:24:38,109 --> 01:24:40,011
We need to shot him down.

1109
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:41,684
Both of us.

1110
01:24:53,587 --> 01:24:55,408
You grew up in
Philadelphia, right?

1111
01:24:55,774 --> 01:24:56,447
Yeah.

1112
01:24:56,623 --> 01:24:58,405
The place called the Bottom.

1113
01:24:59,277 --> 01:25:00,747
The Bottom.

1114
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:04,157
Tell me about my mother.

1115
01:25:07,046 --> 01:25:08,743
Helen Jackson Brogan.

1116
01:25:08,925 --> 01:25:10,992
Worked two jobs for 40 years.

1117
01:25:11,832 --> 01:25:14,131
That woman used to whip my ass.

1118
01:25:14,872 --> 01:25:16,289
Did you deserve it?

1119
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:17,612
Usually.

1120
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,180
Does being angry and stupid

1121
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:22,798
and never really trying at
anything mean you deserve it?

1122
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:28,073
Our father wasn't around much,
he left when I was 5.

1123
01:25:28,261 --> 01:25:31,764
And I think every time she
looked at me, she just saw him.

1124
01:25:33,193 --> 01:25:34,944
I had to get the
hell outta there.

1125
01:25:35,398 --> 01:25:36,920
Joined the Core.

1126
01:25:37,627 --> 01:25:40,283
First time I've ever made
any real friends.

1127
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:41,307
'Oorah!'

1128
01:25:43,315 --> 01:25:44,873
Met Clay Verris there.

1129
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:49,309
Found something I was
really, really good at.

1130
01:25:50,259 --> 01:25:52,594
By the time I left, I had
medals on the chest.

1131
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:55,367
She was gone, and...

1132
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:57,192
I have become this.

1133
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:02,797
You gotta walk away
while you still can.

1134
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,233
- This is all I know.
- No, this is all he taught you.

1135
01:26:07,456 --> 01:26:11,238
Stop now, you can still
become something else.

1136
01:26:13,274 --> 01:26:14,284
Sure.

1137
01:26:14,645 --> 01:26:17,314
A Doctor?
Lawyer?

1138
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:20,380
Husband, father.

1139
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:23,872
And all the things this job
gives you the excuse not to be.

1140
01:26:25,751 --> 01:26:27,145
I threw all of that away.

1141
01:26:29,329 --> 01:26:32,510
It's shame to waste these
gifts the second time around.

1142
01:26:37,069 --> 01:26:39,050
I'm sorry, what is your name?

1143
01:26:40,899 --> 01:26:42,538
It's always been Junior.

1144
01:26:43,229 --> 01:26:44,548
Clay Junior.

1145
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:48,048
I don't really know anymore.

1146
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:51,618
That's another really
good reason to quit.

1147
01:26:57,639 --> 01:26:59,328
Do you sure about this?

1148
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:01,916
I need to talk to him.

1149
01:27:03,514 --> 01:27:06,686
So, what happens
when we get to him?

1150
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,720
He's not gonna surrender.

1151
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,050
That's him.

1152
01:27:18,305 --> 01:27:19,349
Can I talk to him?

1153
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:22,494
I want to be the one to
tell him we all BFFs now.

1154
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:25,037
Take it.

1155
01:27:26,462 --> 01:27:27,641
This is Junior.

1156
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:28,975
Are you with Brogan?

1157
01:27:29,525 --> 01:27:31,878
Why would I be with him?
You sent me to kill him, didn't you?

1158
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,695
It doesn't matter, just run.

1159
01:27:35,671 --> 01:27:36,560
What?

1160
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,600
Run, get away from him.
Now.

1161
01:27:39,074 --> 01:27:41,306
Junior, I just want you safe.

1162
01:27:41,378 --> 01:27:42,378
Why?

1163
01:27:42,604 --> 01:27:44,627
Because I'm your
favorite experiment?

1164
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:48,015
No, because I'm your father
and you need to listen to me.

1165
01:27:48,016 --> 01:27:49,027
Run!

1166
01:27:51,787 --> 01:27:53,197
- Get out off the car!
- Go!

1167
01:27:59,096 --> 01:28:00,436
Baron!

1168
01:28:00,997 --> 01:28:01,997
No!

1169
01:28:14,676 --> 01:28:15,987
Come on!

1170
01:28:24,426 --> 01:28:25,987
I'm sorry, Henry.

1171
01:28:33,527 --> 01:28:35,346
- Chief Mitchell?
- Go ahead.

1172
01:28:35,426 --> 01:28:38,146
Clay Verris, I need your
units to stand down.

1173
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:39,305
Sir?

1174
01:28:39,462 --> 01:28:43,980
We're engaging with a terrorist cell that
has a weaponized biological capability.

1175
01:28:43,981 --> 01:28:46,555
All units, go back, immediately!

1176
01:28:48,051 --> 01:28:51,292
Federal authorities have been
notified and they en route.

1177
01:28:51,391 --> 01:28:53,546
Affirmative, keep me
posting, Clay.

1178
01:28:53,707 --> 01:28:54,707
Yes, sir.

1179
01:28:57,135 --> 01:28:59,296
You gotta stand your
men down, now!

1180
01:28:59,488 --> 01:29:00,963
You did the right thing, Junior

1181
01:29:00,965 --> 01:29:01,965
of walking away from him.

1182
01:29:02,355 --> 01:29:03,738
I did what a coward would do.

1183
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,291
Makes me sick!

1184
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:08,067
I was asking too much of you.

1185
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:09,579
I can see that now.

1186
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,645
He deserves better than a
missile shot into his car, pop.

1187
01:29:13,646 --> 01:29:16,912
It doesn't matter what he
deserves, he has to die.

1188
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:57,926
Are you gonna call
those goons off now?

1189
01:29:57,957 --> 01:29:59,680
No. But you can.

1190
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:02,890
Just fire that.
Take command.

1191
01:30:04,197 --> 01:30:06,867
Armor's weak at the joints.
Eyes and neck are the kill shots.

1192
01:30:07,538 --> 01:30:09,104
Take right, I'll take left.

1193
01:30:15,591 --> 01:30:16,729
Muscle, discipline.

1194
01:30:17,015 --> 01:30:18,198
Watch you round count.

1195
01:30:18,396 --> 01:30:19,663
You set, I spike.

1196
01:30:19,926 --> 01:30:21,478
- Ready?
- Roger that.

1197
01:30:38,801 --> 01:30:39,818
- I'm out!
- Take cover!

1198
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:49,417
Set!

1199
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,373
Get down!

1200
01:31:20,886 --> 01:31:24,545
I am trying to make you a man!

1201
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,074
I should have cloned myself.

1202
01:31:36,404 --> 01:31:39,993
Loving, dedicated,
present father?

1203
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:43,198
Right there!

1204
01:31:48,912 --> 01:31:50,292
Go ahead.

1205
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:52,692
Do it.

1206
01:32:03,493 --> 01:32:04,824
How many rounds you got left?

1207
01:32:08,435 --> 01:32:09,435
One.

1208
01:32:09,994 --> 01:32:11,345
Okay.

1209
01:32:20,274 --> 01:32:21,585
I'm sorry.

1210
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:22,801
For what?

1211
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:24,771
For getting you into this.

1212
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,487
I was the one surveilling you.

1213
01:32:26,634 --> 01:32:27,634
Yeah.

1214
01:32:28,565 --> 01:32:31,185
Anyway, sorry.

1215
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:34,323
Now let's fight our
way out of this thing.

1216
01:33:09,953 --> 01:33:11,460
You're a great partner.

1217
01:33:40,844 --> 01:33:42,224
Thank you.

1218
01:33:42,604 --> 01:33:44,163
Sorry I ran.

1219
01:33:44,444 --> 01:33:45,724
Yeah, that's been a rough night.

1220
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:47,658
How many more out there?

1221
01:33:47,886 --> 01:33:49,434
I didn't see any.

1222
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:50,569
Verris?

1223
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:52,909
Out of commission.

1224
01:33:53,501 --> 01:33:55,240
But still alive?

1225
01:33:57,511 --> 01:33:58,810
Yes.

1226
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:29,421
Here.

1227
01:34:29,876 --> 01:34:30,943
How bad is that?

1228
01:34:31,287 --> 01:34:32,287
I'm fine.

1229
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,360
You're not.

1230
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,011
Hold the elevator position.

1231
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:39,452
We gonna secure an out.

1232
01:35:50,771 --> 01:35:51,771
Back off!

1233
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:20,279
Don't you feel pain?

1234
01:37:51,645 --> 01:37:54,113
I don't know why
you're so angry, Henry?

1235
01:38:04,858 --> 01:38:07,307
You were the
inspiration for all of this.

1236
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:22,185
You know where I got the idea?
Are you okay?

1237
01:38:24,996 --> 01:38:26,386
Khafji.

1238
01:38:27,725 --> 01:38:31,131
Watching you go house to house,
wishing I had a whole division of men -

1239
01:38:31,418 --> 01:38:32,668
all as good as you.

1240
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:35,518
Wondering if that
could be possible.

1241
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,631
You should be flattered.

1242
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:42,030
You should be dead.

1243
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,440
You saw what
happened over there.

1244
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,881
An atrocities.

1245
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:51,190
Friends being sent home
in a pine box.

1246
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:54,797
Why should we accept that
If there is a better way?

1247
01:38:58,234 --> 01:39:01,024
And look what we created.

1248
01:39:05,992 --> 01:39:07,525
It's got both of us in.

1249
01:39:09,122 --> 01:39:11,703
Don't you think
your country deserves

1250
01:39:11,704 --> 01:39:13,372
a perfect version of you?

1251
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:16,488
There is no
perfect version of me,

1252
01:39:17,202 --> 01:39:19,207
or him, or anybody.

1253
01:39:19,466 --> 01:39:20,485
No?

1254
01:39:21,595 --> 01:39:22,703
He was on his way to Yemen.

1255
01:39:22,837 --> 01:39:23,639
Now thanks to you

1256
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,345
his place is gonna be taken
by someone with parents.

1257
01:39:26,511 --> 01:39:27,938
Someone who feels pain.

1258
01:39:28,474 --> 01:39:29,474
Fear.

1259
01:39:29,648 --> 01:39:31,733
Which we had edited out of him.

1260
01:39:31,734 --> 01:39:34,466
Someone with just as
many weaknesses,

1261
01:39:34,467 --> 01:39:35,952
as the terrorists
that we're trying to kill.

1262
01:39:35,953 --> 01:39:37,659
And you gonna
tell me that's better?

1263
01:39:38,957 --> 01:39:41,189
So why not make
a whole army of 'em?

1264
01:39:41,649 --> 01:39:42,649
Yeah, why not?

1265
01:39:44,207 --> 01:39:46,662
Think how many American
families we can spare.

1266
01:39:46,823 --> 01:39:49,506
Nobody's son, or daughter
would ever have to die.

1267
01:39:49,514 --> 01:39:52,552
No vet comes home
with PTSD and kills himself.

1268
01:39:53,347 --> 01:39:55,546
We can keep the whole world safe

1269
01:39:55,547 --> 01:39:58,090
without any actual grief, so...

1270
01:39:58,349 --> 01:40:00,309
Who would I be hurting?

1271
01:40:00,868 --> 01:40:03,193
You're talking
about people, Clay.

1272
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:05,090
Henry.

1273
01:40:06,234 --> 01:40:09,373
This is the most humane
thing that Gemini's ever done.

1274
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:12,685
How many more of me
are running around out there?

1275
01:40:13,893 --> 01:40:16,453
There's only one you, Junior.

1276
01:40:17,832 --> 01:40:19,493
He was a weapon.

1277
01:40:20,146 --> 01:40:21,707
You're my son.

1278
01:40:23,796 --> 01:40:25,225
And I love you.

1279
01:40:26,305 --> 01:40:30,025
As much as any father
ever loved any kid.

1280
01:40:34,572 --> 01:40:36,141
I don't have a father.

1281
01:40:37,421 --> 01:40:38,435
Goodbye, Clay.

1282
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:39,791
Hey, hey.

1283
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,724
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

1284
01:40:51,423 --> 01:40:53,842
Gonna turn him in?
They not gonna try him.

1285
01:40:53,844 --> 01:40:55,748
They not gonna
shot down his lab.

1286
01:40:56,265 --> 01:40:57,881
We have to end
this this right now.

1287
01:40:58,019 --> 01:40:59,019
Hey.

1288
01:41:00,372 --> 01:41:01,731
Look at me.

1289
01:41:03,481 --> 01:41:04,841
Look at me.

1290
01:41:06,212 --> 01:41:07,350
You pull that trigger

1291
01:41:07,717 --> 01:41:10,545
and you gonna break something
inside of yourself.

1292
01:41:12,122 --> 01:41:14,914
That will never get fixed again.

1293
01:41:22,862 --> 01:41:24,021
Don't.

1294
01:41:29,402 --> 01:41:30,692
Let it go.

1295
01:41:31,801 --> 01:41:33,231
Give it to me.

1296
01:41:38,881 --> 01:41:41,072
You don't want those ghosts.

1297
01:41:42,202 --> 01:41:43,591
Trust me.

1298
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:24,796
You should know
better than that.

1299
01:42:26,298 --> 01:42:27,943
Surprised you give a shooot.

1300
01:42:29,069 --> 01:42:29,779
Well...

1301
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:32,095
We can't be friends anymore.

1302
01:42:32,582 --> 01:42:34,655
Because you did
let them try to kill me.

1303
01:42:34,884 --> 01:42:38,024
But, that doesn't mean I wanna
see you drink yourself to death.

1304
01:42:40,286 --> 01:42:42,310
The Gemini lab's
been dismantled.

1305
01:42:42,971 --> 01:42:45,038
Cloning program is history.

1306
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:48,180
And Junior?

1307
01:42:48,864 --> 01:42:50,329
He's untouchable.

1308
01:42:50,475 --> 01:42:52,942
No one will bother him.
Ever.

1309
01:42:53,984 --> 01:42:56,555
And we checked,
there are no more clones.

1310
01:42:57,743 --> 01:42:59,234
What about you?

1311
01:43:00,085 --> 01:43:01,520
IG called.

1312
01:43:01,521 --> 01:43:03,561
I'm looking at charges, but

1313
01:43:03,563 --> 01:43:06,539
if I bury Janet,
I can make a deal.

1314
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:09,201
She earned it.

1315
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:15,211
I'm really sorry, Henry.

1316
01:43:19,095 --> 01:43:21,956
- Take care, Dell.
- Yeah, you too. ten thirty

1317
01:43:22,427 --> 01:43:24,318
And happy retirement.

1318
01:43:54,007 --> 01:43:55,648
Hey.

1319
01:43:58,957 --> 01:44:01,427
Hey.

1320
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:03,400
Good to see you.

1321
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:05,430
Congrats on a promotion.

1322
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,046
I heard they got big plans.

1323
01:44:07,047 --> 01:44:10,109
Well, after you pretty sure
I can handle anything.

1324
01:44:11,423 --> 01:44:14,395
- How've you been?
- Good, just...

1325
01:44:14,396 --> 01:44:15,717
Settled Baron's estate.

1326
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:18,096
Scattered his ashes
in the Caribbean.

1327
01:44:19,131 --> 01:44:21,078
I don't know, all I
wanna do now is

1328
01:44:21,181 --> 01:44:23,043
put some good in the world.

1329
01:44:23,045 --> 01:44:24,675
Just gotta figure out how.

1330
01:44:25,328 --> 01:44:26,328
Yeah, you will.

1331
01:44:27,257 --> 01:44:28,944
You sleeping okay?

1332
01:44:29,408 --> 01:44:30,408
Better.

1333
01:44:30,608 --> 01:44:33,231
- No ghosts?
- Not like before.

1334
01:44:33,712 --> 01:44:36,131
Oh, and I actually looked
in the mirror the other day.

1335
01:44:36,252 --> 01:44:38,612
- Really?
- It wasn't horrendous.

1336
01:44:40,282 --> 01:44:42,042
Speaking mirrors.

1337
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:56,051
Catch you later.

1338
01:44:57,073 --> 01:44:58,073
Hey.

1339
01:45:11,065 --> 01:45:11,730
What's this?

1340
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,679
This is you.

1341
01:45:13,837 --> 01:45:17,382
Passport, birth certificate,
driver's license.

1342
01:45:17,743 --> 01:45:19,430
Apparently you got
pretty good credit.

1343
01:45:20,893 --> 01:45:22,532
I love the name you chose.

1344
01:45:22,806 --> 01:45:23,806
Jackson?

1345
01:45:23,887 --> 01:45:25,020
It's my mother's name.

1346
01:45:25,048 --> 01:45:25,452
Hey.

1347
01:45:25,453 --> 01:45:27,319
She was my mother first.

1348
01:45:27,626 --> 01:45:28,626
Yeah, yeah.

1349
01:45:28,731 --> 01:45:30,688
Don't you "yeah, yeah" me,
young man.

1350
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:34,635
Come on, I know a
good place for lunch.

1351
01:45:38,551 --> 01:45:40,271
So you settled
down on major yet?

1352
01:45:40,273 --> 01:45:41,961
Leaning towards engineering.

1353
01:45:41,962 --> 01:45:42,962
Engineering?

1354
01:45:43,945 --> 01:45:46,216
Yeah, you should listen to her.

1355
01:45:46,286 --> 01:45:49,207
If I were you, which I sorta am,

1356
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:50,760
I'd go with computer science.

1357
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:51,782
Save that for grad school.

1358
01:45:51,783 --> 01:45:53,243
You want start with humanities.

1359
01:45:53,353 --> 01:45:55,081
- Okay, don't listen to her.
- Don't listen to him.

1360
01:45:55,104 --> 01:45:56,585
You need a grounding
on the classics.

1361
01:45:56,748 --> 01:45:59,055
Excuse me, I'm trying to
talk to myself over here.

1362
01:45:59,055 --> 01:46:01,060
Yeah, you are talking to yourself,
but you're not talking to him.

1363
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:03,479
Look, I just made a lot of
mistakes when I was young.

1364
01:46:03,479 --> 01:46:06,476
And I'd actually like to make
some of those mistakes myself.

1365
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:09,439
What I'm trying to say is, I made
them already so you don't have to.

1366
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:13,884
- But he's not you.
- Okay, everybody chill the hell out.

1367
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:16,850
I'm gonna be okay.

1368
01:46:22,347 --> 01:46:23,347
If you're okay,

1369
01:46:24,989 --> 01:46:25,989
I'm okay.

1370
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,819
What?

1371
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,988
I just can't believe that in
30 years I'm gonna look like

1372
01:46:35,162 --> 01:46:36,162
you.

1373
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:38,271
What? Please.
You wish.

1374
01:46:39,661 --> 01:46:42,761
Boy, you better hope you
look like me in 30 years.

1375
01:46:43,627 --> 01:46:48,257
This is 50-year old,
mature man meat

1376
01:46:48,649 --> 01:46:49,877
you're looking at.

1377
01:46:49,877 --> 01:46:50,877
51.

1378
01:46:51,011 --> 01:46:54,140
I brush, I floss.
I work hard.

1379
01:46:54,775 --> 01:46:56,095
When you're 50, I bet
you won't be

1380
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:59,481
dragging your ass around the
track every morning like I do.

1381
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:02,545
In fact, we can race now.

1382
01:47:03,065 --> 01:47:05,774
We can race right now, we'll
take it to the corner right now.
