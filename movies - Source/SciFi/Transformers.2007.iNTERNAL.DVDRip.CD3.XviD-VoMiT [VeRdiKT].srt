1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:01,245
- What?
- <i>... and the backup generator</i>

2
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:03,322
- <i>is just not gonna cut it.</i>
- Do you have an arms room?

3
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:11,492
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

4
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:12,997
I'll bring security to the...

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,624
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

6
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:17,327
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

7
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:18,802
Let's go!

8
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:20,668
They're popping our generators!

9
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:34,051
Megatron melting!

10
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:37,748
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

11
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:40,053
Stand by! Set!

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,219
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,765
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!</i>
<i>We're losing NBE One!</i>

14
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:53,200
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

15
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:57,299
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

16
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:05,477
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

17
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:06,609
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,654
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

19
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:10,484
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,852
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

21
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,323
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

22
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:15,417
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

23
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:17,258
Take him to his car!

24
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:20,193
Drop it.

25
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:23,629
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

26
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,896
Drop your weapon, soldier.

27
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:29,136
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

28
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:30,266
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

29
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:32,572
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

30
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:33,839
S-Seven don't exist.

31
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:35,710
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

32
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:39,080
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

33
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,315
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

34
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:47,484
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

35
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:53,966
All right. Okay.

36
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:58,697
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

37
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,404
No, no!

38
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:07,039
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

39
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:10,708
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

40
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,317
Are you okay?

41
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:17,281
They didn't hurt you, right?

42
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:29,832
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

43
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:34,331
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

44
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:36,671
They're not gonna hurt you.

45
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:40,303
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

46
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:43,678
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

47
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,273
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,832
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

49
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,295
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,502
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

51
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:40,004
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

52
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:43,132
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

53
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:44,642
Mission City is 22 miles away.

54
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:46,041
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

55
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,545
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

56
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,614
Good! Right.

57
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:51,445
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

58
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:53,610
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

59
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,585
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

60
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,283
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

61
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,824
In the alien archive, sir!

62
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,917
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

63
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,552
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

64
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,097
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

65
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,962
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

66
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:09,695
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

67
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,771
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

68
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,395
Affirmative!

69
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:17,340
<i>Warning! NBE One</i>
<i>cryo-containment failing.</i>

70
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,209
Check that backup system!

71
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:24,477
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

72
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,074
Come on! Get out of here!

73
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:27,710
Heads up! Look out!

74
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,122
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

75
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:34,660
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

76
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,430
I am Megatron!

77
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,658
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

78
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:08,750
Well, put the seat belt on.

79
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,022
Pour it on him!

80
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:25,768
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

81
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,279
Where is the Cube?

82
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,440
The humans have taken it.

83
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,688
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

84
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:39,591
Come on, Mags!

85
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,183
Over here, sir!

86
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,590
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

87
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,133
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

88
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:54,495
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

89
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,531
Mikes?

90
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:57,905
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

91
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,569
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

92
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,203
Let's find them.

93
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:02,781
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

94
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:05,043
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

95
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:08,211
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

96
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,618
- Glen?
- Huh?

97
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:13,214
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

98
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,315
What good is that?

99
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:16,827
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

100
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,491
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,431
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

102
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:35,738
There's Optimus.

103
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,167
Almost done.

104
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:58,903
What the hell was that?

105
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:03,670
Barricade the door!

106
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,778
- Get something.
- Watch out!

107
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,975
Six, five, four, six, three.

108
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:18,021
Here! Put some rounds in!

109
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:22,327
Master search.

110
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,220
I got it! We're transmitting!

111
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:26,457
Send exactly what I say!

112
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:30,696
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

113
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:34,830
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

114
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:36,465
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

115
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,201
What was that?

116
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:42,145
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

117
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,512
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

118
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,212
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

119
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:16,749
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

120
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,960
Oh, my God.

121
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,864
Cool, Mom!

122
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,752
This is so not good.

123
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,113
He's behind the pillar!

124
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:06,083
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

125
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:11,560
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

126
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:17,403
Sucker, burn!

127
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,507
Oh, shit!

128
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,869
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

129
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,106
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,</i>
<i>scramble, scramble.</i>

130
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,581
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

131
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,389
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

132
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,452
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

133
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:51,595
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

134
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,899
Here, I got shortwave radios.

135
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,635
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

136
00:10:56,742 --> 00:10:59,040
Well, use them! It's all we got!

137
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:02,437
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

138
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:05,483
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

139
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:08,281
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

140
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,480
F-22 at 12:00.

141
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,286
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

142
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,257
to extract that Cube. You got it?

143
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:20,163
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

144
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,093
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

145
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:24,529
<i>We have you visual.</i>

146
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,536
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

147
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,098
<i>Provide air cover and vector</i>
<i>Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

148
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,716
It's Starscream!

149
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:39,845
Please tell me you copy.

150
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:42,484
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

151
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,260
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

152
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:51,524
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

153
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,859
Incoming!

154
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:19,754
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

155
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,326
Clear the area!

156
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,657
Oh, my God.

157
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:32,402
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

158
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,169
Your legs.

159
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:39,370
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

160
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:43,347
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

161
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,111
Ratchet!

162
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,454
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

163
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:51,489
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

164
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:53,957
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

165
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,221
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

166
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,127
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

167
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,423
Come on!

168
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:03,661
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound</i>
<i>to your location. Over.</i>

00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,660
Move out! Let's go!

172
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,797
Let's go! Move!

173
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,071
I'm not gonna leave you.

174
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,209
Come on, Decepticon punk!

175
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,050
Oh, my God!

176
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,540
Concentrate your fire!

177
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:01,647
Come on. Come on.

178
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:05,918
Megatron!

179
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,292
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

180
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:20,163
Fall back!

181
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,373
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

182
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:30,506
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

183
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,880
We need air cover down here now!

184
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,290
Sam, help me with this.

185
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:48,797
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

186
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,994
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

187
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:53,401
No! I want two!

188
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,373
What's going on?

189
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:00,805
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

190
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,944
Oh, these things just don't die.

191
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,010
Oh, we're so dead.

192
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,453
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

193
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:12,746
Where's the Cube?

194
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:13,825
- Right there.
- Okay.

195
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:14,915
And take that and wrap it around

196
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:15,994
the base and then put it
around his neck.

197
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,757
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

198
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,666
That building.

199
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:27,235
- Okay.
- What?

200
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,308
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

201
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,673
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

202
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:34,973
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

203
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,014
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

204
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:41,519
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

205
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,850
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

206
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:46,015
or a lot of people are gonna die.

207
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,648
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

208
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,920
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

209
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,724
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

210
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,257
Army Black Hawk requested.

211
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,891
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

212
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:59,527
<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

213
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:02,732
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

214
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:07,676
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

215
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,780
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

216
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:21,652
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

217
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,991
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

218
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,826
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

219
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,572
Watch out!

220
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:46,208
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

221
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:47,979
Get out of here now!

222
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:16,815
Megatron!

223
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:18,083
Prime.

224
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:46,102
Humans don't deserve to live.

225
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:48,873
They deserve to choose for themselves.

226
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,681
Then you will die with them!

227
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,756
Join them in extinction!

228
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:20,639
Keep moving, Sam!

229
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,012
Don't stop!

230
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:40,020
No!

231
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,340
Sam, get to the building!

232
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:07,384
Give me that Cube, boy!

233
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,132
Did that jerk just dent my car?

234
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:46,953
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

235
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,399
I smell you, boy!

236
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,779
Maggot!

237
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:29,398
Oh, no!

238
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:55,797
I'll drive! You shoot!

239
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,052
This isn't going well!

240
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:19,556
Shoot! Shoot!

241
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:06,632
Nice shot.

242
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:10,196
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

243
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:21,744
Hey!

244
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:28,660
Hey! I'm over here!

245
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,701
We've got the boy.

246
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:48,745
Watch out!

247
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:50,308
Missile!

248
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,225
Hang on, Sam!

249
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,300
No! No!

250
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,038
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

251
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:38,062
Where do I go?

252
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:43,357
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

253
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,297
Oh, no, no, no, no.

254
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:52,909
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

255
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,843
Oh, so unwise.

256
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:09,283
I got you, boy.

257
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:12,893
Hold on to the Cube!

258
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:35,451
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

259
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,483
Sam?

260
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:48,995
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

261
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:51,202
No sacrifice,

262
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:55,631
- no victory.
- Lf I cannot defeat Megatron,

263
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:58,465
you must push the Cube into my chest.

264
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:02,074
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

265
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:04,014
Get behind me.

266
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,277
It's you and me, Megatron.

267
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:11,322
No, it's just me, Prime.

268
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,890
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

269
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:29,137
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

270
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:50,693
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

271
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:53,264
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

272
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,389
Hey.

273
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,761
Bring the rain. All right?

274
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,161
All right, let's kill these things.

275
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,698
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

276
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,800
Armor's weak under the chest.

277
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,445
Target marked. Still waiting.

278
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:19,581
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

279
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:28,624
F-22s, we're still waiting.

280
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:35,305
Move out!

281
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:39,771
Incoming!

282
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,413
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

283
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,905
Run! Move!

284
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,940
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

285
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,047
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

286
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:27,625
- <i>Copy.</i>
- <i>It's either a massive amount of...</i>

287
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:38,529
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

288
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:44,700
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

289
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:46,373
Take him out!

290
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:01,923
Two's down!

291
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:13,303
I'll kill you!

292
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:16,169
Mine! All Spark!

293
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:20,009
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

294
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:21,736
Sam!

295
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:23,808
No, Sam!

296
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:50,801
Hold up.

297
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:56,881
You left me no choice, brother.

298
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,358
Sam, I owe you my life.

299
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:12,224
We are in your debt.

300
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,150
Prime, we couldn't save him.

301
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,317
Jazz.

302
00:30:39,524 --> 00:30:41,719
We lost a great comrade

303
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,926
but gained new ones.

304
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:47,494
Thank you, all of you.

305
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:50,198
You honor us with your bravery.

306
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,204
Permission to speak, sir?

307
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:56,572
Permission granted, old friend.

308
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,142
You speak now?

309
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:01,170
I wish to stay with the boy.

310
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,878
If that is his choice.

311
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,844
Yes.

312
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:35,241
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

313
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,806
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

314
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:42,750
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is</i>
<i>seven miles below sea level,</i>

315
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:44,947
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

316
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,717
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,</i>
<i>coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

317
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:51,022
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

318
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,560
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

319
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:05,609
<i>With the All Spark gone,</i>
<i>we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

320
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,939
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

321
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:14,384
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

322
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:24,856
<i>We live among its people now,</i>
<i>hiding in plain sight,</i>

323
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:27,760
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

324
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:30,559
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

325
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,996
<i>I have witnessed</i>
<i>their capacity for courage.</i>

326
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:38,599
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

327
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,647
<i>like us, there's more to them</i>
<i>than meets the eye.</i>

328
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:47,674
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

329
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:51,453
<i>and I send this message</i>
<i>to any surviving Autobots</i>

330
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:54,548
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

331
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,322
<i>We are here.</i>

332
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,921
<i>We are waiting.</i>

333
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:24,245
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

334
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:32,753
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

335
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,264
- infestation...
- Yeah.

336
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:38,067
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

337
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:39,830
The government would let us know.

338
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:41,596
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

339
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:44,140
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

340
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:45,869
because there's no secrets.

341
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:48,070
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

342
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:01,421
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
