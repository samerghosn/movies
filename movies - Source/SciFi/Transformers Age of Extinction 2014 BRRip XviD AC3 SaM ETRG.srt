1
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,353
Oh, shit.
Darcy, you really shouldn't have come.

2
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,334
Show me.

3
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,663
Corporate was adamant. We keep running.

4
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:50,341
No stopping operations.

5
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,500
No, no, no. You got to go through.
No cameras.

6
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,509
He's got orders to kill. I don't even think
international laws apply up here.

7
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,640
We are geologists first.

8
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,519
If this thing
has any historical significance at all,

9
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,067
we are shutting down.
I am shutting us down.

10
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,049
Oh, he's going to shoot me? Shoot me.
Hey, don't kill her.

11
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,442
This is crazy stuff.

12
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,995
Crazy shit.

13
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,924
Well, what do you think?

14
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:34,006
I think history is about to change.

15
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,324
I am a nasty woman

16
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:13,632
Oh, look who decided
to show up for work.

17
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,009
I am a heartbreaker

18
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,685
Going to make you cry

19
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,021
What, surf report no good
at South Padre?

20
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:30,692
The waves are flat and I got no gas.
You know that, Cade.

21
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:34,858
Dude. Rude.

22
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:38,624
Look at these two junebugs.
Whoo. My, my.

23
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,497
Hey, you're paying me on this one,
right, Cade?

24
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:41,851
Please tell me I am getting paid.

25
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:44,209
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys
are just happy to have a job at all.

26
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:45,534
Yeah, I suppose.

27
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,379
- You got any cash on you?
- Yeah. All right, good.

28
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:57,675
Hey, Lucas Flannery.

29
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,680
Place has been
in the family since '28.

30
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,728
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

31
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,690
Real soon
he's going to sign it over to me.

32
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,394
The movies nowadays,
that's the trouble.

33
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,154
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.

34
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:15,356
I love that one. Oh.

35
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,233
He's deaf and senile.

36
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,488
Heard that.

37
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,821
Now these just need
some spit and polish.

38
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,747
I believe they're digital, possibly IMAX.

39
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
Yeah, they're not.

40
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,110
Mister, we will have a look around
if you want to leave us to it, okay?

41
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,591
You know, folks used to come from miles around
to see the dancing girls with the big cha-chas.

42
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,076
I swear to God I am one diaper change
away from poisoning his oatmeal.

43
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,463
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

44
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,264
If coming here makes you feel young, then
you tell this kid to bring you here every day.

45
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,262
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

46
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,588
Sold.

47
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,630
Remember this place when we were kids?

48
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,605
How many girls you think
you brought here in high school?

49
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,523
I only remember one.

50
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,653
Hey, heads.

51
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,154
Ow.

52
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,783
That's why you didn't make
the varsity team.

53
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,497
Ah.

54
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,420
All right. Go long.

55
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,302
Leave it.

56
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,821
Mortar shells?
What the hell happened to you?

57
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,750
Hey, snakeballs.
How much for the truck?

58
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,331
Truck?

59
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:12,149
Two more weeks, girls, till no more classes,
ever. Almost time to get a tan and get wasted.

60
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,716
Please, please.

61
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,427
No financial aid. Great.

62
00:07:54,682 --> 00:08:00,192
Yes, I know I am home, thank you.
Intruder alert. Back away from the premises.

63
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:05,927
Voice recognition. It's me.
I am dialing 911. Go right ahead. I don't care.

64
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:08,028
I am still calling 911.

65
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,365
The Battle of Chicago was an event that
permanently changed our world. Over 1,300 dead.

66
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,223
Much of the city has been destroyed.

67
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:18,389
Homeland Security is urging everyone
to report suspicious alien activity.

68
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:24,321
A swift act of Congress
put an end to all joint operations

69
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:28,346
between the military and the Autobots,
ending the alliance.

70
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,706
As this committee knows,
the Invasion of Chicago

71
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:33,142
was a defining day
for our nation five years ago.

72
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,144
The day millions of people realized that

73
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:39,677
never again can we allow aliens
to fight our battles for us.

74
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:46,043
A handful of Autobots were given sanctuary
after joint-combat operations were abolished.

75
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:49,287
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons
are still on the run

76
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,625
thanks to our CIA unit,

77
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,620
"Cemetery Wind."

78
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,318
Hurry, let's get it to my house, guys.
As for the alien technology,

79
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:58,698
our objective remains
to keep it in American control.

80
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,347
Hi. My name is Timothy.
This is my crew.

81
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,000
We found this alien ball turret
in Chicago.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,403
We just found it in the rubble and it's all
working... Word has it Japan, India,

83
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:10,551
the Israelis may have gotten their hands
on a couple of ships.

84
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,793
Apparently the Russians
are starting a bidding war.

85
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:16,476
We're taking $5,000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.

86
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,942
A new era has begun.

87
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,484
And the age of the Transformers is over.

88
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,043
Hey.

89
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,929
Hey, I have been waiting for you.

90
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,418
You're looking hot today. Oh, yeah?
How about you take your shirt off?

91
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,389
You want me to take my shirt off
right now?

92
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,000
What would your dad think of that?
What the hell? Hey, where you going?

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,740
I cannot believe him.
I cannot believe this.

94
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,062
What the hell?

95
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,855
All the way.

96
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,226
A truck?

97
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,490
Dad, please tell me
you didn't spend our money on this.

98
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,164
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't.
He spent my money.

99
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:17,520
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

100
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,201
As an advance
on your regular paycheck.

101
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,625
- What regular paycheck?
- Which you will get back.

102
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,172
- When?
- Never. We're broke.

103
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:27,859
I knew it. Sweetheart, could you please not
drive a wedge between employer and employee.

104
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,254
Hold on. I thought we were partners.

105
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,634
Look, I came up short, okay?
I had to buy her a prom dress.

106
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,149
You want me to deny her a prom dress?

107
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,701
You might as well.
You denied her a prom date.

108
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,724
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.

109
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:39,597
Nobody wants to go to the dance
with their dad. It's weird.

110
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,889
It's not the issue.

111
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,518
Well, maybe it should be.

112
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,299
Hey, could you guys just get off my case?
You know what the engine on this runs for?

113
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:46,700
I can break it down and strip it for parts.

114
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,158
And sweetheart, your shorts
are shrinking by the second, okay?

115
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,993
Cold water, air dry, please.

116
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,663
I think she looks hot.

117
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:56,822
What did you say?

118
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,602
Like a hot teenager.

119
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:03,126
Oh, it's the "teenager" thing that makes it better.
Thank you. It didn't sound like what it meant.

120
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,697
That goes by the circuit boards.

121
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,138
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

122
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,716
Dad, please. You can't keep
spending money on junk

123
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,597
just so you can turn it
into different junk.

124
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:19,428
We do not use the "J" word in here.

125
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,184
That is a Super Simplex
theater projector. It's very rare.

126
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,187
What about the SmilePilot?

127
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,052
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented?
Simply ahead of their time.

128
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,730
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.

129
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,696
You're going to get him upset.

130
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,282
Hey, Cade. Cade.

131
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,316
This thing still work? No.
Yes. Yes, and still groundbreaking.

132
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,620
Go back there and lay on the recliner
and just wait for a cold one.

133
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,506
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

134
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,802
Final notice, late notice, past due.

135
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,200
Come on, come on.
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on.

136
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,885
I mean, what is all this crap
people send you?

137
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,155
That's a Discman
and that's an 8-track tape.

138
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,999
- Music.
- Never heard of it.

139
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,600
Look, I fix that,
it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250.

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,148
If I would have been able to fix that before you
broke it even more, it would have been 20 bucks.

141
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,583
This stuff is what's
going to put you through college,

142
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,605
as long as you land
one of those scholarships.

143
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,488
What's the estimated time of arrival,
usually? Average?

144
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,860
Wait. So it just brings the beer near you?

145
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,144
That's the trick?

146
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,192
- It's got a couple kinks, man.
- Yeah.

147
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,899
Dad, you think maybe some things
should never be invented?

148
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,676
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking.

149
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:34,511
This is a temple of technology.
You guys are standing in a holy place.

150
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,261
What do you think?
Why don't you look at all of this?

151
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,459
This could be yours.
What about this land?

152
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,263
Purple People Eater's back
and she looks hungry.

153
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,014
Isn't this incredible?

154
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,062
- I knew you would like it.
- Hey, you. Hey.

155
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,823
I own this house. It's not for sale.

156
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:52,947
Six months late on payments, Mr. Yeager.

157
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:55,191
And I see you stealing power at the pole.

158
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,674
Hey, that's not your concern.

159
00:12:56,674 --> 00:13:00,299
- Sir, do you want to see the property? Sure.
- I'd be more than happy to give you a tour.

160
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,799
I will show you three other buyers
I got buried out back,

161
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,100
then I will crack your head open like an egg.
Whoa. Whoa. Stay back.

162
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,876
He's crazy.
I told you don't come back here anymore.

163
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:07,953
I will have my brother come back
and beat your ass.

164
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,876
Don't you start with me. Why don't you do it yourself?
And I will bring the police when I come, too.

165
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:13,158
- My brother ain't no joke.
- Who, Jerry?

166
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,618
You bring his big ass up here,

167
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:17,230
he's going to be huffing and puffing
before he can squeeze out of that car.

168
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,820
You back out on my grass,
you're going to be in big trouble.

169
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,144
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I will give him some pecan pie.

170
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,645
Hey.

171
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,980
She smashed through the fence?

172
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,063
Cade, relax.
You're going to have an aortic infarction.

173
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,193
What is that?

174
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:38,279
I think it's a brain heart attack.
Yeah, I have had one already.

175
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,693
So we're stealing power now?

176
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,323
No, we're borrowing it
from the neighbors.

177
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:43,498
Great. That's awesome.

178
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,408
Once I graduate and I am gone,
who's going to take care of you?

179
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,744
Oh, you take care of me?

180
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,971
Who taught you how to solder a circuit?

181
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,421
Or write a program?
Or French braid your hair?

182
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:54,334
Or throw a spiral? Me. That's what I do.

183
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,177
Who taught you how to cook
without ketchup,

184
00:13:56,177 --> 00:13:57,879
or balance your checkbook?

185
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,676
Who always has to be the grownup
around here?

186
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,105
All right, you got a point, okay?
But that means we're a great team.

187
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,727
And I know it's been sucky
around here lately.

188
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,777
But we're going to be fine, sweetie.
You just got to keep believing, okay?

189
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:14,195
I mean, that's what great inventors do.

190
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:18,240
I promise you, one day,
I am going to build something that matters.

191
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,695
I believe you, Dad.

192
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,661
You know, your mom
would be very proud of you.

193
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,125
It's going to be okay.

194
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,532
Spread out. Push right.
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

195
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,120
Give me two. Give me two.

196
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,160
Take the beach, nice and easy.

197
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,910
All right, hold what you got.

198
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,621
Release the mini-drones.

199
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,106
Vipers.
Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.

200
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,696
Got a heat sig. Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

201
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,157
Predator 0-1.
Captured target area.

202
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,900
Set charges.

203
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:52,109
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.
Eagles moving internal. Clear. Second deck.

204
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,706
Frogman 83, Frogman 83.

205
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,071
Breached site on rooftop.

206
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,698
- Breached site on rooftop.
- Have Echo Platoon on standby.

207
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,235
Let the helo know we're moving external.

208
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,907
Alpha, take port.
Bravo, take starboard.

209
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,966
Shift right. Shift right.

210
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,165
Cracking steel.

211
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,340
No.
Hit him, hit him, hit him.

212
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,849
Fire.

213
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,307
Missiles out. Danger close.

214
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,818
He's running. Move.

215
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,109
He's on the run.
He's on the run.

216
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,191
- No.
- Please.

217
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,789
Hold your fire.

218
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,219
Hold. Hold fire.

219
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,506
Can you not see? I have been injured.

220
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,932
Box him in. Box him in.

221
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:34,557
Medical Officer Ratchet. I am a friend.

222
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,567
I am an Autobot.

223
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,439
Then why are you running?

224
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,404
Optimus sent this distress message.

225
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:46,323
Calling all Autobots.

226
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:50,545
We are under targeted attack.
Cease all contact with humans.

227
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:54,912
We're all hiding.
All Autobots are being hunted.

228
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,563
We're all in danger.

229
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,498
I lost a sister in Chicago.

230
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,671
You will get no sympathy from me.

231
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,520
What's wrong with you humans?

232
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
No. Please.

233
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,532
Check fire, check fire.

234
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,458
He's mine now.

235
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,802
Lockdown.

236
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:56,140
Autobots, Decepticons.
Like little children, always fighting.

237
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,728
Making a mess out of the universe.
Then I have got to clean it up.

238
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,271
There is one way you survive.

239
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:06,194
Tell me where he's hiding.

240
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:09,569
Where is Optimus Prime?

241
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,367
Never.

242
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,500
Never is here.

243
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:36,000
I must say, it is remarkable, really astounding,
the success that the CIA has had

244
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,263
since you have taken operational control,
and so the President has asked me to ask you

245
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:47,402
to ask him, to invite you both over
to the White House just to powwow,

246
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:55,994
where we get maybe some more specifics about how
exactly you're hunting the enemy Decepticons left.

247
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:00,756
I have had my desk for two years.
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

248
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:04,355
He runs the projects
where I don't ask for specifics.

249
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:08,795
That's why they're called Black Ops.
And why we all sleep better at night.

250
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:11,434
Check. That is great. So, um...

251
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:17,662
Any dirt on that?
Uh, how, uh, how that's going?

252
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,594
Outstanding.

253
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,709
Great. Oh, great. I was hoping to hear that.
The President will be pleased.

254
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:28,298
Because, I will tell you right now, I have only
been Chief of Staff since Monday, um,

255
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:33,691
but I do know that the alien war stuff,
these are... These are the only fun meetings.

256
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,255
Look, I am not here
to entertain the President,

257
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:40,030
but you may tell him
that the war will be over.

258
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,781
Soon.

259
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:45,700
"...be over..." In case he asks,
I just like to have an exact quote.

260
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,463
"War will be over soon."
That is great. Such good news.

261
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:55,201
And, um, the President would, I know, just love...
Really, really love to press the flesh...

262
00:20:55,201 --> 00:21:00,145
Not flesh, obviously, but just maybe get
a shot with, um... Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

263
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:02,108
We could bop on Air Force One.

264
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,101
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and bop back.

265
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:08,232
I wouldn't get his hopes up on that one.
Okay. He's called Optimus Prime.

266
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,520
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

267
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:16,201
But aren't they our friends? Why?

268
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:20,613
Because our world will never truly
be safe till all of them are gone.

269
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:25,803
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

270
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:29,079
Especially since our military
has worked so closely with them.

271
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,461
- Until you.
- It's not their planet.

272
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,961
Never was.

273
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,220
Time we take it back.

274
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:50,101
All right, come on. Come on.

275
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,483
Yes. Yes.

276
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,109
Yes.

277
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,481
Oh, there you go.

278
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:03,684
No, hold it. Stop shaking.
Why are you shaking? You have the job.

279
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,992
You forgot to eat dinner.

280
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,078
You see why I worry?

281
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:14,799
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

282
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,301
I almost got it working right.

283
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,172
So, listen, I am done with homework
and set with finals,

284
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:25,448
so I was just going to take a little drive
with some friends if that was okay with you.

285
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:30,769
No boys, I know. Graduate first.
Exactly.

286
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,943
You do know
no one else has this rule, right?

287
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:37,147
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay.
It's wisdom.

288
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,665
I don't think we need to be
driving around in the middle of the night.

289
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:43,537
It's already like quarter to eight.
It's almost dark. Spud, will you stop it?

290
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,411
You know where I was for my graduation?

291
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,829
Yes. With me, the mistake.

292
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:51,721
The surprise, Tess.
And the best thing that ever happened.

293
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:55,796
Do we look unhappy? Huh?
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

294
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,105
I made your mother a promise
before she passed.

295
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,923
Our baby's going to be at her graduation.
That's it.

296
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,983
High school boys know nothing.
It's only later they turn into men.

297
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,688
So if you were older and wiser,
I wouldn't exist.

298
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,005
That's not what I meant.

299
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:14,602
You know, this is a non-dating household, okay?
You don't date, I don't date. That's it.

300
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,854
Well, maybe you should.

301
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,573
Tessa, wait.

302
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,738
Tessa?

303
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,444
Look.

304
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,656
I know I have been on you, okay?
But I have to be.

305
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:31,205
Twelve to seventeen
is the official teenage danger window.

306
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:35,506
It's my job to get you through it.
So you can be pissed off all you want.

307
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:42,846
And, yes, you can take a ride
with your friends.

308
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,263
Okay.

309
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,092
Don't work all night.

310
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,684
And eat.

311
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,079
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.

312
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:11,040
She's the best thing that ever happened.

313
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,201
You'd be proud.

314
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,509
Oh, no.

315
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,227
Unbelievable.

316
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:34,230
Unbelievable. God.

317
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:40,836
Something in here needs to
make this family some money.

318
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,910
Come on, you old wreck.

319
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,744
Judgment Day.

320
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,878
Where is he?
I don't know.

321
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,174
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

322
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,099
Asshole. I am dialing 911.

323
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,604
Tess, I am basically your uncle.
Su casa es mi casa.

324
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:19,608
And we're going to lose the casa.

325
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:21,106
Dad.

326
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,695
Coming.

327
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:26,808
Are you working with lasers?
If so, I am not coming in.

328
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:30,028
You guys have never seen a truck like
this before. Get in here. Lock that door.

329
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,954
It doesn't have a lock.

330
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,760
Look. Look at the hole in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

331
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,750
Something blew a hole in it.
Yeah, so? It's not normal steel.

332
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,701
The shrapnel in the engine,
it ripped all the connections apart.

333
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:45,920
And watch. And this took some Cade genius.
You are going to love this.

334
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,631
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

335
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,971
Calling all...
Calling all Autobots.

336
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,138
Oh, yeah.

337
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,436
I don't think it's a truck at all.

338
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,565
I think we just found a Transformer.

339
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,398
Tran... Ugh.

340
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:05,859
- Evacuate.
- Wait. Guys. Dad.

341
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:08,601
Are you out of your mind?
You need to get that thing out of here.

342
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,692
You don't have to worry. I have been
in there working all night. I am fine.

343
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:12,621
You know what?
That's not a truck, okay? You're right.

344
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,599
It's an alien killing machine.
Dude. Jesus. It's DOA.

345
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,769
It's been recalled, totaled, done.
So, listen, there's a number that you call.

346
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,330
You're supposed to call the government.
It's the American thing to do.

347
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,010
Here we go. You're supposed to call, and if it
ends up being alien, then you win $25,000.

348
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,258
You don't win money.
And if you can capture it live...

349
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:32,751
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest,
then you get $100,000.

350
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:34,349
- Dad, we're making the call.
- I heard that.

351
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:37,694
I've seen the commercial. They don't say that. That's
not a guarantee. You think Greg would lie to me?

352
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,499
Look, if that's a Transformer there
from the Battle of Chicago,

353
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,101
I need to know how it works.

354
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,836
I am an inventor.
This could be a game changer for me.

355
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,704
If I can apply that technology
to my inventions,

356
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,322
we'd never have to
worry about money again.

357
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:49,991
I have heard that before.

358
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,505
Twenty-five grand.
It pays for my college. It pays for the house.

359
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:55,564
Besides, you used my money
to buy the truck, right?

360
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,788
So technically, that's my truck.
Don't you think?

361
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:02,796
You also signed a contract
regarding all research lab l.P.

362
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,211
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

363
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,078
You signed it and now you're competing.

364
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:15,002
Any idea of yours is mine. Any thought you
have, I own it, so basically, I own you.

365
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:19,916
I don't think you can own someone.
That was, like, a while ago, even in Texas.

366
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,991
All right. Bring the torch over
and help me with the pulley arm.

367
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:29,359
I think the shrapnel took out its power core.
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?

368
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,411
Would an alien killing machine
let me do that?

369
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:35,929
Look, I will make the call.

370
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:38,153
We will get the money.
Just first let me see if I am right.

371
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:41,160
You want to hide in the house?
Go ahead. Okay.

372
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,607
Let's go. Pulley arm.

373
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,921
I can't believe him.

374
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:53,244
What is that? Looks like a missile.
It is. Whoa.

375
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,316
Dad.

376
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,560
There's a missile in the family room.

377
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,608
Holy...

378
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,030
I will kill you.

379
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,711
No. No.

380
00:28:27,364 --> 00:28:29,007
Dad, there's a missile in...

381
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:39,851
I will kill you. Stay back. Oh, no.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Call 911. Run.

382
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,990
- Lucas.
- Stop.

383
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,509
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

384
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,652
Easy, human.

385
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,663
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us.

386
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,451
Weapons systems damaged.
A missile hit your engine.

387
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:04,500
And we took it out of you.
You're hurt really bad.

388
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:11,040
I am just trying to help you. You're in my home now.
I am an engineer. My name is Cade Yeager.

389
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,720
Cade, I am in your debt.

390
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,640
My name is Optimus Prime.

391
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,306
My Autobots.

392
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,642
They're in danger.

393
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,405
I need to go. I need to go now.

394
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,525
How far you think you're going to get?

395
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:35,903
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.

396
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,990
What happened to you?

397
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:43,694
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.

398
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,790
I escaped and took this form.
But you're on our side.

399
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,003
Why would humans hurt you?

400
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:57,398
They were not alone.

401
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:02,201
- My Autobots can repair me.
- Yeah.

402
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,766
If you can reach them.

403
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,736
What about me?

404
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:37,088
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth,

405
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:41,390
an alliance is a contract, and contracts,

406
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:43,474
like humans,

407
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,602
expire.

408
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:50,816
On this planet, we have a saying.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

409
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:55,362
I also have a saying.
"I don't care."

410
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,650
So what happened in Mexico City?
I thought you had him.

411
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,980
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.
Then your men allowed him to escape.

412
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,032
You promised me human intelligence.

413
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,623
Or is there such a thing?

414
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,163
You know, you have still never told me.

415
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,381
Why do you want him?

416
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,116
Who are you working for?

417
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:22,038
Every galaxy I have traveled,
all you species are the same.

418
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:25,843
You all think
you're the center of the universe.

419
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,517
You have no idea.

420
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:33,784
Go to the hardware store and you
get the list. The whole list.

421
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:35,088
What, you're going to try and fix him?

422
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:38,130
He's not a model train set, Cade.
No, that's right. He's important.

423
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,299
Yeah, but important to who?
You can't keep an alien locked up in your barn.

424
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,442
What are you going to do, play with him?

425
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:46,288
Will you calm down? I am trying to, but I just
got hit in the head with a ten-foot cannon.

426
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:48,115
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

427
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,192
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me? Not a single word.

428
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:52,455
Nobody.

429
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,508
I think we have a lock
on a high-value target.

430
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,342
Special Operations group is ready.

431
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,717
What do you got? Sir, Special Ops just
got a call from Paris, Texas.

432
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,019
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico City.

433
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:12,431
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.

434
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,105
Took a hell of a hit, you know.
The missile just missed your power source.

435
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,988
We call it a Spark.

436
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:28,329
It contains our life force
and our memories.

437
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,413
Yeah, we call it a soul.

438
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,501
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

439
00:32:35,604 --> 00:32:37,797
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

440
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:39,295
This room is going dark.

441
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,942
The exit is on your left.

442
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,720
- I will take it from here.
- Okay, let's go.

443
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,224
I am with Cemetery Wind.
We're on the move.

444
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,301
Repeat, on the move.

445
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:01,942
Cade.

446
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,074
Why are you willing to help me?

447
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:08,365
I guess maybe because you trust me to.

448
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,505
I am back.

449
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,891
Took you long enough. My head hurts.
I had to go to the doctor.

450
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:35,351
I got a welt on my head that makes me look
like a fricking Star Trek character. Whatever.

451
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:47,400
- Look.
- Look.

452
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,464
We're on property.
Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1.

453
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,766
Dad.

454
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,204
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy.
I am a federal agent.

455
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:09,278
My men and I are trying to track down
an abandoned truck.

456
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,161
It's a nice spread you got here.
Too bad she's for sale.

457
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,103
Well, thanks. She's not.

458
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,954
That the truck you mean?

459
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,505
Afraid not.

460
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,210
You know, Mr. Yeager, we received a call from
someone concerned about this truck. Oh, no.

461
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,675
That wasn't you?

462
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:35,603
Only thing I am concerned about is you
being on my property without permission.

463
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,853
You know, we got a rule about people
messing with people from Texas.

464
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:40,731
And I don't know what truck
you're talking about.

465
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:42,936
The kind that cost American lives.

466
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,894
Search the property. What do you mean,
"Search the property"? You don't have a warrant.

467
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,105
My face is my warrant.

468
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,648
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck,
we get a reward, right?

469
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,907
Viper 15 holding, point alpha.

470
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,876
Charlie team, hold tight.

471
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,496
Lock it down.

472
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,673
- Open, open, open.
- Short wall. Short wall.

473
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:11,570
Five in. Five in. Intruder alert.
Back away from the premises.

474
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,902
- What the hell is that?
- Just some dumb inventor.

475
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:14,922
Clear.

476
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,965
Clear.

477
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,934
Clear right.

478
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,427
Clear.

479
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,016
360. 720. Heads on a swivel.

480
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,782
Let's go. There's nothing here.

481
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,954
There's no signs. We got nothing.
Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash.

482
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:47,706
Live? I carried that to the trash.
You told me that was a dud, dude.

483
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,775
I could be dead. Right?

484
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,614
Look.
Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.

485
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:56,621
I towed it back for the parts. I left it
here last night. This morning, it's gone.

486
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:59,699
When? Where? I don't know. I swear to God.
That's as much as I know about him.

487
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,139
"Him."

488
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,300
He said, "Him."

489
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,655
He knows who the son of a bitch is.

490
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,695
- Mr. Yeager.
- What? Excuse me.

491
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,650
You just said, "Him."

492
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:18,235
- Take them down.
- What?

493
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:22,916
Ow. Let me go. They don't know about the truck.
I know. Let me go. Just let her go.

494
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:27,653
Let me go. What kind of a man betrays his
flesh-and-blood brethren for alien metal?

495
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:30,925
Get this guy out of my sight. Get off.
Let her go. They don't know about the truck.

496
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:34,577
All right. Load up. Search the perimeter.
Lucas, you called, didn't you?

497
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:36,505
No.
I don't know any of these scary guys.

498
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:41,143
Oh, God. You're manhandling a woman.
I will kick your ass. Let her go.

499
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:44,391
- Daddy. Let me go.
- You're not going anywhere.

500
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:47,873
Daddy.
No. You're not taking me anywhere.

501
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,855
I am an American.

502
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,298
- Easy, sweetheart.
- Okay, okay, okay.

503
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:54,525
All right. Okay. All right. I was wrong.

504
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,780
Savoy. Use the girl.

505
00:37:58,108 --> 00:37:59,751
Oh, my God. Ahh.

506
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,344
Now, you got ten seconds.
Where's the truck?

507
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:15,204
- You're going to shoot my little girl?
- If I have to. Please don't shoot me.

508
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:17,704
Please. Look, I don't know. I told you
everything that I know. He's gone.

509
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:21,556
He left. He was in the barn.
I swear to God. Just let her go. Ow.

510
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:25,344
Please, please.
He was in there. Let her go.

511
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,684
Seven seconds.

512
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:29,891
I am telling you the truth.
He was in there.

513
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,202
Dad.

514
00:38:33,202 --> 00:38:36,068
Tell him to get away
from my little girl now.

515
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,657
Dad.

516
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:41,128
You touch her and I will kill you.

517
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:44,108
You got two seconds.

518
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,831
I need the truth.

519
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,954
- Please.
- Shoot her.

520
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,596
Here I am.

521
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:15,068
Get down. Ahh. Cade.
They're going to kill you. Get out of here.

522
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:30,384
Push right. Headed to the house.

523
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:45,990
Come on. Hurry up. Get in the car.
Let's go. Daddy, get in the car.

524
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,690
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way.

525
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:21,201
What's happening, baby? Who are they?
It's the truck. They want the truck.

526
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:24,362
"Who are they"? Who are you,
and who are you calling "baby"?

527
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:27,898
I know you heard me.
I am her boyfriend. He's my boyfriend.

528
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:30,474
What? You're not her boyfriend.

529
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,273
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad.

530
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,233
What kind of cars are those?
They're so scary.

531
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,909
There's another one
coming up the back.

532
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,155
You got to try to lose them
in the cornfield.

533
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:17,478
He's coming up behind us. Go.
Viper 15, running on fumes. RTB.

534
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,862
They have got us cornered.

535
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,505
Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

536
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,009
Mr. Yeager, this is not
how I wanted us to meet, okay?

537
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:43,925
I am Shane, and I am a completely...
And I am not talking to you. Drive the car.

538
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:45,775
Watch out. Watch out.

539
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,356
Throw them some warning shots.

540
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,302
Man, I don't know how
I am driving this good.

541
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:08,983
It's like, today I have gone to a whole
other level. Road, focus. Stop talking.

542
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:12,454
Shane, look out.

543
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,777
This may be primarily my fault, okay.

544
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:24,376
They said they were going to bring a check.
I didn't know they were going to send a death squad.

545
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:34,753
Hang on.

546
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,487
Hey, we got ourselves a winner.
Don's got it over here. Look out.

547
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:48,733
We lost them.
Good job, stranger from the cornfields.

548
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,793
The scary cars are back.

549
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,972
Lose them at the factory, Shane.

550
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,443
I thought you knew
how to drive this thing. Go.

551
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,358
I don't think we're going to get that money.
Doesn't seem like it.

552
00:43:35,737 --> 00:43:36,909
Cade.

553
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,085
Take them upstairs.

554
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,277
We're losing them on the fifth floor.

555
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:02,903
- Do that thing, Shane. You know it.
- What do you mean? What thing?

556
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:05,844
What we're about to do
is going to be kind of scary.

557
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,998
Take out your guns and shoot them.

558
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:15,800
They're shooting at us. Tessa.
Grab my stick. Grab my stick. What?

559
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,969
She's got the best hands in the business.

560
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:21,708
Ready, Tess? Pull.

561
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,891
- No. No. No.
- No f-ing way.

562
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:39,655
- Oh.
- Yeah.

563
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:45,273
Yeah.
Tessa, you are so grounded.

564
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,302
Shit. The rim's cracked.

565
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,360
Optimus. Come on, move. Move.

566
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:57,460
My foot's stuck. Wait, Cade.
Lucas. Wait. Wait.

567
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,369
Lucas. Lucas, above you.

568
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:02,119
Run.

569
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,148
Come on, get in, let's go.

570
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,454
I will bet you wish
you could see my face right now.

571
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,532
Lucas, we just left him?

572
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,960
He's gone.

573
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:49,932
My deepest sympathies
for the loss of your friend.

574
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,735
Stay here till I am sure
we weren't followed.

575
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,735
We are all targets now.

576
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:06,641
So we're hiding out now?
That's the plan?

577
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:08,414
We're taking orders from a truck?

578
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,615
Well, you got a better idea?

579
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:17,543
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't...
Keep your hands off her. All right? No.

580
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,597
You got your ass kicked
by a garage inventor from Texas.

581
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,639
That goes on your resume.
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too.

582
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:28,688
Do I look like I am in the mood
for any of your shit today?

583
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,253
Washington thinks
we were chasing a Decepticon target,

584
00:47:32,253 --> 00:47:35,311
but our story falls apart
if we don't find this Yeager family first.

585
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,364
Yeah, well, what if he goes to the cops
or the FBI? They know to hand him over.

586
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:42,447
His world as he knows it is gone.

587
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,376
Well, bright side, you guys met.

588
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,628
Where is he from?
I told you, he's a driver from Texas. Texas?

589
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:02,021
Where, Dublin, Texas? Shamrock, Texas?
So why does he sound like a leprechaun?

590
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:04,447
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland
for saying that.

591
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:06,987
Well, we're not in Ireland,
Lucky Charms. We're in Texas.

592
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:13,269
And so he drives? What do you mean, he drives?
Like, for a living? Yeah. At least he makes a living.

593
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,059
Thank you.

594
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,978
Look, I race rally cars.

595
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,061
One driver.

596
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:20,650
One navigator. Her.

597
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:24,822
By the way, I am totally legit.
I just got picked up by Red Bull.

598
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,998
And just so you know, my life savings
was in that car back there.

599
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,864
- This is not happening.
- Oh, it definitely is.

600
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:41,802
How old are you?

601
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,461
Twenty.

602
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:45,505
She's a 17-year-old girl.

603
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,355
So we can work this two ways.

604
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:50,762
One, I punch you right in the mouth
and you call the police on me.

605
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,306
- Dad.
- Or two,

606
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:55,452
I just call the cops on you
because this is illegal. She's a minor.

607
00:48:55,452 --> 00:48:57,525
We're protected by
the Romeo and Juliet laws.

608
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:01,699
We dated for a little while. I was a sophomore,
and he was a senior. It's fine. No, it's not fine.

609
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:05,117
We have got a preexisting
juvenile foundational relationship.

610
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:08,753
- Statute 2705-3.
- What?

611
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,739
Texas statute?

612
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,474
- That a real law?
- Yep.

613
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,293
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

614
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:19,210
- You know how those two ended up?
- In love.

615
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,201
Dead. Do your parents know about this?

616
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:24,699
Is your dad okay with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

617
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:28,181
He took off when I was five,
but if I ever bump into him, I will ask him.

618
00:49:28,923 --> 00:49:30,425
You know, Tessa,

619
00:49:30,925 --> 00:49:32,974
- I trusted you.
- To what?

620
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:37,224
Never have fun, take a risk,
be a normal teenager, like you?

621
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,237
I am your father, okay?

622
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:40,735
And I have been busting my ass
to take care of you.

623
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:43,614
Is that what you were doing
when you brought home the truck?

624
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:47,322
All you had to do was report it,
and now Lucas is dead.

625
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:51,992
And my life is over. Thank you.
You have taken real good care of me.

626
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:07,282
Please don't shoot me.
Please. Dad.

627
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:09,882
They were willing to kill her.

628
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,304
Then they still are.

629
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,545
Somebody somewhere gave that order.
I am going to find some fingerprints.

630
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,400
Please....

631
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:30,034
No.
I am an Autobot. I am an Autobot.

632
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,275
Grab whatever you think
we can use for supplies.

633
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:34,791
Clothes, anything.
And take that computer.

634
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,295
Let's go.

635
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,869
This is not easy.

636
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:50,170
You know, you don't suck at everything, Dad.

637
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,735
What the....

638
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:07,815
I knew it.

639
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,411
You told me he was no one.

640
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:15,827
Well....

641
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,585
this "no one" has our tech.

642
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,996
Calling all Autobots.

643
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,112
Calling all Autobots.

644
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,998
- Whoa. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

645
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,625
That was insane. It was awesome,
but it was insane, right?

646
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:40,577
Oh, yeah. Hell, yeah.

647
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:43,956
He's back. He's alive.

648
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:46,960
Optimus is here.

649
00:52:55,623 --> 00:52:59,222
At last. There is hope after all.

650
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,907
Yeah....

651
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,454
Mr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back.

652
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,958
I knew you'd make it. I never doubted.

653
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,965
We got your warning.
We have been waiting.

654
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,588
Hell, yeah. Boom time.
We got the gang back together.

655
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:57,867
Humans have asked us
to play by their rules.

656
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,992
Well, the rules have just changed.

657
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:07,798
Human beings, bunch of backstabbing weasels.
Hound, find your inner compass.

658
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:12,150
Loyalty is but a flower
in the winds of fear and temptation.

659
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,259
What the hell are you saying?
It's a haiku. Cut the crap,

660
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:18,739
before I drop a grenade down your throat.
Try it, you will be dead.

661
00:54:18,739 --> 00:54:21,148
Oh, please pull it. Please do it.

662
00:54:21,148 --> 00:54:23,403
You know what,
it will save us so much time.

663
00:54:23,403 --> 00:54:29,501
Well, raise your hand if you're thoroughly
disenchanted with our little pleasant Earth vacation.

664
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:32,807
So, who's the stowaways?
Oh, whoa, hey, what's with the gun?

665
00:54:32,807 --> 00:54:37,065
Stop. Hound, both of you.
They have risked their lives for mine.

666
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,405
We owe them.

667
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,246
So, there's been no sign of any others?

668
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,699
- Nada.
- We are all that's left.

669
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,610
They're picking us off, one by one.

670
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:51,992
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.
And you make five.

671
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,420
So that's our best-case scenario?

672
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,969
Autobot witness protection?

673
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:04,222
Hey, Speed Racer, you're welcome to leave
anytime. Well, for the record, Superdad,

674
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,813
I am not hiding with you.
I am hiding out with that big guy.

675
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:12,692
Sensei, with your fate unknown,
Bumblebee has held command,

676
00:55:12,692 --> 00:55:18,119
despite his complete and total lack
of anything resembling warrior discipline.

677
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,072
He's like a child.
This child is about to kick your ass.

678
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:22,998
He brings us shame.

679
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,324
Cage fight.

680
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:27,574
Smartass.

681
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,257
What's the matter with them?

682
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:36,199
Am I the lone sage who sees through
this puppy-dog eyes act? It's beneath you.

683
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,005
Yes, I have been waiting
for them all to dispatch each other,

684
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:43,056
so I could take charge with no trouble at all.
Just me reporting to me.

685
00:55:43,056 --> 00:55:45,099
Well, it sure looks like
you have been missed.

686
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:51,101
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us
and humans are helping.

687
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,516
We need to know why.

688
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,565
Well, listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.

689
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,864
This drone I stole recorded footage
of an Autobot raid.

690
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,030
It's in pieces,
but watch what happens here.

691
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:10,121
Oh, that's Leadfoot.

692
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,161
They rip him apart. Savages.

693
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,684
And later, this truck comes to haul him off.
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

694
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:19,300
Defense, aerospace, government contracts.

695
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,253
They designed this drone.

696
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:25,291
So these government guys just hunt you down,
and then pass you off to this KSI?

697
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,815
The company is headquartered in Chicago.
That could be where they were taken.

698
00:56:28,815 --> 00:56:33,766
No way to get inside without a battle.
Well, what if you had some human help?

699
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:36,318
- What, are you two partners now?
- Sweetie, we're targets now, too.

700
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:38,987
We need to know why
or we will never get our lives back.

701
00:56:38,987 --> 00:56:40,108
Autobots,

702
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,402
I have sworn to never kill humans.
Big mistake.

703
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,657
But when I find out who's behind this,

704
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:51,081
he's going to die. Hooah.

705
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:08,675
There's a full-on manhunt out for us,
so we have some new rules.

706
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,849
Anyone who has got a badge is not our friend.

707
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,847
We're going to divide and conquer.

708
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:16,059
You two in charge of stealing food
and the essentials. And nothing else.

709
00:57:22,697 --> 00:57:24,887
Chicago KSI headquarters
is like a fortress.

710
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:27,286
I am going to find a way
into their top-secret military wing.

711
00:57:27,286 --> 00:57:29,028
Find something to blackmail
this company and the government.

712
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,907
We're going to get our freedom back.

713
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,793
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

714
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,929
What was that sound?

715
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,226
That's "the" sound.

716
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,894
That you asked for.

717
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:58,483
No, I asked for boundless.
Transcendent.

718
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:00,047
When you walk through a door
in this building,

719
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:02,483
it should sound like
you have stepped into the future.

720
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,827
Present.

721
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,246
Say it.

722
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,583
Future.

723
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,748
The past is history. The present is past.

724
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,422
The future is now.
Why can't I get in touch with you?

725
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,929
Don't you realize
what the Arctic find means?

726
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,592
You know that story
we were all told as children

727
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,853
about a giant asteroid that struck the Earth

728
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:37,313
millions of years ago
and wiped out the dinosaurs?

729
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:39,733
- Vaguely.
- We were wrong.

730
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:42,731
This metal caused the great extinction.

731
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,599
How and why, I can't yet say.

732
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:47,983
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years B.C.

733
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,760
This ore you have got us digging for
is a lot more dangerous than you think.

734
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,083
And my people... Darcy, I think that you
have been out in the field for far too long.

735
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,119
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs over dinner?

736
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,672
- Ribs?
- Not a chance.

737
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,210
You have no idea
what's been happening here.

738
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:09,170
We're about to make the quantum leap.

739
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,132
A rare-earth metal.

740
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,842
Molecularly unstable.

741
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,851
Industrial uses, none.

742
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,764
And then the aliens came.

743
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,355
And we made the connection.

744
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,193
It's what they're made of.

745
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:26,862
It's the Holy Grail.

746
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,103
"Transformium."
That's what we're calling it.

747
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:33,206
Focus-grouped. Catchy.
Trademarked. Yeah.

748
00:59:33,206 --> 00:59:36,449
This is the greatest advance in modern physics

749
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:40,501
since the splitting of the atom.
It's programmable matter.

750
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,672
And now, we have mapped its genome.
I. Now you have mapped its genome.

751
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:49,010
And now we can begin to give it

752
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,759
instructions.

753
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:58,224
This is extremely good.

754
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,688
Watch this.

755
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:12,028
We can change anything into anything.

756
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:17,782
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?

757
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,713
Do you like music?

758
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:26,831
The Pill.

759
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:31,670
Perhaps something a little more violent?

760
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:38,552
Oh, my God. You have done it.

761
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:44,478
In aerospace, the military...
We will own the entire robotics industry.

762
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,150
All exploration.

763
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,405
The oceans. Space. Everything.

764
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,775
Wembley. What is this?

765
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,202
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.

766
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:59,652
You said they were erotic yet deadly,
like women. I never said that.

767
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:02,199
Yes, you did. No, I didn't.
I definitely heard you say it

768
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:05,795
because you were talking about your
ex-girlfriend, who was sexy, but a bitch.

769
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:07,880
Please don't eat on the tour.

770
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:09,925
Is that her?

771
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:16,621
Hey, I found a whole bunch
of boxes of clothes.

772
01:01:16,621 --> 01:01:19,121
So, sweetie, you can get some
long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,

773
01:01:19,121 --> 01:01:21,597
and lose the short shorts, okay?
What'd you guys get?

774
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,132
It's protein.

775
01:01:26,132 --> 01:01:27,938
Look, I said the essentials, okay?

776
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,396
It wasn't easy. We almost got caught.

777
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:31,862
You stole mouthwash?

778
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:34,219
I like to be fresh
when I am making out with your daughter.

779
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,902
That's funny.

780
01:01:40,414 --> 01:01:42,407
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

781
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,867
Ever?

782
01:01:45,117 --> 01:01:48,121
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.

783
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,833
I don't understand it.

784
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,385
This is the fifth iteration.

785
01:01:53,385 --> 01:01:55,320
Why does he keep turning out like this?

786
01:01:55,695 --> 01:01:57,838
It's just some bugs in the final render.

787
01:01:58,672 --> 01:02:04,271
I modeled Galvatron after Optimus Prime.
Why does he keep looking like Megatron?

788
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:06,974
Rendering sequence
is almost finished. Stand by.

789
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,684
Simple coding.

790
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:12,775
Algorithms.

791
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,027
Math.

792
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,447
Why can't we make
what we want to make,

793
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,449
the way we want to make it?

794
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,123
Why?

795
01:02:25,005 --> 01:02:28,875
And does that look
like a consumer-friendly face to you?

796
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,965
And what about that big hole in the chest?

797
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,300
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

798
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,086
- Love it.
- Well, I hate it.

799
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:44,255
Oh, here he is.
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.

800
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:48,199
Ma'am, this is not legal.
This is illegal experimentation.

801
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:51,699
Aliens would never do this to people.
Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it.

802
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:56,440
This ain't right.
Nobody puts baby in a box. Ahhh.

803
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,811
This is worse than waterboarding.

804
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:00,934
This little gentleman
has been translating for us

805
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:03,574
all the information
that comes from these two heads.

806
01:03:03,862 --> 01:03:06,271
Their history, their science, everything.

807
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:10,875
- Is that Megatron?
- Precisely. Where did you get all this?

808
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,581
Special government contract.

809
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:14,512
Now we know everything
about Transformers.

810
01:03:14,512 --> 01:03:17,382
And now at long last
we can build them ourselves.

811
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:19,338
And we can build them better.

812
01:03:40,326 --> 01:03:43,244
Yeah, that's good, Bee.
That will get us in.

813
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:49,835
A couple times a day, these guys are moving

814
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:52,788
in vehicle shipments into KSI
for something called "scanning".

815
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,500
Major security all over.

816
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,001
So our best shot at getting in
is a back classified research entrance.

817
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,862
I am going to drive in with Bee
tomorrow morning.

818
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:08,380
Excuse me.
There's no smooching in front of me, okay?

819
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:12,677
You're so square. Who even says "smooching"?
I tell you, no respect.

820
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:17,708
It's just impossible sometimes.
Yeah. I went through that with Bumblebee.

821
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:27,489
Calm down. Calm down.

822
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:29,456
You know, at a time like this,

823
01:04:29,456 --> 01:04:32,969
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?

824
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:35,793
About a month ago.

825
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:40,202
Middle of the night, I thought I heard
noises in my house. Was that you?

826
01:04:40,202 --> 01:04:42,829
What? Come on. No way.
Don't lie to me, kid.

827
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,465
You see that guy with the gun out there?
There's so many guys with guns.

828
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,085
Let's get out of the car and tell him
we're about to break in and it's your idea,

829
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:50,478
because I don't care.
I am old, I have already lived long enough.

830
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:53,552
You have a really bad habit of having
these conversations at the wrong time, man.

831
01:04:53,552 --> 01:04:55,851
You want to come clean
or you want me to make a mess?

832
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:57,434
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

833
01:04:57,434 --> 01:04:59,364
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

834
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,695
I am sorry. I am sorry.

835
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,822
- Taking it in for scanning?
- Uh-huh.

836
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,452
All right. You're good to go.

837
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:12,159
I am literally going to kill you.

838
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,168
Scanning in bay three.

839
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:20,458
We took old, alien technology
and made it better in every way.

840
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,338
Introducing Stinger.

841
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,632
KSI. We make the world.

842
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,139
That is a bad-ass robot.

843
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:34,045
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

844
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:37,858
Here is the past. And now the future.
They're trying to build their own versions.

845
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:40,527
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars
than this.

846
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:48,202
You talk to me like that? Bee, stop.
You see what happens from being a wiseass?

847
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:50,222
Now get out of here.

848
01:05:50,222 --> 01:05:55,376
Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee,
but better in every way.

849
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:58,847
Son of a...
No, no. You got to calm down.

850
01:05:59,204 --> 01:06:01,003
- He's crazy.
- Stop.

851
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:03,876
Bumblebee. Bee, stop going psycho.

852
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:13,452
My delicate flower, I can't
understand you when you're angry.

853
01:06:13,452 --> 01:06:15,730
Actually, I don't really understand you
at all.

854
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:19,393
Our entire factory is up and running...
Excuse me one second. Hey.

855
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,648
Hey, you two. Grease monkeys.

856
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,547
What the hell is going on here? Huh?
What's with this vintage crap?

857
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,813
We're not scanning collector car junk.

858
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,411
What do you think it is
that we make here? Hmm?

859
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:34,039
We make poetry. We're poets.

860
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,760
All right? You work for me,
you get one mistake. One.

861
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,909
- Understood? It won't happen again.
- It certainly won't.

862
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:43,878
So let's get this pathetic thing
out of here. And you, too.

863
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:45,985
So sorry. So sorry.

864
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,338
Let's move on. Watch him.
I am going to see what I can find.

865
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,610
Quietly get out of here.

866
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:55,056
I swear. I swear. I can't bear it when
you're angry. You know how it upsets me.

867
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,800
Bee, you got to calm down right now.
I am perfectly calm, dude.

868
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,056
You got to breathe,
or just do whatever it is that you do.

869
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,032
I am calm. I am calm.
I am not even touching it.

870
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:10,405
Okay, I am barely touching it.
Oh, my God.

871
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,528
I am barely touching it.
Turn back into a car right now.

872
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,456
Get out of my face, all right?
Our design team started with the Bumblebee.

873
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:20,920
But really, this alien's design was
decrepit and, let's face it, antique.

874
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,409
What the...

875
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:25,617
- Kind of old and ratty. You mean ugly.
- Don't take it personally, Bee.

876
01:07:25,617 --> 01:07:30,672
- Don't take it personally. Oh, hell, no.
- No. No. You think you're better than me.

877
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,469
Yee-hah.

878
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:39,938
What did you touch?

879
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,478
Uh...

880
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:46,150
I told you, homeboy
Can't touch this

881
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,789
My office in 15 minutes.

882
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:53,619
This is dissection room seven.
Galvatron, render postmortem number 12.

883
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:57,619
Continued head disfigurement
at event number 32.

884
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,804
So what about the deal? Is it done?
Did you get the Seed?

885
01:08:05,804 --> 01:08:08,655
We get it when the
bounty hunter gets Prime. Uh-huh.

886
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:12,764
Meanwhile, there has been a complication.
A what?

887
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:17,298
No, no.
At KSI, we don't use words like that.

888
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,599
A civilian harboring the Autobots has
hacked into one of your mini-drones.

889
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:24,521
Meaning, they may know
of your involvement.

890
01:08:25,225 --> 01:08:26,327
"What"?

891
01:08:33,158 --> 01:08:35,055
That was a little bit intense.

892
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:39,449
I need more Transformium, and
I need it now, to build more prototypes.

893
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:46,213
You tell your alien bounty hunter that
I have staked my company on this deal.

894
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:50,710
And I have merely staked my life.
Hey, you came to me on this, remember?

895
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,802
You retire from the CIA,

896
01:08:52,802 --> 01:08:59,011
you get a seven-figure piece of my company, and
you and I revolutionize national defense together.

897
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:03,939
But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes,

898
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:07,090
you need to deliver...

899
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,354
...the Seed.

900
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:28,081
I am in. Can you see my camera?

901
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:31,046
They're melting Ratchet.

902
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:37,043
They slaughtered Ratchet.
I am going to tear them apart.

903
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:39,054
Metal.

904
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:42,778
Just metal.
That's what I always thought of them.

905
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:46,795
Well, they're not.
They're living things, with souls like ours.

906
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:50,435
Once, I spoke to one.

907
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:55,800
And you're working with Transformium?
Uh, yeah, that's what I do. I am.

908
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,423
I am out there digging for it.
There's just not much left to find.

909
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,067
So that's how badly
you boys need more, huh?

910
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:04,667
Reduced to melting
evil old Decepticons down.

911
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,462
No. That's an Autobot there.

912
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,756
The ones who fought for us.

913
01:10:10,756 --> 01:10:13,329
- I have got this taken care of from here.
- Right.

914
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:18,096
Same badge code scanned at two separate gates.
I am having the classified area locked down now.

915
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,105
Check that guy.

916
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,400
Hey.

917
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,360
Stop right there.

918
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:37,692
Stop.

919
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,744
Freeze.

920
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:48,916
Up against the wall.

921
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,675
All right.

922
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:55,863
Corporate espionage.
That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

923
01:11:14,686 --> 01:11:16,188
Wow....

924
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:20,618
Look, I want a lawyer.

925
01:11:20,618 --> 01:11:23,962
The Justice Department. Somebody I can trust.
I am just trying to protect my family, okay?

926
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:26,286
Not from your company, from the government.

927
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:27,537
Mr. Yeager,

928
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,497
who do you think I work for?

929
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,988
You're trying to protect your family,
that's admirable.

930
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,742
I am trying to defend the nation
from alien war.

931
01:11:35,742 --> 01:11:37,005
We have had a taste
of what that looks like,

932
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,054
and we are not going to tolerate another.
Now...

933
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,639
There is a version of this conversation
where you get to go back to your barn,

934
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,646
your daughter gets to graduate with honors,

935
01:11:46,646 --> 01:11:49,188
and life as you know it will go on.

936
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:53,521
You have no idea
what you're involved with here.

937
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,313
Really?

938
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:59,489
What's the other version
of this conversation?

939
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:02,576
The one when you send in
the hired help to murder my little girl?

940
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,447
Or you going to man up
and do it yourself?

941
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,747
What's your preference?

942
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,578
I am going to ask you this once.

943
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,835
Where is Optimus Prime?

944
01:12:49,002 --> 01:12:50,744
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

945
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,122
We're moving. Basement.

946
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,122
They're here.

947
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,306
Get out. All of you.
Science fair's over, meatbags.

948
01:13:03,306 --> 01:13:07,225
- Destroy the lab.
- Move, move, move, move. Look out. Look out.

949
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,136
Destroy it all.

950
01:13:12,002 --> 01:13:16,063
Danger. Security breach.
Danger. Security.... Ow....

951
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:19,315
Guys. It's me.
Break me out of this Frankenstein box.

952
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,692
Hey.

953
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:21,771
Hey.

954
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:24,684
Hey.

955
01:13:24,684 --> 01:13:30,155
Stop. That's company property.
They're not your property.

956
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,627
They were my friends.

957
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:41,376
Oh, you ain't talking so much now.
You got Hound in front of you, huh?

958
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:42,710
Go ahead.

959
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:48,345
Show us your true colors, once and for all.
Just give me the word, I will splatter him.

960
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:54,512
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here that this
is all the spoils of war. Dead metal.

961
01:13:55,805 --> 01:13:58,979
Innovation. What we do here is science.

962
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:02,154
Because if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

963
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,826
Because you cannot stop technology.
We're not your technology.

964
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,639
Let me vaporize his ass.

965
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:19,335
I broke the code.
I own your whole genome.

966
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:22,979
The world will know
what you're doing here.

967
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:26,255
The world? The world will approve.

968
01:14:26,878 --> 01:14:28,841
We can make you now.

969
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:33,423
Don't you get it?
We don't need you anymore.

970
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:36,255
That was cruel.

971
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:43,173
Autobots....

972
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:45,903
...we are done.

973
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:48,630
We're done?
We're not going to kick a little bit of ass?

974
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,787
I have been itching
to kill something lately.

975
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:53,648
This is our chance.
We have to stop him. You have to stop him.

976
01:14:53,648 --> 01:14:57,493
It's never been tested in the field. Labs.
Military bases, but not on civilian streets.

977
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,003
Down there a Defense Department contract
was just attacked in a terrorist attack.

978
01:15:01,003 --> 01:15:07,381
This is now a CIA military Op.
You're indemnified. Respond.

979
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,762
Let's go.

980
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:18,730
KSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in.
Been an unprovoked Autobot attack.

981
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,524
Bring up Galvatron.

982
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,940
Transforming Galvatron.

983
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:27,739
Galvatron coming online.

984
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,530
Bring up Stinger.

985
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:34,447
Stinger coming online.

986
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:44,264
Let's show these alien terrorists
what an upgrade looks like.

987
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,881
Galvatron and Stinger are moving
to intercept targets.

988
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,601
Reapers.
Five targets in the open. Good picture.

989
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:02,604
Two miles to intercept.

990
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,755
200 meters.

991
01:16:15,755 --> 01:16:17,332
"Engage."

992
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,119
Transform.

993
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:33,176
Whoa.

994
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:50,480
We are programming this, right? Yes.
Mostly. Systems seem to have malfunctioned.

995
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,649
Targeting five bogeys.

996
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:54,694
Engaging rockets.

997
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:55,903
Missiles away.

998
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,810
Got to haul ass, Bee. Come on.

999
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:17,768
Stinger is in pursuit.

1000
01:17:28,594 --> 01:17:32,606
Misfire, misfire. Misfire, misfire.
System failure. Galvatron just fired four rockets.

1001
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,574
Whoa. They're shooting at us.

1002
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,940
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Watch out. What are you doing?

1003
01:18:12,204 --> 01:18:13,948
Argh....

1004
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,118
What was that?

1005
01:18:25,676 --> 01:18:28,176
We need a full medical team now.
Possible civilian casualties.

1006
01:18:28,176 --> 01:18:30,355
I mean, you got a lot of people
in the crossfire here. I don't like...

1007
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:32,908
You're making history here.
For your country, for the world.

1008
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:37,720
Human freedom is at stake.
Innocent people die all the time.

1009
01:18:44,395 --> 01:18:45,841
Come on, Optimus.

1010
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,840
Tessa.

1011
01:19:21,908 --> 01:19:23,930
Make him fight. Don't let him go down.

1012
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,176
Make him fight.

1013
01:19:25,176 --> 01:19:27,518
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

1014
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,860
Tessa.

1015
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,381
Tessa.

1016
01:19:36,889 --> 01:19:38,661
Tessa, run to the field.

1017
01:19:45,146 --> 01:19:51,488
You have no soul.
That is why I have no fear.

1018
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,122
You die....

1019
01:20:06,185 --> 01:20:07,657
Help me.

1020
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,994
What is that?

1021
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,490
That's my asset. Pull Galvatron back.

1022
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:37,774
Do it.

1023
01:21:08,872 --> 01:21:10,373
I got to go get her.

1024
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:14,582
Tessa.

1025
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:19,925
Don't go out there. He will kill you.
She needs my help. She's hidden.

1026
01:21:19,925 --> 01:21:24,994
Optimus. Optimus, get up, get up.
I can't. Get out of here.

1027
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:32,559
I feel sorry for you, Prime.
Your allegiance to these humans.

1028
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:39,315
The trouble with loyalty to a cause
is that the cause will always betray you.

1029
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,318
Who sent you here?

1030
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,820
Where do you think you came from?

1031
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,652
You think you were born?

1032
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:53,625
No. You were built.
And your creators want you back.

1033
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,828
We all work for someone.

1034
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,173
- No.
- No.

1035
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:10,842
No.

1036
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,887
It's got her.
She's in the car. Tessa.

1037
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,689
- No.
- Tessa.

1038
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,203
Dad....

1039
01:22:22,529 --> 01:22:24,730
Tessa, get out.

1040
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:26,863
Get out.

1041
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:29,351
Tessa...

1042
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:38,819
Get out. Tessa. Dad, help me.
Tessa. Help me, help me. Dad. Dad.

1043
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:46,344
Dad. Dad.
Tessa. Break the glass.

1044
01:22:46,344 --> 01:22:48,792
- Break the glass to get out.
- I am trying.

1045
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:50,931
- Tessa, I can't hold on.
- Dad.

1046
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:55,993
- Tessa. Help me.
- Just break it. Break the glass. Tess...

1047
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:05,137
Cade, warn the Autobots.
Dad, help me. Don't leave me.

1048
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,737
No......

1049
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:38,771
Take that human to the trash.

1050
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,814
Mr. Secretary.

1051
01:23:52,735 --> 01:23:56,350
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

1052
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:58,703
This is my asset.

1053
01:23:59,033 --> 01:24:03,024
Tell the military to stand down.
Hang on, I have the White House.

1054
01:24:03,024 --> 01:24:04,104
Agent, hello.

1055
01:24:04,104 --> 01:24:07,716
Oh, my goodness. Boy, is it a flurry of
excitement over here at the White House.

1056
01:24:07,716 --> 01:24:12,251
Everybody is super, super mad. At me.
So, I went over my notes from our last meeting,

1057
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:16,990
and I am not sure when you said anything about
a "giant alien warship over Michigan Avenue."

1058
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:19,475
Tell the President this is not an attack.

1059
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:29,113
Remember this ship, Prime?

1060
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:34,101
Built for all you Knights, you great
crusaders, to explore the universe.

1061
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:38,728
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

1062
01:25:34,253 --> 01:25:35,631
Optimus?

1063
01:25:42,796 --> 01:25:46,300
Welcome back to the Knights' Temenos, Prime.

1064
01:25:47,634 --> 01:25:51,029
You have disgraced it.

1065
01:25:55,768 --> 01:25:59,788
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.

1066
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,671
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst. It's taken centuries,

1067
01:26:05,671 --> 01:26:09,840
but I have collected all the Knights but you.

1068
01:26:17,163 --> 01:26:20,967
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

1069
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,314
I am slave to no one.

1070
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:32,479
All this species mixing with species.

1071
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,360
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1072
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:37,738
The creators, they don't like it.

1073
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:42,155
They built you to do what you were told.

1074
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,751
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1075
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:47,990
Come on, Bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it.

1076
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:50,010
Savoy, mission accomplished.

1077
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:53,131
Lockdown has Prime.
The deal's going down now.

1078
01:26:53,131 --> 01:26:55,217
Picking up the Seed at the recon point.

1079
01:27:09,132 --> 01:27:11,777
Nest, Talon. L.Z. appears clear.

1080
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:35,009
Much as I have enjoyed the hunt,

1081
01:27:35,009 --> 01:27:37,752
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1082
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:41,523
Our deal is done.
One Prime for one Seed.

1083
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:45,676
Handle it with care.

1084
01:27:48,512 --> 01:27:51,483
I trust your species is ready.

1085
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,648
Don't worry about our species.

1086
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:56,613
Farewell, Earth.

1087
01:28:06,297 --> 01:28:07,899
Come on, come on.

1088
01:28:20,078 --> 01:28:21,679
Bee, come on.

1089
01:28:22,456 --> 01:28:26,996
It's a bad idea.
But I am all about bad ideas.

1090
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:28,979
Let's go.

1091
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,003
Well, let's rock.

1092
01:28:51,652 --> 01:28:54,604
This is crazy. Look, you want to
cut and run, you better do it now.

1093
01:28:54,604 --> 01:28:56,131
I am going to die trying.

1094
01:28:56,131 --> 01:29:00,819
Hey, I am not here to help you get your daughter.
You're here to help me get my girlfriend.

1095
01:29:02,354 --> 01:29:06,600
Engage dark-matter drives. Full power.

1096
01:29:16,368 --> 01:29:21,369
We're behind enemy lines now.
Lockdown's ship has booby traps. Eyes open.

1097
01:29:21,369 --> 01:29:25,659
Beware of his bone grinders, brain blinders,
flesh peelers, chromosomal inverters,

1098
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:28,912
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors,
and, of course, radiation.

1099
01:29:28,912 --> 01:29:32,149
We must be quick.
We have the element of surprise.

1100
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:35,569
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.

1101
01:29:36,012 --> 01:29:40,654
Oh, get it. I kill you. Kill you.
Ugh. I hate those things.

1102
01:29:40,654 --> 01:29:43,119
- That's freaky.
- He's not alive anymore.

1103
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:45,842
Well, we looked.
They're not here. Let's go.

1104
01:29:45,842 --> 01:29:48,261
What? Hey, I am not going
anywhere without Tessa.

1105
01:29:48,261 --> 01:29:51,189
I am unclear. What's in it for me?

1106
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:52,936
What's in it for you?

1107
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:59,541
Easy. Let's use words.
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.

1108
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:03,314
We're getting the boss back.
And the girl. Copy?

1109
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:07,804
Okay, okay.
Very persuasive. Textbook machismo.

1110
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:11,296
Well, then.
We will need to sabotage something.

1111
01:30:11,296 --> 01:30:14,659
Better hurry. Because dark-matter
drives are preparing to take off.

1112
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:19,509
Oh, wonderful. I give us 10 minutes.
Is that what that sound is? The engines filling up?

1113
01:30:19,509 --> 01:30:21,173
Are you telling me
that thing's going to be...

1114
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:24,006
This is going to be flying out of here
in 10 minutes? Uh-huh. Ten minutes?

1115
01:30:24,006 --> 01:30:25,737
Could be nine. Worst case, seven.

1116
01:30:25,737 --> 01:30:28,000
- Humans, search the cell blocks.
- We're wasting time, let's go.

1117
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,386
- We will find the center core.
- Let's move.

1118
01:30:30,386 --> 01:30:32,635
We're going to stop this nightmare ship.

1119
01:30:47,376 --> 01:30:49,453
We're never going to find her
in this huge ship.

1120
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:51,658
Like a needle in a haystack.

1121
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,957
Tessa.

1122
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,801
- Great.
- Great.

1123
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:00,470
Oh, that was smooth.

1124
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:03,265
No, that was really smooth,
letting everybody know we're here.

1125
01:31:03,265 --> 01:31:05,213
Now they're going to be looking for us.

1126
01:31:13,007 --> 01:31:17,101
Better hurry, Crosshairs,
before we go into space.

1127
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:20,365
Ah. Here's the little jujube right here.

1128
01:31:21,725 --> 01:31:23,844
Hello, Mama.

1129
01:31:35,273 --> 01:31:37,746
Who fired the anchors?

1130
01:31:41,387 --> 01:31:44,917
Who's on my ship?
We have a loose prisoner.

1131
01:31:48,561 --> 01:31:51,203
Hurry up. We got like six minutes.

1132
01:31:51,203 --> 01:31:52,670
We will find her.

1133
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:55,518
Hold up.

1134
01:31:58,896 --> 01:32:00,113
Back up.

1135
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:05,430
Come on, these things
are going to find us. Hurry, hide.

1136
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,323
Whoa.

1137
01:33:01,658 --> 01:33:02,859
"Weapons."

1138
01:33:03,153 --> 01:33:05,655
Come here. Help me. Hurry, hurry.

1139
01:33:11,328 --> 01:33:12,970
Help me up.

1140
01:33:13,179 --> 01:33:15,551
There are some weird sounds out there.

1141
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,054
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1142
01:34:02,054 --> 01:34:03,512
You ready?

1143
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:04,930
Run....

1144
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:10,985
Oh.

1145
01:34:14,002 --> 01:34:16,212
All right, we're not going down
without a fight.

1146
01:34:18,435 --> 01:34:20,287
They turn that corner,
and we're going to take them.

1147
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:22,619
You ready or you going to bitch out on me?
No, I got your back.

1148
01:34:22,619 --> 01:34:24,110
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

1149
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:29,529
Don't bitch out on me.
Are you ready? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1150
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:33,118
Whoa, okay. I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender.

1151
01:34:38,264 --> 01:34:41,684
I am so sorry. I am so, so, so sorry.
What'd you do? How'd you do that?

1152
01:34:41,684 --> 01:34:42,969
I have no idea.

1153
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:45,680
You no-good, chickenshit little rat.

1154
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,783
Look at that. You see that? Oh. Whoa.

1155
01:34:50,342 --> 01:34:52,270
You stay here, Lucky Charms.

1156
01:35:10,322 --> 01:35:13,826
Oh, man. I am so going to patent this shit.

1157
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:27,984
Ew....

1158
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:29,649
Tess.

1159
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,484
Dad. Help me.

1160
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,796
- Hey. Tess?
- Tess.

1161
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:42,327
Come on, move, move.

1162
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:44,417
Tessa.

1163
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:48,951
Shane, I love you. I love you.
You saved me. You saved me. I know. I know.

1164
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,304
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1165
01:35:52,304 --> 01:35:55,466
- Thank you. You saved me.
- Oh, yeah, he saved you. Yeah.

1166
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,792
Yeah.

1167
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,623
I think you and Mr. "I Surrender"
have a lot to catch up about, sweetie.

1168
01:35:59,623 --> 01:36:01,158
He saved me, too.
You should have seen him in there.

1169
01:36:01,158 --> 01:36:04,317
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.

1170
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:07,056
- Eyes open.
- I almost got it.

1171
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:11,228
Big boy coming through.
Move, move, move. Whoa.

1172
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:15,569
This has got to be the Supermax.
Watch the corners.

1173
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:19,694
There's a lot of cages.
Oh, yeah. Creepy critters in here.

1174
01:36:19,694 --> 01:36:22,197
I don't want to know
what's in the big cage.

1175
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,970
- What's this?
- Hound, don't do it.

1176
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:27,448
Aw, you don't look
very dangerous in there.

1177
01:36:28,248 --> 01:36:31,868
Oh, that's festering ugliness.

1178
01:36:32,252 --> 01:36:34,671
I am hit. I am down. It's melting.

1179
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:35,948
It burns.

1180
01:36:36,925 --> 01:36:42,590
Ugh, I think it's acid.
Ah, nuts. It's just shizzle.

1181
01:36:43,171 --> 01:36:44,890
I hope that's not contagious.

1182
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:48,461
I got to hurt you now.
You're just too disturbing to live.

1183
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:50,645
Take that, "bitch."

1184
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:55,442
- Oh. You're dead.
- Hound. He's alive.

1185
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:56,814
Hold on, boss, we're coming.

1186
01:36:56,814 --> 01:36:59,067
- Optimus, sound off.
- In here, quick.

1187
01:36:59,067 --> 01:37:00,489
Hang on, we're coming for you.

1188
01:37:00,489 --> 01:37:02,317
The arms of this Knight Ship detach.

1189
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:05,369
We can break free. It's a separate ship.
Hurry.

1190
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:06,845
Where's the cockpit? Right or left?

1191
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:08,201
- Right.
- I am on it, boss.

1192
01:37:08,201 --> 01:37:11,708
Hurry. We have no time. Sensei.

1193
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:15,329
Let's rock.
I always wanted to fly one of these things.

1194
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,756
I am there, boss.

1195
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,502
Hey, Yeager Technologies,

1196
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,963
you going to invent us
a way out of this one?

1197
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,136
Oh.....

1198
01:37:31,128 --> 01:37:33,430
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

1199
01:37:34,556 --> 01:37:35,934
I am not doing this.

1200
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:38,106
- I am not doing that.
- Yes, we are.

1201
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:41,234
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on.

1202
01:37:41,646 --> 01:37:45,548
No way. Sweetie, you know why I am here?
I'm here to protect you. You've done great at that.

1203
01:37:45,548 --> 01:37:48,466
I want you to trust me right now.
We're getting down. Let's go.

1204
01:37:52,841 --> 01:37:57,712
Don't look down, okay? Step.
See, it's easy. Come on.

1205
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:02,797
Careful, these cables
are starting to get thinner here.

1206
01:38:02,797 --> 01:38:08,425
Step. Step. There. Oh, my God. See.
Don't look down. All right? Don't look down.

1207
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:10,805
We're going to be at the building
in no time.

1208
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,270
You okay, Tess?

1209
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,271
Keep stepping.

1210
01:38:15,814 --> 01:38:18,488
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Dad. Oh.

1211
01:38:22,137 --> 01:38:25,282
All right, sweetie.
You need to keep moving here, okay?

1212
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:29,029
- Come on.
- I can't. I am freaking out.

1213
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,537
You need to move now.

1214
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:33,832
I am not moving.
I am going back to the ship.

1215
01:38:36,427 --> 01:38:38,148
Oh, shit.

1216
01:38:38,438 --> 01:38:39,858
You can't go back to the ship, honey.

1217
01:38:39,858 --> 01:38:43,244
Watch me. You are not 18 years old yet
and you're going to do what I say.

1218
01:38:43,244 --> 01:38:44,452
Now let's go.

1219
01:38:50,917 --> 01:38:54,390
We need to go this way, okay.
Not that way.

1220
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:55,889
Talk to her, Romeo. Now.

1221
01:38:55,889 --> 01:38:57,301
Come on, for God's sake.

1222
01:38:57,301 --> 01:38:59,208
Do not start with me.

1223
01:39:03,595 --> 01:39:05,363
Oh, my God, what is that?

1224
01:39:05,363 --> 01:39:06,649
All right, Tessa.

1225
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:10,652
Don't look back. Well, don't say that
to me. Now I want to turn around.

1226
01:39:10,652 --> 01:39:13,805
It's nothing major, sweetie.
Well, that means it's totally major.

1227
01:39:13,805 --> 01:39:15,417
I am going to have to point this gun
in your direction.

1228
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:18,248
It's going to feel like it's in
your direction, but I am not.

1229
01:39:19,686 --> 01:39:21,466
- You better hurry.
- Are you trying to kill me?

1230
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:23,462
I had to bust my ass
to get up here on this spaceship.

1231
01:39:23,462 --> 01:39:25,409
- Shoot it.
- Get down now.

1232
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:48,429
Tessa, wait.
I am coming for you. Tessa. Oh.

1233
01:39:58,025 --> 01:40:00,328
- Oh, my God.
- I am coming.

1234
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,171
Hold on.

1235
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:29,865
You're the best, Bee. You are the best.
You damn right. And don't ever forget it.

1236
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:32,238
You see that? Look at me.
We're off the ship, right?

1237
01:40:32,609 --> 01:40:34,863
Bumblebee. Bumblebee. Friendly.

1238
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:38,871
Enemy ships are coming in hot.
Get on. Get on.

1239
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,404
Oh...

1240
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,353
Hold your knickers, I am punching it.

1241
01:41:01,881 --> 01:41:05,122
They got three ships on them.
I am giving it the juice.

1242
01:41:08,746 --> 01:41:11,024
Come on, Bee, take them out.

1243
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,822
Good move, Bee.

1244
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,533
This one's for you, A-holes.

1245
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:37,479
If you're going to do something,
you better do it. Come on.

1246
01:41:38,643 --> 01:41:42,813
I am sick of this crap.
You fly. I shoot.

1247
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:48,257
Hey, you better let me fire this big-ass gun
and make this ship go faster. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1248
01:41:49,886 --> 01:41:52,064
Listen up. Crash course. Tracer guns.

1249
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:55,192
Punch forward to fire,
slide back to reload.

1250
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:58,636
What? Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. Wait.

1251
01:41:58,636 --> 01:41:59,708
What're you talking about?

1252
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:01,081
- I don't know what he means.
- Good luck.

1253
01:42:01,081 --> 01:42:02,744
Where are you going?

1254
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:04,586
To lay some hate.

1255
01:42:14,078 --> 01:42:17,886
Say it. Okay. Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1256
01:42:17,886 --> 01:42:19,350
Go...

1257
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:32,462
Yeah, I got one. Whoo.

1258
01:42:33,722 --> 01:42:35,475
These alien guns kick ass.

1259
01:42:38,211 --> 01:42:41,655
Come on, he's on us.
Bee, you got to move. Duck.

1260
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:46,664
Bee, fire the gun.

1261
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:00,789
Uh-oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1262
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:12,109
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1263
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:16,990
That was insane.

1264
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:19,355
Tess, you okay?

1265
01:43:27,484 --> 01:43:29,662
- Okay.
- Sir?

1266
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,173
You better have insurance.

1267
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,802
Insurance?

1268
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,878
It's a freaking spaceship.

1269
01:43:39,878 --> 01:43:41,801
You go get insurance
on a freaking spaceship.

1270
01:43:41,801 --> 01:43:43,046
Good luck with that, buddy.

1271
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,429
Is this your car? Huh?

1272
01:43:49,256 --> 01:43:51,479
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1273
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,529
Here you go.

1274
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:55,404
Come here.

1275
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:57,989
- Trust your dad.
- Okay.

1276
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:07,658
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1277
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,777
We're almost ready to separate.
We're almost there.

1278
01:44:17,777 --> 01:44:19,845
- Hurry, he's launching.
- All over it, chief.

1279
01:44:19,845 --> 01:44:23,173
Lockdown will be in deep space
before he realizes I am gone.

1280
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:25,680
I am a sucky pilot,
but let's give it a whirl.

1281
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,181
Hell, yeah.

1282
01:44:35,694 --> 01:44:37,809
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1283
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:40,612
What a deft hand.
I am sure nobody noticed all that.

1284
01:44:40,612 --> 01:44:43,305
Look. In a few minutes, there are
going to be feds all over this place,

1285
01:44:43,305 --> 01:44:45,650
and I don't want them finding our Holy Grail.

1286
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:50,256
So we're going to take all our R&D,
we're moving it to our China facility. Yeah.

1287
01:44:50,256 --> 01:44:54,042
I want you to bring me the Seed,
but I want you to bring it to me there.

1288
01:44:54,042 --> 01:44:59,006
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe
your product testing as perfected.

1289
01:44:59,006 --> 01:45:01,925
We have plenty of time
for improvements in China.

1290
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:07,141
Sir, Galvatron. He was... A fiasco.

1291
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,179
A farrago. An embarrassment.

1292
01:45:10,488 --> 01:45:13,014
And he spoke. How did that happen?

1293
01:45:13,014 --> 01:45:15,185
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley?
A flaw?

1294
01:45:15,185 --> 01:45:18,570
A flaw is a total failure.

1295
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:24,101
I did not have control over my prototype,
and I want to know why.

1296
01:45:41,801 --> 01:45:46,422
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.
We got a ship now. We're leaving.

1297
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:50,681
You humans. After all we have done.

1298
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,514
You don't know
what you have wrought upon yourselves.

1299
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:55,800
What? What is it now?
What are you talking about?

1300
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,733
I mean, I am doing stuff
out of my league here.

1301
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,157
You don't see who's controlling who.

1302
01:46:01,157 --> 01:46:04,070
Within that manmade prototype I fought,

1303
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:07,028
I sensed the presence...

1304
01:46:07,028 --> 01:46:08,703
...of Megatron.

1305
01:46:09,588 --> 01:46:11,990
What, the Decepticon that
started the Chicago war?

1306
01:46:12,323 --> 01:46:15,283
How do you think KSI
built those bots in the first place, hmm?

1307
01:46:15,283 --> 01:46:20,001
They had a whole mess of dead Decepticon heads
and they were downloading their minds.

1308
01:46:20,001 --> 01:46:22,213
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.

1309
01:46:22,213 --> 01:46:25,052
No union, no benefits, no nothing.

1310
01:46:25,503 --> 01:46:29,204
They hooked me up to Megatron, and that
mind wasn't as dead as they thought.

1311
01:46:29,204 --> 01:46:31,268
He fed them the science and specs.

1312
01:46:31,268 --> 01:46:34,266
All so they could build him
a brand-new body.

1313
01:46:35,213 --> 01:46:39,238
Then he infected it
with his evil, nasty chromosomes.

1314
01:46:40,344 --> 01:46:44,000
They had red, beady eyes.
They got all in my lovely locks.

1315
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,653
Oh, I can smell it right now.

1316
01:46:45,653 --> 01:46:47,984
Total inside custom job.

1317
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:53,189
KSI might have named the body
the snappy name of Galvatron,

1318
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:56,434
but that's just Megatron reincarnated.

1319
01:46:56,434 --> 01:46:58,110
You knew this and you didn't warn them?

1320
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:02,528
Little girl, you can go to a pretty
dark place when you on death row.

1321
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:05,761
He's been playing KSI all this time,

1322
01:47:05,761 --> 01:47:10,371
all so that he could manipulate them
into going after the Seed.

1323
01:47:10,975 --> 01:47:14,853
Wait. The Seed?
Those nasty soldiers that were chasing us.

1324
01:47:14,853 --> 01:47:18,615
I saw them board the ship, and they took
something that they called the Seed. Listen.

1325
01:47:18,615 --> 01:47:21,635
Sixty million years ago,
give or take an eon...

1326
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:25,113
Thousands of planets
were cyber-formed with Seeds.

1327
01:47:28,559 --> 01:47:33,409
They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.

1328
01:47:34,356 --> 01:47:39,600
Our creators destroyed your world
to make us.

1329
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,780
And that's what Galvatron
wants to happen again.

1330
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:46,886
He wants to detonate that Seed
in the biggest city and kill millions.

1331
01:47:46,886 --> 01:47:50,229
He's going to show the world,
"Baby, I am back."

1332
01:47:50,488 --> 01:47:54,864
The blast wave will incinerate
that city into molten metal.

1333
01:47:54,864 --> 01:48:01,935
He will have enough to build a massive army
and annihilate your species forever.

1334
01:48:01,935 --> 01:48:05,005
You dumb, greedy bastards
just brought extinction to yourself.

1335
01:48:05,005 --> 01:48:07,707
Not my problem, though.
I am free at last.

1336
01:48:07,707 --> 01:48:10,000
Whole thing worked out good for me.
I am walking.

1337
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,569
We got to get the Seed
before Galvatron does.

1338
01:48:27,158 --> 01:48:30,587
The Seed is going to be
the salvation of our company.

1339
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:32,855
We take delivery tonight.

1340
01:48:32,855 --> 01:48:36,105
And next month, we detonate safely
in the Mongolian desert.

1341
01:48:36,105 --> 01:48:40,805
And we will create enough Transformium
for a hundred years.

1342
01:48:44,859 --> 01:48:47,802
Dad, I am tired of running and stealing.

1343
01:48:47,802 --> 01:48:51,945
Well, a place to sleep.
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1344
01:48:57,413 --> 01:48:59,453
You know, when I was your age,

1345
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:03,362
I liked to get a little wild.
I liked cars, girls.

1346
01:49:07,006 --> 01:49:08,838
But then there was Tessa.

1347
01:49:09,217 --> 01:49:13,729
And when she was born, all I ever wanted out of life
was for her to be happy and healthy and safe.

1348
01:49:14,289 --> 01:49:17,434
Somehow I thought I'd always
be enough to protect her.

1349
01:49:19,185 --> 01:49:20,887
But I won't be.

1350
01:49:21,104 --> 01:49:22,806
I will never be.

1351
01:49:24,175 --> 01:49:26,318
So somebody better be.

1352
01:49:31,002 --> 01:49:33,449
Thanks for being here today, Lucky Charms.

1353
01:49:36,103 --> 01:49:40,997
Well, thanks for not shooting me when you
had the chance. Oh, I will have more.

1354
01:49:42,251 --> 01:49:44,123
Yeah, I can see that.

1355
01:49:44,837 --> 01:49:47,666
We have intercepted the encrypted communications.

1356
01:49:47,666 --> 01:49:52,845
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory
in Guangzhou, China.

1357
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:55,005
Hey, big shot.

1358
01:49:56,007 --> 01:49:59,966
Your company's in serious trouble.
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1359
01:49:59,966 --> 01:50:02,283
Really?
Well, you better have a great one because

1360
01:50:02,283 --> 01:50:05,000
you're about to be responsible
for the annihilation of a city.

1361
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,274
Now, you listen to me.

1362
01:50:06,274 --> 01:50:08,734
Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.

1363
01:50:08,734 --> 01:50:11,104
And now Galvatron is after that Seed.

1364
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:14,208
Look. I know you have a conscience
because you're an inventor, like me.

1365
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:17,414
Do not let Galvatron
anywhere near that Seed.

1366
01:50:17,414 --> 01:50:20,162
I control Galvatron. I created him.

1367
01:50:20,663 --> 01:50:22,332
Deep down, I know you know.

1368
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:25,997
Your prototype's been controlling you.

1369
01:50:29,297 --> 01:50:31,716
How fast can that thing get us
halfway around the world?

1370
01:50:32,009 --> 01:50:35,087
Very. It's a spaceship.

1371
01:50:51,636 --> 01:50:55,231
If we're traveling, now's the time.

1372
01:50:56,266 --> 01:50:59,996
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.

1373
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:07,747
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

1374
01:51:16,744 --> 01:51:18,546
She's a keeper.

1375
01:51:19,006 --> 01:51:20,773
Must take after her mom.

1376
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:24,261
I can't argue with that, kid.

1377
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:28,297
Move. We're retrieving the Seed,

1378
01:51:28,297 --> 01:51:31,293
but then we're done defending the humans.

1379
01:51:31,293 --> 01:51:34,006
What, done?
What do you mean, you're done?

1380
01:51:34,006 --> 01:51:37,686
Means "finished,"
"see ya," "good-bye."

1381
01:51:51,488 --> 01:51:55,603
Hijacked part of my ship?
How did you let this happen?

1382
01:51:55,603 --> 01:52:00,551
Shut down dark-matter drive, reverse course
at light speed, and get us back.

1383
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:03,634
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1384
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:06,603
And he will feel my wrath.

1385
01:52:14,185 --> 01:52:15,288
Welcome to China.

1386
01:52:15,288 --> 01:52:18,591
Put Galvatron in containment.
Tell the techs do not activate him.

1387
01:52:18,591 --> 01:52:19,820
Absolutely, sir.

1388
01:52:25,072 --> 01:52:26,414
Joyce.

1389
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:31,127
I cannot tell you
how enthused I am to deliver this.

1390
01:52:33,171 --> 01:52:35,515
Top of your alien wish list.

1391
01:52:35,515 --> 01:52:39,087
It's yours. Or rather ours.

1392
01:52:41,246 --> 01:52:43,569
I will need to see my advance.

1393
01:52:43,569 --> 01:52:46,000
Five million shares of the company.

1394
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,304
Together, we're going to end human warfare.

1395
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:51,112
We're about to build
a fully automated U.S. Army.

1396
01:52:51,112 --> 01:52:54,998
Just think of all the American lives
we're going to save.

1397
01:53:09,001 --> 01:53:11,784
So how soon until
we can start continuous production?

1398
01:53:22,746 --> 01:53:27,391
You know, why don't we take
a beat on this for a minute?

1399
01:53:27,876 --> 01:53:32,020
I have some new data that I discovered and...
You're not backing out on me here?

1400
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:33,899
No, I am not backing out. I just...

1401
01:53:33,899 --> 01:53:36,144
I want the Seed.
I am not saying I don't want the Seed.

1402
01:53:36,144 --> 01:53:40,572
I am just saying I don't know if I...
if I want the Seed right now.

1403
01:53:40,896 --> 01:53:45,405
Good men have died trying to get
that thing for us. For you.

1404
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:50,038
I know what you did to get that thing.
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1405
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:53,690
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops.
Don't you threaten me.

1406
01:53:54,243 --> 01:53:58,905
I started this company when I was a boy,
with a dream of making the world a better place.

1407
01:53:58,905 --> 01:54:01,881
Funny. I had the same dream.

1408
01:54:02,386 --> 01:54:06,055
Somewhere along the way,
you made billions of dollars.

1409
01:54:06,055 --> 01:54:08,305
So why don't you tell me
what's missing from my dream?

1410
01:54:08,305 --> 01:54:11,402
Why don't you tell me what's missing
from my boyhood dream?

1411
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:17,140
I have served my country for decades
of unparalleled prosperity

1412
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:19,801
and you are my golden parachute.

1413
01:54:19,801 --> 01:54:24,122
So you are damn well
jumping out of the plane with me.

1414
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:37,744
I am Galvatron.....

1415
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,582
- What's going on?
- Your Galvatron has gone active.

1416
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:48,972
What haven't you been telling me?

1417
01:54:48,972 --> 01:54:52,444
Find Darcy, and bring a car around
downstairs. Quietly.

1418
01:54:53,087 --> 01:54:55,868
We got a factory emergency.
I have to get you out of here.

1419
01:54:55,868 --> 01:54:57,752
- What the hell's going on?
- Take them outside.

1420
01:54:57,752 --> 01:55:00,148
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

1421
01:55:00,976 --> 01:55:02,649
I got what "it" wanted.

1422
01:55:03,846 --> 01:55:08,653
My brothers, today I grant you your freedom.

1423
01:55:08,653 --> 01:55:13,832
And from now on, you are commanded by me.

1424
01:55:14,283 --> 01:55:16,126
Rise up.

1425
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:20,634
Go find my Seed.

1426
01:55:34,377 --> 01:55:38,523
Detonate the Seed in the largest city.

1427
01:55:39,716 --> 01:55:41,802
Listen, princess.
I don't want to hear, "I told you so,"

1428
01:55:41,802 --> 01:55:43,737
but this is much more dangerous than I think.

1429
01:55:43,737 --> 01:55:44,871
Get in.

1430
01:55:51,295 --> 01:55:54,551
- Galvatron's hacked into the others.
- What? Joshua.

1431
01:55:54,551 --> 01:55:56,586
- You have to contain this.
- Drive, drive.

1432
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:58,238
Son of a...

1433
01:56:00,628 --> 01:56:03,047
Come on.
Let's move, let's move, let's move.

1434
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:20,828
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.

1435
01:56:20,828 --> 01:56:23,859
I know a military garrison there
that will help us.

1436
01:56:24,469 --> 01:56:27,113
Threatening a professional CIA killer.

1437
01:56:28,064 --> 01:56:30,703
Possibly not my finest hour.
I'd like to have that one back.

1438
01:56:30,703 --> 01:56:36,148
Killer? I thought they were your friends. No.
Not friends. Business. They gave me this bomb.

1439
01:56:36,148 --> 01:56:41,369
Bomb? Oh. Is there a bomb in the bag?
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

1440
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:42,837
<i>Shit.</i>

1441
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:56,819
When you said you were done fighting for
humans, you didn't mean that, did you?

1442
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:02,907
How many more of my kind must be
sacrificed to atone for your mistakes?

1443
01:57:02,907 --> 01:57:05,693
Well, what do you think being human means?
That's what we do.

1444
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:07,729
We make mistakes.

1445
01:57:08,305 --> 01:57:11,484
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.

1446
01:57:16,438 --> 01:57:23,462
When I fixed you, it was for a reward.
That was it. That was why. For money.

1447
01:57:24,421 --> 01:57:26,840
And it was me making a mistake.

1448
01:57:27,381 --> 01:57:29,835
Without it, you wouldn't be here.

1449
01:57:32,328 --> 01:57:36,449
So even if you got no faith in us,
I am asking you to do what I do.

1450
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:39,265
I am asking you to look at all the junk
and see the treasure.

1451
01:57:40,261 --> 01:57:44,466
You got to have faith, Prime,
in who we can be.

1452
01:57:56,003 --> 01:57:58,771
I am seriously pissed
we're not getting paid for this.

1453
01:57:59,331 --> 01:58:02,175
Well, at least we get to kill him.

1454
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,240
They're not getting away if
I still got him on satellite.

1455
01:58:05,462 --> 01:58:08,636
Some genius.
Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

1456
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:11,591
- Joshua?
- Yes?

1457
01:58:11,591 --> 01:58:13,573
How lethal is that bomb?

1458
01:58:13,573 --> 01:58:15,845
Uh, I don't know. Let me check.

1459
01:58:21,877 --> 01:58:24,514
I love this. This is so good.
Oh, hang on.

1460
01:58:25,356 --> 01:58:28,600
I am getting a text from
IL Duce in Hong Kong.

1461
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:32,855
"Need to know
the Seed's estimated blast range." Duh.

1462
01:58:41,789 --> 01:58:45,038
I will do the diversion.
Get that thing somewhere safe.

1463
01:58:50,431 --> 01:58:52,704
Killers are coming. Guys, we got to go.

1464
01:58:52,704 --> 01:58:57,578
Guys, guys... Shut up. Shut up. All right.
I am sorry. All right, go ahead, go ahead.

1465
01:58:59,791 --> 01:59:02,859
Okay, good? No, don't go. Wait.

1466
01:59:02,859 --> 01:59:06,752
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.

1467
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:10,697
I need a raise. I want a raise.
All right, yes. I am sure whatever you want.

1468
01:59:14,472 --> 01:59:15,819
Go, go, go.

1469
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:19,368
Oh, no.

1470
01:59:21,645 --> 01:59:23,966
Death is on our tail.
Death is on our tail.

1471
01:59:30,654 --> 01:59:33,753
Get out of the way, all of you.
Get out of the way.

1472
01:59:35,577 --> 01:59:37,875
I don't want to die like this.

1473
01:59:53,009 --> 01:59:54,770
Box them in.

1474
02:00:08,518 --> 02:00:11,831
Hurry, hurry. Come, come. Okay, yes.
I will follow you anywhere. You're amazing.

1475
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:15,149
We're going to get you to the roof.
Good, good.

1476
02:00:20,413 --> 02:00:21,506
Go.

1477
02:00:32,234 --> 02:00:34,306
LOL. That's funny.

1478
02:00:34,677 --> 02:00:36,652
I can't... This is really happening.

1479
02:00:36,652 --> 02:00:41,118
A man, me, who is worth
over 20 billion dollars is now

1480
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:44,820
being chased by CIA assassins.
That's the truth.

1481
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:48,337
And in the middle of a robot uprising.

1482
02:00:50,217 --> 02:00:53,992
And I am carrying what is,
in essence, a tactical nuke.

1483
02:00:53,992 --> 02:00:59,306
And the great thing is I... The great thing is
that I am... I am barely feeling any jetlag.

1484
02:00:59,306 --> 02:01:00,953
- Just stop it.
- What?

1485
02:01:00,953 --> 02:01:02,904
You need to hide on the roof
of this building.

1486
02:01:02,904 --> 02:01:04,894
I will get you a helicopter extraction.

1487
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,726
Okay.

1488
02:01:11,381 --> 02:01:13,024
I like her.

1489
02:01:13,425 --> 02:01:14,994
I find her very attractive.

1490
02:01:16,595 --> 02:01:18,738
He's definitely around here.

1491
02:01:19,255 --> 02:01:20,655
Come on, come on.

1492
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,319
I got a bike.

1493
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:26,320
Check in there.

1494
02:01:26,621 --> 02:01:29,222
These are the CIA assassins I told you about.

1495
02:01:31,283 --> 02:01:32,475
Whoa.

1496
02:01:32,711 --> 02:01:34,457
- Guys.
- Let's go.

1497
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:36,997
Hello.

1498
02:01:43,162 --> 02:01:45,284
- Hey.
- Okay.

1499
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:53,670
- Pick it up.
- All right. I am going to.

1500
02:02:07,203 --> 02:02:08,649
Wow....

1501
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:13,301
Wow. Wow, thank you.
Wow. How did you...

1502
02:02:13,301 --> 02:02:15,869
Police training, prior to my MBA.

1503
02:02:16,438 --> 02:02:17,630
I love you.

1504
02:02:18,881 --> 02:02:21,501
Get to the roof.
All right, okay.

1505
02:02:52,407 --> 02:02:53,533
Mmm.

1506
02:03:16,131 --> 02:03:19,305
Find my Seed. It's here.

1507
02:03:19,305 --> 02:03:21,819
Those prototypes are after that bomb.

1508
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:31,667
No....

1509
02:03:31,895 --> 02:03:34,538
No, no, no, no.

1510
02:03:37,694 --> 02:03:39,291
Who the hell's aboard that?

1511
02:03:39,291 --> 02:03:41,163
Impossible.

1512
02:03:48,537 --> 02:03:53,588
Brothers, it's the Autobots.
Shoot them down.

1513
02:03:58,547 --> 02:04:01,065
- Joshua.
- Hey, Baldy.

1514
02:04:01,065 --> 02:04:02,850
Hey, it's me. Hey.

1515
02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:04,396
Bring it over now. Let's go.

1516
02:04:04,988 --> 02:04:06,734
Hurry up, run.

1517
02:04:06,734 --> 02:04:09,707
- Hurry. Come on.
- Let's go. Move it. Guys.

1518
02:04:09,707 --> 02:04:11,831
Come on. Give it to me now.

1519
02:04:11,831 --> 02:04:13,822
Looks like we might have company.

1520
02:04:23,739 --> 02:04:25,667
- We're hit.
- We're hit.

1521
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:54,494
They live, they talk, we're dead.

1522
02:04:55,007 --> 02:04:57,539
- Kill them all.
- Pleasure.

1523
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:01,752
I count ten below.

1524
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:04,947
I thought you said
you had one prototype get infected.

1525
02:05:04,947 --> 02:05:08,509
Now he's got operational control
of my other 50. Come on.

1526
02:05:10,136 --> 02:05:12,430
- Climb.
- Climb.

1527
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:14,841
Surround them.

1528
02:05:19,229 --> 02:05:22,251
I may have started the apocalypse,
but you brought your family.

1529
02:05:22,251 --> 02:05:24,390
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.

1530
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:26,127
Oh, I am about one second away
from knocking you out,

1531
02:05:26,127 --> 02:05:29,266
taking the bomb, and just leaving you here.
Please, do me a favor.

1532
02:05:29,266 --> 02:05:33,927
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?
Come on, bitch. Come on.

1533
02:05:45,447 --> 02:05:46,963
- Evac.
- Evac.

1534
02:05:46,963 --> 02:05:48,545
We're getting flanked.

1535
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:51,631
We got company below.

1536
02:05:53,378 --> 02:05:54,426
Oh.

1537
02:05:54,426 --> 02:05:58,601
My fat ass is stuck.
Bee, take the shot.

1538
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:05,895
Oh.

1539
02:06:08,636 --> 02:06:11,810
- Into the elevator. Get in.
- Okay. Come on.

1540
02:06:14,684 --> 02:06:16,206
Get down, get down.

1541
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:18,810
Close the door. Close the door.

1542
02:06:20,948 --> 02:06:24,355
Won't go. It's not closing.
There's too much weight.

1543
02:06:24,355 --> 02:06:29,219
- Get back down to Bumblebee.
- Dad, no. Hey. You want me.

1544
02:06:39,225 --> 02:06:40,426
Center elevator.

1545
02:06:40,426 --> 02:06:42,019
Center elevator.

1546
02:06:46,149 --> 02:06:48,042
He's going to be okay.

1547
02:07:00,396 --> 02:07:03,640
Alien bomb. Alien bomb, coming through.

1548
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:07,332
Clear the way. Clear the wa...
Hi, kids. Coming through, ladies.

1549
02:07:07,332 --> 02:07:10,921
Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me. Oh, my God.

1550
02:07:10,921 --> 02:07:13,322
How do you say, "Get the fuck
out of the way" in Chinese?

1551
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:45,564
Ahhh....

1552
02:07:57,662 --> 02:08:00,305
That's a long way down.

1553
02:08:02,958 --> 02:08:04,676
You have got to be kidding me.

1554
02:08:06,354 --> 02:08:07,996
No....

1555
02:08:20,684 --> 02:08:21,996
Come on.

1556
02:08:29,007 --> 02:08:31,189
Whoa....

1557
02:08:33,363 --> 02:08:35,306
I am coming for you.

1558
02:09:10,003 --> 02:09:12,101
Never should have hidden that truck.

1559
02:09:12,101 --> 02:09:17,207
You should have never came after my family.
Tough luck, Yeager. We all have family.

1560
02:09:17,492 --> 02:09:19,639
Yeah, but I am going to live to see mine.

1561
02:09:42,725 --> 02:09:47,701
Where is my escaped bounty?
Autobots at this location.

1562
02:09:48,163 --> 02:09:50,037
Prime is close.

1563
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,418
Do whatever you have to do.

1564
02:09:54,869 --> 02:09:56,671
I intend to.

1565
02:09:58,615 --> 02:10:03,671
Darcy. Joshua. We got three more coming
in from that way. Bee, where's Tessa?

1566
02:10:04,713 --> 02:10:06,015
Dad...

1567
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:11,703
We got a real dilemma here. Okay?
I created incredible robots.

1568
02:10:11,703 --> 02:10:14,456
It's all designed
to kick that fat Transformer's ass.

1569
02:10:14,456 --> 02:10:18,645
So, really, this is a no-win situation.
It's over.

1570
02:10:18,645 --> 02:10:23,337
That was mean. Hey. I am sorry if you
can't handle the cold-hearted truth.

1571
02:10:23,337 --> 02:10:26,002
Optimus, what are my orders
with these humans?

1572
02:10:26,002 --> 02:10:27,506
Can I squish the bald guy?

1573
02:10:27,506 --> 02:10:30,890
They're in trouble.
Nah. This isn't our fight.

1574
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:33,768
I am done being an underdog.
Underdogs suck.

1575
02:10:33,768 --> 02:10:37,154
I say they get what they deserve.
What's the play, Prime?

1576
02:10:37,154 --> 02:10:40,333
It's time for reinforcements.

1577
02:10:42,667 --> 02:10:45,992
Recognize one of your Knights.

1578
02:11:16,202 --> 02:11:17,578
Come on.

1579
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:20,872
All right, come on. Come on, let's go.

1580
02:11:20,872 --> 02:11:22,295
Bee, go.

1581
02:11:26,496 --> 02:11:29,168
Come on, we got to move.
Let's go, move.

1582
02:11:32,417 --> 02:11:36,559
Where's Tessa? Tessa, get over here.
Come on. Get over here.

1583
02:11:36,922 --> 02:11:38,923
Stay behind me. I am covering you.

1584
02:11:38,923 --> 02:11:43,237
If I stop covering you, it means I am dead.
But that ain't going to happen.

1585
02:11:43,970 --> 02:11:45,314
Take that.

1586
02:11:47,516 --> 02:11:50,319
I am a wicked warrior robot.

1587
02:11:51,069 --> 02:11:53,577
Goddamn.
Come on. We got to move now.

1588
02:11:55,157 --> 02:11:56,248
Go, go.

1589
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:04,628
We got hostiles coming down the street.

1590
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:07,336
Go.

1591
02:12:11,873 --> 02:12:14,376
Bee. Twelve o'clock. Cover fire.

1592
02:12:18,338 --> 02:12:22,988
We're surrounded.
Hustle, hustle, hustle. Rocket.

1593
02:12:23,219 --> 02:12:26,394
Go, go, go.
Get down.

1594
02:12:28,457 --> 02:12:30,320
Oh, this is the perfect place to hide.

1595
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:34,247
A big glass box. Nobody will ever
find us here. That's...

1596
02:12:36,673 --> 02:12:39,447
You have got to be kidding me.

1597
02:12:39,447 --> 02:12:46,658
Legendary warriors, the powers that
created us now want us all extinguished.

1598
02:12:46,658 --> 02:12:51,960
We must join forces,
or else forever be their slaves.

1599
02:12:52,497 --> 02:13:00,193
So today you stand with us
or you stand against me.

1600
02:13:06,595 --> 02:13:09,800
We will let Prime figure this one out.
Very wise.

1601
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:14,328
There's no frigging way I am staying
down here with them. No way. No way.

1602
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:23,296
Only together can we survive.

1603
02:13:24,546 --> 02:13:26,489
Let me lead you.

1604
02:13:37,792 --> 02:13:41,680
Oh, no.
I was expecting a giant car.

1605
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,274
Come here.

1606
02:13:49,137 --> 02:13:51,935
We're giving you freedom.

1607
02:14:07,556 --> 02:14:10,876
You defend my family...

1608
02:14:12,328 --> 02:14:14,380
...or die.

1609
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:18,975
Autobots,

1610
02:14:18,975 --> 02:14:23,997
we're going to prove who we are
and why we're here.

1611
02:14:24,814 --> 02:14:27,393
Ugh, you just want to die for the guy.

1612
02:14:27,393 --> 02:14:30,619
That's leadership.
Or brainwashing, or something.

1613
02:14:30,619 --> 02:14:34,484
No. That's Optimus Prime.

1614
02:14:40,273 --> 02:14:43,525
Autobots, we charge together.

1615
02:14:44,568 --> 02:14:46,414
Now, roll out.

1616
02:14:48,698 --> 02:14:51,676
We're getting boxed in.
We're getting flanked everywhere.

1617
02:14:51,676 --> 02:14:54,902
Help me out here.
Kill anything that moves.

1618
02:14:55,121 --> 02:14:57,297
Come on, Cade, shoot.

1619
02:14:58,507 --> 02:15:00,635
Come and get some, you little bitch.

1620
02:15:00,635 --> 02:15:02,060
Incoming.

1621
02:15:06,298 --> 02:15:08,350
I can't believe
I am putting my life in your hands.

1622
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:09,756
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

1623
02:15:09,756 --> 02:15:12,020
Go ahead, take it. No, I don't want the gun.
Come on, you can lead. No, I don't want the gun.

1624
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:13,570
Then stay under there and shut up.

1625
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:16,069
All right. You're good with the gun.
So you keep it.

1626
02:15:19,953 --> 02:15:23,615
Running out of guns and ammo. Ow.

1627
02:15:30,422 --> 02:15:33,296
Come and get some.

1628
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:36,560
You're all going to die.

1629
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:58,442
Way to go, baby.

1630
02:15:59,185 --> 02:16:00,907
Good shooting, Cade.

1631
02:16:02,438 --> 02:16:08,661
I am like a fat ballerina
who takes scalps and slits throats.

1632
02:16:15,283 --> 02:16:17,577
Got your fortune cookie.

1633
02:16:18,578 --> 02:16:20,301
Come here, you little punk.

1634
02:16:23,458 --> 02:16:26,832
Pull the pin. I am dying out here.

1635
02:16:26,832 --> 02:16:30,104
Here. Take it. Take it.
Little help. Little help.

1636
02:16:30,104 --> 02:16:31,775
It's live. It's live, it's live.

1637
02:16:31,775 --> 02:16:35,145
Take it. What do you want me to do with it?
Just throw it. Give, give, give.

1638
02:16:48,775 --> 02:16:53,992
Got some bad news, Cade.
I am out of ammo and out of ideas.

1639
02:17:02,832 --> 02:17:05,299
- Faster.
- Go.

1640
02:17:12,398 --> 02:17:14,075
I will kill you.

1641
02:17:43,337 --> 02:17:45,011
Charge.

1642
02:17:55,885 --> 02:17:58,753
No, impossible.

1643
02:17:58,753 --> 02:18:01,152
They're ruining everything.

1644
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:03,592
Take that.

1645
02:18:10,865 --> 02:18:12,038
Get off me.

1646
02:18:13,502 --> 02:18:15,373
- Get up, Hound.
- I can't go on.

1647
02:18:15,373 --> 02:18:17,115
But you got to keep fighting.

1648
02:18:17,115 --> 02:18:18,708
Tank's empty, bro.

1649
02:18:19,665 --> 02:18:22,643
There's more of them coming. If you don't
get up and fight, we're going to die. Let's go.

1650
02:18:27,716 --> 02:18:29,218
Attack.

1651
02:18:32,903 --> 02:18:34,935
Optimus is here.

1652
02:18:45,868 --> 02:18:47,740
Bee, jump.

1653
02:19:36,743 --> 02:19:38,159
Uh-oh.

1654
02:20:08,004 --> 02:20:10,252
I hate cheap knockoffs.

1655
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:13,413
Awesome job.

1656
02:20:13,413 --> 02:20:18,007
- You. Who? You.
- Step forward. Wait. Why?

1657
02:20:18,007 --> 02:20:22,547
Your science will be responsible
for humanity's extinction.

1658
02:20:22,547 --> 02:20:27,801
All right. I know that you're sensitive
to this whole bioethical dilemma.

1659
02:20:27,801 --> 02:20:30,706
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is
that some things should never be invented.

1660
02:20:30,706 --> 02:20:32,440
Ahhh....

1661
02:20:35,343 --> 02:20:36,435
Okay.

1662
02:20:36,435 --> 02:20:38,516
We will lead you out of the city.

1663
02:20:38,516 --> 02:20:41,691
Get that Seed safely to the hills.

1664
02:20:41,691 --> 02:20:43,189
Use this car.

1665
02:20:43,393 --> 02:20:44,690
He almost ate me.

1666
02:20:47,347 --> 02:20:48,990
All right, we're good.

1667
02:20:49,265 --> 02:20:50,867
All right, let's go.

1668
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:53,855
Get out of that seat.

1669
02:20:55,121 --> 02:20:57,364
And you're one lucky dad to have me.

1670
02:20:58,825 --> 02:21:01,994
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that.
You drive. Let's go.

1671
02:21:12,472 --> 02:21:13,719
What did you do?

1672
02:21:13,719 --> 02:21:16,434
I don't know.
I don't know, but it's an issue.

1673
02:21:16,434 --> 02:21:18,787
- Did you press a button?
- Is it going to blow up? I don't know.

1674
02:21:18,787 --> 02:21:21,206
Your thing is beeping now,
so you must have hit something.

1675
02:21:21,206 --> 02:21:22,824
- Is it going to blow up?
- I don't know.

1676
02:21:22,824 --> 02:21:24,603
A bomb starts beeping,
that might signal a problem....

1677
02:21:24,603 --> 02:21:28,067
...you think? I am just saying
that it's a steady blinking light,

1678
02:21:28,067 --> 02:21:29,692
which could be a timer of some kind.

1679
02:21:30,731 --> 02:21:32,700
Unless it's signaling location.

1680
02:21:34,068 --> 02:21:35,240
To who?

1681
02:21:42,861 --> 02:21:45,488
We have got to call the central government
for help.

1682
02:21:50,411 --> 02:21:52,539
Optimus Prime.

1683
02:21:54,005 --> 02:21:56,679
Come to me.

1684
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:16,370
There's the bridge.

1685
02:23:34,855 --> 02:23:35,903
Back it up. Back it up.

1686
02:23:35,903 --> 02:23:41,000
Go, go, go, go. Back up. Go back. Go back.
Move. Get out of the way. I can't see.

1687
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,972
- I can't see. Shane, drive faster.
- Okay, just calm down.

1688
02:23:55,744 --> 02:23:58,144
- Shane, watch out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1689
02:24:00,582 --> 02:24:02,989
- Get cover.
- Back up. Back. Back up.

1690
02:24:07,673 --> 02:24:09,725
Autobots, fall back.

1691
02:24:13,787 --> 02:24:15,922
- Come on, move. Out of my way.
- Get out of the way.

1692
02:24:15,922 --> 02:24:18,102
- Look out.
- Just hit them. Just hit them.

1693
02:24:37,468 --> 02:24:40,792
It's a big magnet.
It's sucking up metal and dropping it.

1694
02:24:44,009 --> 02:24:45,525
Oh....

1695
02:24:47,296 --> 02:24:50,682
Go faster. Go faster. Move.
Get out of the way. It's coming. It's coming.

1696
02:24:50,682 --> 02:24:52,266
It's coming closer.

1697
02:24:52,266 --> 02:24:54,147
Go faster, Shane.

1698
02:24:56,138 --> 02:24:57,809
Watch out, watch out.

1699
02:24:58,323 --> 02:25:00,495
- Watch out.
- Look out.

1700
02:25:00,495 --> 02:25:01,743
Whoa.....

1701
02:25:03,811 --> 02:25:05,558
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1702
02:25:05,558 --> 02:25:09,584
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us.
Hard right. Take a hard right.

1703
02:25:09,792 --> 02:25:14,272
Move it. Get out of the way.
Oh, my God.....

1704
02:25:28,236 --> 02:25:31,281
Oh, no. No, the magnet. Get out, get out.

1705
02:25:31,281 --> 02:25:33,603
Come on. Come here. Get out.

1706
02:25:35,135 --> 02:25:37,311
No, no, no.
No, we're going up. Grab the bomb.

1707
02:25:37,311 --> 02:25:39,563
Help me grab the bomb.
I can't get the seat belt off.

1708
02:25:39,563 --> 02:25:41,657
Pull me down. Catch me.

1709
02:25:41,657 --> 02:25:43,317
I am going up. I am going up.

1710
02:25:43,317 --> 02:25:44,906
Get me. Grab me.

1711
02:25:46,555 --> 02:25:49,449
Pull me down. Pull me.
I can't get the seat belt off.

1712
02:25:49,449 --> 02:25:51,617
I can't get the belt off.

1713
02:25:52,293 --> 02:25:53,995
I am stuck. I am stuck.

1714
02:25:54,862 --> 02:25:56,843
Hold the bomb. I can't hold on.

1715
02:25:57,790 --> 02:26:00,768
Pull.
Guys, it's crushing me.

1716
02:26:12,513 --> 02:26:13,765
Car.

1717
02:26:14,182 --> 02:26:15,608
Move...

1718
02:26:18,844 --> 02:26:22,273
- Shane. Shane.
- I am good. I am good.

1719
02:26:22,574 --> 02:26:23,853
I am good.

1720
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,207
Bumblebee....

1721
02:26:33,877 --> 02:26:35,545
Hey, you guys.

1722
02:26:36,328 --> 02:26:37,376
Yee-hah.

1723
02:26:37,376 --> 02:26:38,840
Come on.

1724
02:26:39,841 --> 02:26:41,212
Go find someplace safe.

1725
02:26:41,212 --> 02:26:42,880
I am proud of you.

1726
02:26:56,867 --> 02:26:58,359
Get cover.

1727
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:04,781
Cade.

1728
02:27:05,766 --> 02:27:11,793
Autobots, get this bomb over the bridge
and out of the city. Dad.

1729
02:27:12,156 --> 02:27:13,625
What? Come on.

1730
02:28:10,298 --> 02:28:12,516
I got it.
I am getting this bomb out of here.

1731
02:28:12,516 --> 02:28:13,996
Give me the gun.

1732
02:28:14,886 --> 02:28:17,079
It's you and me now.

1733
02:28:22,886 --> 02:28:25,531
Look, Optimus is out there all alone.
What? You can't help him.

1734
02:28:25,531 --> 02:28:28,457
I have to, Tess. He came back for us.
Dad, don't leave, please.

1735
02:28:28,457 --> 02:28:31,450
Look, I will find you, I will get there, okay?
Dad, no, you will die.

1736
02:28:31,450 --> 02:28:33,412
You got to stay with Shane.
You're going to be okay.

1737
02:28:33,412 --> 02:28:34,625
You promise me
you're going to keep her safe,

1738
02:28:34,625 --> 02:28:38,534
rest of her life, until the end of time.
Promise me. I promise you.

1739
02:28:38,993 --> 02:28:42,495
You're the best thing I ever made, Tess.
All right, don't ever forget it, it was always you.

1740
02:28:42,495 --> 02:28:44,307
- I love you.
- Please.

1741
02:28:44,582 --> 02:28:45,879
Get in the car, now.

1742
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:47,255
Dad.

1743
02:28:56,886 --> 02:28:59,129
Prime....

1744
02:29:24,713 --> 02:29:26,474
Stop the car.

1745
02:29:27,002 --> 02:29:29,514
- You better listen.
- No, you listen.

1746
02:29:30,545 --> 02:29:32,621
I am not leaving my dad.

1747
02:29:43,825 --> 02:29:48,200
All right, we're going to
hold the line, then block the bridge.

1748
02:30:16,373 --> 02:30:18,726
You see, it takes patience to make a man.

1749
02:30:18,726 --> 02:30:22,271
The patience to watch and wait,
to protect all of us, quietly,

1750
02:30:22,271 --> 02:30:25,671
for God and country,
without any recognition at all.

1751
02:30:30,604 --> 02:30:36,028
Cade. There are no good aliens.
Or bad aliens, Yeager.

1752
02:30:36,028 --> 02:30:38,658
It's just us and them.

1753
02:30:38,658 --> 02:30:40,415
And you chose them.

1754
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:47,539
Anytime.

1755
02:30:58,666 --> 02:31:02,396
You saved the human
instead of saving yourself?

1756
02:31:02,396 --> 02:31:05,246
You bring shame upon us all.

1757
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:22,364
She never listens. Never.

1758
02:31:25,126 --> 02:31:27,599
I gave you an order.

1759
02:31:41,009 --> 02:31:44,395
Get out of here, now.
Get in. Get in.

1760
02:31:44,679 --> 02:31:46,951
Hey, you. Hey.

1761
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:53,025
Cade, get out of here. This is my fight.

1762
02:31:55,239 --> 02:32:00,165
It's my fight, and you're all going to die.

1763
02:32:08,753 --> 02:32:10,745
- Go.
- Go.

1764
02:32:10,745 --> 02:32:12,605
- Come on.
- Come on.

1765
02:32:18,413 --> 02:32:20,685
Yeah. Killer robot, my ass.

1766
02:32:28,639 --> 02:32:30,141
Whoo.

1767
02:32:38,608 --> 02:32:39,954
Come on.

1768
02:32:47,424 --> 02:32:49,868
Get away, all of you.

1769
02:32:50,335 --> 02:32:52,712
Come on, Tess.
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess.

1770
02:33:00,421 --> 02:33:01,721
Drive.

1771
02:33:04,141 --> 02:33:08,709
- You see my face, your life is done.
- Oh. Come on, come on, come on.

1772
02:33:24,611 --> 02:33:25,913
Yeah...

1773
02:33:27,432 --> 02:33:29,995
Honor to the end.

1774
02:33:31,503 --> 02:33:33,354
You still happy we met?

1775
02:33:38,291 --> 02:33:39,593
Always.

1776
02:33:46,843 --> 02:33:48,244
Hurry.

1777
02:33:49,003 --> 02:33:53,389
Quickly. I am setting off
Lockdown's grenade. Hold tight.

1778
02:34:09,273 --> 02:34:15,471
We shall meet again, Prime,
for I am reborn.

1779
02:34:30,545 --> 02:34:33,147
Kind of nice being your hero for a change.

1780
02:34:34,002 --> 02:34:36,885
You always were. All my life.

1781
02:34:38,185 --> 02:34:39,186
I love you.

1782
02:34:40,396 --> 02:34:41,567
I love you, too.

1783
02:34:42,557 --> 02:34:44,533
Let's go home to graduation, huh?

1784
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:46,402
Yeah.

1785
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,530
You're okay, kid.

1786
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:51,415
Come here, you're all right.
You're all right.

1787
02:34:54,835 --> 02:34:58,555
We don't have a home, Dad.
It blew up.

1788
02:35:02,477 --> 02:35:04,970
I might be able to help you with that.

1789
02:35:10,627 --> 02:35:12,603
Brave warriors...

1790
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:15,263
...you are free.

1791
02:35:16,174 --> 02:35:19,197
I will ride with you anytime, Spike.

1792
02:35:38,328 --> 02:35:39,831
Did you miss me?

1793
02:35:40,581 --> 02:35:41,753
No.

1794
02:35:43,834 --> 02:35:48,591
This Seed belongs to our creators,
whoever they are.

1795
02:35:49,173 --> 02:35:51,851
There remains a price on my head.

1796
02:35:52,468 --> 02:35:55,311
I endanger you all if I stay.

1797
02:35:56,338 --> 02:35:59,984
I shall take it
where it can never be found.

1798
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:03,154
Will we ever see you again?

1799
02:36:03,396 --> 02:36:04,692
Cade Yeager,

1800
02:36:04,939 --> 02:36:06,941
I do not know.

1801
02:36:07,441 --> 02:36:10,114
But whenever you look to the stars,

1802
02:36:10,778 --> 02:36:12,996
think of one of them

1803
02:36:13,989 --> 02:36:15,788
as my soul.

1804
02:36:17,158 --> 02:36:20,302
Defend this family, Autobots,

1805
02:36:21,496 --> 02:36:23,969
as they have you.

1806
02:36:24,709 --> 02:36:26,631
Defend.....

1807
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:29,388
....all they can be.

1808
02:36:36,421 --> 02:36:41,521
There are mysteries to the universe
we were never meant to solve.

1809
02:36:42,684 --> 02:36:46,690
But who we are and why we are here

1810
02:36:47,565 --> 02:36:49,566
are not among them.

1811
02:36:50,191 --> 02:36:54,242
Those answers we carry inside.

1812
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:57,615
I am Optimus Prime

1813
02:36:57,615 --> 02:37:01,250
and this message is to my creators:

1814
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:04,173
Leave planet Earth alone.

1815
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:07,009
Because I am coming

1816
02:37:07,009 --> 02:37:08,551
for you.
