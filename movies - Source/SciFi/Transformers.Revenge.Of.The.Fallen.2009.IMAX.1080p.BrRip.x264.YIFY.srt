2
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:01,143
Earth, birthplace
of the human race,

3
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,397
a species much like our own,

4
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,900
capable of great compassion

5
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,655
and great violence.

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,753
For in our quest
to protect the humans,

7
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,838
a deeper revelation dawns.

8
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,134
Our worlds have met before.

9
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,890
- Newsflash from the BBC.
- Breaking news out of Shanghai.

10
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:26,020
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.

11
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,230
We're staying on top of this
developing story for you.

12
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,776
We will bring you any new
information as we get it.

13
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,158
NEST Seahawks
approaching target.

14
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,495
Three minutes until evacuation
is complete, sir.

15
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,665
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,751
All right, give
NEST team the go.

17
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,627
Black Hawks, you're
clear to land.

18
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,966
Ding-a-ling! Come
out and get your ice cream.

19
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,556
Any bad robot out there better
get ready for an ass-whupping.

20
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,856
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

21
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,235
has taken refuge here
under my command.

22
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,152
Arcees, get ready to launch.

23
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,737
We're locked and loaded.

24
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,867
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

25
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,162
a secret but brave
squad of soldiers.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,164
All right, listen up. China's cover
story on this one is "toxic spill."

27
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,501
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

28
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,045
This makes six enemy
contacts in eight months.

29
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,340
We gotta make sure this one does not get
out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

30
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,635
A classified strike
team called NEST.

31
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,348
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

32
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,435
hiding in different
countries around the globe.

33
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,853
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.

34
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,114
Move out! Let's go!

35
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,718
All right, lronhide. We got echoes.
They're close.

36
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,721
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

37
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,487
He's here. I smell him.

38
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,992
It's close. It's getting closer.

39
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,167
- Oh, no.
- What have you got?

40
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,502
Thermal ripple.

41
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,507
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

42
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,396
Eagle niner!

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,189
I need an energy proton.

44
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,872
Panther 1, requesting
fire mission now!

45
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,375
Gunships on station.
Roll in hot!

46
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,252
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

47
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,805
We got a second Decepticon.

48
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,685
Arcee twins! Target
coming your way!

49
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,151
I got him, I got him!

50
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,225
I screwed that up. I'm okay.
I'm all right.

51
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,478
- This is combat, man.
- Total brain freeze, man.

52
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,644
What's wrong with you?

53
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,108
Bring in Sideswipe!

54
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,487
Clear a path!

55
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,670
Damn, I'm good!

56
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,434
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

57
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,937
Cyclone 98, final
attack hitting in 120.

58
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,274
Clear to drop in five,
four, three, two, one.

59
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,624
Autobots, I'm in pursuit!

60
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,778
Pull over!

61
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,843
Punk-ass Decepticon!

62
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:34,263
Any last words?

63
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:38,057
This is not your planet to rule!

64
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,476
The Fallen shall rise again.

65
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,647
That doesn't sound good.

66
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,857
Not today.

67
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,490
Come on, let's go!
All hands on deck!

68
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,368
Frankie, Mojo, out! Come on,
kiddo, we're on a schedule.

69
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,913
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

70
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,624
- Did you rent the room out?
- No, I got other ideas for your room

71
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,875
and it rhymes
with "home theater."

72
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,759
Look what I found.
It's your little baby booties.

73
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,222
- Ma.
- My little baby-bootie boy.

74
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:19,158
- You can't go.
- You see this, Dad? This is how

75
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,558
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

76
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,894
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

77
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,438
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

78
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,567
You have to come home
every holiday, not just big ones.

79
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,611
You have to come
home for Halloween.

80
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,947
Well, I can't come home
for Halloween, Mom.

81
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,447
- Well, then we'll come to you.
- You're not coming.

82
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,698
- No, we're not going anywhere.
- We'll dress up.

83
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,076
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

84
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,744
- You can't do that, Mom.
- Would you let the kid breathe,

85
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,620
for crying out loud?
Come on. Go pack.

86
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,248
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

87
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,584
Come on, chop, chop! Let's go.
March, young lady.

88
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,480
- Dad.
- I love it when you call me "young lady,"

89
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,547
- you dirty old man.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

90
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,674
- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
- What?

91
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,134
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
It's not a rap video.

92
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,552
It's just like a coach thing.

93
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,514
That was a really creepy
move just now, Dad.

94
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:03,726
Look. You know, your mother
and me are really proud of you.

95
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,272
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

96
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,984
Now I'm crying again!
This sucks!

97
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,860
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

98
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,403
You know, it's just going to be,

99
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:19,284
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

100
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,288
going out to handle
the world on his own.

101
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,623
- You okay, Pop?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,293
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

103
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,671
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

104
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,798
You'll see a lot
of that in college, too.

105
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,051
- What are you talking about, Dad?
- There's gonna be a lot of women there.

106
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,802
Yeah, well, I'm
a one-woman kind of guy.

107
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,221
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

108
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,932
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

109
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,268
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

110
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,519
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

111
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,244
How long you gonna be
riding that scooter?

112
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,035
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

113
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,996
Wait a second. Who
could that be?

114
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
In two weeks, it could be Muffy.

115
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,207
Hey, beautiful.

116
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,543
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam.
- Really?

117
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,086
You sure? I'm not hearing
a lot of conviction.

118
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

119
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:18,092
Wow, you almost sounded
serious that time.

120
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,014
Guess what? I made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

121
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:24,515
Yeah, I got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

122
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,768
All Witwicky, all the time.

123
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,912
And I got you a couple
souvenirs from the event

124
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,187
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

125
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,774
- Some mixes and candles and stuff.
- Sounds cute. I can't wait.

126
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,193
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

127
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,446
You kept your nasty,
shredded clothes?

128
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,095
Yeah. Of course,
I kept it, Mikaela.

129
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,195
It's like my Super Bowl Jersey.
I bled in this thing.

130
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,869
- Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
- No, it's not that.

131
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,371
It's just that my low
self-esteem's at an all-time high.

132
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,707
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

133
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:51,394
You really should come with me.

134
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,169
They got cheap
apartments near campus.

135
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,798
Well, that's not gonna happen
until I get my man-child father,

136
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,551
fresh out of prison,
back on his feet.

137
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,928
I heard that. Where'd you
put the clutch covers?

138
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,452
- Next to the camshafts.
- I love it when you say "camshafts."

139
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,515
Whisper it to me.

140
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,852
Camshafts.

141
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,022
Why can't I hate you?

142
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,942
It's my Witwicky charm.

143
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:16,794
Wait, hold on. Wait,
hold on a second.

144
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,738
I guess we're not breaking up.
I'll be over in 20.

145
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,491
Mikaela, I think a sliver
of the Cube got stuck on my shirt.

146
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,039
Sam?

147
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,173
There's a fire!

148
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,427
Dad, we got a fire!

149
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,488
Fire!

150
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,168
Ron, did you know it
was gonna be this hard?

151
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,793
Can you just stop?

152
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,588
Yeah, okay, I'll stop.
You carry this shit!

153
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,225
- Wow.
- Do you know what?

154
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,559
- What?
- I don't want to go anywhere with you.

155
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,811
I don't wanna go
to France with you.

156
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,437
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

157
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,813
- I'm going back inside.
- All right, fine.

158
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,940
I'll call you from Paris.

159
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,828
What is all the racket?

160
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,913
Sam?

161
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,374
Dad!

162
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,840
- What was that?
- That's the whole kitchen!

163
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,428
- Bumblebee... Oh, my...
- Bumblebee!

164
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:29,868
- 911.
- Bumblebee!

165
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,870
- Get in the garage. Go!
- What the freak just happened?

166
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,209
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

167
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,793
Holy Mother!

168
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,799
- Oh, my God!
- Whatever.

169
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
Get in the garage now!

170
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:55,286
- Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
- Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

171
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,022
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

172
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,697
My house is on fire!

173
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:12,201
- Very important.
- What happened?

174
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,999
Come here. Listen, I need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

175
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,322
- What's going on?
- Just take it.

176
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,293
- Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
- Yes, Mom. Yeah.

177
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,504
- Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot.
- Hi.

178
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,965
- An old furnace, I think.
- From a waffle iron.

179
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:28,594
When you go, he goes. I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

180
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,346
Judy... National security.

181
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,975
Look, if we stay quiet, they're
gonna take care of everything.

182
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:38,394
Just consider this the official
start of our remodel, okay?

183
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,523
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool and a hot tub!

184
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,067
And I'm gonna skinny-dip and you
can't say shit about it!

185
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,283
- Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
- He still having voice problems?

186
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,784
He's playing it up.

187
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,955
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

188
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,292
I'm so excited and I just
can't hide it.

189
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,501
Hey, I'm not taking you with me.

190
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?

191
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,235
I meant to tell you
about this earlier.

192
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,720
It's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

193
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,014
Freshmen aren't
allowed to have cars.

194
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:17,100
I know, and if it was up to me, I'd take
you with me, but it's not, Bee.

195
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,977
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

196
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,441
I mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

197
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:25,984
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

198
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,445
Can you just look at me, please?

199
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,908
Come on, big guy. Look,
the guardian thing is done.

200
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,327
Okay? You did your job.
Look, I'm safe now.

201
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,871
You need to go be with Optimus
Prime and the others.

202
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,334
I just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,

203
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,586
and I can't do that with you.

204
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,505
It's not the last time I'm
gonna see you, you know, Bee.

205
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,384
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

206
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,596
But you'll always
be my first car.

207
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,142
Love you, Bee.

208
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,981
Wow!

209
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,236
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

210
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,881
- You got dirt all over you.
- Stop. Stop.

211
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,405
- What?
- Stop, I'm okay.

212
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,865
Look.

213
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,244
So, you think you can make it through those
East Coast winters without me?

214
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,538
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

215
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,624
- And?
- And I'll do anything for you.

216
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,542
And?

217
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,712
- I think Sam's about to say the L-word.
- Let's go, kiddo!

218
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,880
Nice timing, Dad.

219
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,965
I adore you.

220
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:33,443
That's not the word that I want

221
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,885
- to hear right now.
- What are you talking about?

222
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,971
It's the same word
as the other word.

223
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,888
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I say the other word now

224
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,516
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

225
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,852
you haven't said it either. So, don't
get mad at me for not saying it.

226
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,520
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

227
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,232
Yeah, well, so do girls. Especially
girls like you, with options.

228
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,487
So, this is all part of your elaborate
plan to keep me interested?

229
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,157
- It can be.
- I hate that it's working.

230
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,993
Can I have a kiss?

231
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,829
We're going to make
it work, I promise.

232
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,950
Soundwave acknowledges.
Pursue her.

233
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,036
Retrieve it.

234
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,602
Autobot twins, report
to Hangar Three.

235
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,521
Bad-ass ice-cream
truck coming through.

236
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,481
- Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
- No, I don't...

237
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,691
- Hold up.
- Those are nice.

238
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,401
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

239
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,154
Yes, sir. Yeah! Look here,
it's my Booty call right here!

240
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,116
- Time to get my sexy on with the green.
- Green? No, green is mine!

241
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,576
I call green!

242
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,039
- I got the green.
- That hurt, man.

243
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,291
It's supposed to hurt.
It's an ass-kicking.

244
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,762
Present arms!

245
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,551
Director Galloway, what an honor.
I'd love to show you around,

246
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,115
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

247
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,784
I am now. Presidential
order, Major.

248
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,787
I got a message for your classified
space buddies!

249
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,955
You guys made
a mess of Shanghai.

250
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,336
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

251
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,590
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

252
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

253
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,662
Secure line to the Pentagon
is now open.

254
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,749
- General?
- Will, I saw the Shanghai op.

255
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335
- We had a rough day out there.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,296
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

257
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,589
Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him,

258
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:01,074
but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

259
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,176
Proceed.

260
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,446
You gotta wonder,

261
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,866
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

262
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,244
General, our alliance
has countermanded

263
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,957
six Decepticon
incursions this year,

264
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,625
each on a different continent.

265
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,628
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

266
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:41,090
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

267
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,843
"The Fallen shall rise again."

268
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,221
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

269
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,723
Origin unknown. The only recorded
history of our race

270
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,979
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with it's destruction.

271
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,646
Excuse me!

272
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,986
With this so-called
AllSpark now destroyed,

273
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,614
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

274
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,991
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

275
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,036
The Presidentjust
appointed him liaison.

276
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,705
Well, I guess I didn't
get that memo.

277
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,794
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

278
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,255
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

279
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,549
After all the damage
in Shanghai,

280
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,595
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

281
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,893
Now, under the classified
Alien/Autobot Cooperation Act,

282
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,523
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

283
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:43,528
We've witnessed your human
capacity for war.

284
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,198
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

285
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,160
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

286
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,364
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

287
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,913
in the field for two years.

288
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,291
We've shed blood, sweat
and precious metal together.

289
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,086
Soldier, you're paid
to shoot, not talk.

290
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,796
Don't tempt me.

291
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,382
And the newest members
of your team.

292
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,759
- Easy.
- I understand they arrived here

293
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,720
after you sent
a message into space,

294
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,557
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

295
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,394
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway.
It was vetted right here.

296
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,397
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team

297
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,401
has always been above reproach.

298
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,320
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

299
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:31,951
that when our national security
is at stake, no one is above reproach.

300
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,163
Now, what do we know so far?

301
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,669
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

302
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,339
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

303
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:49,927
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

304
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:54,432
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

305
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,433
is locked
in an electromagnetic vault

306
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,854
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.

307
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,442
Decepticons, we have
located the shard.

308
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:10,365
And since no one can seem to tell
me what the enemy is now after,

309
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,284
well, there's only one clear
conclusion!

310
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,203
You! The Autobots!

311
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,332
They're here to hunt you!

312
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,376
What's there to hunt
for on Earth besides that?

313
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,337
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

314
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,632
It sounds to me
like something's coming.

315
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:32,470
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

316
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,266
by denying you further
asylum on our planet,

317
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,270
will you leave peacefully?

318
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:46,233
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

319
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:52,574
But before your President
decides, please ask him this.

320
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:57,537
What if we leave
and you're wrong?

321
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,087
That's a good question.

322
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,720
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

323
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,847
I feel smarter already.

324
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,810
- Ron, can you smell it?
- Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

325
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:26,398
- Hey, cheapo!
- Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

326
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,525
Just go ahead and check
out your room.

327
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,609
Yeah, go.

328
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,202
- Hey.
- Hey.

329
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,205
- You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.
- Hey.

330
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,792
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

331
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,380
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

332
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,759
You know what this is? This
is the awkward moment.

333
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,427
Yeah, see, you're trying
to see if I'm a normal guy.

334
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,804
I'm trying to see
if you're a normal guy.

335
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,431
Balanced, unmedicated, nothing
under the crawl space.

336
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,891
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

337
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,017
No criminal record,
won't steal anything.

338
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,644
- Including girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.

339
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,979
- You got a girlfriend?
- I do. You?

340
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,441
No, not a chance. You a techie?

341
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,734
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

342
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:13,099
- Server's almost online, Leo.
- Network's up and running.

343
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,571
Beautiful,
that's what I like to hear.

344
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,659
That's Sharsky,
that's Fassbinder, my lT gurus.

345
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,869
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal.com.

346
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,204
That's me, I'm sure
you've heard of it.

347
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,707
- No, I haven't.
- Well, that sucks.

348
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,250
- What is all this for?
- See where I'm going, bro.

349
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,253
Look, call me gross, I want
to be a baby billionaire.

350
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,838
Kitten calendars. That's where I started.
Look at me now.

351
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,173
Got to have dreams, bro.

352
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:37,929
Leo! We got some brand-new
Shanghai vid!

353
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:40,973
Post it, baby! Go, go, go!
FTJ! FTJ!

354
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,433
- What's "FTJ"?
- "Fuel the Jet."

355
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,852
Fuel the Jet, bro.

356
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,313
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

357
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:49,833
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

358
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:52,317
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

359
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,778
Don't believe the hype, bro.

360
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,490
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

361
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,951
Yeah, I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

362
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,288
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

363
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,330
- it looks fake to me.
- Dude, it's not fake.

364
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,500
The Internet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

365
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,265
- It looks fake.
- No, man, I've seen them.

366
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,506
- They're, like, these robots...
- Look, look, it's fake.

367
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:15,090
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

368
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:17,218
And I wasn't there,

369
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,511
- so I can't comment or speculate.
- No.

370
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,836
"Comment or speculate"? And
we're supposed to cohabitate?

371
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,851
No, listen, okay? Don't
be sucking the sack, bro!

372
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,644
- Which sack?
- The ball sack.

373
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,270
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

374
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,356
Mainstream media sack. They're
lying to us, all right?

375
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,817
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

376
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,153
Follow me.

377
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,238
Leo, bad news!

378
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,656
We just got scooped. The
video's already up on GFR.

379
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,241
Fassbinder!

380
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,721
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

381
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,788
"Effing" was my F-ing
idea and he stole it!

382
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,375
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

383
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,836
By the way, I read your file.
I'm poor, you're poor.

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,088
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

385
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,509
I work for you now?
That's incredible.

386
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,511
It's first day of college, I got
a career in a dinky Internet firm

387
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,640
with a boss who is made
up of just pure champion stuff.

388
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,683
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

389
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,310
That's your one warning patrolling, dude.
Don't make me

390
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,020
have Fassbinder hack your financial
aid, 'cause I'll do it!

391
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,357
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little intense
in my room. Can I switch out?

392
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:18,320
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

393
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:19,489
- Oh, here we go.
- We made it. Hi.

394
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,698
It's just like Hogwarts.

395
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,990
- Hi.
- Is this co-ed?

396
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,367
This is a co-ed dorm.

397
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,911
- You guys want to meet my roommates?
- Yeah.

398
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,244
Some real swell guys.

399
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,730
- Here's Leo.
- We're the Witwickys.

400
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,873
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.

401
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,750
Hey, you have a great
son, you really do.

402
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:33,436
- Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
- Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

403
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,628
What is that in your hand,
by the way?

404
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:38,799
I got this at the bake sale for the environment
that those boys are having.

405
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,802
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

406
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,429
- Mom?
- Yeah, it's 100% pure,

407
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,138
Hawaiian green
for the environment.

408
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,723
- How many of these have you eaten?
- Drop it.

409
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,726
- What is this?
- Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

410
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,185
- No, it's...
- Please, give me...

411
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,396
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.

412
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,398
I'm going to freak out. Please
do something right now, Dad.

413
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,691
Please do something right now.

414
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,372
I can eat all the fricking
brownies I want!

415
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,444
Come on, let's go.

416
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,029
I'm sorry and you're welcome.

417
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,951
We call it the "Hot
Freshman 55."

418
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,996
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and stacked
the dorm with pretty Betties.

419
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,499
Is... Is so nice...

420
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,961
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

421
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,691
She's tied for number
one on my to-do list.

422
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,425
Do not bird-dog
my quail, you hear me?

423
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:25,762
Pretty girls! Hey, you. My
son lives in this dorm.

424
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:29,016
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

425
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,434
Glad she ain't my mama!

426
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,728
And he recently had
his cherry popped!

427
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,165
He didn't know I was in the house!
I heard it all!

428
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,858
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Here he is!

429
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,487
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

430
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:47,451
- Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
- No, like the GPS. OnStar!

431
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,369
- OnStar.
- Frisbee!

432
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,499
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

433
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,298
- Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
- Hey! Crazy!

434
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,550
- You want it?
- I want it.

435
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:07,054
Judy, Judy, just...
Just put it down.

436
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,515
- You gotta control your mother.
- I don't know who this woman is.

437
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,143
Hey, Professor, I'd do
anything for an A.

438
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,104
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

439
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,065
- Did you get the booties? All right.
- Yes, Dad, I got the booties!

440
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,942
I'm upside down!

441
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:53,518
Black Lion X-ray, this
is Black Lion Tango.

442
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,438
We have activation of motion sensors
on the Western perimeter fence.

443
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,432
Breach at B-14.

444
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,689
Go, go, go, go!

445
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,699
The shard's gone.

446
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,666
Contact!

447
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,045
Take it down!

448
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,297
- Which way?
- Shoot left!

449
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,471
Knock it down!

450
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:05,375
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

451
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,067
So, get your game faces on.

452
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,278
I can't stay long. I have
a webcam date with my girlfriend.

453
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,643
- That's so cool!
- No, it's not.

454
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,578
While he's making
out with his MacBook,

455
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,538
I'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

456
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,833
- Let's roll.
- She's hot.

457
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,751
Bro, we're hunting!

458
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,132
- See you, darling.
- Bye, Dad.

459
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,300
Okay.

460
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,601
This is our first live chat date.
I've never done it before.

461
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,978
I'm kind of nervous.

462
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,798
- Are you okay?
- No.

463
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,552
I was getting a napkin
for my drink.

464
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,972
Thanks. Cheers.

465
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,057
- It's Sam, right?
- Yeah.

466
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,811
- I wanna dance.
- What, like... Like dancing?

467
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,981
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

468
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:32,862
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi...
I'm in a relationship, kind of...

469
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:37,282
- Relax. I just want to have some fun.
- Wanna have some fun?

470
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:41,369
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

471
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,331
Oh, my...

472
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,043
So, how about tonight you
pretend I'm your girlfriend

473
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,253
and I pretend that you're
my boyfriend?

474
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,516
Hey! Who drove the freaking
yellow Camaro?

475
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,936
There is a car on the lawn!

476
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,942
What are you doing?

477
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,527
Houston, we have a problem.

478
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,695
- What is it?
- Freshman!

479
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,338
- Yeah?
- Is that your car in our bushes?

480
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,242
No, there's a friend of mine, he just
went to get you a tighter shirt.

481
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,036
There isn't a tighter shirt!
We checked.

482
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,746
Now how about I park
my foot in your ass?

483
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,456
- What size shoe do you wear?
- Yeah?

484
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,541
- Hold on.
- You wanna try?

485
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,461
- I'll back it up right now.
- Get him out of here.

486
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:34,297
You have a ride? Bro, why
are you holding out on us?

487
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,541
I've only known you 17 hours.

488
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,052
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

489
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,349
- I love Camaros.
- I can't do this right now, okay?

490
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,351
- Don't be a wimp.
- Oh, God!

491
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,987
- My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
- Yeah?

492
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:02,827
Fuel-injected. The roar
of the engine, it just tickles me.

493
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,204
We shouldn't stare...

494
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,791
I mean, share stories
with each other at all.

495
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,168
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

496
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,755
Your cheatin' heart.

497
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,010
Don't. Don't!

498
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,847
She's a super freak, super
freak She's super freaky.

499
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,057
- Is your radio broken?
- No, my concentration is.

500
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:27,934
We're not cheating.

501
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,563
Not yet.

502
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Is something wrong here?

503
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,074
God! You okay?

504
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,036
She's mighty, mighty

505
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,414
I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

506
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,630
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!

507
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,050
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.

508
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,510
I got Wetnaps for your face!
Hold on!

509
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,679
L... I'm so sorry!

510
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,516
What are you doing?

511
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,530
You won't give me a day, huh?

512
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,409
- You won't give me one day in college?
- I'm sorry, Sam,

513
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,829
but the last fragment
of the AllSpark was stolen.

514
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,748
Like what? Like
Decepticons stole it?

515
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,878
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

516
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:38,755
but I'm here for your help, Sam,

517
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,260
because your leaders believe
we brought vengeance upon your planet.

518
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,346
Perhaps they are right.

519
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:50,516
That is why they must be reminded
by another human of the trust we share.

520
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,311
- This isn't my war.
- Not yet,

521
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,773
but I fear it soon will be.

522
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,402
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

523
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,655
Whole generations lost.

524
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,536
I know, and I want
to help you, I do,

525
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,706
but I am not some alien
ambassador, you know?

526
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,583
I'm a normal kid
with normal problems.

527
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,045
I am where I'm supposed to be.

528
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:23,384
I'm sorry. I...

529
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,135
I really am.

530
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,056
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

531
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,686
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

532
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,940
We do, more than you know.

533
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:15,561
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

534
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,646
confirmed for Project
Deep Six Drop Point.

535
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,440
- What do you got?
- SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

536
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,733
diving fast.

537
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,032
Never seen anything dive
that deep that fast.

538
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,617
- Man battle stations.
- Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

539
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,579
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

540
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,373
- Left full rudder, two-thirds.
- Dive, go deep.

541
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,773
The nets protecting NBE
One are screaming, sir.

542
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,735
That is 9,300 fathoms down. And
no confirmed DSRVs on site?

543
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:06,987
- None, sir.
- Then, people, we've got a problem!

544
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:21,293
Need parts! Kill the little one!

545
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,885
The shard make Energon!

546
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,068
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

547
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:49,530
- Sound collision alarm.
- Left hard rudder.

548
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,365
Five hundred feet.

549
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,369
Angel Six, we got
six hostiles coming up.

550
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,586
- Collision imminent port side.
- One hundred feet.

551
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,713
Brace for impact.

552
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,284
Starscream, I'm home.

553
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:41,456
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

554
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,710
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

555
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:50,673
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

556
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:55,094
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

557
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,391
- So disappointing.
- Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

558
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,605
Even in death, there
is no command but mine.

559
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,989
My master, I failed
you on Earth.

560
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:19,702
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

561
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:26,168
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

562
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:29,880
It's power, it's knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

563
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:34,550
- It can only transform.
- How is that possible?

564
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,222
It has been absorbed
by the human child.

565
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:43,351
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

566
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:47,063
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

567
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,608
And you will,
my apprentice, in time.

568
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:55,989
For millennia, I have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

569
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:02,663
where I, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.

570
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:10,336
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

571
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,048
Optimus! He protects the boy.

572
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:17,427
Then the boy will lead us to him

573
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:23,016
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

574
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,188
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

575
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:33,318
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

576
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:43,119
Space. Time. Gravity.

577
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,126
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

578
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,088
We're going on a journey
together, you and I, today.

579
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:58,175
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

580
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,014
And I shall be
your consort, your guide,

581
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:06,101
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

582
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,938
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

583
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,568
For what do we know
about the stars?

584
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,530
Virgo, the virgin.

585
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,534
Orion, the great hunter.

586
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:27,246
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

587
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,666
No, they are dynamos

588
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:34,338
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

589
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:40,135
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,
a Professor once, like moi.

590
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:41,739
- Energy equals mass...
- What you doing?

591
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,282
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

592
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,724
Young man, there
are no questions

593
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:47,768
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

594
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,188
I just finished your book
and there's only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

595
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,333
Energy does equal mass
times the velocity

596
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,440
of light squared
in this dimension,

597
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,485
but what about the other 17? Nobody
ever talks about the other 17.

598
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,780
Clear example.

599
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:04,885
Break down the elemental
components of Energon,

600
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,391
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

601
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,871
Fourteen galactic
convergences it took

602
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,583
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on it's signal,

603
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,628
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

604
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,128
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

605
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,507
Come on, guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...

606
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,344
Young man, I will not be
punk'd in front of the Dean.

607
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,099
No, this is my universe here.

608
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:33,563
Do you understand? I am
the Alpha and the omega.

609
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,065
- Get out of my class!
- Yes, sir.

610
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:41,737
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

611
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:56,795
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

612
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,672
What a good boy, you are.

613
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:06,887
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

614
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,518
Come on, check that out.

615
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,188
There you go.

616
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,532
- Yes, Samuel?
- Hello? Mikaela?

617
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:28,201
I can't believe you're gonna stand
me up on our first web chat date.

618
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,085
- Something just happened to me, okay?
- What, you finally hit puberty?

619
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,789
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

620
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,583
Remember I was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

621
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,460
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

622
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,628
Watch it, watch it, watch... No! Okay,
remember how I was telling you...

623
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,007
Okay. Can you stop? Watch the foot!
Watch your foot!

624
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,132
Mikaela, okay,

625
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,302
my great-great-grandfather went
on this Arctic mission, right?

626
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,987
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

627
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,934
and he started seeing these
crazy symbols. Okay.

628
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,431
Well, now I'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

629
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,976
I just read a 903-page astronomy
book in 32.6 seconds.

630
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,436
I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

631
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,688
I am seeing symbols
ever since I...

632
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,902
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.

633
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,987
- Do you have it?
- Yeah, I have it.

634
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,949
- It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
- Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

635
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,713
- Don't touch it.
- I'm not gonna touch it.

636
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,494
Sam, it's fine.
It's locked away.

637
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,914
- No one knows where it is.
- I do!

638
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,751
You're hot, but you
ain't too bright.

639
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,922
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

640
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,260
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

641
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,264
What are you looking
at, slobber puss?

642
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,811
What the... This place
is a freaking house of horrors!

643
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,775
Pain... it hurts...

644
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,318
Hold on.

645
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,365
Right to five, then...

646
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,876
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you can do?

647
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,463
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

648
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,092
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

649
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:11,387
- You gonna talk now?
- I seek knowledge from the Cube.

650
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,222
- The Fallen demands me!
- What knowledge?

651
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,934
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.

652
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,561
They're gonna whack me! I'm gonna
be dead without that shard!

653
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,731
Easy, warrior goddess, I'm just
a little salvage-scrap drone!

654
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:25,110
- And I'm your worst nightmare.
- Hey, hey, hey!

655
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,610
- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,

656
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,237
just not on an open
phone line, okay?

657
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,280
I'm gonna get
on a plane right now

658
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,764
and I'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

659
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,626
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

660
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,420
Yeah, a live bomb!

661
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,797
- No.
- Good.

662
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,103
Major, incoming SOS
from Autobots!

663
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,983
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

664
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,068
- As in how many?
- Unclear, sir.

665
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,528
Well, get clear.

666
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,077
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

667
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,246
They're not answering our calls

668
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,914
and they're heading to New
York and Philadelphia.

669
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,208
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

670
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,253
Move it!

671
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,505
Let's go!

672
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,889
Flight 57, welcome
to Philadelphia.

673
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:41,061
Alicia, mi Amor, can I interest you
in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?

674
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,704
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

675
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,773
Basically, I've got,
like, 18 inches of meat.

676
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,443
Unless you're vegetarian. All right.
It's cool. I am, too.

677
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,820
- Sam home?
- Sam? I think he died,

678
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,197
but why don't we check?

679
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,157
- Here we are.
- Hey!

680
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,409
You ever have a song stuck in your head?
It's like

681
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,452
the worst song ever, but you can't
help to whistle it or sing it

682
00:49:58,536 --> 00:50:02,206
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

683
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,416
Kitten calendar, kitten
calendar, kitten calendar,

684
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,835
- kitten calendar...
- Dude, what the eff?

685
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,003
I know you're freaking out. Don't
freak out. Don't freak out.

686
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,172
Easy fix. Puzzle
code in my head.

687
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,896
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

688
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,010
This is the part that...

689
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:18,889
Okay, what were you saying?

690
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:22,351
Alice, I'm horrified you
had to see this. Let's go.

691
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,769
Get out.

692
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,688
Wait, wait, wait! Can
I just sit and watch?

693
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,898
I'll... I'll eat
my pizza quietly.

694
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,902
Sam, I knew there was something
special about you.

695
00:50:30,985 --> 00:50:32,277
Really?

696
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,907
And I know you know what happens

697
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,909
when two people
in the know get together.

698
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,288
They're genuinely
amazing in bed.

699
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,583
Thank you.

700
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,396
All right, listen, hold on!
Boundaries.

701
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:53,550
- Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish.
- We have needs, Sam. Relax.

702
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,842
Jeez!

703
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,847
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

704
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:04,978
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

705
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,396
You want some Turkey meatloaf?

706
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,695
Sam?

707
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,574
- Mikaela!
- Is that your girlfriend?

708
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,827
Ex.

709
00:51:21,786 --> 00:51:23,996
Mikaela! Wait!

710
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,751
I can explain...

711
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,228
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

712
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:08,291
All right, come on.

713
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,918
- She's coming!
- She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

714
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,335
- Is this real?
- Just run!

715
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:20,612
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe
I almost had sex with her in my dream!

716
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,347
I can tell that you really
missed me a lot, Sam!

717
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,806
- Look, it's not my fault, okay?
- It's not your fault?

718
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,307
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim!

719
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:26,786
- You were a victim? Of what?
- Yeah.

720
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,644
- Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
- Of... Of molestation.

721
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,438
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a Mountain ox!

722
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,856
You didn't have to put
your tongue in her mouth!

723
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,065
- I didn't! Look!
- You did!

724
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,652
You ever had your stomach tongued
by a Mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

725
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,905
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

726
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,324
- Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
- You're such a little girl!

727
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,369
We're gonna have 10 seconds
of silence right now.

728
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,619
I'm not talking to you
for 10 seconds.

729
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,539
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

730
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,166
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

731
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,458
You know what? You can give
me the silent treatment

732
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,463
all you want, but you can't
keep me from talking.

733
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:55,170
- What were you gonna say?
- I hope you had a lot of fun,

734
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,172
because this, this is over.

735
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,675
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

736
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,010
She did it? She went in there? All
her little embryo alien babies

737
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,931
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

738
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:07,809
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

739
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,018
Who are you?

740
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,188
I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.

741
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,952
The aliens, they want
me 'cause of my site.

742
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:20,989
Whoa, guys, right there!

743
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,536
Run!

744
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,623
Mikaela!

745
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,393
Come on! We gotta move!

746
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,646
It's a bomb!

747
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,157
You've got to get that box!

748
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,871
- This way.
- What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

749
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,751
Oh, my God, you know how to hot-wire a car?
That's so hot!

750
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,115
Drive, drive, drive! She's right there!
She's right there!

751
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,922
Come on, come on, come on.

752
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,675
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

753
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,094
Now!

754
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,014
Tongue!

755
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,311
Oh, my God!

756
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,320
Kiss this, bitch!

757
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,577
Drive, drive, drive.

758
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:54,641
Okay, so what else don't
I know, all right?

759
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,706
Since you guys forgot
to mention some minor details.

760
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,090
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

761
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,847
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Sam!

762
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,309
Sam!

763
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,983
- Sam!
- Hold on!

764
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,400
- Pull me up!
- Hold on!

765
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,570
Sam, get back in!

766
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,409
I don't want to die! We're gonna die!
Oh, my God!

767
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,603
Jesus! Jesus!

768
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,405
Come here, boy.

769
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:09,990
Closer.

770
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,867
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

771
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,369
You remember me, don't you?

772
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,914
I did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

773
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,291
Shut up!

774
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,293
Sam!

775
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:30,510
Yeah! Yes, yes.

776
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,139
It feels good
to grab your flesh!

777
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:40,146
I am going to kill you
slowly, painfully,

778
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,858
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

779
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,989
How I could snap your limbs off!

780
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,827
Doctor, examine this
alien specimen.

781
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:58,789
I'll scan you. Let's take
a look at your face.

782
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:06,588
I'm the doctor. The odd job.
Information!

783
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,967
Yeah!

784
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,851
Beseeching my shard!

785
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,771
Easy or tough way?

786
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,563
- There they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

787
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,465
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

788
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,637
We must have the brain
on the table!

789
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,306
- Chop, chop!
- Brain?

790
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,641
What does he mean by my brain?

791
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:01,643
Well, you have something
on your mind, something I need.

792
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,728
Hold on. I know you're pissed.
I know you're pissed

793
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,690
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

794
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,190
If somebody tried to kill
me, I'd be upset, too.

795
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,860
I think that we have
an opportunity here

796
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,072
to start anew and develop
our relationship

797
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,449
and see where it leads us, okay?

798
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,661
So, you just call Doctor inspector
off and let's just talk for five seconds!

799
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:19,954
Wait, wait, wait!

800
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,963
- Come on! Go, go!
- Sam!

801
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:32,925
Go, go, go!

802
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,286
Sam!

803
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,128
Run!

804
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,637
Go, go, go, go!

805
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,014
Here he comes!

806
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,231
Hide, Sam!

807
00:59:38,824 --> 00:59:40,367
Weak!

808
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,623
Puny! Waste of metal!

809
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,003
Junkyard crap!

810
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:54,340
Decepticons!

811
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,893
Come here, boy.

812
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,804
There is another source
of Energon hidden on this planet.

813
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,972
The boy could lead us to it.

814
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,324
Optimus!

815
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:20,925
Is the future of our race not
worth a single human life?

816
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,764
- Up! Get up!
- You'll never stop at one!

817
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,391
I'll take you all on!

818
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,143
Piece of tin!

819
01:02:14,146 --> 01:02:16,023
Sam! Where are you?

820
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,777
No!

821
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,987
You're so weak!

822
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:54,603
The last Prime is dead!

823
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:08,199
Sam, run. Run.

824
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,211
Autobots, attack!

825
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,219
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

826
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,983
This is Lennox.

827
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,000
- That went well.
- We've lost the boy, Master.

828
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,585
The Autobots must be
shielding their signals.

829
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,923
I can't even rely on you
to SWAT a simple insect?

830
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,302
- One insect among seven billion!
- Shut up!

831
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,056
He could be anywhere.

832
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,601
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

833
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:20,356
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

834
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,567
No more disguises. No mercy!

835
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,570
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

836
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,871
Decepticons, mobilize.
It is time.

837
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,724
Speaking French is so exciting!

838
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,518
Oh, God, who is this?

839
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,190
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!

840
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,860
- What? Who is this?
- Where is the boy?

841
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,865
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

842
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,157
Jeez!

843
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:56,784
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

844
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,077
Would you get out of here?

845
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,414
I didn't come all the way across the ocean
to eat a plate of snails.

846
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,789
I want to try new things.

847
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,251
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

848
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,961
It's nasty.

849
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,579
Revenge is mine.

850
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,639
Yeah!

851
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,893
Definitely not a plane...

852
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,063
Look, carriers don't just sink.

853
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,275
A horrible accident
or a terrorist attack or worse...

854
01:07:51,608 --> 01:07:53,568
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

855
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:57,989
projectile came from beyond our atmosphere,
inbound at 30,000 knots.

856
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,757
Citizens of the human hive,

857
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,261
your leaders have
withheld the truth.

858
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,890
You are not alone
in this universe.

859
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,685
We have lived among you, hidden,

860
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,354
but no more.

861
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:35,359
As you've seen, we can
destroy your cities at will,

862
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,532
unless you turn over this boy.

863
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:51,877
If you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

864
01:08:52,386 --> 01:08:54,146
What we're hearing
from the German government

865
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,216
is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.

866
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,636
The military has just told us
they have assumed Condition Delta,

867
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,471
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.

868
01:09:03,555 --> 01:09:05,515
President Obama is being
flown to a bunker

869
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,319
somewhere in the middle
of the United States

870
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:11,814
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

871
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:17,277
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

872
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,530
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,

873
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,323
but that number could climb.

874
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,449
It's still too early to tell.

875
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,953
What we need to ask now
is, "Who and why?"

876
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,956
The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

877
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,750
We believe they have
information about the attacks.

878
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,168
The FBI, CIA and lnterpol

879
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:37,588
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.

880
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,800
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

881
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,511
- They have a traffic-camera spotting...
- They have a picture of me, man.

882
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,014
We're dead, bro. FBI, CIA,
we are wanted fugitives now!

883
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,306
I just need you to focus

884
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,350
- for one minute, man.
- Just stop.

885
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,018
This thing has blown up to a whole
other level, all right?

886
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,770
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

887
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,814
- Do you see this?
- What?

888
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,569
They can track us? Like,
satellite track us?

889
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,612
Okay, I'm not
even with you guys!

890
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,030
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

891
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,408
- Enough is...
- Yo, Leo!

892
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,868
This thing's gonna give me
a heart attack, I swear.

893
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,328
- That's 'cause you is a wuss.
- You guys forced me into that car, right?

894
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:10,413
I think he's scared.

895
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,000
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna
do with this shrimp taco?

896
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,417
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

897
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,043
and then nobody gonna know
nothing, know what I mean?

898
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:19,046
- Not in my trunk.
- Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you.

899
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,341
Okay? I'm right here
and I can hear you!

900
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,594
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

901
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,220
I've had a hell of a day!

902
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,724
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

903
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:29,932
Go whine to your boyfriend!

904
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,226
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do, man.
Look, I'm just going to go

905
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,353
to the authorities
and tell them the truth.

906
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,438
Like, I had nothing
to do with this.

907
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,064
- So, I'm not an accomplice.
- Hey, you wanted this, right?

908
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,481
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

909
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,900
Wake up! You're
in the middle of it!

910
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,319
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

911
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,947
Stop complaining.

912
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,693
What is the meaning of this?

913
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,945
You dare point a gun at me?

914
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:27,783
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

915
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:32,162
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

916
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,704
- Tell them to lower their weapons!
- Tell them first.

917
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:34,831
Tell them to lower
their weapons.

918
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,917
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him.

919
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,877
Your NEST team
is deactivated, Major.

920
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,880
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

921
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,298
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

922
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,783
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

923
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,636
Well, I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

924
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,222
and I will raise you a President
of the United States.

925
01:11:51,306 --> 01:11:52,765
I have operational command now.

926
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,060
An alien blood feud has
been brought to our shores

927
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,863
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

928
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:58,896
The secret is out!

929
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,442
This is our war now and we will win
it as we always have,

930
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,444
with a coordinated
military strategy.

931
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,488
This fool is terribly
misinformed.

932
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,948
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

933
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,742
What we need is to draw
up battle plans

934
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,994
while we explore every possible
diplomatic solution.

935
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,578
Like what, handing over the kid?

936
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,748
All options are being
considered.

937
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:22,295
Whatever the Decepticons
are after, this is just the start.

938
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,465
- There is no negotiating with them.
- I'm ordering you to stand down.

939
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,636
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

940
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,930
And take that pile of scrap
metal back to Diego Garcia.

941
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,475
Let's go!

942
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:40,646
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

943
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,233
Autobots, report
to hangar for transport.

944
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:48,654
- Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
- That's not what Optimus would want.

945
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,842
There's nothing that you
could have done.

946
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,557
- You okay?
- Yeah.

947
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,564
Bee, if you hate
me, I understand.

948
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,533
I messed up. I'm sorry.

949
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,456
Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.

950
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:42,626
If there's anything you
need, I won't be far away.

951
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,590
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

952
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,760
There's some things you
just can't change.

953
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:56,014
So, his sacrifice for us would not
have been in vain. Hallelujah!

954
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,600
I'm gonna make it right. I'm
going to turn myself in.

955
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,853
We... We've got
to stick together.

956
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,194
- You're not going to do that.
- Yes, I am.

957
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,036
Everything we worked for will be
wiped out in one day!

958
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,832
- You two...
- Huh?

959
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,042
Hey, you know the glyphs?

960
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,586
These? The symbols that have
been rattling around in my head?

961
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,382
That's old school, yo. That's, like...
That's Cybertronian.

962
01:14:31,507 --> 01:14:33,069
That's some serious
stuff, right there.

963
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,137
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

964
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:37,639
Like a map to an Energon source!

965
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:40,975
- Can you read this?
- Read?

966
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,353
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

967
01:14:43,436 --> 01:14:45,516
If you can't read it, we gotta
find somebody who can.

968
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,189
Look who came sashaying back!

969
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,914
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

970
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,777
I had a bit of a mild panic
attack earlier, right?

971
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:52,021
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

972
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,470
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through.

973
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,657
I heard you have a problem.

974
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,743
- I think I know someone who can help.
- Who?

975
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,994
Robo-Warrior.

976
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,791
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

977
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,252
everything about anything
alien, he's supposed to know.

978
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,778
One time we revenge-hacked
his site

979
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:13,216
and maybe I saw some of your alien
drawings or whatever.

980
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,605
This is it. Yep.

981
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,856
Deli. Good front!

982
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,775
All right, wait here. I'll give
you the go/no go. All right?

983
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,945
Number 42, we got
your kishka, knish,

984
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,158
kasha-varnishka and kreplach
combo right here.

985
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,576
Cash only. Who's next?

986
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:42,953
I told you to cure the lox
in the brine and then smoke it.

987
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,622
Ma, you want me to cut
my hand off, or what?

988
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,207
You... You ruined a beautiful
piece of fish, you retard!

989
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,626
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form.

990
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,918
Give me your money.
Get out of here!

991
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:52,922
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

992
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:54,925
Robo-Warrior.

993
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,802
- Know him?
- I never heard of him.

994
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,222
You never heard
of TheRealEffingDeal.com?

995
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,850
You must be talking
about that amateur-hour blog operation

996
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,061
- with Game Boy-level security.
- Robo-Warrior.

997
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,024
It's him! It's him! That's the guy
right there! That's him!

998
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:13,525
No.

999
01:16:14,064 --> 01:16:16,463
- You got to be kidding me.
- All right, meat store's closed!

1000
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,864
- Everybody out! Out, right now!
- When he says to go,

1001
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:20,592
- you go.
- That means you, lady, right now.

1002
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,819
- Wait a minute. You know this guy?
- We're old friends.

1003
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,288
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

1004
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,707
got the kibosh, disbanded.

1005
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,043
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1006
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:34,088
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1007
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:38,467
- Look at her now, so mature.
- Moron! Where's the whitefish?

1008
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,427
Hey! Don't touch
me with the pig.

1009
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,096
- Yakov!
- What?

1010
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,224
You don't get Christmas
bonuses standing around!

1011
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:46,100
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1012
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,395
- It's my dream.
- Help her out.

1013
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,063
You live with your mama?

1014
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:51,480
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1015
01:16:51,564 --> 01:16:53,444
They got your face
all over the news, alien boy.

1016
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,902
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1017
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,154
How did that happen?
Don't answer.

1018
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,614
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1019
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:03,451
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1020
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,996
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, I need your help.

1021
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,664
Really? You need my help?

1022
01:17:08,748 --> 01:17:11,376
I need... Look, I am
slowly losing my mind.

1023
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,086
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1024
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,331
plunged a device deep
into the soft tissues of my brain

1025
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,216
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1026
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,051
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1027
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,305
You said it projected
images off your brain?

1028
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,974
- Right.
- Meat locker, now!

1029
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,975
Dead pigs.

1030
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,228
What you're about to see
is top secret.

1031
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,023
Do not tell my mother.

1032
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,150
- Swine flu. Not good.
- Now you know.

1033
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:39,194
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1034
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:40,572
Sad little story.

1035
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:41,823
An entire city flat. How
do you explain that?

1036
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,990
Are you saying you
believe in aliens now?

1037
01:17:43,074 --> 01:17:46,243
Okay, files, files. We're
talking about symbols.

1038
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,538
Hey, still radioactive.
Hands off.

1039
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,250
Okay, Cube-brain.

1040
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,086
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1041
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,503
Where'd you get these?

1042
01:17:56,588 --> 01:18:00,257
Before I got fired, I poached
S-7's crown jewel,

1043
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:05,721
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1044
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:09,768
The Transformers, they've been here
a long, long time.

1045
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,269
How do I know?

1046
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,271
Archeologists found these
unexplained markings

1047
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,608
in ancient ruins
all over the world.

1048
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,109
China. Egypt. Greece.

1049
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,654
Shot in 1932.

1050
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:23,573
These the symbols you're
seeing in your head?

1051
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,242
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1052
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:31,122
So, tell me, how did they end
up all drawing the same things?

1053
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:35,126
Aliens. And I think
some of them stayed.

1054
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,128
Check this out.
Project Black Knife.

1055
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:43,092
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1056
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,470
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1057
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,057
I pleaded on my knees
with S-7 to investigate it,

1058
01:18:50,141 --> 01:18:53,685
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1059
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,230
that I was obsessed.

1060
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,065
Me. Can you imagine that?

1061
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:01,277
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1062
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,238
- On Earth. Another source?
- On Earth.

1063
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,198
Okay? And that these symbols, maps
in my head, would lead him there.

1064
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,033
You talk to your Autobot
friends about this?

1065
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,411
No, no, no, the source
is before them.

1066
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:11,328
Whatever the Energon source
is, it predates them.

1067
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,497
It's before them.

1068
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,582
- So, it comes before them.
- Correct.

1069
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,043
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1070
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,212
I mean, I'm not on speaking
terms with them.

1071
01:19:20,296 --> 01:19:22,006
Actually, I am.

1072
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,054
Let me out!

1073
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,390
- This is going to be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1074
01:19:32,016 --> 01:19:34,226
I will have so
many Decepticons on your butt!

1075
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,770
Hey, behave!

1076
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,689
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1077
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,565
- And you're training him?
- I'm trying to.

1078
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,153
I spent my whole adult life
combing the planet for aliens,

1079
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,573
and you're carrying around one in your purse
like a little Chihuahua.

1080
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,617
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1081
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,871
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry
about your eye, you know,

1082
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:56,082
but, if you're a good boy, then I'm
not gonna torch your other eye.

1083
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,583
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1084
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:01,045
Just tell me what these
symbols are, please.

1085
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,256
All right.

1086
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:07,594
I know that. That's the language
of the Primes.

1087
01:20:08,511 --> 01:20:11,180
I don't read it,
but these guys...

1088
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,765
Where the frick did you
find photos of these guys?

1089
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:17,645
- Is this they?
- Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1090
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,315
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.

1091
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:24,903
Nobody tells me nothing,
but they'll translate those symbols for you.

1092
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,322
- And I know where to find them.
- Show us.

1093
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:28,739
Yeah.

1094
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,412
The closest one's in Washington.

1095
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:41,752
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

1096
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,506
All I ever wanted to be
was an astronaut.

1097
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,551
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1098
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,554
What? I wear them
when I'm in a funk.

1099
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:56,141
So does Giambi, Jeter.
It's a baseball thing. Okay.

1100
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,226
Watches synchronized, sharp
mind and empty bladder.

1101
01:20:58,686 --> 01:21:01,689
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1102
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,524
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1103
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,929
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1104
01:21:05,985 --> 01:21:07,694
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1105
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,530
Okay. Now, let's get
this show on the road.

1106
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,074
No, listen, I can't do this.

1107
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:14,077
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.

1108
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,703
- Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid.

1109
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:19,707
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1110
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,377
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1111
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,712
The museum is now closing.

1112
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:27,715
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

1113
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,091
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1114
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:32,177
Sir! I suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

1115
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,680
Listen, man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1116
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,725
All right? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. All right.

1117
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:39,685
Sir, you are a grown, naked
man around children.

1118
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,689
- Pull your pants up and exit the building.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1119
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,070
- You got that paper, right, sir?
- You should be embarrassed.

1120
01:21:50,154 --> 01:21:52,282
This is a family museum, sir.

1121
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,759
What is going on here?

1122
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,346
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1123
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,640
You are an amateur,
man, a rank amateur.

1124
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,730
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1125
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:26,481
- Get your stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second here.

1126
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,275
I got to get
the tracker, all right.

1127
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:30,778
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1128
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,006
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

1129
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:57,889
- He knows something.
- What?

1130
01:22:57,972 --> 01:22:59,015
He knows something.

1131
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:06,021
You got what I got?

1132
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,731
- Yeah.
- Blackbird.

1133
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,319
There he is.

1134
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:16,032
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

1135
01:23:16,115 --> 01:23:20,328
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

1136
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,462
Shit. It's a Decepticon!

1137
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,922
- Decepticon?
- Decepticon?

1138
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,050
Behind the MiG now!

1139
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:49,356
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1140
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,694
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1141
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,113
Show yourselves or suffer
my infinite wrath!

1142
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:00,283
You little spinal-cord-based
organisms!

1143
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,662
Bugger it!

1144
01:24:03,162 --> 01:24:07,667
Behold the eternal
glory of Jetfire!

1145
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:10,127
Prepare for remote
systems override!

1146
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,755
- I tell you, this guy did not age well.
- I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

1147
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,132
I command these doors to open.

1148
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:19,177
Fire! I said, fire!

1149
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,389
Bollocks!

1150
01:24:21,472 --> 01:24:25,059
- Damn these worthless parts.
- Wait a second!

1151
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:28,479
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1152
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,734
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1153
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,484
We gotta catch that plane.

1154
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:41,826
- Right. I'm on a mission.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1155
01:24:41,884 --> 01:24:43,804
- What do you want?
- Look, we just want to talk!

1156
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:45,579
I have no time to talk.
I'm on a mission.

1157
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:48,916
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am I on?

1158
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,376
- Earth.
- Earth?

1159
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:55,506
Terrible name for a planet. Might
as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1160
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:59,010
Tell me, is that robot
civil war still going on?

1161
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,761
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1162
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:05,224
- Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
- What do you mean, "changed sides"?

1163
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,810
It's a choice. It's an intensely
personal decision.

1164
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:12,564
So much negativity. Who wants
to live a life filled with hate?

1165
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,649
You mean you don't have to work

1166
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,443
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1167
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:19,070
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1168
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:21,948
I'm changing sides. I'm changing
sides, too, warrior goddess.

1169
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,202
- Who's your little Autobot?
- You're cute.

1170
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,329
Name's Wheelie. Yeah. Say
my name, say my name.

1171
01:25:27,563 --> 01:25:29,682
What are you allowing to happen
to your foot just now?

1172
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:30,832
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1173
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,877
Yeah, well, he's faithful
and he's nude and he's perverted.

1174
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:36,523
Can you just... Can you stop?

1175
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:37,965
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's just something

1176
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,966
to think about. I won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1177
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:44,137
I told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1178
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,640
Somebody shit the bed
this morning.

1179
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,307
- Look at this guy.
- I have issues of my own.

1180
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:48,893
And it started with my mother!

1181
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:51,436
My ancestors have
been here for centuries.

1182
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,481
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1183
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:56,818
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1184
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:57,944
Nothing!

1185
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:01,697
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1186
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:09,538
Bollocks.

1187
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:12,082
My boosters are fried.

1188
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,326
I think we can help each other.

1189
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:18,256
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.

1190
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,757
I don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, I don't.

1191
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,904
I could do this all day. It comes
in waves, these vivid symbols.

1192
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,890
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1193
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,850
and Megatron wants
what's in my mind.

1194
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,145
- Him and someone called The Fallen.
- The Fallen? I know him.

1195
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:36,481
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1196
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:40,360
He's terrible to work for. It's always
apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1197
01:26:40,444 --> 01:26:42,488
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1198
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:43,573
The Fallen's search.

1199
01:26:43,614 --> 01:26:47,201
I remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1200
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,369
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1201
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:53,957
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

1202
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,903
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1203
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,707
I just hope we're still
on the right planet.

1204
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,698
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1205
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,326
Oh, my God.

1206
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,833
Oh, God.

1207
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:43,256
Oh, my God,
what a beautiful face.

1208
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:47,302
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1209
01:27:47,386 --> 01:27:49,012
Please, get off.

1210
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,390
God, my balls.

1211
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:54,851
Sam!

1212
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:59,064
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1213
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:04,110
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is this?
It's Vegas.

1214
01:28:04,195 --> 01:28:06,029
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1215
01:28:06,113 --> 01:28:08,615
Hey, I think we're in Vegas!

1216
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:12,286
That really, really hurt. You're
just lucky that I didn't get hurt!

1217
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:15,038
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1218
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:17,082
- you would have heard...
- Shut up.

1219
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,462
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1220
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,381
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1221
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,216
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1222
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,887
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

1223
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,640
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1224
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:33,890
Can you tell us why
we're in Egypt

1225
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,644
so we can all have a little bit
of semblance of peace of mind?

1226
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,146
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1227
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,984
by our earliest
ancestors, millennia ago.

1228
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,987
They were on an exploratory
mission to harvest Energon,

1229
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:48,655
the lifeblood of our race.

1230
01:28:48,739 --> 01:28:53,577
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1231
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,581
Do you have any idea
what it's like to slowly fall apart and die?

1232
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,583
Let's not get episodic,
okay, old-timer?

1233
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:06,590
Beginning, middle, end. Facts. Details.
Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1234
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:11,511
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1235
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:15,807
It harvests Energon
by destroying suns.

1236
01:29:15,891 --> 01:29:17,600
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1237
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:19,561
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1238
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:22,773
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1239
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,944
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1240
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:33,033
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1241
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,037
until one of them tried
to defy this rule.

1242
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,373
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

1243
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,502
He despised the human race

1244
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:49,884
and he wanted to kill you
all by turning on that machine.

1245
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:54,012
The only way to activate
it is with a legendary key

1246
01:29:54,096 --> 01:29:57,182
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1247
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:07,859
A great battle took place
over possession of the Matrix.

1248
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,158
The Fallen was stronger
than his brothers,

1249
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,997
so they had no choice but to steal
and hide it from him.

1250
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:26,462
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1251
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,715
in a tomb made
of their very own bodies,

1252
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:33,344
a tomb we cannot find.

1253
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:40,475
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1254
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,603
The Fallen knows where it is

1255
01:30:42,686 --> 01:30:48,317
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1256
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,319
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1257
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,779
Only a Prime can
defeat The Fallen.

1258
01:30:52,863 --> 01:30:54,448
Optimus Prime?

1259
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,993
So, you've met a Prime?

1260
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:02,163
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1261
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:05,376
Is he alive, here
on this planet?

1262
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,378
He sacrificed
himself to save me.

1263
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,296
So, he's dead.

1264
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:14,467
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1265
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:18,555
So, the same energy that's gonna
be used to reactivate the machine,

1266
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,266
could that energy somehow be
used to reactivate Optimus

1267
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,431
and bring him back to life?

1268
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:27,189
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1269
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:31,152
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1270
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:34,445
Follow your mind,
your map, your symbols.

1271
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,158
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1272
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:42,453
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1273
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:44,497
Find the doorway!

1274
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:46,457
Go now! Go!

1275
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:49,461
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1276
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:53,841
Go before the Decepticons
find me and find you.

1277
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,681
Okay, here's what my CIA
contact says.

1278
01:32:01,765 --> 01:32:05,310
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf ofAqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1279
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,270
- That's the Dagger's Tip.
- It's part of the Red Sea.

1280
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:09,523
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1281
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:13,444
29.5 degrees north, 35 east.
Here it is.

1282
01:32:13,944 --> 01:32:15,904
First thing we've got to do is get
Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1283
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:18,448
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1284
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,699
I'm gonna make a call.

1285
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:23,912
We got cops!

1286
01:32:30,252 --> 01:32:31,333
I can't go to prison, guys.

1287
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,801
Sam, we got to get
off this road and lay low.

1288
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:50,230
Man, stupid cops!

1289
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:52,524
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1290
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:56,403
- Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
- They're gone.

1291
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,128
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...

1292
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:00,532
You're on the Worldwide
Wanted List.

1293
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,243
Try calling one base, they'll track
you here in seconds.

1294
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,954
- CIA is all over this place!
- You're gonna call.

1295
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:14,087
- Okay. That's a good idea.
- All right.

1296
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,590
I mean, I just had
my mind on other things,

1297
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,194
like winding
up in an Egyptian prison.

1298
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,180
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1299
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:28,310
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1300
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,900
Major Lennox, phone call.

1301
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,779
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1302
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:41,448
We need the truck. The truck.

1303
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,284
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1304
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:48,622
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

1305
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,248
Back of a $1 bill.

1306
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:57,006
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

1307
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,800
Oh, my God. I got to go.
Okay. Heat comes.

1308
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,426
Wait, who are you?

1309
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,139
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me.
Leo. Leo. Leo.

1310
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:06,306
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1311
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,182
Move, move, move, move.

1312
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,063
Coordinates, 29.5
north, 34.88 east.

1313
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,606
Tip of the Red Sea.
Gulf ofAqaba.

1314
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,234
Egypt? Are you serious?

1315
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:20,945
Sir.

1316
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:28,078
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1317
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,831
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1318
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:34,251
Look, I don't know,
but we got to trust him.

1319
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:37,921
Okay, let's go over it again.

1320
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,173
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1321
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,551
- the Three Kings...
- Will reveal the doorway.

1322
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,427
That's what he said. You
know what it means?

1323
01:34:44,474 --> 01:34:46,113
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1324
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,979
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Checkpoint.
Checkpoint.

1325
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,432
I don't have my passport.

1326
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:53,186
Passport!

1327
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:02,112
They got cameras at the top.

1328
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:09,536
All right, chill. This is espionage time.
I can handle it.

1329
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:12,663
These are my people. I'm
one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1330
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:17,086
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1331
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,630
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1332
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:31,307
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1333
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,894
Egypt, Jordan. We
want to go there.

1334
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:37,230
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

1335
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:40,943
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1336
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,903
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1337
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,029
Fifty kilometers.

1338
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:46,875
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1339
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,908
- I know. I know you from somewhere.
- Go, Yankees!

1340
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:50,569
Put it on the wire to the CIA.

1341
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:59,670
Decepticons,
boy's location detected.

1342
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,597
Undercover, yo. You got to blend
in with your surroundings.

1343
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:14,016
You know, you got to be
part of the landscape.

1344
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:25,194
Awesome! I think
aliens built that.

1345
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:26,572
Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,365
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1347
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:31,577
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1348
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,746
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

1349
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:59,438
Being my girlfriend
is hazardous to your health.

1350
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:04,400
Yeah, well, girls
like dangerous boys.

1351
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,403
- Do they?
- Yeah.

1352
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:11,408
You might as well just say it.

1353
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,951
Ladies first.

1354
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:17,122
Okay, so tonight you're
going to be a gentleman.

1355
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:20,333
- You're really chivalrous.
- Why are you mad at me?

1356
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:23,921
You know what? Baby, I'm not...
I'm not mad.

1357
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:29,510
Do you realize that I just flew 3,000
Miles to keep you from getting killed?

1358
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,801
I know.

1359
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:36,807
Who else could be
your girlfriend, Sam?

1360
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,603
Look at the things
I go through with you.

1361
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,396
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1362
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,690
and the three most beautiful
pyramids on the planet

1363
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:47,109
and you still can't even tell
me that you love me.

1364
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,570
Pyramids.

1365
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,198
What? Why do boys always

1366
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,243
- change the subject?
- Pyramids and stars.

1367
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,786
- Sam?
- Come with me really quick.

1368
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,046
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1369
01:38:09,341 --> 01:38:11,635
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1370
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,387
No. I was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1371
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:16,640
- Here. Get up. Up, up.
- What is he talking about?

1372
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:23,122
Okay, you see those three stars?

1373
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:24,907
You see how the last
one touches the horizon?

1374
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,734
That's Orion's belt, but it's also
called the Three Kings.

1375
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,610
And the reason
for that is the three Egyptian kings

1376
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:32,488
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1377
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:34,408
so it's like an arrow staring
us straight in the face.

1378
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,953
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

1379
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,259
We've had an engine malfunction.

1380
01:38:52,342 --> 01:38:54,302
We're gonna have
to divert to SOCCENT.

1381
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:56,470
Flight master, let's lighten
the load and prepare for bailout.

1382
01:38:56,555 --> 01:38:59,015
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?
Bailout?

1383
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,019
- All right, team, grab your chutes!
- Bailout like bailout?

1384
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:07,064
- You familiar with the standard MC-4?
- Of course not!

1385
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:09,443
I've neverjumped out of a perfectly
good airplane before!

1386
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:10,902
Wait a minute, is this
really happening?

1387
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,779
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.

1388
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:17,451
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1389
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:19,161
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1390
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:23,122
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

1391
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:26,376
I'm just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?

1392
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:30,087
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1393
01:39:34,217 --> 01:39:36,302
What was that? What was that?

1394
01:39:36,386 --> 01:39:38,721
That's not good. Come on.

1395
01:39:39,243 --> 01:39:41,283
- Right this way!
- I can't jump out of an airplane!

1396
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,351
- I have an ulcer! No, no.
- Come on. It's okay.

1397
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,979
I really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1398
01:39:46,521 --> 01:39:48,564
Come here! Come here.

1399
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:52,903
- Why aren't you wearing your chute?
- Because I have to secure the VIPs first.

1400
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:57,198
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.

1401
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,243
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1402
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:02,453
Right next to that's a fabric
webbing called a bridle,

1403
01:40:02,537 --> 01:40:04,664
which holds the pin that keeps
the main container closed.

1404
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,832
- Okay, are you listening?
- I can't hear what...

1405
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:08,335
- Stop that!
- All right. All right.

1406
01:40:08,418 --> 01:40:10,878
All right, when the pilot
chute inflates into the air,

1407
01:40:10,962 --> 01:40:13,131
it pulls the pin
and opens the main.

1408
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,257
Red's your backup,
blue's your primary.

1409
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:19,512
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard!

1410
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:22,431
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1411
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:28,313
- He say good-bye?
- No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1412
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,564
General, we're loaded and ready.

1413
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:33,527
You give us the go, and we'll be
ready to press in five minutes.

1414
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:36,154
- Excellent.
- Sir, you need to see this now.

1415
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,158
- Have we checked these coordinates?
- Egypt, sir.

1416
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:44,037
- They're airdropping in.
- You've got to be kidding me.

1417
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:45,497
He knows something.

1418
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,957
We need to be ready to back him
up if this thing goes hot.

1419
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,377
Copy that.

1420
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,921
CIA just got a hit on the boy,

1421
01:40:53,463 --> 01:40:55,625
100 Miles from the location
on that little note there.

1422
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:56,716
It's getting hotter.

1423
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,806
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1424
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,037
You see the size of this?

1425
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:30,167
- You see this?
- Spectacular.

1426
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,296
Amazing. Look at that.

1427
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,850
- It's here somewhere, guys.
- Yeah, why?

1428
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,494
'Cause we're trusting
Grandpa Blackbird

1429
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,060
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1430
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:54,149
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.

1431
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,444
Okay. Well, that's great. Let me
do a quick search, all right?

1432
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,113
Nope. Ever cross
your mind, guys,

1433
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:01,614
that archeologists
have been here before?

1434
01:42:01,698 --> 01:42:02,783
There's nothing here.

1435
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:05,243
Real life is heartbreak,
despair, kid.

1436
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,453
Sometimes you get
to the end of the rainbow

1437
01:42:07,537 --> 01:42:09,706
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1438
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,167
I'm listening to you? You
live with your mother!

1439
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,462
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1440
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:17,046
Why are we still listening
to you, little punk-ass?

1441
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,211
I mean, what you ever done
for us except ding my rim?

1442
01:42:19,257 --> 01:42:21,217
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1443
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:22,344
Well, he didn't
get the job done,

1444
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:23,970
you know what I mean,
'cause he's back now...

1445
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:26,972
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1446
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:29,475
I'm ugly? Well, we're
twins, you stupid genius!

1447
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,310
Bring it, then! Get off me!

1448
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:34,480
- I'll change your face around!
- I'll get all up in that ass!

1449
01:42:34,564 --> 01:42:35,981
Bring it!

1450
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:37,900
Guys!

1451
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,880
- You like the way that feels?
- That didn't hurt.

1452
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:42,447
You like that, don't you?

1453
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:44,908
- Come on, Bumblebee!
- Bumblebee, listen.

1454
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,582
Now, that's rude.

1455
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:06,512
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1456
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,599
Bee! Shoot it.

1457
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:38,127
- Check this out.
- Look at it.

1458
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,380
Wow!

1459
01:43:40,463 --> 01:43:42,966
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1460
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,426
The tomb of the Primes.

1461
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:49,639
Yo!

1462
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:04,988
The Matrix.

1463
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:26,134
No.

1464
01:44:28,511 --> 01:44:31,055
Thousands of years,
turned to dust.

1465
01:44:31,681 --> 01:44:33,641
This isn't
how it's supposed to end.

1466
01:44:33,725 --> 01:44:34,893
Hear that?

1467
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,815
US Air Force! C-17s!

1468
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,610
- What's a C-17?
- You can't bring him back, Sam.

1469
01:44:44,694 --> 01:44:48,280
- There's nothing left.
- Look! Look around you.

1470
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:50,951
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1471
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,452
to just have it end like this.

1472
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,203
There is a reason
that we are here.

1473
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:58,166
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1474
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:06,341
Everyone's after me
because of what I know,

1475
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,845
and what I know is that this
is going to work.

1476
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:15,350
- How do you know it's gonna work?
- Because I believe it.

1477
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,737
You best let me
out of this plane.

1478
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:41,376
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

1479
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:50,819
You think you can bring him back
to life with that pixie dust?

1480
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:52,429
Absolutely. Let's go.

1481
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:03,731
Go!

1482
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,277
Let's move it. Remember,
they're friendlies.

1483
01:46:17,912 --> 01:46:19,456
Cover Optimus!

1484
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:24,502
Secure the village. Get
those cases down here.

1485
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:26,712
I need snipers
and Stingers up high.

1486
01:46:26,796 --> 01:46:30,925
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of dead
robot in the middle of nowhere.

1487
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,635
I hope this little kid
know what he's doing.

1488
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,761
Yeah, me too.

1489
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:42,936
Got a visual! Yellow team!
Four clicks!

1490
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,567
Pop flare!

1491
01:46:49,819 --> 01:46:52,581
- That's them, right there. See the flare?
- Right over there! See it?

1492
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:04,667
Sam!

1493
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,555
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

1494
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,320
Leo, stop freaking out.
Stop freaking out.

1495
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:21,768
Shut this guy up, huh?

1496
01:47:21,851 --> 01:47:24,270
- Please, just let me live, just let me live!
- Shut up and let him drive!

1497
01:47:24,354 --> 01:47:26,234
- Just stop screaming...
- All right, that's it!

1498
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:29,818
I can't take that guy anymore.

1499
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,166
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1500
01:47:52,757 --> 01:47:54,757
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1501
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:57,470
You lead the Decepticons away, all right?
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1502
01:47:57,555 --> 01:48:00,097
I'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1503
01:48:00,181 --> 01:48:02,225
You get to those soldiers.

1504
01:48:03,351 --> 01:48:06,395
- I hope that dust works, kid.
- Thank you.

1505
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,653
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1506
01:48:14,404 --> 01:48:15,445
It's up to me.

1507
01:48:15,738 --> 01:48:18,408
One man, alone, betrayed
by the country he loves,

1508
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,993
now it's last hope
in their final hour of need.

1509
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:24,747
Prepare to be driven like never
before, by the maestro.

1510
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,833
- Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
- You'll never make it, kid.

1511
01:48:27,917 --> 01:48:30,377
- I'm coming with you.
- Bravery will only get you so far.

1512
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:33,381
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
I'm going.

1513
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:35,465
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

1514
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:46,978
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1515
01:48:51,065 --> 01:48:53,234
- What the hell was that?
- Anyone copy?

1516
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,360
- Anyone there? Who's up?
- Copy?

1517
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:57,738
- Radio's down.
- It's dead. Comms are down.

1518
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,157
EMP burst.

1519
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:02,409
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1520
01:49:04,162 --> 01:49:05,204
Yes, sir?

1521
01:49:05,288 --> 01:49:08,123
- Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
- I know, sir.

1522
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:11,043
Well, what country
am I in right now?

1523
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:12,377
United States.

1524
01:49:12,462 --> 01:49:16,381
No, not the United States.
I'm from the United States.

1525
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:19,135
I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

1526
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:24,056
Well, that was our good friend, Galloway.
He's less than pleased.

1527
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,809
How is it that we can't
reach our men,

1528
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:32,273
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1529
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:37,528
Nothing.

1530
01:49:38,113 --> 01:49:40,989
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye
in the sky know we need some help.

1531
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:43,076
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, boys, old school time!

1532
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:45,994
Pop some more flares so
the kid can find us.

1533
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:55,046
Look. There it is. We
got a couple of Miles.

1534
01:49:55,713 --> 01:50:00,551
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1535
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:06,015
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1536
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,768
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1537
01:50:08,851 --> 01:50:11,229
Our satellites in the area have gone blind.
We're working it, sir.

1538
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:14,940
Damn it. Something's not right.
It doesn't add up.

1539
01:50:15,024 --> 01:50:18,444
Contact the Jordanians, see what air
assets they've got in the area,

1540
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,904
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1541
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:24,867
Ask him to clear some USV
overflights in Egyptian airspace.

1542
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:28,037
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1543
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:29,872
Scramble Predators now.

1544
01:50:30,039 --> 01:50:31,457
V-1, rotate.

1545
01:50:43,511 --> 01:50:45,345
We still have a mile that way.

1546
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,395
Come on.

1547
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:57,065
This way. This way.

1548
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:05,033
- One man, alone...
- Stop saying that!

1549
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:06,438
Betrayed by the country
he loves!

1550
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:08,661
Oh, my goodness. I'm in the car, okay?
You're not alone.

1551
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,831
Just relax. You're
with the maestro.

1552
01:51:20,506 --> 01:51:22,550
I don't think he's still
following us.

1553
01:51:23,551 --> 01:51:25,219
That's what you think.

1554
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:45,823
Master, sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

1555
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:48,951
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1556
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:51,244
The boy must have the Matrix.

1557
01:51:51,662 --> 01:51:54,289
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1558
01:51:54,957 --> 01:51:58,627
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1559
01:51:59,337 --> 01:52:00,962
We've got incoming!

1560
01:52:17,105 --> 01:52:20,024
We got a whole lot
of fight coming our way.

1561
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:22,109
- How many?
- About 13 of them.

1562
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,862
This ain't good.
This ain't good.

1563
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:35,288
We're about to get
our asses whupped.

1564
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,208
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

1565
01:52:38,292 --> 01:52:41,170
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1566
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:45,466
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1567
01:52:45,551 --> 01:52:48,427
so our mission is to find
him and get him to Optimus.

1568
01:52:48,511 --> 01:52:51,305
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. I need a scout team.

1569
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,431
I'm leading.

1570
01:52:52,515 --> 01:52:54,934
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and lronhide!

1571
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,560
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1572
01:52:56,645 --> 01:52:59,396
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back through those pillars.

1573
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,692
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1574
01:53:14,787 --> 01:53:17,081
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1575
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:21,752
- With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
- No, why?

1576
01:53:25,006 --> 01:53:27,841
- Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
- Is that good?

1577
01:53:30,052 --> 01:53:31,595
A lot of people died.

1578
01:53:50,573 --> 01:53:51,740
Hide!

1579
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:55,243
- Vamonos, amigos!
- Oh, my God!

1580
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,167
- Hit the deck!
- Oh, my God!

1581
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:18,266
Sam, Sam.

1582
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,395
I don't think they saw us.

1583
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,773
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1584
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:25,733
Okay. Listen.

1585
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:30,947
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

1586
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:33,783
What if it doesn't work?

1587
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,202
It's gonna work.

1588
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,287
- What if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work. It'll work.

1589
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,177
Up, up, up!

1590
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:28,814
Get ready to jump!

1591
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:50,336
We got a half-mile. I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1592
01:56:53,047 --> 01:56:54,381
Fall back!

1593
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:57,926
- Ironhide, up the middle!
- Lronhide, move it!

1594
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,011
Let's go! Go, go!

1595
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:08,561
Devastator!

1596
01:57:11,966 --> 01:57:14,086
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1597
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,737
If we're going out, we're going
out like men, understand?

1598
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,729
Look at this mother...

1599
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:52,480
Mean robots suck!

1600
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:07,037
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

1601
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:13,461
- Simmons!
- Don't let go!

1602
01:58:13,545 --> 01:58:16,005
Hang in there, I got you!
Just hang in.

1603
01:58:20,135 --> 01:58:21,635
I don't want to die!

1604
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:25,180
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

1605
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:26,515
You ain't getting me!

1606
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,855
He dead. He got so ate.

1607
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:37,109
- Who's your daddy now, huh?
- He got all ate up.

1608
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,319
The only safe place
is right under it.

1609
01:58:39,404 --> 01:58:43,073
- Run at it. Run for it's feet! Move it!
- Yeah.

1610
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,292
You should've never eaten me!
I'm gonna bust your face up!

1611
01:58:58,297 --> 01:58:59,465
Oh, my God!

1612
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:04,720
Nobody mess with me!
In your face!

1613
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:07,305
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

1614
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,474
Oh, my God!

1615
01:59:16,233 --> 01:59:18,192
Nobody messes with the twins.

1616
01:59:22,072 --> 01:59:24,239
I got you... My bad!

1617
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:29,078
Man! You shot me in the face!

1618
01:59:29,496 --> 01:59:31,788
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it!

1619
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,086
Come on.

1620
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,478
Judy!

1621
01:59:59,568 --> 02:00:01,652
- Sam! Sam!
- What?

1622
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,613
Sam! Sam!

1623
02:00:09,077 --> 02:00:10,327
Sam!

1624
02:00:10,412 --> 02:00:11,744
- Sam!
- Dad!

1625
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:20,880
Wait, wait!

1626
02:00:22,131 --> 02:00:25,634
Please listen to me!
I want you to run! Run!

1627
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:28,429
Dad, just stop! They don't
want you, they want me!

1628
02:00:28,512 --> 02:00:29,971
- Oh, God!
- Wait!

1629
02:00:30,055 --> 02:00:31,931
Sam Witwicky.

1630
02:00:32,016 --> 02:00:36,311
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

1631
02:00:36,395 --> 02:00:38,063
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop!

1632
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:39,387
- Stop!
- Listen to your father!

1633
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:41,190
Just get out of here!

1634
02:00:41,525 --> 02:00:43,903
Just don't hurt them.
I know what you want.

1635
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:45,487
Just go! Just go!

1636
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:49,365
And I know that you need me
because I know about the Matrix.

1637
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:51,534
- Don't do it, Sam...
- Please, Dad.

1638
02:00:51,619 --> 02:00:55,581
- They're going to kill us all anyway!
- Here's what you want, right here.

1639
02:00:55,957 --> 02:00:57,373
Bumblebee!

1640
02:01:10,596 --> 02:01:12,221
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1641
02:01:50,177 --> 02:01:52,720
- Stay tight, Ma.
- Come on. Get in here.

1642
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,404
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1643
02:02:11,949 --> 02:02:13,033
- Hey!
- I don't know

1644
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:15,077
what's going on,
but we've got to move!

1645
02:02:19,248 --> 02:02:21,082
There's got to be
a way out of here!

1646
02:02:22,418 --> 02:02:24,502
Judy, get back, get
back, get back.

1647
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:28,716
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

1648
02:02:30,092 --> 02:02:32,094
Bee! Bumblebee!

1649
02:02:32,929 --> 02:02:34,930
You get them somewhere
safe, all right?

1650
02:02:36,652 --> 02:02:38,493
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1651
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:40,351
No, this isn't
up for discussion!

1652
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:42,354
- You're my son! You're my son!
- I know.

1653
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:43,689
- Dad...
- We all go together!

1654
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:45,064
- Listen...
- We're all going together!

1655
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:48,444
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

1656
02:02:48,528 --> 02:02:50,847
You know, you run. You don't
stop, you don't hide, you run.

1657
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:53,448
You hear what I'm saying, okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1658
02:02:53,533 --> 02:02:55,033
- No.
- You've got to let me go, Dad.

1659
02:02:55,118 --> 02:02:58,453
- You have to let me go. You have to.
- Ron.

1660
02:03:01,123 --> 02:03:03,583
Ron. Ron, let him go.

1661
02:03:05,627 --> 02:03:07,962
You come back! Come on.

1662
02:03:08,088 --> 02:03:09,840
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

1663
02:03:09,923 --> 02:03:12,467
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go without you.

1664
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:25,314
Move to cover!

1665
02:03:29,569 --> 02:03:31,319
We got Jordanians!

1666
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:32,863
We got help!

1667
02:03:38,994 --> 02:03:40,244
Down!

1668
02:03:56,805 --> 02:03:58,430
You okay, soldier?

1669
02:03:58,515 --> 02:04:01,682
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's get
these wounded clear of the bird.

1670
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:03,685
Stay still. Stay still.
Don't move.

1671
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:06,063
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1672
02:04:07,524 --> 02:04:11,984
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what I did for my country.

1673
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,154
This is my moment.

1674
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:16,989
You're crazy!

1675
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:20,953
ETA to station, two minutes.

1676
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,912
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir. Yes, sir.

1677
02:04:22,997 --> 02:04:24,372
Predator 01.

1678
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,092
Shit, it's a trick.

1679
02:04:36,176 --> 02:04:38,595
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1680
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:41,265
- Get those Marines on the ground.
- Roll in strike packages...

1681
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,225
Task Force Ripper,
execute Lightning.

1682
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:06,289
- Spotted Sam!
- Sam!

1683
02:05:06,748 --> 02:05:08,041
Lronhide!

1684
02:05:08,917 --> 02:05:11,086
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1685
02:05:13,922 --> 02:05:16,591
Get out, Sam! Get
to the pillars!

1686
02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:18,926
Let's go.

1687
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:26,143
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1688
02:05:26,226 --> 02:05:30,605
If they turn that machine
on, no more sun.

1689
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:37,487
Not on my watch.

1690
02:05:48,457 --> 02:05:50,000
USS Stennis. Identify.

1691
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:52,502
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

1692
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,462
SportsCenter? I Dream
of Jeannie orsomething?

1693
02:05:54,546 --> 02:05:58,550
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1694
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,135
Identify yourself.

1695
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:01,886
What is your name, sailor?

1696
02:06:02,471 --> 02:06:07,434
Wilder, Captain of the USS John C.
Stennis aircraft carrier.

1697
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:10,395
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1698
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:12,814
This is Agent Seymour
Simmons of Sector Seven.

1699
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:15,274
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

1700
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:17,152
getting ready
to blow up our sun.

1701
02:06:17,237 --> 02:06:19,070
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1702
02:06:19,154 --> 02:06:21,155
or do you want to help
save a gazillion lives?

1703
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:24,493
All right, Agent Simmons.
I'm listening.

1704
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:34,377
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1705
02:06:34,462 --> 02:06:37,421
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.

1706
02:06:37,506 --> 02:06:40,550
Our one hope is a prototype
weapon called a rail gun,

1707
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:43,679
- shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
- That's classified.

1708
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:47,349
Don't talk to me
about classified, all right?

1709
02:06:47,432 --> 02:06:50,101
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which I know you do,

1710
02:06:50,185 --> 02:06:52,729
you tell them
to ready that weapon!

1711
02:06:54,106 --> 02:06:56,315
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

1712
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:58,859
Alpha Team, flank left!

1713
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:00,695
This way! Move it!

1714
02:07:02,408 --> 02:07:04,967
- Where do you need us, sir?
- Protect those in the line of fire.

1715
02:07:04,993 --> 02:07:06,618
Let's go! Go!

1716
02:07:10,539 --> 02:07:13,041
Give me your Comms.
Come on. Epps!

1717
02:07:17,421 --> 02:07:19,797
Right now, we need
air support, ASAP!

1718
02:07:19,881 --> 02:07:22,466
Have troops in contact 20 Miles northwest.
Radar contact.

1719
02:07:22,551 --> 02:07:23,712
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

1720
02:07:27,765 --> 02:07:29,349
B-1, snap 090.

1721
02:07:29,434 --> 02:07:31,851
You are approved to drop
your 2,000-pound JDAMs.

1722
02:07:38,659 --> 02:07:40,461
- What you got?
- I couldn't get to them, sir.

1723
02:07:40,485 --> 02:07:42,529
They're 600 meters away and they're
heading right for the pillars.

1724
02:07:42,613 --> 02:07:45,489
All right. Precious
cargo's coming!

1725
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:46,824
Move!

1726
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:59,212
Curse you!

1727
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:15,270
Sam! Spotted Sam!

1728
02:08:47,552 --> 02:08:49,304
- Come on!
- 2-2 covering fire.

1729
02:08:49,389 --> 02:08:50,805
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!

1730
02:08:59,356 --> 02:09:00,940
Cover for us!

1731
02:09:07,323 --> 02:09:10,117
Hold the air strike! We're
rescuing civilians!

1732
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:24,005
Keep firing!

1733
02:09:30,011 --> 02:09:31,680
Come on! Mikaela!

1734
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:34,432
Come on! Get in here!

1735
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:36,810
Look who showed up.

1736
02:09:36,894 --> 02:09:38,895
You better have a good
reason for us to be here.

1737
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:40,689
- Where's Optimus?
- He's right over there,

1738
02:09:40,773 --> 02:09:42,189
across the courtyard.

1739
02:09:42,734 --> 02:09:45,293
- I got to get to him right now.
- Not with an air strike coming.

1740
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:47,529
I have to get to him right now.

1741
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:50,407
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1742
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:52,199
- Go.
- Listen up...

1743
02:09:55,662 --> 02:09:56,872
Okay.

1744
02:10:00,501 --> 02:10:01,877
Incoming!

1745
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:05,087
Stick the landing.

1746
02:10:06,006 --> 02:10:08,884
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

1747
02:10:10,177 --> 02:10:13,721
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1748
02:10:33,783 --> 02:10:35,076
I'm too old for this crap.

1749
02:10:35,243 --> 02:10:37,912
Keep going, man, 15
rounds of fighting.

1750
02:10:58,059 --> 02:11:01,560
I am directly
below the enemy's scrotum.

1751
02:11:02,313 --> 02:11:05,606
25.7 meters above sea
level, 29.32 north.

1752
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:07,900
- Kill track, 5205...
- Target acquired.

1753
02:11:07,984 --> 02:11:10,569
- Killing track.
- Two, one...

1754
02:11:10,654 --> 02:11:11,947
Fire!

1755
02:11:26,127 --> 02:11:27,796
Yeah! Yeah!

1756
02:11:28,171 --> 02:11:31,841
B-1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

1757
02:11:31,926 --> 02:11:34,051
We're gonna make a break
through the B's on my command, okay?

1758
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:37,055
You guys stick with me, you understand?
You stay on my ass.

1759
02:11:37,265 --> 02:11:40,516
- 1-1 tally orange smoke.
- I hope these F-16s got good aim.

1760
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:44,145
- Yeah? Why is that?
- I told them to hit the orange smoke.

1761
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:47,189
You mean that orange smoke?

1762
02:11:47,274 --> 02:11:48,858
It wasn't my best toss, okay?

1763
02:11:48,943 --> 02:11:51,694
- Viper, thunder.
- Run!

1764
02:12:00,704 --> 02:12:01,997
Incoming!

1765
02:12:05,083 --> 02:12:06,333
Come on!

1766
02:12:26,605 --> 02:12:27,771
Sam!

1767
02:12:35,614 --> 02:12:36,864
Run!

1768
02:12:39,784 --> 02:12:40,868
Die!

1769
02:12:47,917 --> 02:12:49,168
Sam!

1770
02:13:05,394 --> 02:13:06,895
Hold your fire!

1771
02:13:09,314 --> 02:13:10,481
Sam!

1772
02:13:12,109 --> 02:13:14,360
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

1773
02:13:16,404 --> 02:13:18,448
Fucking do something!

1774
02:13:53,859 --> 02:14:00,114
- Sam! Sam!
- Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

1775
02:14:01,908 --> 02:14:03,702
- Let me go!
- Come on, you got to move.

1776
02:14:03,786 --> 02:14:06,537
- You got to move, come on.
- We got no pulse.

1777
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:07,747
Starting CPR.

1778
02:14:07,832 --> 02:14:11,042
- I have to see my kid! I got a son...
- Sammy!

1779
02:14:11,793 --> 02:14:12,918
Sam!

1780
02:14:15,256 --> 02:14:16,797
- Clear.
- Ready to shock.

1781
02:14:16,881 --> 02:14:19,634
- Clear!
- Ready to shock. One, two, three.

1782
02:14:22,595 --> 02:14:24,012
Do it again!

1783
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:30,854
No!

1784
02:14:32,898 --> 02:14:37,985
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

1785
02:14:39,238 --> 02:14:42,782
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

1786
02:14:42,867 --> 02:14:44,451
I love you.

1787
02:14:53,836 --> 02:14:58,172
Where am I? Where am I?
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1788
02:14:58,673 --> 02:15:02,969
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

1789
02:15:05,346 --> 02:15:09,350
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

1790
02:15:09,435 --> 02:15:14,521
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

1791
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,025
a leader worthy of our secret.

1792
02:15:18,569 --> 02:15:23,198
The Matrix of Leadership
is not found, it is earned.

1793
02:15:24,449 --> 02:15:26,658
Return now to Optimus.

1794
02:15:27,368 --> 02:15:29,703
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

1795
02:15:30,247 --> 02:15:34,833
It is, and always has
been, your destiny.

1796
02:15:39,756 --> 02:15:40,881
Sam!

1797
02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:49,807
I love you. I love you.

1798
02:16:27,262 --> 02:16:30,597
Boy, you returned for me.

1799
02:16:31,934 --> 02:16:33,893
A living Prime.

1800
02:16:35,478 --> 02:16:37,689
I don't believe it!

1801
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:50,158
My Matrix!

1802
02:16:55,498 --> 02:16:57,416
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

1803
02:16:58,293 --> 02:16:59,835
Get up, Prime!

1804
02:17:01,754 --> 02:17:03,130
Oh, no.

1805
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:07,468
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

1806
02:17:07,969 --> 02:17:09,304
Optimus!

1807
02:17:11,514 --> 02:17:13,891
Fallen, my master.

1808
02:17:13,976 --> 02:17:18,438
My brothers could not
stop me from this.

1809
02:17:19,315 --> 02:17:23,692
Yes, now I claim your sun.

1810
02:17:25,987 --> 02:17:29,114
- Move!
- Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

1811
02:17:29,199 --> 02:17:30,742
Engage! Engage!

1812
02:17:36,206 --> 02:17:39,166
In moments, we'll be
at firing strength.

1813
02:17:54,766 --> 02:17:59,311
All my Decepticon life, I never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1814
02:17:59,854 --> 02:18:02,773
Optimus, take my parts

1815
02:18:02,858 --> 02:18:06,027
and you will have a power
you've never known.

1816
02:18:06,986 --> 02:18:09,030
Fulfill your destiny.

1817
02:18:15,328 --> 02:18:17,163
Jolt! Electrify!

1818
02:18:17,622 --> 02:18:19,540
Transplant those afterburners.

1819
02:18:37,893 --> 02:18:39,519
Let's roll.

1820
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:44,065
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1821
02:18:55,911 --> 02:18:59,371
This planet will be
dark forever.

1822
02:19:21,602 --> 02:19:24,022
Die, like your brothers!

1823
02:19:24,647 --> 02:19:26,898
They were your brothers, too.

1824
02:19:55,763 --> 02:19:57,638
Starscream!

1825
02:20:10,652 --> 02:20:12,819
You picked the wrong planet.

1826
02:20:15,782 --> 02:20:17,657
Give me your face.

1827
02:20:26,167 --> 02:20:27,834
I rise.

1828
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,004
You fall.

1829
02:20:32,799 --> 02:20:35,218
No, no.

1830
02:20:37,304 --> 02:20:39,721
Not to call you
a coward, Master,

1831
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:45,477
but sometimes
cowards do survive.

1832
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:48,022
This isn't over.

1833
02:21:15,717 --> 02:21:18,593
It took all this for you
to tell me that you love me.

1834
02:21:20,221 --> 02:21:21,763
You said it first.

1835
02:22:12,941 --> 02:22:15,567
Thank you, Sam,
for saving my life.

1836
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:18,154
Welcome.

1837
02:22:18,947 --> 02:22:20,656
Thank you for believing in me.

1838
02:22:25,495 --> 02:22:30,040
Our races united
by a history long forgotten

1839
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,543
and a future we shall
face together.

1840
02:22:34,086 --> 02:22:36,504
I am Optimus Prime,

1841
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:41,593
and I send this message so that our pasts
will always be remembered,

1842
02:22:41,677 --> 02:22:45,597
for in those memories,
we live on.

1843
02:23:08,413 --> 02:23:11,290
So glad you could join
us, Professor Einstein.

1844
02:23:11,791 --> 02:23:13,709
Yeah, I was kind of busy.

1845
02:23:16,379 --> 02:23:17,587
Okay.
