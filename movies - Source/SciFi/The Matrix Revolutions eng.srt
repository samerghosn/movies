1
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,507
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,176
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,469
Should we jack in and
try to contact them?

4
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,263
It wouldn't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:29,805
Then we should start back.

6
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,599
No! If that ship can still fly,
we need it.

7
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,317
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.

8
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:36,299
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

9
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,745
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

10
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,942
Captain, these lines are
crawling with calamari.

11
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:42,819
Then the sooner we
find them the better.

12
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,621
Thought you could use
something to eat.

13
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,621
Thank you.

14
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,307
Any change?

15
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,049
No.

16
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:02,923
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

17
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,634
At least until he wakes up.

18
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,359
What do you mean?

19
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,389
Captain has some
questions for him.

20
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,549
He better have some
good answers.

21
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:16,284
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

22
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:20,198
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

23
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,961
But like I said,
the answer had better be good.

24
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:30,040
Roland. I'd like to run another
search through the Matrix.

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,543
- For what?
- For Neo.

26
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,963
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

27
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:38,841
Please, for me.

28
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,562
This is what keeps bothering me.

29
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,313
What?

30
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,609
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

31
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,736
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

32
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:04,616
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

33
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,213
The big bubkis. Nada.
He's not in there.

34
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,591
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,651
Based on the point of entry
and the past speed

36
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:25,800
it looks like the machines will be
in Zion in just under 20 hours.

37
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:28,599
Jesus H. Christ.

38
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,701
All right,
let's move with a purpose.

39
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:33,599
AK, get upstairs, I want
you on holographics.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,483
Mauser, I want forward and
aft guns manned at all times.

41
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:38,801
And make sure we are running on
as few pads as possible.

42
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,349
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,500
Hey.

44
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:43,373
- Hey hey! We got a call.
- What?

45
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,534
Operator.

46
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:50,913
It's Seraph.

47
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:54,144
I bring word from The Oracle.
You must come at once.

48
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:09,014
Good morning.

49
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,435
Who are you?

50
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,800
My name is Sati.
Your name is Neo.

51
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,370
My papa says you're not
supposed to be here.

52
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,170
He says you must be lost.

53
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,250
Are you lost, Neo?

54
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:27,511
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

55
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:34,560
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

56
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:38,702
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

57
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,665
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

58
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:46,545
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

59
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,048
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says

60
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,769
or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

61
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:13,904
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

62
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,641
One thing I've learned
in all my years

63
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,619
is that nothing ever works out
just the way you want it to.

64
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:24,249
- Who are you?
- I'm The Oracle.

65
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,754
I wish there was an easier way
to get through this,

66
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:28,956
but there ain't.

67
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,841
I'm sorry this had to happen.

68
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,595
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting
here like you remember me,

69
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,649
but it wasn't meant to be.

70
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,750
What happened?

71
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,949
I made a choice,

72
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,069
and that choice cost me
more than I wanted it to.

73
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,687
What choice?

74
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,691
To help you, to guide Neo.

75
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,824
Now, since the real test
for any choice is

76
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:53,826
having to make
the same choice again,

77
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,783
knowing full well
what it might cost,

78
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,937
I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice,

79
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:06,040
'cause here I am, at it again.

80
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,228
Do you know
what happened to Neo?

81
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,228
Yes.

82
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,149
He is trapped in a place

83
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:15,000
between this world and
the machine world.

84
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:19,346
The link is controlled by
a program called the Trainman.

85
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:24,141
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

86
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,540
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him,

87
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:31,500
then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

88
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,302
Why?

89
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,750
Because of who
the Trainman works for.

90
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,403
The Merovingian.

91
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,100
He has placed a bounty
on your lives.

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,300
You must be careful
at all times.

93
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:44,733
Seraph knows how to
find the Trainman.

94
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,033
He'll go with you.

95
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:49,750
For years he has protected me.

96
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,379
I hope he can do
the same for you.

97
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:57,800
Please, follow me.

98
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,848
Oracle...

99
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,225
I know, Morpheus.

100
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,600
I can see you're
filled with doubt,

101
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,389
clouded by uncertainty.

102
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,899
After everything
that has happened,

103
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,449
how can you expect me
to believe you?

104
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:16,161
I don't.

105
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,997
I expect just
what I've always expected:

106
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:21,701
For you to make up your
own damn mind.

107
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,502
Believe me or don't.

108
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,632
All I can do is tell you that
your friend is in trouble,

109
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,432
and he needs your help.

110
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,886
He needs all our help.

111
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,764
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

112
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:37,182
No.

113
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,000
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

114
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,856
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

115
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,586
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

116
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:52,613
Yes, Papa.

117
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,495
I am sorry.
She is still very curious.

118
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:01,290
I know you.

119
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,649
Yes, in the restaurant
of the Frenchman.

120
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,355
I am Rama-Kandra.

121
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,399
This is my wife, Kamala.
My daughter, Sati.

122
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,706
We are most honoured
to meet you.

123
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:13,843
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

124
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,485
I am the power-plant
systems manager

125
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,259
for recycling operations.

126
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,250
My wife is an interactive
software programmer.

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,500
She is highly creative.

128
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,079
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

129
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:30,052
Kamala! Goodness, I apologise.
My wife can be very direct.

130
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,946
It's okay.

131
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:34,655
I don't have an answer.

132
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,715
I don't even know where "here" is.

133
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,389
This place is nowhere.

134
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,630
It is between your world
and our world.

135
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:46,125
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

136
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,253
Why'd I know you were
going to say that?

137
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,590
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

138
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,384
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

139
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:58,614
I know that if you want to take
something from our world

140
00:08:58,615 --> 00:08:59,615
into your world,

141
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:02,892
that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

142
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,686
Is that what you're
doing here?

143
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,250
Rama, please.

144
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,150
I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

145
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:11,692
He may never see another
face for the rest of his life.

146
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:13,778
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,674
You don't have to answer
that question.

148
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,176
No, I don't mind.

149
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,602
The answer is simple.

150
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:28,125
I love my daughter
very much.

151
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,360
I find her to be
the most beautiful thing

152
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I have ever seen.

153
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:34,756
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

154
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,693
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

155
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:41,139
If it does not,
it is deleted.

156
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,836
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

157
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,898
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

158
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:53,025
Heard a program
speak of love.

159
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:57,572
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

160
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,820
What matters is the
connection the word implies.

161
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,999
I see that you are in love.

162
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,740
Can you tell me
what you would give

163
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,441
to hold on to
that connection?

164
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,712
Anything.

165
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,261
Then perhaps the reason
you are here is not so different

166
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,763
than the reason I am here.

167
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,553
That's him.

168
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,899
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

169
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:35,985
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

170
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:41,240
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

171
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:33,460
Oh, no!

172
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:45,500
Damn it!

173
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:53,270
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

174
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,106
It's not like the Trainman
to be late.

175
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,049
You think it has something
to do with me?

176
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,399
I cannot say.

177
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:02,739
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

178
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,741
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

179
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,639
I consulted with her before
I met with the Frenchman.

180
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,149
She promised she
would look after Sati

181
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,451
after we said goodbye.

182
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:13,541
Goodbye?

183
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,376
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

184
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,259
Our arrangement
with the Frenchman

185
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,760
was for our daughter only.

186
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:23,009
My wife and I must return
to our world.

187
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,010
Why?

188
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:27,471
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

189
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,850
Karma is a word, like love.

190
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,811
A way of saying:

191
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,230
"What I am here to do."

192
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:38,850
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

193
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:40,638
Grateful for
my wonderful wife,

194
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,100
for my beautiful daughter.

195
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:43,700
They are gifts,

196
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,900
and so I do what I must do to honour them.

197
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:52,350
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,201
Can I carry that for you?

199
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,273
All right.

200
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,950
Hurry it up, I'm late!

201
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,643
Who are you?

202
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,937
- He is a friend.
- Rama.

203
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,773
I know you.

204
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:23,653
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

205
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,197
I'll pay you
whatever you want.

206
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,544
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

207
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,701
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

208
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,087
You're gonna stay right here

209
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,700
until the Merovingian
says different.

210
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,498
If I know him,

211
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:39,376
you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

212
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:43,423
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

213
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,216
I built this place.

214
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,201
Down here,
I make the rules.

215
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,602
Down here,
I make the threats.

216
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,690
Down here, I'm god.

217
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,200
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

218
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:24,087
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

219
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,909
No. We know
what has to be done.

220
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:43,967
Shit.

221
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,847
You gotta be kidding.

222
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:17,642
Holy shit, it's wingless.

223
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,351
I get it.

224
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,563
You must be ready to die.

225
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,149
I need to speak with him.

226
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:26,037
The only way you're
getting through this door

227
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:29,100
is over my big, dead ass.

228
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,039
So be it.

229
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:56,889
There are no weapons
allowed in the club.

230
00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:00,518
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl,

231
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,105
and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

232
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,149
And if we're unlucky?

233
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:09,652
There will be many men.

234
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:12,169
Can I take your...?
Oh, my god.

235
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,326
What in the hell?

236
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:43,013
I don't believe this.

237
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,270
Hey! Hey!

238
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,980
Is the prodigal child returns?

239
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,738
<i>L'ange sans ailes.</i>

240
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,085
Are you here for the bounty,
Seraph?

241
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:07,500
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

242
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:10,583
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

243
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,586
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

244
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:15,164
I'm sure you do.

245
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,865
You have fought
through hell to do so.

246
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:18,866
Yes?

247
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,510
I'll tell you what I will do.

248
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:22,789
Put down the guns,

249
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,790
and I will promise you
a safe passage out of here.

250
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,352
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

251
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,855
Of course.

252
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,450
<i>Quelle bonne surprise, n'est pas?</i>

253
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,134
Who could've guessed we'd all be
seeing each other so soon

254
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:02,990
after our last meeting?

255
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:06,431
The Fates are too kind, eh?

256
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,201
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here

257
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,400
I can only surmise

258
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:14,101
that the fortuneteller has
found herself another shell?

259
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,567
Disappointing,
but not unexpected.

260
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:19,990
I do hope, however,

261
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,099
she has the good manners
to learn her lesson,

262
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:25,474
and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

263
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:28,150
And if you take
something from me,

264
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,988
you will pay the price.

265
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:32,717
You know why we are here?

266
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,775
Come now,
what kind of question is this?

267
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:37,875
Of course I know.

268
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,006
It is my business to know.

269
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,325
Some might think
this is a strange coincidence,

270
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,326
but I do not.

271
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:49,383
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

272
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,477
- Do you know?
- No.

273
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,394
No?

274
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,730
I did not think so.

275
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,817
But it is always best
to ask, huh?

276
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,887
We want to make a deal.

277
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:07,951
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

278
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,454
Okay.
I have something you want.

279
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,582
To make a deal,

280
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:20,296
you must have something
I want, yes?

281
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:24,800
And it so happens
there is something I want.

282
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:29,346
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

283
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,558
It is said they
cannot be taken,

284
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,060
they can only be given.

285
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,381
What?

286
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:41,269
The eyes of The Oracle.

287
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,607
I have told you before,

288
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:49,009
there's no escaping
the nature of the universe.

289
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:51,627
It is that nature that has
again brought you to me.

290
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:55,664
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

291
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:58,125
Where others see chance,

292
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:03,256
I see cost.

293
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:07,594
Bring me the eyes
of The Oracle,

294
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:11,181
and I will give you back
your saviour.

295
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:14,751
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

296
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,130
Yes? No?

297
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,849
I don't have time
for this shit.

298
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,433
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

299
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,894
You give me Neo,
or we all die,

300
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:00,710
right here, right now.

301
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:06,027
Interesting deal.

302
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:12,534
You are really ready to die
for this man?

303
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,662
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

304
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,664
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

305
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:21,084
She's in love.

306
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,430
It is remarkable

307
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:26,599
how similar the pattern of love
is to the pattern of insanity.

308
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,340
Time's up.

309
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,553
What's it gonna be, Merv?

310
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:38,601
Okay. You got yourself in here,

311
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,814
you can get yourself out.

312
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:30,319
Are you ready for us?

313
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:31,375
Almost, sir.

314
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,576
They got some pretty ancient
hacks here, we're working on it.

315
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:35,784
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

316
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:36,799
No, sir.

317
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:38,800
We were reading something,
but I couldn't tell what it was.

318
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,961
I can't leave yet.

319
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:49,339
I have to see her.

320
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:51,977
Now?

321
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:55,922
It's my last chance.

322
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,682
That's it. That's the secret.

323
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:03,353
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

324
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,606
Cookies need love
like everything does.

325
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,567
Neo!

326
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:13,031
I was hoping to have these
done before you got here.

327
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:14,532
Oh, well.

328
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,910
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

329
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,954
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

330
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,707
Okay.

331
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:28,877
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

332
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:34,634
So, do you recognise me?

333
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:38,011
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

334
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:41,015
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

335
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:44,721
I don't yet recognise my face
in the mirror, but...

336
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:50,066
I still love candy.

337
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:52,402
No, thank you.

338
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:53,869
Remember what you were like

339
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,750
when you first walked
through my door,

340
00:25:55,947 --> 00:26:00,910
jittery as a junebug?
And now, just look at you.

341
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:04,580
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

342
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:07,791
You gave me a few surprises too.

343
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,252
I hope I helped.

344
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,923
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

345
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:15,799
Where is this going?

346
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,635
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

347
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,656
You don't know
or you won't tell me?

348
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,357
I told you before,

349
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:26,545
no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand,

350
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:27,846
and I mean no one.

351
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:29,299
What choice?

352
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,130
It doesn't matter.
It's my choice.

353
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:35,028
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

354
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:37,056
Does that include
what things to tell me

355
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:38,257
and what not to tell me?

356
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,865
Of course not.

357
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,035
Then why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

358
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:43,549
Why didn't you tell me
about Zion,

359
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,611
and the Ones before me?

360
00:26:44,615 --> 00:26:46,623
Why didn't you tell me
the truth?

361
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:49,430
Because it wasn't time
for you to know.

362
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:51,030
Who decided it wasn't time?

363
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:53,029
You know who.

364
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,431
I did.

365
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,934
Then I think it's time for me
to know a few more things.

366
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,978
So do I.

367
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:11,460
Tell me how I separated
my mind from my body

368
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:12,461
without jacking in.

369
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:16,318
Tell me how I stopped four
sentinels by thinking it.

370
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:18,715
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

371
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,744
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

372
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:27,119
It reaches from here

373
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:29,460
all the way back to
where it came from.

374
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:31,917
- Where?
- The Source.

375
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:35,337
That's what you felt when you
touched those sentinels.

376
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,214
But you weren't ready for it.

377
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:38,920
You should be dead,

378
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:41,621
but apparently you weren't
ready for that either.

379
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:47,109
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the Source,

380
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:49,411
Zion would be destroyed
by midnight tonight.

381
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,019
Please.

382
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,349
You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices,

383
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:57,402
but that man can't see
past any choice.

384
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,400
Why not?

385
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:01,224
He doesn't understand them.
He can't.

386
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:04,116
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

387
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:05,490
One at a time,

388
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,535
each variable must be solved,
then countered.

389
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,459
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

390
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,751
What's your purpose?

391
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,962
To unbalance it.

392
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,673
Why? What do you want?

393
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:23,344
I want the same thing
you want, Neo.

394
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:26,722
And I am willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

395
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:29,851
The end of the war.

396
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,060
Is it going to end?

397
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,730
One way or another.

398
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:36,968
Can Zion be saved?

399
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:42,660
I'm sorry, I don't have the
answer to that question, but...

400
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:46,180
If there is an answer,

401
00:28:46,181 --> 00:28:49,280
there's only one place
you're going to find it.

402
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:52,325
- Where?
- You know where.

403
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:56,311
And if you can't find
the answer,

404
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,900
then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

405
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,000
What does that mean?

406
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:11,810
Everything
that has a beginning,

407
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,599
has an end.

408
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:18,066
I see the end coming.

409
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,810
I see the darkness spreading.

410
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:23,579
I see death.

411
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:26,916
And you are all
that stands in his way.

412
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:29,786
Smith.

413
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:33,000
Very soon, he is going to
have the power

414
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,454
to destroy this world.

415
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:36,184
But I believe
he won't stop there.

416
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,185
He can't.

417
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,587
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

418
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,132
What is he?

419
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,259
He is you.

420
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,845
Your opposite,
your negative.

421
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:50,765
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

422
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:55,478
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

423
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:58,897
this war is going to end.

424
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:02,299
Tonight,
the future of both worlds

425
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,569
will be in your hands
or in his.

426
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:26,550
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

427
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,719
I need time.

428
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,776
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

429
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:45,400
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is, sir. He's conscious.

430
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,073
Good.
Maybe he's got some answers.

431
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:58,540
I love that smell.

432
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,211
I sure am going to miss it.

433
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,507
- Oracle.
- I know.

434
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:06,883
I know.

435
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:10,678
Sati, honey.

436
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:13,222
Take a few cookies and
go with Seraph.

437
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:16,142
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

438
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:21,230
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

439
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,402
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

440
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:50,426
I'm scared, Seraph.

441
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:53,971
Come.

442
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:39,851
He's following us.

443
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,517
Well, well,
it's been a long time.

444
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:51,069
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

445
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,323
I have beaten you before.

446
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,230
Yes, true,
but as you can see,

447
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,599
things are
a little different now.

448
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:03,290
And you must be
the last exile.

449
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,674
The Oracle told me
about you.

450
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:06,675
Really?

451
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:09,338
What did she say about me?

452
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:11,340
That you were a bad man.

453
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:17,721
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

454
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:50,963
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

455
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:56,719
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

456
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:59,489
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

457
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,599
How can she be?
She knows everything.

458
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,375
But if that's true,
then why is she here

459
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,276
if she knew I was coming?

460
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,692
Why wouldn't she leave?

461
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,789
Maybe you knew
I was going to do that,

462
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:17,791
maybe you didn't.

463
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:20,400
If you did, that means
you baked those cookies

464
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,659
and set that plate right there,

465
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,329
deliberately, purposefully.

466
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,976
Which means that
you're sitting there also

467
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,699
deliberately, purposefully.

468
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:30,961
What did you do with Sati?

469
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:37,217
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

470
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,846
You are a bastard.

471
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:43,891
You would know, Mom.

472
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:48,938
Do what you're here to do.

473
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:52,608
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,182
I really wish I could help,
but I just...

475
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,083
I don't remember any of it.

476
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:43,800
What about the cuts
on your arms?

477
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,701
Those cuts are
more than one day old.

478
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:49,081
Yeah, definitely.

479
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:51,876
You're right about that, sir.

480
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:55,422
They look like they might
be self-inflicted.

481
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,842
But why would I do
something like that to myself?

482
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,764
Unless, of course,
I wasn't myself.

483
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:11,103
But if I'm not me,
then who am I?

484
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:16,840
Has this man
been tested for VDTs?

485
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,409
Yes, sir. It was negative.

486
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:22,364
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

487
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:24,130
Some cross-synaptic firing,

488
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,099
as well as signs of
recent trauma,

489
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,081
with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

490
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,550
I want the truth.
I don't care what it takes.

491
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,851
Make him remember.

492
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:58,141
Sir, we found her.

493
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,400
- The "Logos"?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:01,463
'Bout time we got some
goddamn good news.

495
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,396
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

496
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,449
No, sir. Nothing yet.

497
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:38,659
What about the ship?

498
00:37:38,661 --> 00:37:40,760
Holographic says
the hull's still intact.

499
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,250
Drop her down and
keep a man in the rear turret.

500
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:44,364
Yes, sir.

501
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:58,403
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

502
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:17,813
Careful, sir.

503
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:21,378
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

504
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:49,005
What was that?

505
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:53,500
You can put that shit away,
boys.

506
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:54,701
All she needs is a jump.

507
00:38:56,686 --> 00:39:01,148
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

508
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,880
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

509
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,019
We didn't know
what happened after...

510
00:39:10,824 --> 00:39:13,911
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

511
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,831
I'm happy to see you too.

512
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,875
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

513
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,210
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

514
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:22,340
You saw her?

515
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,199
Just before
the sentinels found us.

516
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:25,800
What did she tell you?

517
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,701
The same thing
she always does.

518
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:31,731
Exactly what I needed
to hear.

519
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,309
In less than 12 hours,

520
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,311
the machines
will breach the dock walls.

521
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,150
Every simulation we've run,

522
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:41,900
we've seen that once the
machines are inside the city,

523
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:44,650
the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

524
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,561
Thus, our primary objective
must be to destroy

525
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,489
or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

526
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:51,630
If we can do that,

527
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,030
perhaps we can prevent them
from ever reaching the city.

528
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,449
If not, the only place

529
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:58,360
we'll be able to mount
an effective defence

530
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:00,541
will be at the entrance of
the temple.

531
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,460
It is small enough that it will
force them into a bottleneck,

532
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,922
allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defence.

533
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:10,092
We understand that you've
requested additional volunteers.

534
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,436
That is correct.

535
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:14,400
Precisely what size of force
are you planning to commit

536
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,300
to the primary dock objective?

537
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:19,893
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

538
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:21,876
Half the infantry?

539
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,309
If it were up to me,
councillor...

540
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:25,389
I'd take every man,
woman and child,

541
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:26,420
put a gun in their hand

542
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,159
and march them
straight into that dock.

543
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,530
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

544
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,782
Time will tell, councillor.

545
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:36,619
Commander,
just one more question.

546
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:39,079
Has there been word
from the "Nebuchadnezzar"?

547
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,608
None, and at this point
there's no reason to expect

548
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,710
that there ever will be.

549
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:44,878
Perhaps.

550
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,670
But we can hope.

551
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,579
I'm afraid hope is
an indulgence

552
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:49,780
I don't have time for.

553
00:41:01,936 --> 00:41:04,856
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

554
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,692
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

555
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,527
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

556
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:12,865
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

557
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:19,197
Kids, you stay here.

558
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:24,291
I know how you feel, Zee,
but you can't do this.

559
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:26,503
- I have to.
- Why?

560
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,338
Because I love him.

561
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,882
I love him the same as
he loves me.

562
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:33,565
And if I were out there
and he were here,

563
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:34,565
I know what he'd do.

564
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:38,000
But you're gonna get
yourself killed.

565
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,001
It's crazy, Zee.

566
00:41:41,684 --> 00:41:43,188
Maybe it is.

567
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,400
But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer,

568
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,139
and you knew the only chance
you had to see him again

569
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:50,099
was to hold the dock...
what would you do?

570
00:41:56,574 --> 00:42:00,077
Make shells.

571
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:12,215
What the shit is going on
over here?

572
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:15,885
An accident, sir.
I didn't see...

573
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:18,221
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

574
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:21,099
A unit volunteer, sir.

575
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,829
What's a pod-born
pencil-neck like you

576
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:25,431
doing volunteering for
my Corps?

577
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:30,400
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

578
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:32,789
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

579
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,322
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

580
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,489
Okay, I'm 16.

581
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,949
Minimum age for
the Corps is eighteen.

582
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:40,251
Sixteen's too young.

583
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:43,420
The machines don't care
how old I am.

584
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:45,420
They'll kill me just the same.

585
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,126
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

586
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:53,172
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

587
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,750
You do, and you'll find me
and the machines

588
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,050
have got something in common.

589
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,228
Okay, charge the igniter.

590
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:22,327
She lives again.

591
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:23,755
You want us
to patch an uplink

592
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:25,556
to reload the operations
software, Sparky?

593
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:26,956
Yeah, that'd be swell.

594
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:29,751
You could clean the
windshield while you're at it.

595
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:36,507
Uplinks are in place,
I'm bringing her back online.

596
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,769
Looking good, except, uhh...

597
00:43:41,304 --> 00:43:43,347
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

598
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:45,025
No, there's not.

599
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:46,527
You're looking
at what we're looking at.

600
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:48,159
<i>-What the hell is
going on in there.</i>

601
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:50,061
Whatever it is,
it can't be good.

602
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:54,150
The machines have taken
Junction 21.

603
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:55,255
The way I see it,

604
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:57,599
if we drop down
from broadcast here,

605
00:43:57,653 --> 00:44:00,614
intersect 153,
we might surprise them.

606
00:44:00,824 --> 00:44:03,250
We go first,
hammer as deep as we can,

607
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:04,550
and then blow our EMP.

608
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,282
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

609
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:11,804
It ain't pretty,

610
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:14,206
but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

611
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:17,172
No, it's not.

612
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:20,385
There's another way.
A support line.

613
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:24,431
It drops down right here,
1000 metres short of 21.

614
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:26,554
If we're lucky,
we may be able to slip down

615
00:44:26,556 --> 00:44:27,655
without them ever knowing.

616
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,869
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

617
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:33,188
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.

618
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:35,179
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

619
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,182
That was a long time ago,
Niobe.

620
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:38,884
I said I can do it.

621
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:39,780
So what?

622
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:41,500
If you can, you'll be
the only one that can,

623
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,367
there's no way
we can follow you.

624
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:49,289
Hi.

625
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:51,342
I know time is always
against us.

626
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:53,099
I'm sorry that
I took so long.

627
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:58,005
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

628
00:44:58,213 --> 00:45:00,300
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

629
00:45:00,507 --> 00:45:02,000
There's no easy way
to say this,

630
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,001
so I'll just say it.

631
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:05,614
I have to take
one of the ships.

632
00:45:05,614 --> 00:45:06,614
What?

633
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:09,184
To go where?

634
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:12,228
To the machine city.

635
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,483
I know it's difficult
to understand.

636
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:20,360
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

637
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,704
I still have to go.

638
00:45:21,713 --> 00:45:22,599
You'll never make it.

639
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:25,519
In 100 years no ship has been
within 100 kilometres of it.

640
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:28,119
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

641
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:30,148
Is this what
The Oracle has told you?

642
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:31,349
No.

643
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:34,519
This is asinine.
If you want to kill yourself,

644
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:37,221
go do it, but do it without
wasting one of our ships.

645
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:39,213
You have to believe me.
I have to go.

646
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:40,213
Bullshit!

647
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,550
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

648
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,125
And believe me, this ship
will go to hell long before

649
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:48,222
I let you take it anywhere.

650
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:56,106
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

651
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:57,934
Don't even think of
trying to tell me

652
00:45:57,934 --> 00:46:00,574
what I can or cannot do
with my ship

653
00:46:00,576 --> 00:46:01,860
after that little speech.

654
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,815
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship,

655
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:06,117
he can take mine.

656
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:08,000
If we leave inside the hour,

657
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:10,201
we should reach Zion
as the machines do.

658
00:46:10,577 --> 00:46:13,123
That's as good a plan as any.

659
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:18,503
It's a waste.
A goddamn waste.

660
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,760
Two ships, two directions.

661
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:29,597
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

662
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:31,570
You've never believed in
the One.

663
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,871
I still don't.

664
00:46:33,143 --> 00:46:36,271
Then why are you doing this?

665
00:46:36,438 --> 00:46:39,481
I believe in him.

666
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:43,360
Thank you.

667
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:49,784
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

668
00:46:49,992 --> 00:46:53,288
To make it easier for
you to remember.

669
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:56,498
What if I don't want
to remember?

670
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,751
Why would you want that?

671
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,838
What if I blew that EMP?

672
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:05,250
What if I did destroy
those ships,

673
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:09,000
and I am responsible for
the deaths of all those men?

674
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:13,733
If I did that...

675
00:47:15,143 --> 00:47:20,356
it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

676
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:34,496
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

677
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:43,922
I'm ready.

678
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,882
Trinity...

679
00:47:47,092 --> 00:47:51,179
There's something I have to say.

680
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:56,601
Something you need to
understand.

681
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:59,646
I know I'm supposed to go.

682
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:02,856
But beyond that,

683
00:48:03,065 --> 00:48:05,485
I don't know. I...

684
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:11,074
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

685
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:13,911
I knew it the moment
you said you had to leave.

686
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,512
I could see it in your face.

687
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:19,416
Just like you knew the
moment you looked at me,

688
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,793
that I was coming with you.

689
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:25,588
I'm scared, Trin.

690
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:28,382
So am I.

691
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:33,012
It took me ten minutes
to buckle up one boot.

692
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:35,264
But I'll tell you something.

693
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:38,434
Six hours ago,
I told the Merovingian,

694
00:48:38,643 --> 00:48:43,063
I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

695
00:48:44,148 --> 00:48:46,693
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

696
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,945
No.

697
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:51,780
Nothing.

698
00:49:03,626 --> 00:49:05,090
<i>Get finished loading
that ammunition.</i>

699
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,090
Just about, sir.

700
00:49:06,128 --> 00:49:08,422
Let's move it. We are out of time.

701
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,925
You're not leaving them anything?

702
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:14,721
He said he didn't need it.

703
00:49:17,181 --> 00:49:20,809
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

704
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:24,313
Thank you.

705
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:30,570
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

706
00:49:30,778 --> 00:49:33,655
Me too.

707
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:39,454
It was an honour, sir.

708
00:49:42,206 --> 00:49:45,751
No, the honour is still mine.

709
00:49:58,222 --> 00:49:59,467
<i>We're ready, sir.</i>

710
00:49:59,568 --> 00:50:00,969
About damn time.

711
00:50:02,476 --> 00:50:07,523
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

712
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:11,652
Bye, baby.

713
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,155
Take good care of them.

714
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:38,804
Ready?

715
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:47,105
Engine's still firing.

716
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:49,001
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

717
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:06,717
I should've known
he'd send his bitch first.

718
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:07,717
Bane?

719
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:10,961
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

720
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,130
Every single time,
I thought it was the last.

721
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:14,875
Every time,
I was sure we had you,

722
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:17,342
but somehow you'd
slip through our fingers.

723
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:22,431
I really can't express just
how aggravating that can be.

724
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,268
What are you talking about?

725
00:51:25,476 --> 00:51:32,150
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

726
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:50,460
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

727
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,514
You're gonna pay for that.

728
00:51:54,422 --> 00:51:56,030
Twenty-seven kilometres to go.

729
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:57,509
<i>Captain, we've got an emergency
down here.</i>

730
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,460
What is it, AK?

731
00:51:58,461 --> 00:51:59,461
<i>It's Maggie, sir.</i>

732
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:02,474
<i>She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.</i>

733
00:52:02,514 --> 00:52:03,675
Goddamn it.

734
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:10,313
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

735
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:12,273
He fired that EMP.

736
00:52:12,282 --> 00:52:16,110
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

737
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:18,110
We searched the whole ship,
captain.

738
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:19,210
He ain't here.

739
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:24,702
- I know where he is.
- The "Logos".

740
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,621
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

741
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:28,472
You don't know that.
What if they need our help?

742
00:52:28,873 --> 00:52:30,449
- It's too dangerous.
- Why?

743
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:33,420
Because if he's killed them
he'll control another EMP.

744
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:37,027
At this point,
they're on their own.

745
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:38,628
Just like us.

746
00:52:40,552 --> 00:52:42,887
Mr. Anderson.

747
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:45,449
I see you are as predictable
in this world

748
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:46,751
as you are in the other.

749
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:49,018
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

750
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:50,447
It might appear that
way to you.

751
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:54,099
But Mr. Anderson and I know that
appearances can be deceiving.

752
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,195
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

753
00:52:59,403 --> 00:53:01,351
Now, thank you for
bringing me the gun.

754
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:02,813
You can set it down
right there.

755
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,784
Don't do it.

756
00:53:04,793 --> 00:53:07,849
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot.

757
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,409
Fry us. Burn us alive.

758
00:53:09,414 --> 00:53:11,985
Do it. If you don't,
he'll kill us both.

759
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:17,838
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

760
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:22,510
- He can't.
- Do it.

761
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:33,563
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

762
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:41,862
Let her go.

763
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,628
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

764
00:53:56,835 --> 00:54:00,923
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

765
00:54:01,132 --> 00:54:04,521
I do. I think of nothing else.

766
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:13,436
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognise me?

767
00:54:13,644 --> 00:54:18,108
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

768
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:26,115
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

769
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:28,659
Disgusting.

770
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:31,355
Look at how pathetically
fragile it is.

771
00:54:31,356 --> 00:54:34,300
Nothing this weak is meant
to survive.

772
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:44,759
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

773
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:50,764
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

774
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:52,891
Look past the flesh.

775
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:56,619
Look through the soft gelatine
of these dull cow eyes

776
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:58,550
 and see your enemy.

777
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:03,652
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

778
00:55:03,862 --> 00:55:05,050
It can't be.

779
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:09,050
There's nowhere I can't go.
There is nowhere I won't find you.

780
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:14,414
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

781
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:17,625
Inevitable.

782
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,960
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

783
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,297
This is it. It's gotta be.

784
00:56:07,382 --> 00:56:10,010
Oh, no.

785
00:56:26,735 --> 00:56:29,974
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

786
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,789
Blind messiah.

787
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:44,981
You're a symbol for all of
your kind, Mr. Anderson.

788
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:51,385
Helpless.

789
00:56:52,262 --> 00:56:55,931
Pathetic.

790
00:56:57,391 --> 00:57:03,063
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

791
00:57:06,985 --> 00:57:08,362
I can see you.

792
00:57:17,286 --> 00:57:20,039
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

793
00:57:20,248 --> 00:57:23,626
It's not over.

794
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,518
- Trinity!
- Neo.

795
00:57:40,643 --> 00:57:43,521
Neo.

796
00:57:45,023 --> 00:57:48,193
Oh, no. Your eyes.

797
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,653
I'll be okay.

798
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:53,032
It's all right, Trin.

799
00:57:55,784 --> 00:58:00,163
But I think you're gonna
have to drive.

800
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:08,338
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

801
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:10,447
They can't know we
don't have an EMP.

802
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,342
They'll have to attack in waves.

803
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:14,677
Concentrate our offence
on the diggers.

804
00:58:14,677 --> 00:58:16,971
Order the APUs into position.

805
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:20,182
Yes, sir.

806
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,440
Come on, move.

807
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:25,081
All right!

808
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:27,083
This is it.

809
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,422
Now, you all know me,

810
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:31,699
so I'll just say this
as simple as I can.

811
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,925
If it's our time to die,
it's our time.

812
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:42,599
All I ask is, if we have to give
these bastards our lives,

813
00:59:42,806 --> 00:59:45,684
we give them hell
before we do!

814
01:00:02,659 --> 01:00:06,331
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

815
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:08,583
But I'll make you a deal.

816
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:13,253
You keep loading,
I keep shooting.

817
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:17,382
Deal.

818
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:28,644
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

819
01:00:28,853 --> 01:00:31,773
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometres.

820
01:00:31,981 --> 01:00:34,365
We're still generating
too hot a field.

821
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:36,266
Ghost,
kill all auxiliary systems.

822
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,000
Give me full manual.
Drop down four pads.

823
01:00:39,297 --> 01:00:40,739
It'll bottom out.

824
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:55,422
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred metres.

825
01:00:56,463 --> 01:00:58,934
If we can just get close enough...

826
01:01:03,637 --> 01:01:05,849
Six hundred metres.

827
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:09,226
There.

828
01:01:15,315 --> 01:01:16,110
Shit!

829
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:21,626
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power, full systems!

830
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,150
Man the gun turrets, every
goddamn one of them! Go, go!

831
01:01:24,425 --> 01:01:26,644
Ghost, you're the best gunner
we have, go with them.

832
01:01:27,045 --> 01:01:28,722
Morpheus, take his place!

833
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:49,809
I'm coming, baby.

834
01:01:57,192 --> 01:01:58,311
Here they come.

835
01:02:03,405 --> 01:02:05,094
<i>Slow down,
this ain't the "Logos".</i>

836
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,219
Hang on to your lunch,
Roland, here we go.

837
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:19,539
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

838
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:13,085
Breach!
The dock is breached!

839
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:37,208
Knuckle up!

840
01:03:49,052 --> 01:03:52,139
For Zion!

841
01:05:58,807 --> 01:05:59,777
Shit.

842
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:08,902
Come on, let's go.

843
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:14,376
Knuckle up!

844
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:30,949
Reload!

845
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:34,621
Reload nine!

846
01:06:41,518 --> 01:06:44,186
Go, go! Move, move!

847
01:06:55,072 --> 01:06:56,099
Watch your left!

848
01:06:57,867 --> 01:06:59,338
Don't let them through!

849
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,942
Zuka!

850
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:44,831
Oh, my god.

851
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,378
Where the hell's my infantry?

852
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,581
I want that goddamn
machine taken down!

853
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:37,257
Dig this!

854
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:41,463
Oh, shit!

855
01:09:02,074 --> 01:09:04,328
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!

856
01:09:30,395 --> 01:09:34,023
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

857
01:09:41,864 --> 01:09:42,909
Keep them off me!

858
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:45,011
Christ,
there's a shitstorm of them.

859
01:10:17,233 --> 01:10:17,962
Captain, you see that?

860
01:10:17,962 --> 01:10:19,462
They're after the radio.
Stop them!

861
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:28,454
Damn it!

862
01:10:53,853 --> 01:10:56,773
Yeah.

863
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:10,369
Grab my belt.

864
01:11:19,337 --> 01:11:22,256
Just give me one clean shot.

865
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,222
Damn it!

866
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:54,622
Charra!

867
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:00,760
- Commander Lock, I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

868
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,359
Sir, yes, sir.
But this is different, sir.

869
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,360
What?

870
01:12:04,047 --> 01:12:05,759
I think it's one of ours, sir.

871
01:12:05,966 --> 01:12:07,039
That's impossible.

872
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,541
Holographics are trying
to confirm sir.

873
01:12:09,095 --> 01:12:10,805
Contact them.
I want access codes.

874
01:12:11,014 --> 01:12:12,684
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

875
01:12:14,893 --> 01:12:17,561
It's a trick. That's not
one of ours, it can't be.

876
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:21,525
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

877
01:12:31,868 --> 01:12:33,479
Forward aft,
30 degrees at 80 percent.

878
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,881
Thirty degrees, 80.

879
01:12:38,123 --> 01:12:39,479
Lower starboard 60 degrees,

880
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,581
- 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

881
01:12:44,088 --> 01:12:48,510
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

882
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:09,988
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the "Hammer", sir.

883
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:11,490
How can that be?

884
01:13:11,698 --> 01:13:13,659
The ship is under attack,
sustaining heavy damage.

885
01:13:13,868 --> 01:13:16,621
But at its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate 3 in 12 minutes.

886
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:19,873
Sir their EMP could take out
every sentinel out there.

887
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:21,385
It'd take out more than that.

888
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:23,270
It'll wipe out our entire
defence system.

889
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:26,256
We blow an EMP inside,
then we lose the dock.

890
01:13:26,463 --> 01:13:29,842
Sir, we already lost the dock.

891
01:13:32,636 --> 01:13:35,347
Open the gate.

892
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:37,029
Gate 3 is not responding!

893
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,831
We've taken critical
damage, sir!

894
01:13:40,103 --> 01:13:42,372
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

895
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:53,449
There's the exit.

896
01:13:53,658 --> 01:13:54,228
On my mark,

897
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:56,529
give me full power 90 degrees
to lower-left starboard.

898
01:13:57,537 --> 01:13:59,497
Full power,

899
01:13:59,706 --> 01:14:00,975
ninety degrees.

900
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:07,865
Now!

901
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:19,475
Hold on, baby.

902
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,480
Goddamn, woman,
you can drive.

903
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:28,150
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

904
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:31,079
Sentinels are inside the dock.

905
01:14:32,363 --> 01:14:33,533
Are we too late?

906
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,771
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

907
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:09,442
Get me the one
closest to Gate 3.

908
01:15:36,552 --> 01:15:37,720
Reload!

909
01:15:37,929 --> 01:15:40,640
He's pissing metal.

910
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:45,645
Go!

911
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:01,493
Go!

912
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:25,143
Heads up!
They're coming around!

913
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:37,599
Behind you!

914
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:52,930
It's jammed!

915
01:16:59,344 --> 01:17:01,671
Forget it, kid!
Get out of here!

916
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,106
Got it!

917
01:17:33,377 --> 01:17:36,672
Captain Mifune.

918
01:17:38,382 --> 01:17:40,635
Oh, no.

919
01:17:40,844 --> 01:17:43,555
They're coming.

920
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:47,225
They're coming.

921
01:17:47,434 --> 01:17:49,018
The "Hammer".

922
01:17:49,226 --> 01:17:50,811
What?

923
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:54,356
You have to open that gate.

924
01:17:54,565 --> 01:17:57,694
Cut the counterweights.

925
01:17:58,403 --> 01:18:00,404
You can do it.

926
01:18:00,613 --> 01:18:04,199
Hurry. There's no time.

927
01:18:04,408 --> 01:18:06,034
Captain...

928
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:10,038
I didn't finish
the training program.

929
01:18:11,957 --> 01:18:15,043
Neither did I.

930
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:38,318
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

931
01:18:38,525 --> 01:18:41,613
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

932
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,367
Come on, someone, please.

933
01:18:59,514 --> 01:19:00,750
Keep the weight forward.

934
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:06,720
Light as a feather,
as a feather.

935
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,069
Commander,
holographic reports

936
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,371
Captain Mifune's APU is
up and moving to Gate 3.

937
01:19:19,692 --> 01:19:21,296
Don't over-squeeze
the trigger.

938
01:19:32,497 --> 01:19:34,457
Captain Mifune's APU just
reached Gate 3.

939
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,661
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

940
01:19:38,168 --> 01:19:41,922
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

941
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:44,500
Mifune...
this is Lock.

942
01:19:45,592 --> 01:19:48,430
I don't know if you can
hear me, but if you can...

943
01:19:48,637 --> 01:19:51,349
<i>the Hammer's two minutes away.</i>

944
01:19:51,557 --> 01:19:55,229
<i>You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.</i>

945
01:19:57,354 --> 01:19:59,106
Link.

946
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:01,474
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

947
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:39,216
Do it, kid.

948
01:20:43,902 --> 01:20:46,180
Neo. I believe.

949
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:59,042
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

950
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,712
We ain't come this far?

951
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,885
Almost home, almost home.

952
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:36,119
Burn it, Link!

953
01:22:00,936 --> 01:22:03,939
- You did it.
- No.

954
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:05,751
We did it.

955
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:09,654
You're a hell of a pilot.

956
01:22:10,904 --> 01:22:14,283
Some things in this
world never change.

957
01:22:14,492 --> 01:22:15,970
But some things do?

958
01:22:17,453 --> 01:22:19,163
Luckily...

959
01:22:19,372 --> 01:22:22,708
some things do.

960
01:22:33,011 --> 01:22:34,720
Link!

961
01:22:34,929 --> 01:22:38,015
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

962
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:46,899
I knew you'd come.
I knew it.

963
01:22:47,108 --> 01:22:50,569
I made a promise.

964
01:22:57,868 --> 01:23:00,747
You did wear it.

965
01:23:01,122 --> 01:23:06,002
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

966
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:16,261
Three captains, one ship.

967
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:17,893
I assume the other ships
were lost

968
01:23:17,894 --> 01:23:20,029
under equally pointless
circumstances.

969
01:23:20,641 --> 01:23:22,226
It's good to see you too,
Jason.

970
01:23:22,435 --> 01:23:24,449
The Council's waiting to hear
your explanation.

971
01:23:24,451 --> 01:23:26,039
You forgive me for
not attending,

972
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:28,240
but I have to try to
salvage this debacle.

973
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:30,979
Did I miss something
Commander?

974
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,319
I thought we just
saved the dock.

975
01:23:32,569 --> 01:23:34,405
That's the problem
with you people.

976
01:23:34,613 --> 01:23:37,283
You can't think for five
minutes in front of your face.

977
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:39,640
That EMP knocked out almost
every piece of hardware

978
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,640
and every APU.

979
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:42,000
If I were the machines,

980
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:44,001
I'd send every sentinel
I had here right now.

981
01:23:44,498 --> 01:23:46,167
Saved the dock, captain?

982
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:48,461
You just handed it to
them on a silver platter.

983
01:23:53,882 --> 01:23:55,045
Come on, get it cut.

984
01:23:57,595 --> 01:23:58,864
The bridge is clear.

985
01:24:01,306 --> 01:24:02,527
Do you hear that?

986
01:24:05,603 --> 01:24:07,104
Get that cable run!

987
01:24:07,313 --> 01:24:08,981
I want the system back online!

988
01:24:09,023 --> 01:24:11,609
Commander, it's the dock.
We've got incoming.

989
01:24:12,444 --> 01:24:14,779
Order everyone to fall back.

990
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:18,240
Seal the shaft. Now.

991
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:19,319
Move it!

992
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:25,640
Oh, my god.

993
01:24:33,297 --> 01:24:35,425
- All clear.
- Do it.

994
01:24:35,632 --> 01:24:39,304
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

995
01:24:54,152 --> 01:24:56,654
Your move.

996
01:24:56,863 --> 01:24:58,864
So you gave them your ship?

997
01:24:59,073 --> 01:25:00,715
That is correct, councillor, I did.

998
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,115
Knowing what he planned
to do with it?

999
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:07,457
And The Oracle said
nothing of this?

1000
01:25:07,664 --> 01:25:09,555
She told me that Neo
would need my help,

1001
01:25:09,555 --> 01:25:12,244
and when the time came I would
choose to help him or not.

1002
01:25:12,545 --> 01:25:15,166
But what hope can
a single vessel have

1003
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:17,067
against their entire
defence system?

1004
01:25:17,175 --> 01:25:20,345
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

1005
01:25:20,552 --> 01:25:22,539
He wouldn't even
take any ammunition.

1006
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:24,783
He was totally out of
his goddamn mind.

1007
01:25:24,858 --> 01:25:29,270
No, he wasn't.

1008
01:25:29,686 --> 01:25:33,565
Neo is doing what he
believes he must do.

1009
01:25:33,774 --> 01:25:35,586
I don't know if what
he's doing is right.

1010
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:36,587
I don't know...

1011
01:25:37,194 --> 01:25:39,780
if he'll reach the machine city.

1012
01:25:39,988 --> 01:25:44,368
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

1013
01:25:44,577 --> 01:25:46,100
But I do know that

1014
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,600
as long as there is
a single breath in his body,

1015
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,837
he will not give up.

1016
01:25:54,045 --> 01:25:57,047
And neither can we.

1017
01:26:02,011 --> 01:26:03,247
Temperature's dropping.

1018
01:26:07,015 --> 01:26:07,985
Here we go.

1019
01:26:47,806 --> 01:26:50,726
We're over the fields,
aren't we?

1020
01:26:50,935 --> 01:26:52,811
How do you know that?

1021
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:56,399
I can feel them.

1022
01:27:03,614 --> 01:27:05,867
Over there.

1023
01:27:06,076 --> 01:27:08,520
There's our path.
Can you see it?

1024
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:09,820
Three lines.

1025
01:27:10,162 --> 01:27:12,247
Power lines.

1026
01:27:12,457 --> 01:27:15,667
Follow them.

1027
01:27:31,141 --> 01:27:32,976
What are they doing?

1028
01:27:33,185 --> 01:27:35,604
I don't know.

1029
01:27:35,814 --> 01:27:38,233
Lieutenant?

1030
01:27:52,831 --> 01:27:54,416
Goddamn it.

1031
01:27:54,623 --> 01:27:57,292
What do we do now,
Commander?

1032
01:28:00,546 --> 01:28:03,132
It is now a matter of time.

1033
01:28:03,341 --> 01:28:06,970
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

1034
01:28:07,177 --> 01:28:08,654
I recommend that
the Council join

1035
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:12,266
the rest of the non-military
personnel inside the Temple.

1036
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:13,935
How long do we have?

1037
01:28:14,144 --> 01:28:18,314
Two hours. Maybe less.

1038
01:28:18,648 --> 01:28:20,529
My men have begun
fortifying the entrance

1039
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:23,235
with enough artillery to
make our last stand.

1040
01:28:24,738 --> 01:28:27,532
Beyond that, there isn't
anything more I can do.

1041
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:30,029
Commander, do you think
that we have any chance...

1042
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,030
of surviving?

1043
01:28:32,912 --> 01:28:33,731
If I were you Councillor,

1044
01:28:33,733 --> 01:28:35,432
I wouldn't ask me
that question.

1045
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,542
I would ask him.

1046
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:39,836
Why?

1047
01:28:39,836 --> 01:28:43,046
Because he's the one
who believes in miracles.

1048
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,931
There.
Those mountains.

1049
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:55,643
That's it.

1050
01:28:58,354 --> 01:29:00,523
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

1051
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:03,359
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

1052
01:29:03,568 --> 01:29:06,654
We'll make it.

1053
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:11,367
We have to.

1054
01:30:23,273 --> 01:30:26,400
Sentinels.

1055
01:30:36,252 --> 01:30:37,505
There's too many!

1056
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:56,264
Gotcha!

1057
01:30:56,472 --> 01:30:57,740
Come on, Neo,
I need help here!

1058
01:30:57,742 --> 01:30:58,742
I can't beat them.

1059
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:01,269
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

1060
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:05,899
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

1061
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,411
Then up we go.

1062
01:31:43,435 --> 01:31:46,773
Beautiful.

1063
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:11,213
Pump the igniter.
The ship will start.

1064
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:21,140
Again. Slowly.

1065
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,226
Now!

1066
01:32:49,668 --> 01:32:50,572
Trin?

1067
01:32:53,256 --> 01:32:55,324
Trinity?

1068
01:32:56,134 --> 01:32:57,819
Trinity?

1069
01:32:58,927 --> 01:33:01,014
- I'm here.
- Where?

1070
01:33:01,221 --> 01:33:03,891
Here.

1071
01:33:12,984 --> 01:33:15,612
We made it.

1072
01:33:15,862 --> 01:33:19,239
You said we would.

1073
01:33:20,074 --> 01:33:23,286
It's unbelievable, Trin.

1074
01:33:23,494 --> 01:33:25,287
Light everywhere.

1075
01:33:25,497 --> 01:33:28,832
Like the whole thing
was built of light.

1076
01:33:29,042 --> 01:33:32,670
I wish you could see
what I see.

1077
01:33:32,878 --> 01:33:36,298
You've already
shown me so much.

1078
01:33:37,132 --> 01:33:41,637
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

1079
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:45,766
I can't go with you, Neo.

1080
01:33:46,016 --> 01:33:47,976
I've gone as far as I can.

1081
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:49,497
What?

1082
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,199
Oh, no.

1083
01:33:54,775 --> 01:33:57,028
Oh, no. No, no.

1084
01:33:57,237 --> 01:34:00,323
It's all right.

1085
01:34:00,323 --> 01:34:03,283
It's time.

1086
01:34:03,451 --> 01:34:06,954
I've done all that
I could do.

1087
01:34:07,162 --> 01:34:10,082
Now you have to do
the rest.

1088
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:12,502
You have to finish it.

1089
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:15,171
You have to save Zion.

1090
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:17,297
I can't.

1091
01:34:17,506 --> 01:34:21,176
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

1092
01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:23,930
You will.

1093
01:34:24,139 --> 01:34:28,725
I believe it.
I always have.

1094
01:34:29,728 --> 01:34:32,814
Trinity.

1095
01:34:33,648 --> 01:34:38,528
Trinity, you can't die.

1096
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:41,322
You can't.

1097
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:43,073
You can't.

1098
01:34:43,283 --> 01:34:46,869
Yes, I can.

1099
01:34:48,579 --> 01:34:52,500
You brought me back once.

1100
01:34:53,251 --> 01:34:56,796
But not this time.

1101
01:35:01,176 --> 01:35:04,554
Do you remember,

1102
01:35:04,887 --> 01:35:09,266
on that roof,
after you caught me,

1103
01:35:09,391 --> 01:35:12,645
the last thing I said to you?

1104
01:35:13,938 --> 01:35:16,565
You said, "I'm sorry".

1105
01:35:16,774 --> 01:35:20,360
I wish I hadn't.

1106
01:35:21,945 --> 01:35:25,699
That was my last thought.

1107
01:35:26,658 --> 01:35:30,204
I wished
I had one more chance

1108
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:34,083
to say what really mattered.

1109
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:39,506
To say how much
I loved you.

1110
01:35:40,465 --> 01:35:45,302
How grateful I was for every
moment I was with you.

1111
01:35:46,637 --> 01:35:49,360
But by the time I knew how to
say what I wanted to,

1112
01:35:49,362 --> 01:35:50,761
it was too late.

1113
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:01,610
But you brought me back.

1114
01:36:03,029 --> 01:36:06,740
You gave me my wish.

1115
01:36:08,618 --> 01:36:14,082
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

1116
01:36:17,335 --> 01:36:20,671
Kiss me.

1117
01:36:22,172 --> 01:36:25,426
Once more,

1118
01:36:25,676 --> 01:36:28,512
kiss me.

1119
01:36:54,497 --> 01:36:55,920
Get that ammunition
where it belongs!

1120
01:36:55,921 --> 01:36:57,421
You got one chance
to get this right.

1121
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:02,463
Get that damn thing mounted!

1122
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:10,012
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1123
01:37:23,484 --> 01:37:24,944
Neo...

1124
01:37:25,153 --> 01:37:29,032
If you're gonna do something,
you better do it quick.

1125
01:39:36,367 --> 01:39:38,411
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

1126
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:41,516
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try to stop you.

1127
01:39:46,711 --> 01:39:48,462
Speak.

1128
01:39:48,671 --> 01:39:51,591
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

1129
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,314
Soon he will spread
through this city

1130
01:39:53,315 --> 01:39:54,815
as he spread through
the Matrix.

1131
01:39:55,386 --> 01:39:58,139
You can not stop him.

1132
01:39:58,847 --> 01:40:01,975
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

1133
01:40:02,185 --> 01:40:05,354
We need nothing!

1134
01:40:05,563 --> 01:40:07,265
If that's true,
then I've made a mistake,

1135
01:40:07,265 --> 01:40:08,666
and you should kill me now.

1136
01:40:14,572 --> 01:40:17,699
What do you want?

1137
01:40:17,908 --> 01:40:20,619
Peace.

1138
01:40:44,978 --> 01:40:48,398
What are they doing?

1139
01:40:52,484 --> 01:40:55,947
What are you doing?

1140
01:40:57,657 --> 01:41:01,077
Morpheus!

1141
01:41:23,932 --> 01:41:27,395
And if you fail?

1142
01:41:28,145 --> 01:41:31,608
I won't.

1143
01:41:51,668 --> 01:41:53,171
Neo.

1144
01:41:53,378 --> 01:41:54,500
He fights for us.

1145
01:42:36,756 --> 01:42:39,634
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1146
01:42:39,842 --> 01:42:43,430
We missed you.

1147
01:42:46,099 --> 01:42:49,394
You like what I've done
with the place?

1148
01:42:49,601 --> 01:42:52,063
It ends tonight.

1149
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:55,233
I know it does.
I've seen it.

1150
01:42:55,442 --> 01:42:59,194
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show,

1151
01:42:59,203 --> 01:43:04,408
because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

1152
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:58,189
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson,

1153
01:44:58,398 --> 01:45:00,734
closing in on you?

1154
01:45:00,942 --> 01:45:04,237
Oh, I can.

1155
01:45:04,445 --> 01:45:08,533
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life

1156
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:12,578
that taught me the
purpose of all life.

1157
01:45:12,787 --> 01:45:17,751
The purpose of life is to end.

1158
01:48:52,215 --> 01:48:54,050
Why, Mr. Anderson?

1159
01:48:54,259 --> 01:48:58,179
Why, why, why?

1160
01:48:58,387 --> 01:49:00,180
Why do you do it?

1161
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,266
Why? Why get up?

1162
01:49:02,475 --> 01:49:05,729
Why keep fighting?

1163
01:49:05,811 --> 01:49:08,472
Do you believe you're
fighting for something?

1164
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,109
For more than your survival?

1165
01:49:11,317 --> 01:49:16,072
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

1166
01:49:18,073 --> 01:49:19,826
Is it freedom or truth?

1167
01:49:20,033 --> 01:49:22,328
Perhaps peace?
Could it be for love?

1168
01:49:22,537 --> 01:49:26,166
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

1169
01:49:26,373 --> 01:49:29,519
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect

1170
01:49:29,527 --> 01:49:32,039
trying desperately
to justify an existence

1171
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:34,199
that is without meaning
or purpose!

1172
01:49:34,631 --> 01:49:38,051
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself,

1173
01:49:38,261 --> 01:49:41,579
although only a human mind
could invent something

1174
01:49:41,581 --> 01:49:43,180
as insipid as love.

1175
01:49:46,895 --> 01:49:49,015
You must be able to see it,
Mr. Anderson.

1176
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,315
You must know it by now.

1177
01:49:50,523 --> 01:49:52,994
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.

1178
01:49:56,488 --> 01:50:01,242
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

1179
01:50:02,993 --> 01:50:06,747
Because I choose to.

1180
01:51:10,228 --> 01:51:14,733
This is my world!
My world!

1181
01:51:37,963 --> 01:51:39,673
Wait.

1182
01:51:39,882 --> 01:51:43,051
I've seen this.

1183
01:51:43,261 --> 01:51:47,015
This is it. This is the end.

1184
01:51:47,265 --> 01:51:48,189
Yes.

1185
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:50,300
You were laying right there,
just like that.

1186
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:53,604
And I, I...

1187
01:51:53,813 --> 01:51:55,869
I stand here, right here,

1188
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:58,770
and I'm supposed to
say something.

1189
01:51:59,819 --> 01:52:01,404
I say:

1190
01:52:01,613 --> 01:52:06,576
"Everything that has
a beginning has an end, Neo."

1191
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:19,088
What?
What did I just say?

1192
01:52:22,966 --> 01:52:28,305
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1193
01:52:34,311 --> 01:52:35,939
Get away from me!

1194
01:52:36,146 --> 01:52:38,274
What are you afraid of?

1195
01:52:38,483 --> 01:52:40,109
It's a trick.

1196
01:52:40,318 --> 01:52:43,279
You were right, Smith.

1197
01:52:43,488 --> 01:52:46,865
You were always right.

1198
01:52:48,701 --> 01:52:51,829
It was inevitable.

1199
01:53:22,152 --> 01:53:25,154
Is it over?

1200
01:53:54,768 --> 01:53:57,145
Oh, no, no, no.

1201
01:53:57,353 --> 01:54:00,273
No, it's not fair.

1202
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:56,954
It is done.

1203
01:55:27,402 --> 01:55:31,155
It doesn't make sense.

1204
01:55:33,658 --> 01:55:35,909
He did it.

1205
01:55:36,118 --> 01:55:38,412
He saved us.

1206
01:55:38,621 --> 01:55:41,166
He saved us.

1207
01:55:41,373 --> 01:55:44,627
It's over! He did it!
He did it!

1208
01:55:44,836 --> 01:55:46,128
He did it! It's over!

1209
01:55:46,337 --> 01:55:48,797
It's over! He did it!
He did it!

1210
01:55:49,006 --> 01:55:52,529
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1211
01:55:52,539 --> 01:55:54,136
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1212
01:55:54,345 --> 01:55:56,264
The machines are gone.

1213
01:55:56,472 --> 01:56:01,269
The war is over, sir.
The war is over.

1214
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:04,730
Zion! Zion!

1215
01:56:04,939 --> 01:56:06,815
Zion, it's over!

1216
01:56:07,024 --> 01:56:08,484
It's over!

1217
01:56:08,693 --> 01:56:11,320
The war is over!

1218
01:56:11,529 --> 01:56:15,783
The war is over!

1219
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:38,972
I have imagined this moment,

1220
01:56:39,181 --> 01:56:42,935
for so long.

1221
01:56:45,354 --> 01:56:48,608
Is this real?

1222
01:56:55,907 --> 01:56:59,536
Neo, wherever you are,

1223
01:56:59,743 --> 01:57:03,206
thank you.

1224
01:57:45,789 --> 01:57:48,417
Good morning.

1225
01:58:08,188 --> 01:58:12,317
Well, now.
Ain't this a surprise.

1226
01:58:12,524 --> 01:58:14,652
You played a very
dangerous game.

1227
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:17,529
Change always is.

1228
01:58:17,738 --> 01:58:22,202
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1229
01:58:22,409 --> 01:58:26,081
As long as it can.

1230
01:58:27,916 --> 01:58:31,377
What about the others?

1231
01:58:31,586 --> 01:58:32,561
What others?

1232
01:58:32,871 --> 01:58:35,381
The ones that want out.

1233
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:38,051
Obviously, they will be freed.

1234
01:58:38,259 --> 01:58:39,886
I have your word?

1235
01:58:40,095 --> 01:58:45,307
What do you think I am?
Human?

1236
01:58:57,862 --> 01:59:00,948
Oracle!

1237
01:59:06,246 --> 01:59:08,372
We were afraid we
might not find you.

1238
01:59:08,581 --> 01:59:11,542
Everything's okay now.

1239
01:59:11,751 --> 01:59:13,877
Look, look.

1240
01:59:14,087 --> 01:59:16,965
Just look at that.

1241
01:59:17,172 --> 01:59:20,551
Beautiful.

1242
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:23,345
Did you do that?

1243
01:59:23,555 --> 01:59:25,849
For Neo.

1244
01:59:26,056 --> 01:59:28,016
That's nice.

1245
01:59:28,225 --> 01:59:30,353
I know he'd love it.

1246
01:59:30,561 --> 01:59:32,939
Will we ever see him again?

1247
01:59:33,148 --> 01:59:35,859
I suspect so.

1248
01:59:36,067 --> 01:59:39,237
Someday.

1249
01:59:42,573 --> 01:59:44,324
Did you always know?

1250
01:59:44,533 --> 01:59:48,121
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1251
01:59:48,328 --> 01:59:51,623
But I believed.

1252
01:59:51,832 --> 01:59:55,712
I believed.
