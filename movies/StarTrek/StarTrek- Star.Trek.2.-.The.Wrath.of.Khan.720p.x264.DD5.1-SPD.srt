00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:38,195
Captain's Log:
Stardate 8130.3.

2
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:41,198
Starship Enterprise
on training mission

3
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,284
to Gamma Hydra,
Section 14,

4
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:46,286
coordinates 22-87-4.

5
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:50,040
Approaching neutral zone.

6
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:53,210
All systems normal
and functioning.

7
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,712
Leaving Section 14
for Section 15.

8
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,714
Stand by.

9
00:03:57,797 --> 00:04:01,301
Project parabolic course
to avoid entering neutral zone.

10
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,302
Aye, Captain.

11
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:06,473
Course change projected.

12
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:07,974
Captain,
I'm getting something

13
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,392
on the distress channel.

14
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:11,061
On speakers.

15
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,312
Imperative.

16
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,064
This is Kobayashi Maru.

17
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:18,652
We've struck a gravitic mine
and have lost power.

18
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:21,655
Our hull is penetrated
and we have sustained...

19
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,074
This is the starship
Enterprise.

20
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:26,576
Your message
is breaking up.

21
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,537
Can you give us your
coordinates?

22
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:32,082
Our position is Gamma Hydra,
Section 10.

23
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,084
In the neutral zone.

24
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,335
Hull penetrated.

25
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,337
Life support
systems failing.

26
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,964
Can you assist us,
Enterprise?

27
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:41,091
Data on Kobayashi Maru.

28
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:44,511
Vessel is third-class
neutronic fuel carrier,

29
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:46,930
crew of 81,300 passengers.

30
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:49,349
Damn.

31
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:55,021
Mr. Sulu,
plot an intercept course.

32
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:58,942
May I remind you that if the starship
enters the zone...

33
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,862
I'm aware of my responsibilities,
mister.

34
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:09,536
Estimating two minutes
to intercept.

35
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,875
Now entering
the neutral zone.

36
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,627
Warning.
We have entered neutral zone.

37
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,630
We are now in violation
of treaty, Captain.

38
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,132
Stand by,
transporter room,

39
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,134
ready to beam
survivors aboard.

40
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,720
Captain,
I've lost their signal.

41
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:30,223
Alert. Three Klingon cruisers
bearing 3-1-6 mark 4,

42
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:31,475
closing fast.

43
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,559
Visual.

44
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,147
Battle stations.
Activate shields.

45
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:39,483
Shields activated.

46
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,152
Tell them we're
on a rescue mission.

47
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,820
They're jamming
the frequencies.

48
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,989
Klingons on attack course
and closing.

49
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,491
We're over our heads.

50
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,993
Mr. Sulu,
get us out of here.

51
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:51,578
I'll try, Captain.

52
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:54,414
Alert. Klingon torpedoes
activated. Alert.

53
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:55,499
Evasive action.

54
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:02,422
Engineering, damage report.

55
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,007
Main energizer hit,
Captain.

56
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,509
Engage auxiliary power.

57
00:06:05,592 --> 00:06:07,177
Prepare to return fire.

58
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,513
Aah!

59
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,515
Shields collapsing,
Captain.

60
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,103
Fire all phasers.

61
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:19,606
No power
to the weapons, Captain.

62
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:25,946
Captain, it's no use.

63
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,782
We're dead in space.

64
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:30,784
Activate escape pods.

65
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,869
Send out the log buoy.

66
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,371
All hands abandon ship.

67
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,373
All right, open it up.

68
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:47,717
Any suggestions, Admiral?

69
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,553
Prayer, Mr. Saavik.

70
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:52,055
The Klingons
don't take prisoners.

71
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,557
Lights.

72
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:55,559
Blowers on.

73
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,396
Captain.

74
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:07,737
Trainees,
to the briefing room.

75
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:10,574
Maintenance Crew,
report to bridge simulator.

76
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:14,911
Maintenance Crew,
report to bridge simulator.

77
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:16,580
Physician, heal thyself.

78
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:20,000
Is that all?
What about my performance?

79
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,835
I'm not
a drama critic.

80
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:26,506
Staying with
a sinking ship?

81
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,592
Permission
to speak candidly, sir.

82
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,676
Granted.

83
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,180
This was not a fair test
of my abilities.

84
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:34,181
Why not?

85
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:37,684
Because there was
no way to win.

86
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:40,687
A no-win situation
is always possible.

87
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,190
Has that never
occurred to you?

88
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,192
No, sir, it has not.

89
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:48,195
Dealing with death
is at least as important

90
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,197
as dealing with life.

91
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:53,200
That thought had not
occurred to me.

92
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,036
Now you have something new
to think about.

93
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,204
Carry on.

94
00:07:57,287 --> 00:08:00,207
Engineering Cadets,
assemble on C Level.

95
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:05,378
Admiral, why not put
an experienced crew on the ship?

96
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,380
Galloping around the cosmos

97
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,217
is a game for the young.

98
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,636
Now, what does that mean?

99
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:20,227
Aren't you dead?

100
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,731
I assume you're
loitering around here

101
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:28,235
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets.

102
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,737
I am understandably curious.

103
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:33,240
They destroyed
the simulator room

104
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,158
and you with it.

105
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:37,160
The Kobayashi Maru
scenario

106
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:40,664
frequently wreaks havoc with students
and equipment.

107
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:44,167
You took the test
three times yourself.

108
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,670
Your final solution
was unique.

109
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,880
That was its virtue.

110
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:52,676
Oh, by the way,
thank you for this.

111
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:56,179
I know of your fondness
for antiques.

112
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:59,266
"It was the best of times,

113
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:02,352
it was the worst of times."

114
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:03,854
Message, Spock?

115
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,940
None that I know.
Except, of course, happy birthday.

116
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:09,192
Surely the best of times.

117
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:10,277
Captain Spock,

118
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,196
space shuttle leaving
in 15 minutes.

119
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,824
Where are you off to?

120
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:19,077
The Enterprise,
to check in before your inspection.

121
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,620
And you?

122
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:23,623
Home.

123
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:42,142
Bless me, Doctor,
what beams you

124
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:45,145
into this neck
of the woods?

125
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:47,147
Beware Romulans
bearing gifts.

126
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,109
Happy birthday, Jim.

127
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,611
Thanks.

128
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:56,156
Romulan ale.

129
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,658
Why, Bones,
this is illegal.

130
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:01,161
I only use it
for medicinal purposes.

131
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:04,164
I got aboard a ship
that brings it in.

132
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,750
Now, don't be a prig.

133
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,084
2283.

134
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:12,172
Well, it takes this stuff
a while to ferment.

135
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,174
Here, give me.

136
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,676
Now, you open this one.

137
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,678
I'm almost afraid to.

138
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:21,681
What is it?
Klingon aphrodisiacs?

139
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:23,141
No.

140
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:27,270
Bones, this is...

141
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:28,814
charming.

142
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,774
For most patients
your age,

143
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,026
I'd recommend
Retinax 5.

144
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,778
I'm allergic
to Retinax.

145
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,404
Exactly. Cheers!

146
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,031
Cheers.

147
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,290
Ahh.

148
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:49,042
Happy birthday.

149
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,380
I don't know
what to say.

150
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,340
You could say thank you.

151
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:56,883
Thank you.

152
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:04,724
Damn it, Jim,
what the hell's the matter with you?

153
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,061
Why are we treating your birthday
like a funeral?

154
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:11,064
Bones, I don't want
to be lectured.

155
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,066
What the hell
do you want?

156
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:19,573
This is not about age,
and you know it.

157
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:22,576
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console

158
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:25,662
when you want to be
out there hopping galaxies.

159
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:27,581
Spare me
your poetry.

160
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,583
We all have
assigned duties.

161
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,084
Bull!

162
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:34,921
You're hiding- hiding behind
rules and regulations.

163
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:36,590
From whom?

164
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:39,009
From yourself, Admiral.

165
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,016
Don't mince words, Bones.

166
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:48,518
What do you really think?

167
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:59,029
Jim, I'm your doctor,
and I'm your friend.

168
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,031
Get back your command.

169
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:04,034
Get it back
before you turn

170
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,536
into part
of this collection,

171
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,290
before you
really do grow old.

172
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:30,560
Starship Log:
Stardate 8130.4.

173
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:33,480
Log entry
by First Officer Pavel Chekov.

174
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,400
Starship Reliant on orbital approach
to Ceti Alpha VI

175
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:40,487
in connection
with Project Genesis.

176
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,906
We are searching
for a lifeless planet

177
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,908
to use as a test site

178
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:46,409
for the Genesis experiment.

179
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:47,911
So far, no success.

180
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,412
Standard orbit, please.

181
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,999
Mr. Beach, any change
in the surface scan?

182
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,501
Negative.

183
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:57,504
Limited atmosphere
dominated by kraylon gas,

184
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:59,506
sand, high-velocity winds.

185
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,175
incapable of supporting life forms.

186
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,512
Does it have to be
completely lifeless?

187
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:07,514
Have you found something?

188
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:11,017
We picked up
a minor energy flux

189
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,019
on one dynoscanner.

190
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:15,021
Damn. Are you sure?

191
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:18,024
Maybe the scanner's
out of adjustment.

192
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:22,028
I suppose it could be a particle
of preanimate matter

193
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,030
caught in the matrix.

194
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:27,534
Get on the Comm-pic
to Dr. Marcus.

195
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,035
Aye, sir.

196
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,038
Maybe it's something
we can transplant.

197
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:35,041
You know what she'll say.

198
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,543
Let me get this straight-

199
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,044
something you can transplant?

200
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,963
Yes, Doctor.

201
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,048
Something you can transplant?

202
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,552
I don't know.

203
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:49,306
But it may only be
preanimate matter.

204
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,725
Then again, it may not.

205
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:55,729
There can't be
so much as a microbe,

206
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,731
or the show's off.

207
00:13:57,814 --> 00:14:01,151
Have a look.
If it can be moved-

208
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:03,403
You bet, Doctor.
we're on our way.

209
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:11,578
Well, don't have kittens.
Genesis will work.

210
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,081
They'll remember you
with Newton, Einstein, Surak.

211
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:18,084
Thanks. No respect
from my offspring.

212
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,086
Par for the course.

213
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,590
You teaming up
with me for bridge?

214
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,091
Maybe.

215
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,093
What is it?

216
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:30,096
Whenever we deal
with Starfleet,

217
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,098
I get nervous.

218
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:34,601
We are dealing
with something

219
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:38,522
that could be perverted
into a dreadful weapon.

220
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:41,024
Remember that overgrown Boy Scout

221
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:43,026
you hung around with?

222
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,529
Jim Kirk
was many things,

223
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:49,032
but he was never
a boy scout.

224
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:53,870
Captain Terrell,
standby to beam down.

225
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,553
Chekov,
are you sure

226
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:12,222
these are
the correct coordinates?

227
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:15,058
Captain, this is
the garden spot

228
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,060
of Ceti Alpha VI.

229
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:20,564
I can barely see it.

230
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:31,575
There's nothing here.

231
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:34,578
The tricorder
must be broken.

232
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,844
Chekov, over here.

233
00:15:57,517 --> 00:16:00,437
Those look like
cargo carriers.

234
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:12,032
Hey, give me a hand.

235
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,322
What the hell happened?

236
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:54,324
If they crashed,

237
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:57,410
where's the rest
of the ship?

238
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,092
What the hell is that?

239
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,440
Botany Bay?

240
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,777
Botany Bay!

241
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,613
Oh, no!

242
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,867
We've got to leave now!

243
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,368
What about-

244
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,370
Never mind that. Hurry!

245
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,873
Chekov, what's wrong
with you?

246
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,040
Chekov?

247
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,294
Come on! Hurry!

248
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:03,810
Starship Reliant
to Captain Terrell.

249
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,271
This is Commander Kyle.

250
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:08,732
Will you please
respond, Captain?

251
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,236
Captain Terrell,
respond, please.

252
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:20,702
Let's give them
a little more time.

253
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:55,695
Khan.

254
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,379
I don't know you.

255
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,471
But you...

256
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:25,058
I never forget a face.

257
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:26,977
Mr...

258
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:30,147
Chekov.

259
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:32,941
Isn't it?

260
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:38,488
I never thought
to see your face again.

261
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,490
Chekov,
who is this man?

262
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,492
A criminal, Captain.

263
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:45,954
A product of 20th-century
genetic engineering.

264
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:48,915
What do you want?
I demand to be-

265
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:53,336
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

266
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,839
I, on the other hand,

267
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:59,342
am in a position
to grant nothing.

268
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:02,846
What you see
is all that remains

269
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:06,016
of the ship's company
and crew

270
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:08,018
of the Botany Bay,

271
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:12,355
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

272
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:15,275
Listen,
you men and women-

273
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,360
Captain, Captain.

274
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:22,324
Save your strength,
Captain.

275
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,784
These people had sworn

276
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:28,205
to live and die
at my command

277
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:30,874
200 years
before you were born.

278
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:36,880
Do you mean he never
told you the tale?

279
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:38,882
To amuse your Captain?

280
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:40,383
No?

281
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:42,803
Never told you

282
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:45,388
How the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay

283
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:48,892
lost in space
from the year 1996,

284
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:52,813
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?

285
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,065
I've never even met
Admiral Kirk.

286
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:56,399
Admiral?

287
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,776
Admiral.

288
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:00,320
Admiral.

289
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,910
Never told you

290
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:11,414
how Admiral Kirk
sent 70 of us into exile

291
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:13,917
on this barren sand heap

292
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,839
with only the contents
of these cargo bays

293
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,006
to sustain us?

294
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,844
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V,
there was life.

295
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,345
A fair chance-

296
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:27,430
This is Ceti Alpha V!

297
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:37,774
Ceti Alpha VI exploded

298
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,778
six months after
we were left here.

299
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:44,322
The shock
shifted the orbit

300
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:46,283
of this planet,

301
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:49,119
and everything
was laid waste.

302
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:51,788
Admiral Kirk
never bothered to check

303
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:54,291
on our progress.

304
00:21:57,878 --> 00:22:00,297
It was only the fact

305
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,799
of my genetically
engineered intellect

306
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,302
that allowed us
to survive.

307
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,308
On earth...

308
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:15,312
200 years ago...

309
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:19,816
I was a prince...

310
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,737
with power over millions.

311
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,822
Captain Kirk
was your host.

312
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,324
You repaid
his hospitality

313
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,076
by trying
to steal his ship

314
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:31,620
and murder him.

315
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:45,342
You didn't expect
to find me.

316
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:49,679
You thought
this was Ceti Alpha VI.

317
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,349
Ahh.

318
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:56,102
Why are you here?

319
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:07,531
Why?

320
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:16,873
Allow me
to introduce you

321
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,875
to Ceti Alpha V's

322
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,629
only remaining
indigenous life form.

323
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:34,975
What do you think?

324
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,311
It killed
20 of my people...

325
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,400
including my beloved wife.

326
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:01,251
Oh, not all at once.

327
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:09,092
And not instantly,
to be sure.

328
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:21,855
You see,

329
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,858
their young enter
through the ears

330
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,861
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

331
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:31,865
This has the effect
of rendering the victim

332
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:36,453
extremely susceptible
to, uh...suggestion.

333
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:42,292
Later, as they grow...

334
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:46,213
follows madness...

335
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:48,882
and death.

336
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,809
Khan, listen to me.

337
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:03,146
These are pets,
of course.

338
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:09,820
Not quite domesticated.

339
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:11,238
Khan,

340
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:15,075
Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty.

341
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,086
Aah!

342
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:31,591
Aaaahh!

343
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,771
That's better.

344
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:51,027
Now, tell me,
why are you here?

345
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:53,530
And tell me

346
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:58,034
where I may find
James Kirk.

347
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,039
Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's shuttle.

348
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:04,541
You're cleared for docking.

349
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:07,043
Approach portside
torpedo bay.

350
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:13,550
Enterprise, this is
Admiral Kirk's party on final approach.

351
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:16,470
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

352
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,319
I hate inspections.

353
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:38,074
I'm delighted.
Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.

354
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm glad you're at the helm
for three weeks.

355
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,589
These kids
can't steer.

356
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:10,774
Open the air lock.

357
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:13,777
Permission to come aboard.

358
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,947
You're welcome.
You know my training crew.

359
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,199
Certainly they know you.

360
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:22,619
We've been through
death and life together.

361
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:28,792
Mr. Scott, you old space dog,
you're well.

362
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,294
I had a wee bout, sir,

363
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:33,797
but Dr. McCoy
pulled me through.

364
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,799
Wee bout of what?

365
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,801
Shore leave, Admiral.

366
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:41,304
Who do we have here?

367
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:45,308
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
Engineer's Mate, sir.

368
00:27:45,308 --> 00:27:47,811
First training voyage,
Mr. Preston?

369
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:48,812
Yes, sir.

370
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:50,147
I see.

371
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:53,817
Shall we start
with the engine room?

372
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:56,319
We'll see you there.
Everything is in order.

373
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,823
That'll be a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Scott.

374
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:03,493
I'll see you
on the bridge, Admiral.

375
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,912
Company, dismissed.

376
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:59,466
Well, Mr. Scott,
are your cadets capable

377
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:01,968
of handling
a minor training cruise?

378
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:02,969
Give the word, Admiral.

379
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:04,971
The word is given.

380
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:06,473
Aye, sir.

381
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:09,893
What about the rest
of the inspection?

382
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,408
This is
Starfleet operations.

383
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:27,410
Enterprise is clear
for departure.

384
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:29,496
Admiral on the bridge.

385
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:40,423
Running lights on.

386
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,929
Very well,
Mr. Saavik.

387
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:48,431
You may clear
all moorings.

388
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,684
Aye, sir.

389
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,436
All moorings are cleared,
Captain.

390
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,688
Thank you.

391
00:29:58,358 --> 00:29:59,442
Lieutenant,

392
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:04,698
have you piloted a starship
out of space dock?

393
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:05,949
Never, sir.

394
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,462
Take her out,
Mr. Saavik.

395
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:21,965
Aye, sir.

396
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:32,976
For everything there is
a first time, Lieutenant.

397
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,978
Don't you agree, Admiral?

398
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:35,979
Uh-huh.

399
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,981
Aft thrusters,
Mr. Sulu.

400
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:40,317
Aft thrusters.

401
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,985
Would you like
a tranquilizer?

402
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,488
Add 1 /4 impulse power.

403
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:47,491
Add 1 /4 impulse power.

404
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,980
We are free
to navigate.

405
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:02,399
Course heading, Captain?

406
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:04,484
Captain's discretion.

407
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,069
Mr. Sulu,

408
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:09,656
you may...
indulge yourself.

409
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,075
Aye, sir.

410
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:40,270
Does that
about do it?

411
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:42,272
I doubt
we could squeeze

412
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:45,358
any more information
into the memory banks.

413
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,860
We'll design
a bigger one.

414
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:48,361
Who would build it?

415
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:49,863
Dr. Marcus,
Comm-pic coming in

416
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:52,115
on the hyperchannel.

417
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,618
It's the starship Reliant.

418
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:57,037
On the screen, Jedda.

419
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,955
Come in, please.

420
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,459
This is the Reliant
callingRegula-1.

421
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:05,462
Repeat,
this is U.S.S. Reliant.

422
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:07,464
Commander, we are receiving.

423
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:09,466
This is Regula-1 .

424
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:11,468
Ah, Dr. Marcus. Good.

425
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,470
We're en route to you

426
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:17,474
and should be there
in three days.

427
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:20,477
We weren't expecting you
for three months.

428
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,562
Has something happened?

429
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:26,483
No. Ceti Alpha VI
has checked out.

430
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:28,985
Then why
are you coming-

431
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:30,821
We have new orders.

432
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:33,990
All materials
of Project Genesis

433
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:37,077
will be transferred
to this ship

434
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,913
fortesting
on Ceti Alpha VI.

435
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,916
Who do they
think they are?

436
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,086
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

437
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:48,839
I have my orders.

438
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:51,925
Pin him down, mother.
Who gave the order?

439
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,262
The order comes from...

440
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:59,850
Admiral James T. Kirk.

441
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:01,852
I knew it!

442
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:03,770
The military's
been waiting

443
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:06,773
to get
their hands on it.

444
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:09,276
I have no intention
of allowing Reliant

445
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,777
or any unauthorized personnel

446
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:12,529
access to our work.

447
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:15,615
I am sorry
that you feel that way.

448
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,702
Admiral Kirk's orders
are confirmed.

449
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:21,538
Please prepare
to deliver Genesis to us

450
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,039
upon our arrival.

451
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:24,124
Reliant out.

452
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:29,296
Well done, Commander.

453
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:32,799
You realize, sir,
they will attempt

454
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:34,801
to contact Admiral Kirk

455
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,720
and confirm the order.

456
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,234
Hold, please.

457
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:55,155
Thank you, sir.

458
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:58,575
Lieutenant,

459
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:01,661
are you wearing
your hair differently?

460
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,497
It's still regulation, Admiral.

461
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,084
May I speak, sir?

462
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,839
Self-expression
doesn't seem to be

463
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:14,841
one of your problems.

464
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:19,679
You're bothered
by your performance

465
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,264
on the Kobayashi Maru.

466
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,266
I failed to resolve
the situation.

467
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,768
There's no correct resolution.

468
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,770
It's a test
of character.

469
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:30,315
May I ask how you
dealt with the test?

470
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:34,236
You may ask.

471
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,949
That's a little joke.

472
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:42,702
Humor. It is
a difficult concept.

473
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:45,789
It is not logical.

474
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,125
We learn by doing.

475
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:51,169
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

476
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:52,629
Thank you, sir.

477
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:55,215
She change
her hair style?

478
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:56,675
I hadn't noticed.

479
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,803
Wonderful stuff,
that Romulan ale.

480
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:01,304
Admiral Kirk.

481
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:02,722
Kirk here.

482
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:04,724
I have
an urgent Comm-pic

483
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:07,227
from Space Lab
Regula-1 for you.

484
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,312
Dr. Carol Marcus.

485
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:14,401
I'll take it
in my quarters.

486
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,237
It never rains
but it pours.

487
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,240
As a physician,
you should appreciate

488
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:22,826
the dangers of reopening
old wounds.

489
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:27,080
Sorry.

490
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:29,499
Jim, can you read me?

491
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:33,170
I can hear you, Carol.
What's wrong?

492
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,673
Why are you taking
Genesis from us?

493
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,509
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

494
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:41,428
Who is taking Genesis?

495
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:45,015
I can see you,
but I can't hear.

496
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:47,851
Jim, did you
give the order?

497
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:50,353
What order?
Who's taking Genesis?

498
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:52,856
I won't let them
have Genesis

499
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:55,025
without proper authorization.

500
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:58,195
On whose authority
can they do this?

501
00:36:58,278 --> 00:36:59,988
No one's authority.

502
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,198
Jim-

503
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:03,033
Uhura, what's happening?

504
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:05,535
Transmission jammed
at the source.

505
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,538
Alert Starfleet headquarters.

506
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:10,165
Aye, sir.

507
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:13,376
I want to talk
to Starfleet command.

508
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,962
We must have order
in here.

509
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:18,381
This has to be a mistake.

510
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:20,467
Mistake.

511
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,968
We're all alone here.

512
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:25,472
They waited until everyone
was on leave.

513
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:28,433
Reliant is at our disposal,
not vice versa.

514
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:30,477
I can't believe
Starfleet-

515
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,479
I tried to tell you

516
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:35,440
scientists are always
pawns of the military.

517
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,401
Starfleet has kept peace
for 1 00 years.

518
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:41,446
I cannot subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

519
00:37:41,446 --> 00:37:43,406
You may be right, Doctor,

520
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,908
but what about Reliant?

521
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:46,827
She's on her way.

522
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,672
We have a problem.

523
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:01,508
Something may be wrong
on Regula-1 .

524
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:04,511
We've been ordered
to investigate.

525
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:05,929
If memory serves,

526
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:09,432
Regula-1 is a scientific
research laboratory.

527
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:11,434
I told
Starfleet command

528
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:14,437
all we had was
a boatload of children,

529
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:17,941
but we're the only ship
in the quadrant.

530
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:20,443
Spock, these cadets
of yours-

531
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:23,947
How will they respond
under real pressure?

532
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,449
As with all
living things,

533
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,910
each according
to his gifts.

534
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:31,955
Of course,
the ship is yours.

535
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:34,458
No, that won't
be necessary.

536
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:38,128
Just get me
to Regula-1 .

537
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:41,465
As a teacher on
a training mission,

538
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:44,468
I am content to command
the Enterprise.

539
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:46,470
If we go on duty,

540
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:49,222
the senior officer
must assume command.

541
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:51,975
It may be nothing.

542
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,977
Garbled communications.

543
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:57,481
You take the ship.

544
00:38:57,564 --> 00:39:00,484
You proceed from
a false assumption.

545
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:02,527
I am a Vulcan.

546
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:04,988
I have no ego
to bruise.

547
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,575
You're about
to remind me

548
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:10,494
logic alone
dictates your actions?

549
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,996
I would not
remind you

550
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,540
of that which
you know so well.

551
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:17,501
It was a mistake

552
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:20,003
for you to accept
promotion.

553
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:24,007
Commanding a starship
is your first, best destiny.

554
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,552
Anything else is
a waste of material.

555
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:30,597
I would not presume
to debate you.

556
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,516
That is wise.

557
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,936
In any case,
were I to invoke logic,

558
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,939
Logic dictates that the needs
of the many

559
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:41,441
outweigh the needs
of the few.

560
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:44,528
Or the one.

561
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:52,035
You're my
superior officer.

562
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:54,538
You are
also my friend.

563
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:59,209
I have been and
always shall be yours.

564
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:03,505
Stop the energizers.

565
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,549
Put me on speakers.

566
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:10,053
An emergency situation
has arisen.

567
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:12,556
By order
of Starfleet command,

568
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:16,726
I'm assuming command
of this vessel.

569
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,437
So note in Ship's Log.

570
00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:22,399
Plot a new course
for Regula-1 .

571
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:24,484
Mr. Scott.

572
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:25,944
Aye, sir.

573
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:28,822
We'll be going
to warp speed.

574
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,950
Course plotted
for Regula-1 , Admiral.

575
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,286
Engage warp engines.

576
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:36,496
Prepare for warp speed.

577
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,998
Ready, sir.

578
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:42,252
I know none of you
were expecting this.

579
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:47,340
I'm asking you to grow up
sooner than you expected.

580
00:40:47,424 --> 00:40:49,509
Warp five, Sulu.

581
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:54,264
So much for the little
training cruise.

582
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:05,192
Course to intercept
Enterprise ready, sir.

583
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,943
Excellent.

584
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:08,028
Helmsman?

585
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,113
Sir. May I speak?

586
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:18,538
We're all
with you, sir.

587
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,540
But consider this-

588
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:22,501
We are free.

589
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:27,047
We have the means
to go where we will.

590
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,549
We have escaped
permanent exile

591
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:31,551
on Ceti Alpha V.

592
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:35,013
You have proved
your superior intellect

593
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:37,974
and defeated the plans
of Admiral Kirk.

594
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:41,978
You do not need
to defeat him again.

595
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:44,981
He tasks me.

596
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:48,985
He tasks me,
and I shall have him.

597
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,989
I'll chase him
round the moons of Nibia

598
00:41:53,073 --> 00:41:56,993
and round
the Antares Maelstrom

599
00:41:57,077 --> 00:41:58,495
and round
perdition's flames

600
00:41:58,578 --> 00:42:00,997
before I give him up.

601
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,002
Prepare to alter course.

602
00:42:06,086 --> 00:42:09,965
Space Station Regula-1 ,
please come in.

603
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,509
Dr. Marcus,
please respond.

604
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:16,471
This is
Enterprise call-

605
00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:18,515
It's no use.

606
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:20,517
There's no response.

607
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,477
But no longer jammed.

608
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,521
No, sir.
No nothing.

609
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,779
There are
two possibilities-

610
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,781
they are unable
to respond,

611
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:36,700
they are unwilling
to respond.

612
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:38,452
How far?

613
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:41,496
12 hours, 43 minutes,
present speed.

614
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,959
"Give up Genesis,"
she said.

615
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:48,462
Give it up to whom?

616
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:52,466
It might help if I knew
what Genesis was,

617
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:54,509
beyond the biblical
reference.

618
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:58,472
Have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

619
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:01,475
Mr. Saavik,
you have the con.

620
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,483
Well, I've got
sickbay ready.

621
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:12,527
Please tell me
what's going on.

622
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:15,489
Computer, request
security procedure

623
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:18,909
and access to
Project Genesis summary.

624
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:22,245
Identify for retina scan.

625
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:24,498
Kirk, Admiral James T.

626
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:35,008
Security scan approved.

627
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,343
Summary, please.

628
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:42,015
Project Genesis.

629
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:44,684
A proposal
to the Federation.

630
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:46,436
Carol Marcus.

631
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,771
Yes.

632
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,940
What exactly is Genesis?

633
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:51,942
Well, put simply,

634
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:55,529
Genesis is life
from lifelessness.

635
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:59,032
It is a process
where by molecular structure

636
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:02,035
is reorganized
at the subatomic level

637
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:05,539
into life-generating matter
of equal mass.

638
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:09,042
Stage One was conducted
in the laboratory.

639
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:13,505
Stage Two will be attempted
in a lifeless underground.

640
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:17,551
Stage Three will be processed
on a planetary scale.

641
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:21,054
We intend to introduce
the Genesis device

642
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:25,058
into an area
of a lifeless space body-

643
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:28,061
a moon or other dead form.

644
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:31,064
The device is delivered,
instantaneously causing

645
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:34,067
what we call
the Genesis Effect.

646
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:37,487
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

647
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:54,004
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

648
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:57,007
capable of sustaining
whatever life forms

649
00:44:57,048 --> 00:45:00,510
we see fit
to deposit on it.

650
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:02,012
Fascinating.

651
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:04,514
The reformed moon
simulated here

652
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:06,516
represents the merest fraction

653
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,518
of the Genesis potential,

654
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:11,521
should the Federation
fund these experiments.

655
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:16,526
When we consider the problems
of population and food supply,

656
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,363
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

657
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:24,034
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you.

658
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:27,037
It literally is Genesis.

659
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:29,706
Power of creation.

660
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:33,543
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

661
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,962
The tape was made
last year.

662
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:39,132
I assume they've
reached Stage Two.

663
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:43,470
Dear Lord, do you think we're
intelligent enough to...

664
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:46,973
Suppose...
What if this were used

665
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:49,142
where life
already exists?

666
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,977
It would destroy
such life

667
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,730
in favor
of its new matrix.

668
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:55,649
Its new matrix.

669
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:58,985
Do you know
what you're saying?

670
00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:02,489
I was not evaluating
its moral implications.

671
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:05,158
As a matter
of cosmic history,

672
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:07,577
it's been easier
to destroy

673
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:09,079
than to create.

674
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:11,998
Not anymore.
Now we can do both simultaneously.

675
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:16,503
According to myth,
the earth was created in six days.

676
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:19,756
Now Genesis will do it
in six minutes.

677
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,260
Really, Dr. McCoy, you must
govern your passions.

678
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:25,762
They will be
your undoing.

679
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:27,931
Logic suggests-

680
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:31,601
My God, the man's
talking about logic.

681
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:34,104
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

682
00:46:34,187 --> 00:46:36,940
You green-blooded,
inhuman-

683
00:46:37,023 --> 00:46:40,777
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area

684
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:42,445
closing fast.

685
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:44,948
What do you
make of her?

686
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:46,950
It's one of ours.
It's Reliant.

687
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,118
Reliant?

688
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:53,206
Try the emergency channels.

689
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,629
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

690
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:18,482
Slow to 1/2 impulse power.

691
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:20,984
Let's be friends.

692
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:24,154
Slowing to 1/2
impulse power.

693
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:25,655
Reliant
in our section.

694
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:28,492
This quadrant, sir,
and slowing.

695
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:31,495
Sir, may I quote
general order 1 2?

696
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:34,498
"When communications
have not been established-"

697
00:47:34,581 --> 00:47:36,917
The Admiral is well aware

698
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,919
of the regulations.

699
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:40,921
Aye, sir.

700
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:47,427
Could their Comm system
have failed?

701
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:50,430
It would explain
many things.

702
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,933
They're requesting
communication, sir.

703
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:55,602
Let them eat static.

704
00:47:55,685 --> 00:48:00,190
They're still running
with shields down.

705
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:01,441
Of course.

706
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:04,444
We are one big happy fleet.

707
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:08,448
Ah, Kirk,
my old friend.

708
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:11,451
Do you know
the Klingon proverb

709
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:14,955
that tells us
revenge is a dish

710
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:17,457
that is best served cold?

711
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:23,213
It is very cold in space.

712
00:48:32,973 --> 00:48:34,474
This is damn peculiar.

713
00:48:36,726 --> 00:48:37,727
Yellow alert.

714
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,396
Energize defense fields.

715
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:47,404
I'm getting
a voice message.

716
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:51,491
Their chambers coil is overloading
their Comm system.

717
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:52,492
Spock?

718
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:53,660
Scanning.

719
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:55,579
Their coil emissions
are normal.

720
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,750
They still haven't raised
their shields.

721
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:02,252
Raise ours.

722
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:05,839
Shields going up.

723
00:49:05,922 --> 00:49:07,757
Lock phasers on target.

724
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:10,594
Locking phasers
on target.

725
00:49:10,677 --> 00:49:11,678
Locking phasers.

726
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:12,679
Raise shields.

727
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:13,680
Fire!

728
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,275
Aah!

729
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:30,113
Get those shields up!

730
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:31,114
Trying, sir.

731
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,722
I can't get power.

732
00:49:57,808 --> 00:49:58,809
Scotty!

733
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:01,561
Get off those channels!

734
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:03,313
Mr. Scott
on the screen.

735
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:06,399
I'm just
hanging on, sir.

736
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:08,401
The main energizer's out.

737
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:10,487
Try auxiliary power.

738
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,822
Aye, aye, sir.

739
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:12,906
Damage report.

740
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:22,415
They knew exactly
where to hit us.

741
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:25,418
Who? Who knew where
to hit us? And why?

742
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:27,003
One thing is certain.

743
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:29,506
We cannot escape
on auxiliary power.

744
00:50:31,591 --> 00:50:32,509
Visual.

745
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:36,680
Sulu, divert power
to phasers.

746
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:37,848
Too late.

747
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,266
Hang on!

748
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:52,362
Scotty, what's left?

749
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:53,864
Just the battery, sir.

750
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,867
I can have auxiliary power
in a few minutes.

751
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,369
We don't have
a few minutes!

752
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:06,543
Can you give me
phaser power?

753
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:08,295
A few shots, sir.

754
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:10,130
Not enough against
their shields.

755
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:11,631
Who the hell are they?

756
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:14,384
Admiral, the Reliant's
commander is signaling.

757
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:16,970
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

758
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,148
Put it on screen.

759
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:29,149
Admiral.

760
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:30,984
Do it!

761
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,986
While we still have time.

762
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:40,160
On screen, sir.

763
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:49,669
Khan.

764
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,923
You still remember, Admiral.

765
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:55,842
I cannot help
but be touched.

766
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:58,428
I, of course,
remember you.

767
00:51:58,512 --> 00:52:00,847
What's the meaning
of this attack?

768
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,849
Where's the crew
of the Reliant?

769
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:06,353
Surely, I have made
my meaning plain.

770
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:10,106
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

771
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,108
I deprived your ship
of power,

772
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,610
and when I swing around,

773
00:52:13,693 --> 00:52:17,030
I mean to deprive you
of your life.

774
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:19,533
But I wanted you
to know first

775
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:22,202
who it was
who had beaten you.

776
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:24,704
Khan...

777
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,626
if it's me you want,

778
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:32,212
I'll have myself
beamed aboard.

779
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:33,797
Spare my crew.

780
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,550
I make you
a counterproposal.

781
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:39,302
I'll agree
to your terms if...

782
00:52:39,386 --> 00:52:40,720
if...

783
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:42,222
in addition
to yourself,

784
00:52:42,305 --> 00:52:46,726
you hand over to me
all data and material

785
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,896
regarding the project
called Genesis.

786
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,565
Genesis? What's that?

787
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,484
Don't insult
my intelligence, Kirk.

788
00:52:54,568 --> 00:52:57,904
Give me time to recall
the data on our computers.

789
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:01,158
I give you
60 seconds, Admiral.

790
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:08,999
Clear the bridge.

791
00:53:14,504 --> 00:53:17,757
At least we know he doesn't
have Genesis.

792
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,760
Keep nodding as though
I'm still giving orders.

793
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:23,263
Mr. Saavik,
punch up the data charts

794
00:53:23,346 --> 00:53:24,681
of Reliant's
command console.

795
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:26,183
Reliant's Command?

796
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:27,184
Hurry.

797
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:28,518
The prefix code?

798
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:29,603
It's all we've got.

799
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,444
Chart's up, sir.

800
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:38,445
Admiral.

801
00:53:38,528 --> 00:53:39,946
We're finding it.

802
00:53:41,948 --> 00:53:43,033
Admiral.

803
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:46,036
Please. Please,
you've got to give us time.

804
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:47,621
The bridge is smashed.

805
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:49,122
The computer's inoperative.

806
00:53:49,122 --> 00:53:51,708
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

807
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:00,383
Damn!

808
00:54:01,802 --> 00:54:02,719
Admiral?

809
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:04,805
It's coming through
now, Khan.

810
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:12,312
Reliant's prefix number
is 1 6309.

811
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:13,814
I don't understand.

812
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:16,817
You have to learn why things work
on a starship.

813
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,820
Each ship has its own
combination code...

814
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:24,157
to prevent an enemy from doing
what we're attempting.

815
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,076
We're using
our console

816
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:29,079
to order Reliant
to lower her shields.

817
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:31,081
Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination.

818
00:54:31,164 --> 00:54:32,666
He's quite intelligent.

819
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:34,584
1 5 seconds, Admiral.

820
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:42,008
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

821
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:45,011
I've given you
no word to keep, Admiral.

822
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:48,348
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

823
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:53,019
I see your point.

824
00:54:54,354 --> 00:54:56,773
Stand by to receive
our transmission.

825
00:54:57,858 --> 00:55:00,360
Mr. Sulu,
lock phasers on target

826
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,862
and await my command.

827
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:03,196
Phasers locked.

828
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:07,284
Time's up, Admiral.

829
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:09,536
Here it comes.

830
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:11,037
Now, Mr. Spock.

831
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:20,046
Sir, our shields are dropping.

832
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:23,049
Raise them!

833
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:25,802
I can't!

834
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:30,474
Where's the override?
The override?

835
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:31,808
Fire!

836
00:55:34,394 --> 00:55:35,645
Fire!

837
00:55:40,066 --> 00:55:41,485
Fire!

838
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:42,486
Fire!

839
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:43,987
We can't, sir!

840
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:45,489
Why can't you?

841
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:48,241
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive.

842
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:49,743
We must withdraw!

843
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:50,827
No! No!

844
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:51,828
We must!

845
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:00,337
Enterprise will wait.

846
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,006
She's not
going anywhere.

847
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:12,516
Sir, you did it.

848
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:15,435
I did nothing...

849
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,438
except get caught
with my britches down.

850
00:56:18,522 --> 00:56:20,440
I must be
getting senile.

851
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:25,028
Mr. Saavik, you go right
on quoting regulations.

852
00:56:25,112 --> 00:56:26,530
Meantime, let's find out

853
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:28,532
how badly
we've been hurt.

854
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:18,415
Is the word given, Admiral?

855
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:19,916
The word is given.

856
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:23,003
Warp speed.

857
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:26,673
Aye.

858
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:45,358
He stayed at his post
when the trainees ran.

859
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:47,027
Admiral, this is Spock.

860
00:57:48,195 --> 00:57:49,446
Yes, Spock.

861
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:52,449
Engine room reports
auxiliary power restored.

862
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:54,951
We can proceed
at impulse power.

863
00:57:55,035 --> 00:57:58,038
Best speed to Regula-1 .
Kirk out.

864
00:57:58,121 --> 00:57:59,539
I'm sorry, Scotty.

865
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:05,295
Approaching Regula
at Space Lab Regula-1.

866
00:58:05,378 --> 00:58:06,797
Space Station Regula-1,

867
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,632
this is
the starship Enterprise.

868
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,133
Please come in.

869
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,640
Space Station Regula-1,
do you read?

870
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:21,895
Space Station Regula-1,
this is Enterprise.

871
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,146
Please acknowledge.

872
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:28,151
This is Enterprise.
Do you read me?

873
00:58:30,237 --> 00:58:33,657
Space Station Regula-1 ,
do you read?

874
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,408
Please come in.

875
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:36,910
There's no response, sir.

876
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:41,498
Sensors, Captain.

877
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:43,500
Scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

878
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,503
There's no way to ascertain
what's inside the station.

879
00:58:46,586 --> 00:58:50,006
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

880
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,091
Precisely.

881
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:54,010
What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

882
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:56,513
Regula is Class D.

883
00:58:56,596 --> 00:58:59,766
It consists of various
unremarkable ores,

884
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:01,768
essentially
a great rock in space.

885
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:04,271
And Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

886
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,939
A distinct possibility.

887
00:59:08,108 --> 00:59:09,109
Engineering.

888
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:10,444
Aye, sir.

889
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:14,281
Mr. Scott, do you have enough power
for transporters?

890
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:15,782
Barely, sir.

891
00:59:17,784 --> 00:59:19,286
I'm going down there.

892
00:59:19,286 --> 00:59:20,787
Khan could be
down there.

893
00:59:20,787 --> 00:59:23,290
He's been there.
Can you spare someone?

894
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,791
There may be people hurt.

895
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,293
Yeah. I can spare me.

896
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:27,794
Begging the Admiral's pardon.

897
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:29,296
General order 1 5.

898
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:31,798
"No flag officer shall beam
into a hazardous area

899
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:33,300
without armed escort."

900
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:34,885
There's no such regulation.

901
00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:40,891
All right.
Join the party.

902
00:59:40,974 --> 00:59:42,392
Mr. Spock,
the ship is yours.

903
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:44,644
Jim, be careful.

904
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:46,730
We will.

905
01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:12,422
Indeterminate life signs.

906
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:17,677
Phasers on stun.

907
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:22,599
Move out.

908
01:01:25,078 --> 01:01:25,996
Aah.

909
01:01:28,081 --> 01:01:28,999
Jim!

910
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:41,511
Well, rigor hasn't set in.

911
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:44,598
This couldn't have happened
too long ago, Jim.

912
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:45,932
Carol.

913
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:48,935
This is Enterprise
calling Space Lab Regula-1 .

914
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:50,020
Respond, please.

915
01:01:50,103 --> 01:01:53,106
Admiral. Over here.

916
01:01:53,106 --> 01:01:55,358
Dr. Marcus,
come in, please.

917
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:21,635
Oh, my God.

918
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:23,637
Please acknowledge signal.
Please-

919
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,640
Commander Uhura,
this is Lieutenant Saavik.

920
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:30,644
We're all right.
Please standby. Out.

921
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:34,397
Oh, sir,
it was Khan.

922
01:02:34,481 --> 01:02:37,400
We found him
on Ceti Alpha V.

923
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,401
Easy. Easy.

924
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:39,402
He...

925
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:44,407
he put creatures
in our bodies

926
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:47,327
to control our minds.

927
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:50,330
It's all right.
You're safe now.

928
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:52,332
Made us say lies...

929
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,834
do things...

930
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,836
but we beat him.

931
01:02:55,919 --> 01:03:00,340
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

932
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:01,842
The Captain was strong.

933
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:02,926
Captain...

934
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:05,512
where's Dr. Marcus?

935
01:03:07,013 --> 01:03:08,932
Where are the
Genesis materials?

936
01:03:09,015 --> 01:03:10,433
He couldn't find them.

937
01:03:10,517 --> 01:03:12,936
Even the data banks
were empty.

938
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:14,354
Erased?

939
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:16,356
He tortured
those people.

940
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:19,359
But none of them
would tell him anything.

941
01:03:19,443 --> 01:03:21,361
He went wild.

942
01:03:21,445 --> 01:03:23,363
He slit their throats.

943
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:27,868
He wanted to tear the place apart,
but he was late.

944
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:30,370
He had to get back
to the Reliant

945
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:32,873
in time
to blow you to bits.

946
01:03:32,956 --> 01:03:35,459
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

947
01:03:37,544 --> 01:03:39,713
Marooned
on Ceti Alpha V.

948
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:41,214
He's completely
mad, Admiral.

949
01:03:41,298 --> 01:03:44,217
He blames you for the death
of his wife.

950
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:47,220
I know what
he blames me for.

951
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,894
The escape pods
are all in place.

952
01:03:55,061 --> 01:03:57,230
Where's the transporter room?

953
01:03:57,314 --> 01:03:59,816
Did he make it
down here?

954
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,318
It was not
my impression.

955
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:03,320
He spent most
of his time

956
01:04:03,403 --> 01:04:06,323
trying to wring the information
out of the people.

957
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:07,324
Anything?

958
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:09,326
The unit's been left on,

959
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:12,245
which means nobody remained
to turn it off.

960
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:13,747
Those people back there

961
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,833
bought escape time for Genesis
with their lives.

962
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:18,835
This is not logical.

963
01:04:18,919 --> 01:04:21,338
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula,

964
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:23,840
a planetoid we know
to be lifeless.

965
01:04:25,926 --> 01:04:27,928
If Stage Two
is completed,

966
01:04:27,928 --> 01:04:29,930
it was going
to be underground.

967
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:32,933
It was going to be
underground, she said.

968
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:34,434
Stage Two of what?

969
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,270
Kirk to Enterprise.

970
01:04:37,354 --> 01:04:38,438
Spock here.

971
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,524
Captain Spock,
damage report.

972
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:43,527
Admiral,
if we go by the book,

973
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:45,028
like Lieutenant Saavik,

974
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:47,197
hours could seem
like days.

975
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,200
I read you, Captain.
Let's have it.

976
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:52,202
The situation
is grave, Admiral.

977
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:55,205
We won't have main power
for six days.

978
01:04:55,288 --> 01:04:57,707
Auxiliary power
has temporarily failed.

979
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,961
Restoration maybe possible
in two days.

980
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,546
By the book, Admiral.

981
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:05,549
Meaning you can't
even beam us back?

982
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:07,050
Not at present.

983
01:05:09,553 --> 01:05:10,637
Captain Spock...

984
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,557
if you don't hear from us
within one hour,

985
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,643
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

986
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:19,646
take the Enterprise to the nearest
star base,

987
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:22,065
and alert
Starfleet command.

988
01:05:22,149 --> 01:05:24,067
Sir, we won't
leave you behind.

989
01:05:24,151 --> 01:05:26,570
Uhura, if you don't
hear from us,

990
01:05:26,653 --> 01:05:30,073
there won't be anybody behind.
Kirk out.

991
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:33,076
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

992
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,078
If it's all the same,
Admiral,

993
01:05:35,162 --> 01:05:37,914
we'd like
to share the risk.

994
01:05:37,998 --> 01:05:39,916
Right. Let's go.

995
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:40,917
Saavik?

996
01:05:42,169 --> 01:05:44,087
Go? Where are we going?

997
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,589
Where they went.

998
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:49,759
Suppose they went nowhere?

999
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:52,762
Then this will be
your big chance

1000
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:55,265
to get away
from it all.

1001
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,127
Admiral.

1002
01:06:38,725 --> 01:06:40,310
Genesis, I presume.

1003
01:06:48,735 --> 01:06:50,237
Phasers down!

1004
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:52,906
You!

1005
01:07:00,747 --> 01:07:02,165
Where's Dr. Marcus?

1006
01:07:02,249 --> 01:07:03,667
I'm Dr. Marcus.

1007
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:04,668
Jim!

1008
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:19,266
Is that David?

1009
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:23,186
Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

1010
01:07:24,688 --> 01:07:27,190
Oh, of course he didn't.

1011
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:29,693
David, you're just
making this harder.

1012
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,695
I'm afraid
it's even harder

1013
01:07:31,778 --> 01:07:33,447
than you think, Doctor.

1014
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,031
Please...

1015
01:07:35,115 --> 01:07:36,616
don't move.

1016
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:37,784
Chekov?

1017
01:07:37,868 --> 01:07:40,287
I'm...

1018
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:41,621
sorry, Admiral.

1019
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,959
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

1020
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:52,215
I have indeed, Captain.

1021
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:53,550
You have done well.

1022
01:07:53,633 --> 01:07:56,553
I knew it.
You son of a bitch!

1023
01:07:58,388 --> 01:07:59,806
Don't move, anybody!

1024
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,141
Captain?

1025
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:02,976
We are waiting.

1026
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:04,978
What's the delay?

1027
01:08:05,061 --> 01:08:06,480
All is well, sir.

1028
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:09,149
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

1029
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:14,488
First things first, Captain.

1030
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,409
Kill Admiral Kirk.

1031
01:08:29,753 --> 01:08:32,422
Sir, it is difficult. I...

1032
01:08:32,506 --> 01:08:34,424
I try to obey, but...

1033
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:36,092
Kill him.

1034
01:08:36,176 --> 01:08:37,344
I...

1035
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:40,180
Aah!

1036
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:47,854
Kill him, Terrell, now!

1037
01:08:52,943 --> 01:08:54,194
Aah!

1038
01:08:59,116 --> 01:09:01,118
Aah!

1039
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:12,629
God sakes!

1040
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:16,216
What is it?

1041
01:09:36,653 --> 01:09:38,238
Khan, you bloodsucker!

1042
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:41,074
You'll have to do
your own dirty work now.

1043
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:43,577
Do you hear me?
Do you?

1044
01:09:45,412 --> 01:09:46,580
Kirk.

1045
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:53,086
Kirk, you're still alive,
my old friend.

1046
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:57,090
Still, "old friend."

1047
01:09:57,090 --> 01:10:00,093
You've managed to kill just about
everyone else.

1048
01:10:00,093 --> 01:10:02,095
But like
a poor marksman,

1049
01:10:02,095 --> 01:10:04,347
you keep missing
the target!

1050
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,610
Perhaps I no longer
need to try, Admiral.

1051
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:23,700
Oh, no!

1052
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:25,202
They can't take it.

1053
01:10:28,205 --> 01:10:29,122
Khan?

1054
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:36,463
Khan, you've got Genesis,

1055
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:37,881
but you don't
have me.

1056
01:10:37,964 --> 01:10:40,383
If you're going
to kill me, Khan,

1057
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:43,887
you're going to have to
come down here!

1058
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:46,973
I've done far worse
than kill you.

1059
01:10:49,643 --> 01:10:52,562
I've hurt you,

1060
01:10:52,646 --> 01:10:56,483
and I wish to go on
hurting you.

1061
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:01,738
I shall leave you
as you left me-

1062
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:04,157
as you left her-

1063
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:06,409
marooned for all eternity

1064
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:09,663
in the center
of a dead planet.

1065
01:11:11,164 --> 01:11:13,166
Buried alive.

1066
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:16,336
Buried alive.

1067
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:18,088
Khan!

1068
01:11:19,339 --> 01:11:21,800
Khan!

1069
01:11:27,264 --> 01:11:29,516
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise.

1070
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:31,768
Can you read us?

1071
01:11:31,852 --> 01:11:33,812
This is Lieutenant Saavik.
Calling Enterprise.

1072
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:35,272
Can you read us?

1073
01:11:35,397 --> 01:11:36,773
He's coming around.

1074
01:11:36,773 --> 01:11:38,608
Can you read us?

1075
01:11:40,944 --> 01:11:42,737
It's no use, Admiral.

1076
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:45,031
They're still jamming
all channels.

1077
01:11:45,115 --> 01:11:48,034
If the Enterprise followed orders,
she's long since gone.

1078
01:11:48,118 --> 01:11:51,204
If she couldn't obey,
she's finished.

1079
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:53,707
So are we,
it looks like.

1080
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:58,211
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?

1081
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:01,047
Who is Khan?

1082
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:03,049
Well, it's a long story.

1083
01:12:03,133 --> 01:12:05,594
We appear to have
plenty of time.

1084
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:10,724
Is there
anything to eat?

1085
01:12:10,849 --> 01:12:13,727
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm starved.

1086
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,230
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

1087
01:12:17,314 --> 01:12:19,566
First order
of business-survival.

1088
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:22,569
There is food
in the Genesis cave,

1089
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:25,071
enough to last
a lifetime...

1090
01:12:26,072 --> 01:12:28,033
if necessary.

1091
01:12:28,074 --> 01:12:29,993
We thought
this was Genesis.

1092
01:12:30,076 --> 01:12:31,077
This?

1093
01:12:33,413 --> 01:12:36,333
It took the Starfleet
corps of engineers

1094
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:40,337
1 0 months in space suits
to tunnel out all this.

1095
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:44,007
What we did in there,
we did in a day.

1096
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:47,260
David, why don't you show

1097
01:12:47,302 --> 01:12:48,762
Dr. McCoy
and the lieutenant

1098
01:12:48,762 --> 01:12:50,263
our idea of food?

1099
01:12:50,263 --> 01:12:52,182
We can't just sit here.

1100
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:55,435
Oh, yes, we can.

1101
01:12:55,519 --> 01:12:59,940
This is just to give us
something to do, isn't it?

1102
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:02,442
Come on.

1103
01:13:10,283 --> 01:13:11,326
Admiral?

1104
01:13:12,786 --> 01:13:16,206
As your teacher Mr. Spock
is fond to say,

1105
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:19,668
I like to think that there always
are possibilities.

1106
01:13:31,304 --> 01:13:33,723
I did what you wanted.

1107
01:13:33,765 --> 01:13:35,225
I stayed away.

1108
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:38,937
Why didn't you tell him?

1109
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:43,817
How can you
ask me that?

1110
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,319
Were we together?

1111
01:13:46,403 --> 01:13:48,738
Were we going to be?

1112
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:51,908
You had your world,
and I had mine.

1113
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:55,495
And I wanted him in mine,

1114
01:13:55,579 --> 01:13:58,498
not chasing through the universe
with his father.

1115
01:14:09,259 --> 01:14:10,260
Actually...

1116
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:14,014
he's a lot like you...

1117
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:15,974
in many ways.

1118
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:21,354
Please tell me
what you're feeling.

1119
01:14:25,776 --> 01:14:30,197
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 1 5 years

1120
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,656
who's trying to kill me.

1121
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,621
You show me a son
that would be happy to help.

1122
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:40,624
My son.

1123
01:14:45,045 --> 01:14:48,131
My life that
could have been...

1124
01:14:48,256 --> 01:14:49,633
and wasn't.

1125
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:54,387
What am I feeling?

1126
01:14:58,767 --> 01:14:59,810
Old.

1127
01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:04,648
Worn-out.

1128
01:15:11,905 --> 01:15:15,075
Let me show you something

1129
01:15:15,158 --> 01:15:18,161
that will
make you feel young

1130
01:15:18,245 --> 01:15:20,622
as when the world
was new.

1131
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,512
Impulse power restored.

1132
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:38,849
Excellent.

1133
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:41,852
More than a match
for poor Enterprise.

1134
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:05,792
You did all this
in a day?

1135
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,587
The matrix formed
in a day.

1136
01:16:08,628 --> 01:16:10,547
The life forms
grew later

1137
01:16:10,672 --> 01:16:13,800
at a substantially
accelerated rate.

1138
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,973
Jim! This is incredible!

1139
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:22,476
Have you ever
seen the like?

1140
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:26,855
Can I cook
or can't l?

1141
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:47,167
Where is she?

1142
01:16:52,589 --> 01:16:55,550
Sir, may I ask you
a question?

1143
01:16:55,592 --> 01:16:57,052
What's on your mind?

1144
01:16:57,093 --> 01:16:59,012
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

1145
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:01,598
You're asking if we're playing out
that scenario?

1146
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:03,099
On the test, sir.

1147
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:06,019
Will you tell me
what you did?

1148
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:08,021
I would really like
to know.

1149
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:12,442
Lieutenant, you're looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

1150
01:17:12,526 --> 01:17:15,445
who ever beat
the no-win scenario.

1151
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:16,780
How?

1152
01:17:16,822 --> 01:17:18,281
I reprogrammed
the simulation

1153
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:20,951
so it was possible
to rescue the ship.

1154
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:22,619
What?

1155
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:24,287
He cheated.

1156
01:17:24,371 --> 01:17:27,290
Changed the conditions
of the test.

1157
01:17:27,332 --> 01:17:30,127
Got a commendation
for original thinking.

1158
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,212
I don't like to lose.

1159
01:17:32,212 --> 01:17:35,215
Then you never faced
that situation...

1160
01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:36,299
faced death.

1161
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,219
I don't believe
in the no-win scenario.

1162
01:17:41,054 --> 01:17:42,472
Kirk to Spock.

1163
01:17:42,556 --> 01:17:44,516
It's two hours.
Are you ready?

1164
01:17:44,516 --> 01:17:47,644
Right on schedule.
Just give us your coordinates,

1165
01:17:47,686 --> 01:17:49,146
and we'll
beam you aboard.

1166
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:50,147
All right.

1167
01:17:53,859 --> 01:17:55,735
I don't like to lose.

1168
01:17:55,735 --> 01:17:57,237
We were immobilized.

1169
01:17:57,237 --> 01:18:00,073
Captain Spock said
it would be two days.

1170
01:18:00,115 --> 01:18:01,575
You go by the book.

1171
01:18:01,575 --> 01:18:03,076
Spock, you know Dr. Marcus.

1172
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:04,077
Of course.

1173
01:18:04,077 --> 01:18:05,579
Hello, Mr. Spock.

1174
01:18:05,579 --> 01:18:06,997
I'm taking them
to sickbay.

1175
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,498
By the book?

1176
01:18:08,582 --> 01:18:11,126
By the book.
Regulation 46a-

1177
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:14,254
"If transmissions are being
monitored during battle...

1178
01:18:14,337 --> 01:18:16,798
no uncoded messages
on an open channel."

1179
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,969
You lied.

1180
01:18:22,345 --> 01:18:23,263
I exaggerated.

1181
01:18:23,346 --> 01:18:24,931
Hours instead of days.

1182
01:18:25,015 --> 01:18:27,934
Now we have minutes
instead of hours.

1183
01:18:31,188 --> 01:18:32,606
They're inoperative
below C-Deck.

1184
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:34,107
What is working
around here?

1185
01:18:34,191 --> 01:18:36,651
Not much, Admiral.
We have partial main power.

1186
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:37,527
That's it?

1187
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:39,780
Best we can do
in two hours.

1188
01:18:58,215 --> 01:18:59,966
Admiral on the bridge.

1189
01:19:00,091 --> 01:19:00,967
Battle stations.

1190
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:04,971
Tactical.

1191
01:19:07,557 --> 01:19:08,558
Uh-oh.

1192
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:14,064
She can still outrun us
and outgun us,

1193
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:17,567
But there is the Mutara Nebula
at 153 mark 4.

1194
01:19:17,651 --> 01:19:19,653
Scotty, can we make it inside?

1195
01:19:19,736 --> 01:19:22,239
The energizer's bypassed
like a Christmas tree,

1196
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,741
so don't give me
too many bumps.

1197
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:26,201
No promises.
On your way.

1198
01:19:26,243 --> 01:19:27,744
Trouble with
the nebula, sir,

1199
01:19:27,744 --> 01:19:29,746
is all that static
discharging gas

1200
01:19:29,788 --> 01:19:31,248
clouds our
tactical display.

1201
01:19:31,248 --> 01:19:34,251
Visual won't function,
and shields will be useless.

1202
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:38,004
Sauce for the goose,
Mr. Saavik.

1203
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:41,258
The odds will be even.

1204
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,460
Alley clear, sir.

1205
01:20:17,961 --> 01:20:19,337
Repairing second.

1206
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:21,298
Ready to fire away 1 .

1207
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:29,890
There she is!

1208
01:20:29,973 --> 01:20:32,058
There she is.

1209
01:20:32,142 --> 01:20:34,644
Ahh.

1210
01:20:34,728 --> 01:20:38,565
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

1211
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:40,150
So much the better.

1212
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:09,596
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

1213
01:21:11,473 --> 01:21:13,183
Reliant is closing.

1214
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:26,029
If they go in there,
we'll lose them.

1215
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:27,781
Explain it to them.

1216
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,626
That was close.

1217
01:21:39,626 --> 01:21:42,254
They just don't want us
going in there.

1218
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,888
One minute
to nebula perimeter.

1219
01:21:51,972 --> 01:21:53,473
Why are we slowing?

1220
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:57,811
We daren't follow them
into the nebula, sir.

1221
01:21:57,853 --> 01:21:59,813
Our shields
would be useless.

1222
01:22:02,607 --> 01:22:04,985
They are reducing speed.

1223
01:22:05,068 --> 01:22:06,736
Uhura, patch me in.

1224
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:08,655
Aye, sir.

1225
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,157
You're on, Admiral.

1226
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,826
This is Admiral Kirk.

1227
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:15,328
We tried it once
your way, Khan.

1228
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:17,497
Are you game
for a rematch?

1229
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:19,332
Khan.

1230
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:23,420
I'm laughing at
the superior intellect.

1231
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,841
Full impulse power.

1232
01:22:27,924 --> 01:22:29,342
No, sir!

1233
01:22:29,426 --> 01:22:32,429
You have Genesis.
You can have whatever you-

1234
01:22:32,429 --> 01:22:34,014
Full power!

1235
01:22:34,097 --> 01:22:35,390
Damn you!

1236
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:43,607
I'll say this for him-
he's consistent.

1237
01:22:45,108 --> 01:22:48,111
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

1238
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:58,205
Emergency lights.

1239
01:23:20,644 --> 01:23:21,812
Oh!

1240
01:23:28,819 --> 01:23:29,694
Tactical.

1241
01:23:31,905 --> 01:23:33,073
Inoperative.

1242
01:23:36,743 --> 01:23:38,245
Raise the shields.

1243
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:42,332
As I feared, sir-
not functional.

1244
01:23:42,415 --> 01:23:43,834
I'm reducing speed.

1245
01:24:25,959 --> 01:24:26,877
Target, sir.

1246
01:24:27,002 --> 01:24:28,462
Phaser lock
inoperative, sir.

1247
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:31,298
Best guess, Mr. Sulu.
Fire when ready.

1248
01:24:39,139 --> 01:24:40,557
Oh!

1249
01:24:40,599 --> 01:24:42,642
Aft torpedoes, fire!

1250
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:52,652
Hold your course.

1251
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:16,551
Phasers starboard!

1252
01:25:25,894 --> 01:25:27,938
Aah!

1253
01:25:27,979 --> 01:25:28,939
Fire!

1254
01:25:50,961 --> 01:25:52,462
Damage, Mr. Scott.

1255
01:25:54,464 --> 01:25:58,385
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

1256
01:25:58,468 --> 01:26:00,470
It's radiation...

1257
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:01,888
Scotty.

1258
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,306
Joachim.

1259
01:26:05,517 --> 01:26:06,560
Yours...

1260
01:26:07,978 --> 01:26:10,480
is a superior...

1261
01:26:18,321 --> 01:26:19,823
I shall avenge you.

1262
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:33,170
Could you use
another hand, Admiral?

1263
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:35,422
Man the weapons console,
Mr. Chekov.

1264
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:41,678
Spock.

1265
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:44,347
Sporadic energy readings,
port side aft.

1266
01:26:44,431 --> 01:26:46,349
Could be
an impulse turn.

1267
01:26:48,185 --> 01:26:51,438
He won't
break off now.

1268
01:26:51,521 --> 01:26:54,483
He followed me this far.
He'll be back.

1269
01:26:56,026 --> 01:26:58,779
But from where?

1270
01:26:58,862 --> 01:27:02,365
He's intelligent,
but not experienced.

1271
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:05,786
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

1272
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:13,460
Full stop.

1273
01:27:13,543 --> 01:27:14,961
Full stop, sir.

1274
01:27:16,296 --> 01:27:17,798
Z minus
10,000 meters.

1275
01:27:17,798 --> 01:27:19,299
Stand by
photon torpedoes.

1276
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,521
Torpedoes ready, sir.

1277
01:28:26,116 --> 01:28:27,200
Look sharp.

1278
01:28:31,204 --> 01:28:32,539
Fire.

1279
01:28:38,128 --> 01:28:39,045
Aah!

1280
01:28:39,129 --> 01:28:40,130
Fire.

1281
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:45,093
- Aah!
- Aah!

1282
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,725
Aah!

1283
01:29:12,829 --> 01:29:13,330
Uhura...

1284
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:14,664
Uhura...

1285
01:29:14,748 --> 01:29:17,667
send to Commander, Reliant.

1286
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:19,169
Prepare to be boarded.

1287
01:29:19,252 --> 01:29:20,170
Aye, sir.

1288
01:29:21,838 --> 01:29:24,341
Commander, Reliant.
This is Enterprise.

1289
01:29:24,341 --> 01:29:28,094
Surrender and prepare
to be boarded.

1290
01:29:28,178 --> 01:29:29,596
Enterprise to Reliant.

1291
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:32,099
You are ordered to
surrender your vessel.

1292
01:29:32,182 --> 01:29:33,100
Respond.

1293
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:46,029
Reliant. Come in, Reliant.

1294
01:29:47,197 --> 01:29:50,033
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel.

1295
01:29:50,117 --> 01:29:51,535
Enterprise to Reliant.

1296
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:54,788
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel. Respond.

1297
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,096
No, Kirk.

1298
01:30:12,681 --> 01:30:14,391
The game's not over.

1299
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:55,265
To the last
I will grapple with thee.

1300
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:11,031
Admiral.

1301
01:31:11,114 --> 01:31:14,618
Scanning an energy
source on Reliant.

1302
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:17,120
A pattern I've
never seen before.

1303
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:24,211
It's the Genesis wave.

1304
01:31:24,294 --> 01:31:25,212
What?

1305
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:28,632
They're on a build-up
to detonation.

1306
01:31:28,715 --> 01:31:29,633
How soon?

1307
01:31:29,716 --> 01:31:31,468
We encoded four minutes.

1308
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:33,970
We'll beam aboard
and stop it.

1309
01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:34,971
You can't.

1310
01:31:37,808 --> 01:31:40,727
Scotty, I need warp speed
in three minutes

1311
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:42,312
or we're all dead.

1312
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:44,981
No response, Admiral.

1313
01:31:45,065 --> 01:31:46,233
Scotty.

1314
01:31:46,316 --> 01:31:49,236
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

1315
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:50,237
Aye, sir.

1316
01:32:27,524 --> 01:32:30,527
Are you out
of your Vulcan mind?

1317
01:32:30,527 --> 01:32:33,029
No human can tolerate
the radiation in there!

1318
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:35,532
As you are so fond
of observing, Doctor,

1319
01:32:35,532 --> 01:32:37,033
I am not human.

1320
01:32:37,033 --> 01:32:39,870
You're not going in there.

1321
01:32:41,955 --> 01:32:43,707
Perhaps you're right.

1322
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:46,293
What is
Mr. Scott's condition?

1323
01:32:46,293 --> 01:32:48,295
Well, I don't think
that he-

1324
01:32:48,295 --> 01:32:49,713
I'm sorry, Doctor.

1325
01:32:49,796 --> 01:32:52,716
I have no time
to discuss this logically.

1326
01:32:56,803 --> 01:32:57,971
Remember.

1327
01:33:08,064 --> 01:33:10,817
Spock! Get out of there!

1328
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:12,068
Spock!

1329
01:33:12,152 --> 01:33:14,070
Spock, get out of there!

1330
01:33:24,998 --> 01:33:26,416
Time, from my mark.

1331
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,752
2 minutes, 10 seconds.

1332
01:33:28,835 --> 01:33:30,754
Engine room...

1333
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:31,755
what's happening?

1334
01:33:31,838 --> 01:33:34,090
Spock! Scotty...

1335
01:33:34,174 --> 01:33:36,843
Good God, man!
Get out of there!

1336
01:33:36,927 --> 01:33:37,928
No! Don't!

1337
01:33:38,011 --> 01:33:39,429
Spock! Spock!

1338
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:40,764
Don't!

1339
01:34:10,043 --> 01:34:11,711
Time.

1340
01:34:13,463 --> 01:34:15,799
3 minutes, 30 seconds.

1341
01:34:21,638 --> 01:34:23,306
Distance from Reliant.

1342
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,308
4,000 kilometers.

1343
01:34:25,392 --> 01:34:28,061
We're not going
to make it, are we?

1344
01:34:39,906 --> 01:34:41,241
No.

1345
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:45,328
No, you can't get away.

1346
01:34:47,747 --> 01:34:52,085
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

1347
01:34:53,753 --> 01:34:56,006
For hate's sake,

1348
01:34:56,089 --> 01:35:01,094
I spit my last breath
at thee.

1349
01:35:12,939 --> 01:35:15,692
Sir, the mains
are back on line.

1350
01:35:15,776 --> 01:35:17,527
Bless you, Scotty.
Go, Sulu!

1351
01:36:01,238 --> 01:36:03,740
My God, Carol,
look at it.

1352
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:16,753
Engine room.

1353
01:36:18,505 --> 01:36:20,757
Well done, Scotty.

1354
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,509
Jim...

1355
01:36:22,592 --> 01:36:25,762
I think you'd better
get down here.

1356
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:26,763
Bones?

1357
01:36:27,931 --> 01:36:29,599
Better hurry.

1358
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,271
Saavik, take the con.

1359
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:05,469
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment.

1360
01:37:05,552 --> 01:37:06,470
He'll die.

1361
01:37:06,553 --> 01:37:08,722
Sir, he's dead already.

1362
01:37:13,226 --> 01:37:14,644
It's too late.

1363
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:38,502
Spock!

1364
01:38:09,282 --> 01:38:10,367
Ship...

1365
01:38:11,868 --> 01:38:13,286
out of danger?

1366
01:38:15,038 --> 01:38:16,039
Yes.

1367
01:38:19,709 --> 01:38:22,212
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1368
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:26,299
It is logical.

1369
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,140
The needs of the many
outweigh...

1370
01:38:35,475 --> 01:38:37,310
The needs of the few...

1371
01:38:38,478 --> 01:38:39,980
Or the one.

1372
01:38:48,738 --> 01:38:53,243
I never took
the Kobayashi Maru test...

1373
01:38:54,744 --> 01:38:55,829
until now.

1374
01:38:58,331 --> 01:39:01,251
What do you think
of my solution?

1375
01:39:03,503 --> 01:39:04,588
Spock...

1376
01:39:14,514 --> 01:39:15,432
I...

1377
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,435
I have been...

1378
01:39:18,518 --> 01:39:21,021
and always
shall be...

1379
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:22,355
your friend.

1380
01:39:28,445 --> 01:39:29,946
Live long...

1381
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:32,449
and prosper.

1382
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:55,722
No.

1383
01:40:15,992 --> 01:40:18,662
We are assembled here today

1384
01:40:18,745 --> 01:40:21,665
To pay final respects
to our honored dead.

1385
01:40:27,254 --> 01:40:29,172
And yet it should be noted

1386
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:31,675
that in the midst
of our sorrow,

1387
01:40:31,758 --> 01:40:35,512
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

1388
01:40:35,512 --> 01:40:38,181
the sunrise of a new world,

1389
01:40:38,181 --> 01:40:40,350
a world
that our beloved comrade

1390
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:42,269
gave his life to protect.

1391
01:40:42,352 --> 01:40:44,104
He did not feel

1392
01:40:44,187 --> 01:40:47,107
this sacrifice a vain
or empty one,

1393
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:49,609
and we will not debate
his profound wisdom

1394
01:40:49,693 --> 01:40:51,111
at these proceedings.

1395
01:40:54,531 --> 01:40:57,451
Of my friend,
I can only say this-

1396
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:06,460
of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

1397
01:41:06,543 --> 01:41:07,961
his was the most...

1398
01:41:11,798 --> 01:41:12,716
human.

1399
01:41:14,885 --> 01:41:16,386
Honors...

1400
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,387
Hup.

1401
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:42,472
Come.

1402
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:48,145
I don't mean to intrude.

1403
01:42:49,312 --> 01:42:51,231
No, not at all.

1404
01:42:51,314 --> 01:42:53,984
I should be
on the bridge.

1405
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:56,987
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1406
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:00,323
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

1407
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:01,825
Lieutenant Saavik
was right.

1408
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,078
You never have
faced death.

1409
01:43:14,838 --> 01:43:16,256
No, not like this.

1410
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:21,762
I haven't faced death.

1411
01:43:21,845 --> 01:43:23,263
I've cheated death.

1412
01:43:26,183 --> 01:43:29,102
I've tricked my way
out of death

1413
01:43:29,186 --> 01:43:32,606
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1414
01:43:36,026 --> 01:43:37,360
I know nothing.

1415
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:39,362
You knew enough
to tell Saavik

1416
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:40,864
that how we faced death

1417
01:43:40,947 --> 01:43:45,285
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1418
01:43:45,368 --> 01:43:46,620
Just words.

1419
01:43:46,703 --> 01:43:48,121
But good words.

1420
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:52,042
That's where ideas begin.

1421
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:54,544
Maybe you should
listen to them.

1422
01:43:57,047 --> 01:43:58,965
I was wrong about you...

1423
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:01,551
and I'm sorry.

1424
01:44:04,554 --> 01:44:06,973
Is that what
you came here to say?

1425
01:44:08,892 --> 01:44:09,810
Mainly.

1426
01:44:16,566 --> 01:44:18,735
And also that I'm...

1427
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:21,154
proud.

1428
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:25,158
Very proud...

1429
01:44:25,242 --> 01:44:26,660
to be your son.

1430
01:44:56,273 --> 01:44:59,943
Captain 's Log. Stardate 8141.6.

1431
01:45:00,026 --> 01:45:02,946
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

1432
01:45:03,029 --> 01:45:05,949
to pick up the crew
of U.S.S. Reliant.

1433
01:45:06,032 --> 01:45:07,451
All is well.

1434
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:09,953
And yet
I can't help wondering

1435
01:45:10,036 --> 01:45:12,205
about the friend
I leave behind.

1436
01:45:14,374 --> 01:45:17,210
,'There are always
possibilities, ,'Spock said.

1437
01:45:17,294 --> 01:45:20,297
And if Genesis is indeed

1438
01:45:20,297 --> 01:45:22,215
life from death...

1439
01:45:23,467 --> 01:45:26,470
I must return
to this place again.

1440
01:45:30,807 --> 01:45:32,225
He's really not dead...

1441
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,979
as long as
we remember him.

1442
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:44,988
It's a far, far
better thing I do

1443
01:45:45,071 --> 01:45:47,491
than I have
ever done before.

1444
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:54,164
A far better
resting place I go to

1445
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:56,249
than I have ever known.

1446
01:45:56,333 --> 01:45:57,834
Is that a poem?

1447
01:45:57,834 --> 01:45:58,835
No.

1448
01:46:00,086 --> 01:46:02,506
Something Spock was trying
to tell me

1449
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:04,007
on my birthday.

1450
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:05,842
You OK, Jim?

1451
01:46:07,677 --> 01:46:09,096
How do you feel?

1452
01:46:12,015 --> 01:46:12,933
Young.

1453
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:19,022
I feel young.

1454
01:47:31,845 --> 01:47:35,932
Space,
the final frontier.

1455
01:47:36,016 --> 01:47:38,602
These are
the continuing voyages

1456
01:47:38,685 --> 01:47:42,939
of the starship Enterprise.

1457
01:47:43,023 --> 01:47:45,275
Her ongoing mission,

1458
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:49,529
to explore
strange, new worlds,

1459
01:47:49,613 --> 01:47:55,368
to seek out new life forms
and new civilizations,

1460
01:47:55,368 --> 01:47:59,873
to boldly go
where no man has gone...

1461
01:47:59,956 --> 01:48:01,708
