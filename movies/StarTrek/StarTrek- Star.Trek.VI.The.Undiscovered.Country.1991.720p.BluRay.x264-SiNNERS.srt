1
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:36,337
Stardate 9521.6.

2
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:39,549
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.

3
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,593
Hikaru Sulu commanding.

4
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:43,636
After three years,

5
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:47,056
I've concluded my first assignment
as master of this vessel,

6
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,977
cataloguing gaseous planetary
anomalies in Beta Quadrant.

7
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:56,190
We're heading home
under full impulse power.

8
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:59,235
I am pleased to report
that ship and crew have functioned well.

9
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,489
According to this, we've completed
our survey of the entire sector.

10
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:18,087
I have an energy wave
at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.

11
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,339
Visual.

12
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,801
My God.

13
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,223
Shields. Shields!

14
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,361
She's not answering her helm.

15
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,613
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.

16
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,739
Aye.

17
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,119
Quarter impulse power.

18
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,129
Damage report.

19
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:01,422
Checking all systems, Captain.

20
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,806
Don't tell me
that was any meteor shower.

21
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,099
Negative, sir.

22
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:15,937
The subspace shockwave
originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.

23
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,397
Location...

24
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,400
It's Praxis, sir. It's a Klingon moon.

25
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:23,736
Praxis is their key
energy production facility.

26
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,366
Send to Klingon High Command.

27
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,285
"This is Excelsior,
a Federation starship.

28
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:34,998
"We have monitored
a large explosion in your sector.

29
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,250
"Do you require assistance?"

30
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,169
-Aye, sir.
-Mr. Valtane, any more data?

31
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:42,964
Yes, sir. I've confirmed
the location of Praxis, but...

32
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,257
What is it?

33
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,343
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

34
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:48,720
Onscreen.

35
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Magnify.

36
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,807
Computer enhancement.

37
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,354
-Praxis?
-What's left of it, sir.

38
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,857
Captain,
I'm getting a message from Praxis.

39
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,442
Let's have it.

40
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:19,292
This is Brigadier Kerla
speaking for the High Command.

41
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:22,920
There has been an incident on Praxis.

42
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:28,468
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.

43
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:34,557
Obey treaty stipulations
and remain outside the neutral zone.

44
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,852
This transmission ends now.

45
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,731
"An incident"?

46
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:44,942
-Do we report this, sir?
-Are you kidding?

47
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,202
What are we doing here?

48
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,245
Maybe they're throwing us
a retirement party.

49
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,415
-That suits me. I just bought a boat.
-This had better be good.

50
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,376
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar
at the Academy.

51
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,921
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?

52
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,589
If we're all here, where's Sulu?

53
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:10,134
Captain Sulu. On assignment.
Where's Spock?

54
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:23,481
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.

55
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,197
As you were.

56
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,578
To break this information down
succinctly,

57
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:41,374
the Klingon Empire
has roughly 50 years of life left to it.

58
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,294
For full details,
I'm turning this briefing over

59
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,755
to the Federation's special envoy.

60
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:01,811
Good morning.

61
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,648
Two months ago, a Federation starship
monitored an explosion

62
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,817
on the Klingon moon Praxis.

63
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,611
We believe it was caused
by over-mining

64
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:13,489
and insufficient safety precautions.

65
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:17,577
The moon's decimation means
the deadly pollution of their ozone.

66
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:19,787
They will have depleted
their supply of oxygen

67
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,456
in approximately 50 Earth years.

68
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,668
Due to their enormous military budget,

69
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,670
the Klingon economy does not have
the resources

70
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,423
with which to combat this catastrophe.

71
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,344
Last month, at the behest
of the Vulcan ambassador,

72
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,808
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

73
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:44,979
He proposes to commence negotiations
at once.

74
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,356
Negotiations for what?

75
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:52,361
The dismantling of our space stations
and starbases along the neutral zone,

76
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:55,698
an end to almost 70 years
of unremitting hostility,

77
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,826
which the Klingons can no longer afford.

78
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:02,997
Bill, are we talking
about mothballing the Starfleet?

79
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:06,459
Well, I'm sure that our exploration
and scientific programs

80
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,795
-would be unaffected, Captain, but...
-I must protest.

81
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,217
To offer Klingons safe haven
within Federation space is suicide.

82
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:17,553
Klingons would become
the alien trash of the galaxy,

83
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:19,263
and if we dismantle the fleet,

84
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:21,974
we'd be defenseless
before an aggressive species

85
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,060
with a foothold on our territory.

86
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:27,563
The opportunity here
is to bring them to their knees.

87
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:32,485
Then we'll be in a far better position
to dictate terms.

88
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,278
Sir?

89
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,697
Captain Kirk.

90
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:39,533
The Klingons
have never been trustworthy.

91
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,912
I'm forced to agree
with Admiral Cartwright.

92
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,997
This is a terrifying idea.

93
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,335
It is imperative that we act now
to support the Gorkon initiative

94
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,463
lest more conservative elements
persuade his empire

95
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:56,634
that it is better to attempt
a military solution and die fighting.

96
00:09:56,802 --> 00:10:00,137
You, Captain Kirk,
are to be our first olive branch.

97
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,225
We have volunteered to rendezvous
with the Klingon vessel

98
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,602
which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon
to Earth

99
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:10,064
and to escort him safely
through Federation space.

100
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,148
Me?

101
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:14,485
Well, there are Klingons who feel
the same way about the peace treaty

102
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:17,071
as yourself and Admiral Cartwright,

103
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,742
but they'll think twice about attacking
the Enterprise under your command.

104
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:25,496
I have personally vouched for you
in this matter, Captain.

105
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:29,041
You have personally vouched?

106
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:34,755
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon
full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.

107
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,716
But a full ambassador
would be better equipped...

108
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:39,051
If there's no further business,

109
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:43,597
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

110
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,392
I remind you, this meeting is classified.

111
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:56,235
I don't know whether
to congratulate you or not, Jim.

112
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,904
I wouldn't.

113
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,493
We volunteered?

114
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:10,458
There is an old Vulcan proverb,
"Only Nixon could go to China."

115
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,377
How could you vouch for me?

116
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,922
That's arrogant presumption.

117
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,175
My father requested
that I open negotiations...

118
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,136
I know your father's the Vulcan
ambassador, for heaven's sake,

119
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,680
but you know how I feel about this.

120
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,391
They're animals.

121
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:31,771
Jim, there is an historic opportunity
here.

122
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,523
Don't believe them. Don't trust them.

123
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:37,610
-They are dying.
-Let them die.

124
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:46,202
Has it occurred to you that this crew
is due to stand down in three months?

125
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:49,205
We've done our bit for king and country.

126
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:51,916
You should have trusted me.

127
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,884
Control, this is SD-103,
approach to spacedock. Over.

128
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:05,554
SD-103, you are clear
to deliver Captain Kirk and party

129
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,308
to NCC-1701 Alpha. Over.

130
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,023
Captain on the Bridge.

131
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:19,193
-As you were, Lieutenant...
-Valeris, sir.

132
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:22,405
We were told that you needed
a helmsman, so I volunteered.

133
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,658
Lieutenant, it is agreeable
to see you again.

134
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,744
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan
to be graduated

135
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,665
-at the top of her class at the academy.
-You must be very proud.

136
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,250
I don't believe so, sir.

137
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,377
She's a Vulcan, all right.

138
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:39,338
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.

139
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:41,590
-Scotty.
-Aye, sir?

140
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:42,925
Did you find the engine room?

141
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,427
Right where I left it, sir.

142
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:47,471
Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster.

143
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:49,765
Control tower reading, sir.

144
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,228
Control, this is Enterprise
requesting permission to depart.

145
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:57,857
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.

146
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,525
Thirty seconds for port gates.

147
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,235
Clear all moorings.

148
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,863
Awaiting port gates from this mark.

149
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,364
All moorings clear.

150
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,116
Aft thrusters.

151
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,910
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.

152
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,956
Captain, may I remind you
that regulations specify thrusters

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,041
only while in spacedock?

154
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,672
Jim?

155
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,552
You heard the order, Lieutenant.

156
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,721
Aye, sir.

157
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,508
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.

158
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,929
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

159
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:17,895
I could never forgive them
for the death of my boy.

160
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,983
It seems to me our mission
to escort the Chancellor

161
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:26,612
of the Klingon High Council
to a peace summit

162
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:29,448
is problematic at best.

163
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,621
Spock says this could be
an historic occasion,

164
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:37,831
and I'd like to believe him,

165
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:42,127
but how on earth can history
get past people like me?

166
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,090
Sorry.

167
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,384
You could have knocked.

168
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:52,429
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.

169
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:53,681
Right.

170
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:02,189
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.

171
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,490
You piloted well
out of spacedock, Lieutenant.

172
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:14,285
I've always wanted to try that, sir.

173
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,672
You've done well, Valeris.

174
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:30,593
As your sponsor at the academy,

175
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:33,470
I have followed your career
with satisfaction,

176
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:37,850
and as a Vulcan,
you've exceeded my expectations.

177
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,354
I do not understand this representation.

178
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:46,400
It is a depiction
from ancient Earth mythology,

179
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,320
the expulsion from Paradise.

180
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:51,989
Why keep it in your quarters?

181
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,951
It is a reminder to me
that all things end.

182
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:04,001
It is of endings that I wish to speak.

183
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,840
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.

184
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,010
Do you not recognize

185
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,390
that a turning point has been reached
in the affairs of the Federation?

186
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:24,063
History is replete
with turning points, Lieutenant.

187
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:27,232
-You must have faith.
-Faith?

188
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,569
That the universe
will unfold as it should.

189
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:35,574
-But is that logical? Surely we must...
-Logic, logic and logic.

190
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,580
Logic is the beginning
of wisdom, Valeris,

191
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:43,374
not the end.

192
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:50,214
This will be my final voyage onboard
this vessel as a member of her crew.

193
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,844
Nature abhors a vacuum.

194
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,682
I intend you to replace me.

195
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,943
I could only succeed you, sir.

196
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,034
Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge.

197
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,370
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.

198
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,330
All officers to the Bridge.

199
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,849
Captain on the Bridge.

200
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,657
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?

201
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,119
Never been this close.

202
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:07,833
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting
our signal.

203
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:19,845
-Uhura, hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.

204
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,765
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.

205
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,601
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.

206
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,853
Channel is open, Captain.

207
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,564
This is the Starship Enterprise,

208
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,025
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

209
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:35,861
This is Kronos One.

210
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,031
I am Chancellor Gorkon.

211
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,954
Chancellor, we've been ordered
to escort you

212
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,124
through Federation space
to your meeting on Earth.

213
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:50,918
Thank you, Captain.

214
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:54,296
Would you and your party
care to dine this evening

215
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,632
aboard the Enterprise with my officers,

216
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,718
as guests
of the United Federation of Planets?

217
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,722
We would be delighted to accept
your gracious invitation.

218
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:10,813
We'll make arrangements to have you
beamed aboard at 1930 hours.

219
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,106
I shall look forward to that.

220
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,908
-Well, I hope you're happy.
-Captain,

221
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:26,411
there is a supply
of Romulan ale aboard.

222
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,540
It might make the evening
pass more smoothly.

223
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,459
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.

224
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,214
Guess who's coming to dinner.

225
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:50,102
Energize.

226
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:26,638
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-Captain Kirk.

227
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,892
May I present Captain Spock,
whom I believe you know.

228
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,477
Captain, face to face at last.

229
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,148
-You have my thanks.
-Chancellor.

230
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:40,319
Gentlemen,

231
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,739
this is my daughter Azetbur,

232
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:50,495
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla,

233
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:56,209
and this is General Chang,
my chief of staff.

234
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:00,047
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.

235
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:03,508
I'm not sure how to take that.

236
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:06,970
Sincere admiration, Kirk.

237
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:10,057
From one warrior to another.

238
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,143
Right.

239
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,983
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.

240
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,545
-They all look alike.
-What about that smell?

241
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,007
You know only top-of-the-line models
can even talk...

242
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:50,639
You men have work?

243
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:52,224
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

244
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:53,892
Then snap to it.

245
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,767
I offer a toast.

246
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,770
"The undiscover'd country,"

247
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,650
the future.

248
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,694
-"The undiscover'd country."
-"The undiscover'd country."

249
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,238
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.

250
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:49,990
You've not experienced Shakespeare

251
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:52,701
until you have read him
in the original Klingon.

252
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,340
Captain Kirk,
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.

253
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,843
One of the advantages
of being 1,000 light-years

254
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,845
from Federation Headquarters.

255
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:16,475
To you, Chancellor Gorkon,
one of the architects of our future.

256
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,351
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.

257
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:24,232
Perhaps we are looking
at something of that future here.

258
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,737
Tell me, Captain Kirk,

259
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:33,325
would you be willing
to give up Starfleet?

260
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:42,584
I believe the Captain feels
that Starfleet's mission

261
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,878
has always been one of peace.

262
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,966
Far be it for me
to dispute my first officer,

263
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:51,718
but Starfleet has always been
at the fore...

264
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:53,970
Captain, there's no need
to mince words.

265
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:57,140
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.

266
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,104
General, are you fond of

267
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,356
Shakespeare?

268
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:08,610
We do believe all planets
have a sovereign claim

269
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,445
to inalienable human rights.

270
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,533
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.

271
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,327
"Human rights."

272
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,205
Why, the very name is racist.

273
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:25,377
The Federation is no more
than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.

274
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:28,380
Present company excepted, of course.

275
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:31,758
In any case,
we know where this is leading.

276
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:35,470
-The annihilation of our culture.
-That's not true.

277
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:36,847
-No?
-No.

278
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,683
"To be, or not to be."

279
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:43,728
That is the question which preoccupies
our people, Captain Kirk.

280
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:47,315
-We need breathing room.
-Earth, Hitler, 1938.

281
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,902
I beg your pardon?

282
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:56,283
Well...

283
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:02,080
I see we have a long way to go.

284
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,250
We must do this again sometime.

285
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,257
You don't trust me, do you?

286
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:15,260
I don't blame you.

287
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,681
If there is to be a brave new world,

288
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,768
our generation is going
to have the hardest time living in it.

289
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:29,816
Captain Spock.

290
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:31,693
Chancellor.

291
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,738
-Madam.
-Captain.

292
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,115
Well, most kind.

293
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,829
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.

294
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:47,876
Have we not
"heard the chimes at midnight"?

295
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:13,360
Thank God.

296
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,113
Did you see the way they ate?

297
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,075
Terrible table manners.

298
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:22,577
I doubt that our own behavior

299
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,163
will distinguish us
in the annals of diplomacy.

300
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,957
I'm going to sleep this off.

301
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,960
Please let me know if there's some
other way we can screw up tonight.

302
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:32,879
I'm going to go find
a pot of black coffee.

303
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:52,107
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon and company

304
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,025
to dinner last night.

305
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:58,863
Our manners weren't exactly
Emily Post.

306
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,116
Note to the galley,

307
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,869
Romulan ale no longer to be served
at diplomatic functions.

308
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,334
Captain Kirk, will you please
join me on the Bridge?

309
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,169
Captain Kirk?

310
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:21,553
-Captain.
-What is it?

311
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:23,388
I find this curious.

312
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:24,639
Spock, I'm really tired.

313
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:28,184
We are reading an enormous amount
of neutron radiation.

314
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:30,770
Where?

315
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:34,065
Strangely enough,
it appears to be emanating from us.

316
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,692
The Enterprise?

317
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,448
Valeris, do you know anything
about a radiation surge?

318
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:43,033
Sir?

319
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:44,200
Chekov?

320
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,911
Only the size of my head.

321
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,997
I know what you mean.

322
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:07,766
-What's happened?
-We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.

323
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,851
Torpedo Room, please confirm.

324
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,311
Have we fired?

325
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:12,604
...0-6...

326
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:14,939
-Uhura, monitor.
-Aye, sir.

327
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,399
Direct hit.

328
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,902
Confirmed, sir.

329
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,040
We've lost gravity!

330
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,264
We are betrayed!

331
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,768
This is the Bridge. Do you read?
Do you read?

332
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:53,895
Torpedo bay,
did we fire those torpedoes?

333
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,356
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory,

334
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,066
we're still fully loaded.

335
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,421
Find Chang.

336
00:29:26,387 --> 00:29:29,264
Unable to confirm or deny
firing of two photon torpedoes.

337
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,641
-Hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.

338
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:36,771
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read? Over.

339
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,691
Repeat. Kronos One...

340
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:44,881
It's very hard to make out, Captain.

341
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:48,426
There's been some weapons firing
and a lot of shouting.

342
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:49,844
She is still listing.

343
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,180
She's spinning out of control.

344
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,203
Restoring auxiliary gravity.

345
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:29,217
Have you not a shred
of decency in you, Kirk?

346
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:34,180
We come in peace,
and you blatantly defile that peace.

347
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,476
For that,
I shall blow you out of the stars.

348
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:43,815
-We haven't fired.
-Captain.

349
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:48,695
According to our databanks,
we have, twice.

350
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:51,322
Captain, they're coming about.

351
00:31:57,997 --> 00:32:01,082
-They're preparing to fire.
-Shields up, Captain?

352
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,460
-Captain, our shields.
-Shields up, Captain?

353
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:09,173
-Signal our surrender.
-Captain?

354
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:10,717
We surrender!

355
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:14,304
-This is Enterprise. We surrender.
-If they fire at us

356
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:15,847
-with our shields down...
-I repeat.

357
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:18,099
-We surrender.
-...we will not be able to respond.

358
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:20,393
Repeat. Enterprise surrenders.

359
00:32:24,523 --> 00:32:26,399
-Are we firing torpedoes?
-I wish I knew.

360
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:28,860
Well, it sure looks like it.

361
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:30,612
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.

362
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:33,114
I am responsible
for involving you in this. I will go.

363
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,617
No, I'll go. You'll be responsible
for getting me out of this.

364
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:37,785
We'll not be the instigators
of full-scale war

365
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,579
on the eve of universal peace.

366
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:41,497
I'm going, too. They may need a doctor.

367
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:43,833
-Perhaps you're right.
-Uhura, tell them we're coming,

368
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,627
and tell them we're unarmed.

369
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:46,961
Aye, sir.

370
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,093
Have you lost your mind?

371
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:55,928
I give you my word,
I don't understand what has happened.

372
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,680
We're here to help.

373
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:00,933
Follow me.

374
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:29,420
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-My God.

375
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:33,675
-What has happened here?
-You dare to feign ignorance?

376
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,844
-What happened?
-With a direct torpedo hit,

377
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:39,639
you crippled
our entire gravitational field,

378
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:43,810
and two of your Starfleet crew
beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots

379
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:44,894
and did this.

380
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:46,562
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?

381
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,356
We were until this disgrace.

382
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,275
Well, then for God sakes, man,
let me help.

383
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,330
I've got a pulse. We can move him.

384
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:07,834
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?

385
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,345
Hold him. Hold him while I stabilize him.

386
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:27,812
I said hold him.

387
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:33,609
Sweet Jesus.

388
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:37,321
-Can you...
-Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.

389
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:44,829
-His wounds are not closing.
-He's killing him!

390
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,920
He's gone into
some kind of damned arrest.

391
00:34:57,176 --> 00:35:00,303
Come on, damn it! Come on!

392
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,350
He's not responding.

393
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:29,123
Don't let it end this way, Captain.

394
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:10,122
Under article number 184
of your interstellar law,

395
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,126
I'm placing you under arrest.

396
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:19,841
You are charged with assassinating
our Chancellor of the High Council.

397
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,717
He tried to save him.

398
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:30,560
They've been arrested.

399
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,605
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.

400
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:39,443
I assume command of this ship
as of 0230 hours.

401
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:42,530
Commander Uhura,
please notify Starfleet Headquarters.

402
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,031
Tell them precisely
what has taken place

403
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:45,825
-and request instructions.
-Aye, sir.

404
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:48,494
We cannot allow them to be taken back
to Kronos as prisoners.

405
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:52,164
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them,

406
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:55,334
and an armed conflict is precisely
what the Captain wished to avoid.

407
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,587
We will be able to follow
the Captain's movements.

408
00:36:57,671 --> 00:37:01,132
-How did you achieve this, sir?
-Time is precious, Lieutenant.

409
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:04,719
We must endeavor to piece together
what happened here tonight.

410
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:08,431
According to our databank,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

411
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:09,724
No way.

412
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:13,352
I sympathize, Mr. Scott,
but we need evidence.

413
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:15,187
Please accompany me.

414
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:19,650
And if we cannot
piece together what happened?

415
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,862
-What then, sir?
-In that case, Mr. Chekov,

416
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:26,157
it resides in the purview
of the diplomats.

417
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,828
The Chancellor of the High Council
is dead!

418
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:36,500
The result of an unprovoked attack
while he travelled to see you

419
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:39,754
under a flag of truce,
on a mission of peace.

420
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,591
Captain Kirk was legally arrested
for the crime.

421
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,594
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy

422
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:49,722
boarded Kronos One
of their own free will?

423
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:52,558
None of these facts are in dispute,
Mr. President.

424
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:55,436
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.

425
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:58,272
-In the meantime...
-In the meantime,

426
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:02,610
we expect the Federation to abide
by the articles of interstellar law,

427
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,695
which you claim to cherish.

428
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,782
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial

429
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:10,117
for the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon.

430
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:11,953
Out of the question.

431
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,537
Ambassador Sarek,
there must be some way

432
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:15,414
to extradite these men.

433
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:20,628
Mr. President, I share a measure
of personal responsibility in this matter,

434
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,588
but I am obliged to confirm

435
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:25,424
my esteemed colleague's
legal interpretation.

436
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,510
What is the position
of the Romulan government,

437
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,136
Ambassador Nanclus?

438
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,765
I must concur with my colleagues.

439
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,018
But you can't possibly believe
that James Kirk assassinated

440
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:38,604
the Chancellor of the High Council.

441
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:42,274
Mr. President,
I don't know what to believe.

442
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:46,237
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.

443
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:51,617
This president is not above the law.

444
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:55,538
Report back at once. Do you copy?
At once.

445
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:57,999
Enterprise to report back on the double.

446
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,500
Do you read? At once.

447
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,252
We're to report back at once.

448
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,754
We cannot abandon
Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.

449
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,339
Of course not.

450
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,842
Four hundred years ago
on the planet Earth,

451
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:11,053
workers who felt their livelihood
threatened by automation

452
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:16,517
flung their wooden shoes called "sabot"
into the machines to stop them.

453
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:22,189
Hence the word "sabotage."

454
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,611
We are experiencing
technical malfunction.

455
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:30,072
All backup systems inoperative.

456
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:33,784
Excellent. I mean, too bad.

457
00:39:35,203 --> 00:39:36,704
Mr. President,

458
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,040
I've been named Chancellor
by the High Council

459
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:40,916
in my father's place.

460
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,668
Madam Chancellor,

461
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:45,713
you have my sincerest condolences
on your recent loss.

462
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,466
I want to assure you
that this shameful deed will not...

463
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,635
Mr. President, let us come to the point.

464
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:55,514
You want this conference
to go forward, and so did my father.

465
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,185
I will attend in one week
on one condition.

466
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:01,562
We will not extradite the prisoners,

467
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:05,900
and you will make no attempt
to rescue them in a military operation.

468
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:09,737
We would consider any such attempt
an act of war.

469
00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:12,073
We hope you'll be our guest
here on Earth.

470
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:17,203
After recent events, you will understand
if I say I prefer a neutral site,

471
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:22,666
and in the interests of security,
let us keep the location secret for now.

472
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:25,669
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.

473
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,758
Attack them now, while we still can!

474
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:34,929
Attack or be slaves in their world.

475
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:42,144
We can take whole by force,
what they propose to divide.

476
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:50,820
War is obsolete, General,
as we are in danger of becoming.

477
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:58,536
Better to die on our feet
than live on our knees.

478
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:02,289
That wasn't what my father wanted.

479
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:05,417
Your father was killed
for what he wanted.

480
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,755
The peace process will go forward.

481
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:13,092
Kirk...

482
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:21,058
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

483
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:26,438
-Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk!

484
00:41:27,649 --> 00:41:31,902
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

485
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:37,700
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

486
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:43,622
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

487
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:49,295
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

488
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,676
It's a damn show trial.

489
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,429
-Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk!

490
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:11,025
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One
without provocation.

491
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:13,736
The Chancellor and his advisers...

492
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,739
...having been lulled
into a false sense of security

493
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:20,367
by an invitation to a state dinner
aboard Captain Kirk's vessel

494
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:24,455
at precisely 1930 hours
that same evening.

495
00:42:25,123 --> 00:42:27,124
Call your first witness.

496
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:31,045
After the first shot,
we lost our gravitational field.

497
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:33,797
I found myself weightless
and unable to function.

498
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:36,967
Then two Starfleet crewmen
came walking towards me.

499
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:39,511
But perhaps they merely wore
Starfleet uniforms.

500
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:42,890
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.

501
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:47,144
Colonel Worf,
we are interested in facts, not theories.

502
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:51,065
If the gravitational unit
was not functioning,

503
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:53,067
how could these men be walking?

504
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:55,486
They appeared to be wearing
magnetic boots.

505
00:42:58,031 --> 00:42:59,531
Gravity boots.

506
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:05,829
Dr McCoy,
would you be so good as to tell me,

507
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:09,500
what is your current medical status?

508
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:14,421
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
I'd say pretty good.

509
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:24,014
You have a singular wit, Doctor.

510
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:28,686
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

511
00:43:29,145 --> 00:43:31,355
In three months, I stand down.

512
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:38,195
You know, I believe that you consumed

513
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,449
a rather generous amount
of Romulan ale in the officers' mess

514
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:44,243
on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?

515
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:46,453
-Objection!
-Sustained.

516
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:49,331
We all did. All of us.

517
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,295
-That doesn't mean...
-Was Chancellor Gorkon alive

518
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:56,297
when you first examined him?

519
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,133
-Barely.
-Now be careful, Doctor.

520
00:43:59,217 --> 00:44:06,056
Have you ever, in your past,
saved patients as barely alive as he?

521
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:09,560
I didn't have the medical knowledge
I needed for Klingon anatomy.

522
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:11,937
-I see.
-You were there.

523
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:15,441
You say you are due for retirement.

524
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:18,360
May I ask, do your hands shake?

525
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:20,487
-Objection!
-I was nervous.

526
00:44:22,574 --> 00:44:23,574
No.

527
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:26,410
You were incompetent.

528
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,372
You were incompetent!

529
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:34,752
Whether deliberately or as a result
of age combined with drink,

530
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:40,257
-the court will have to determine.
-My God, man! I tried to save him!

531
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:43,010
I tried to save him.

532
00:44:45,263 --> 00:44:47,348
I was desperate to save him.

533
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,770
He was the last best hope
in the universe for peace.

534
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:55,647
The witness is excused.

535
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:02,112
There we have it, citizens.

536
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:05,699
We have finally established
the particulars of the crime,

537
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:10,454
and now we come to the architect
of this tragic affair,

538
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,959
James Tiberius Kirk.

539
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:21,090
What would
your favorite author say, Captain?

540
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,966
"Let us sit upon the ground

541
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:25,969
"and tell sad stories
of the death of kings."

542
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:29,139
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.

543
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:34,103
Tell us that you planned to take revenge
for the death of your son.

544
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:37,398
-That's not true.
-Objection!

545
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:40,442
Captain Kirk has not been identified
as the assassin.

546
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:42,152
Sustained.

547
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:44,446
I offer into the record

548
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:48,409
this excerpt
from the Captain's personal log.

549
00:45:49,536 --> 00:45:53,414
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

550
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:58,585
I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.

551
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,716
Again. Again!

552
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:08,345
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

553
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:12,933
I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.

554
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:18,230
Are those your words?

555
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,861
Those words were spoken by me.

556
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:29,283
Objection!

557
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:32,119
My client's political views
are not on trial here.

558
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:35,205
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives

559
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,125
are indeed
at the very heart of the matter.

560
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:41,295
This officer's record
shows him to be an insubordinate,

561
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:44,673
unprincipled,
career-minded opportunist,

562
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:46,925
with a history of violating
the chain of command

563
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,469
whenever it suited him!

564
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:49,970
Continue.

565
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:52,639
Indeed, the record shows
that Captain Kirk

566
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:54,433
once held the rank of Admiral,

567
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:57,853
and that Admiral Kirk was broken
for taking matters into his own hands

568
00:46:57,937 --> 00:46:59,563
in defiance of regulations of the law.

569
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,440
Do you deny being demoted
for these charges?

570
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:04,443
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!

571
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:05,652
I cannot deny it.

572
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,321
-You were demoted?
-Yes.

573
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:11,742
-For insubordination?
-On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.

574
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:14,870
And were you obeying
or disobeying orders

575
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:18,040
when you arranged the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon?

576
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,834
I didn't know about the assassination
until we boarded the ship.

577
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:23,795
You still deny the Enterprise
fired on Kronos One?

578
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,839
-Well...
-Your Honors, please!

579
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:29,051
And you still deny your men beamed
aboard and shot the Chancellor?

580
00:47:29,135 --> 00:47:30,260
Objection!

581
00:47:30,345 --> 00:47:32,930
I cannot confirm or deny actions
I did not witness.

582
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:34,473
Captain Kirk,

583
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:38,477
are you aware
that as the captain of a starship,

584
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,731
you are required to be responsible
for the actions of your men?

585
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,652
I am.

586
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:49,988
And if it should be proved
that members of your crew

587
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:53,242
did, in fact,
carry out such an assassination...

588
00:47:53,326 --> 00:47:55,494
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...

589
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:56,578
Do not answer!

590
00:47:56,663 --> 00:47:59,957
Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.

591
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,424
As captain,

592
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:15,097
I am responsible for the conduct
of the crew under my command.

593
00:48:18,768 --> 00:48:20,936
Your Honors, the State rests.

594
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:25,357
Send to Commander Enterprise.

595
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:30,946
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "

596
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:38,203
It is the determination of this court
that the prisoners are guilty as charged.

597
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:51,758
I wish to note for the record

598
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:55,596
that the evidence against my clients
is entirely circumstantial.

599
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,725
I beg the court to consider this
when pronouncing its sentence.

600
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,435
So noted.

601
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,731
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr Leonard McCoy,

602
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:12,112
in the interest of fostering amity
for the forthcoming peace talks,

603
00:49:12,864 --> 00:49:16,366
the sentence of death is commuted.

604
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:27,127
It is the judgment of this court

605
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:32,633
that, without possibility of reprieve
or parole,

606
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,636
you be taken from this place

607
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:42,517
to the dilithium mines
on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe,

608
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:47,981
there to spend
the rest of your natural lives.

609
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:57,699
Rura Penthe?

610
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:03,955
Known throughout the galaxy
as the aliens' graveyard.

611
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,751
Better to kill them now
and get it over with.

612
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:33,276
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit
once again, please.

613
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:39,825
Hold.

614
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:43,328
It is Enterprise.

615
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:47,332
-We fired.
-That is not possible.

616
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:51,002
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.

617
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:56,133
An ancestor of mine maintained
that if you eliminate the impossible,

618
00:50:56,217 --> 00:51:00,178
whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.

619
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:02,806
What exactly does that mean?

620
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,518
It means that if we cannot
have fired those torpedoes,

621
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:08,145
someone else did.

622
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:12,357
Well, they did not fire on themselves,
and there were no other ships present.

623
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:15,068
There was
an enormous neutron energy surge.

624
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:16,194
Not from us!

625
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:20,699
A neutron surge that big
could only be produced by another ship.

626
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:23,034
Kronos One?

627
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,870
Too far away.

628
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:28,957
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

629
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,545
If there were a ship beneath us,
the Klingons would have seen her.

630
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,466
Would they?

631
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:44,181
-A bird-of-prey.
-A bird-of-prey.

632
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:48,226
Cloaked?

633
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:51,354
A bird-of-prey cannot fire
when she's cloaked.

634
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:55,108
All things being equal, Mr. Scott,
I would agree.

635
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:57,486
However, things are not equal.

636
00:51:58,154 --> 00:51:59,613
This one can.

637
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:01,656
We must inform Starfleet Command.

638
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:05,744
Inform them of what,
a new weapon that is invisible?

639
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:08,121
Raving lunatics,
that's what they'll call us.

640
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:11,416
They'll say that we're so desperate
to exonerate the Captain

641
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,084
that we'll say anything.

642
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:16,421
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence,

643
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:19,549
only a theory
which happens to fit the facts.

644
00:52:19,842 --> 00:52:22,219
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock,

645
00:52:22,762 --> 00:52:24,888
why would they fire
on their own president?

646
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:26,181
Indeed.

647
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:28,850
This ship will be searched
from bow to stern.

648
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:30,477
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.

649
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:32,938
-Aye, sir.
-I do not understand.

650
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:35,732
If there was a ship underneath us,

651
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:38,652
surely the assassins
beamed aboard from that vessel,

652
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:40,153
not Enterprise.

653
00:52:40,238 --> 00:52:42,948
You're forgetting something,
Mr. Chekov.

654
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:47,410
According to our databanks,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

655
00:52:47,912 --> 00:52:50,163
If we did, the killers are here.

656
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:54,709
If we did not,
whoever altered the databanks is here.

657
00:52:54,961 --> 00:52:58,880
In either case,
what we are looking for is here.

658
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:02,300
What are we looking for, sir?

659
00:53:03,386 --> 00:53:04,761
Lieutenant?

660
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:08,098
Two pairs of gravity boots.

661
00:54:14,123 --> 00:54:17,375
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

662
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:22,088
There is no stockade, no guard tower,

663
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,133
no electronic frontier.

664
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:29,387
Only a magnetic shield
prevents beaming.

665
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:35,310
Punishment means exile
from prison to the surface.

666
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:40,023
On the surface, nothing can survive.

667
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:48,198
Work well and you will be treated well.

668
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:52,786
Work badly and you will die.

669
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,291
Oh, my God.

670
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:29,966
The universal translator's
been confiscated.

671
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:33,136
I'm sorry?

672
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:40,769
He's definitely on about something, Jim.

673
00:56:45,816 --> 00:56:48,318
If this is your spot, we'll move on.

674
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:51,988
He wants your obedience
to the brotherhood of aliens.

675
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:54,365
-He's got it.
-And your coat.

676
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:57,160
I'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit.

677
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:13,176
Thanks.

678
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:15,887
This will help keep you warm.

679
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,725
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.

680
00:57:22,728 --> 00:57:23,853
How'd you know that?

681
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,356
We don't get many
presidential assassins.

682
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,067
-We didn't kill Gorkon.
-Of course not,

683
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,780
-but there is a reward for your death.
-It figures.

684
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:36,449
We've been set up all along.

685
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:39,369
Somebody up there
wants you out of the way.

686
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:46,876
-Nothing in here.
-Nothing here.

687
00:57:47,169 --> 00:57:48,628
-Any progress?
-None.

688
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:51,840
We have a crew of 300
turning their own quarters inside out,

689
00:57:51,924 --> 00:57:54,300
but the killers may still be among them.

690
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:57,470
Surely they have disposed
of these boots by now.

691
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:00,974
Would it not have been logical
to have left them on Gorkon's ship?

692
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:03,476
Even logic must give way to physics.

693
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:06,146
Gravity had not been restored
by the time they escaped.

694
00:58:06,522 --> 00:58:07,480
Without the boots,

695
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:10,900
they would have floated off
the Klingon transporter pads.

696
00:58:11,402 --> 00:58:13,528
Why not simply vaporize them?

697
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:17,949
Like this?

698
00:58:24,915 --> 00:58:26,207
At ease.

699
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,961
As you know, Commander Chekov,
no one can fire an unauthorized phaser

700
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:31,713
aboard a starship.

701
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,843
Suppose when they returned,
they threw the boots into the refuse.

702
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:41,306
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct,

703
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,349
those boots will cling
to the killers' necks

704
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:45,602
like a pair of Tiberian bats.

705
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:47,687
They could not
make their escape without them,

706
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:50,899
nor can they simply throw them
out the window for all to see.

707
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:55,320
-Those boots are here somewhere.
-Did someone fire off a phaser?

708
00:58:55,654 --> 00:58:58,489
It's all right. It's nothing. It's nothing.

709
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:03,453
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us
to return to port.

710
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:07,207
-Who fired that...
-Mr. Scott.

711
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,210
I understand you're having difficulty
with the warp drive.

712
00:59:10,294 --> 00:59:12,212
How much time
do you require for repair?

713
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:14,047
There's nothing wrong
with the bloody thing.

714
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:16,799
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock,

715
00:59:17,468 --> 00:59:19,177
the assassins will surely find a way

716
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:21,512
to dispose
of their incriminating footwear,

717
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:25,683
and we will never see
the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.

718
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:29,103
-It could take weeks, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. Scott.

719
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:31,397
Valeris, please inform
Starfleet Command

720
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:34,150
-our warp drive is inoperative.
-A lie?

721
00:59:34,693 --> 00:59:35,985
An error.

722
00:59:36,654 --> 00:59:41,074
You understand we have lost all contact
with the Captain and Dr McCoy.

723
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:44,327
Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded
by a magnetic shield.

724
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:48,081
However, if I know the Captain,
by this time,

725
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:50,667
he is deep into planning his escape.

726
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:17,068
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!

727
01:01:09,538 --> 01:01:11,622
-You all right, Jim?
-I think so.

728
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:14,125
-They'll respect you now.
-That's a comfort.

729
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:17,837
-I was lucky that thing had knees.
-That was not his knee.

730
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:22,133
Not everybody keeps their genitals
in the same place, Captain.

731
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,219
Anything you want to tell me?

732
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,681
Bones, why don't you see
what you can do for him?

733
01:01:28,766 --> 01:01:31,476
Let him know
we're not holding a grudge.

734
01:01:31,727 --> 01:01:33,936
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

735
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:40,443
When whoever it is makes their move,
you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

736
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:49,118
-Do you want to get out of here?
-There's gotta be a way.

737
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:13,518
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.

738
01:02:13,602 --> 01:02:17,230
-We're not finished.
-No? Speak for yourself.

739
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,692
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.

740
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:25,363
Bones, are you afraid of the future?

741
01:02:27,408 --> 01:02:32,245
I believe that was the general idea
that I was trying to convey.

742
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:34,330
I don't mean this future.

743
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:39,544
-What is this, multiple choice?
-Some people are afraid

744
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:43,339
of what might happen.

745
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:46,676
I was terrified.

746
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:49,720
What terrified you, specifically?

747
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,895
No more neutral zone.

748
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,525
I was used to hating Klingons.

749
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:09,991
It never even occurred to me
to take Gorkon at his word.

750
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:14,787
Spock was right.

751
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:19,000
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.

752
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:20,126
No.

753
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:23,546
Somebody felt a lot worse.

754
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:27,592
I'm beginning to understand why.

755
01:03:28,177 --> 01:03:31,596
Well, if you've got any bright ideas,
now's the time.

756
01:03:31,722 --> 01:03:34,891
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.

757
01:03:36,435 --> 01:03:38,978
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.

758
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:43,191
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound
to attempt another assassination.

759
01:03:45,777 --> 01:03:48,029
Unless we can get out of here.

760
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,000
Kirk, it's me, Martia.

761
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:04,420
Listen, no one has ever escaped
from Rura Penthe.

762
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,507
-Except us.
-It is possible.

763
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:12,428
-I know how to get outside the shield.
-How do we fit in?

764
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,931
Getting outside the shield is easy,

765
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,768
but after that, it's up to you to get us
off the surface before we freeze.

766
01:04:18,852 --> 01:04:20,102
Can you?

767
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:24,232
-It's possible.
-I can't make it alone,

768
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:29,695
and you're likeliest candidate
to come in this hellhole for months.

769
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,531
Candidate for what?

770
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:49,382
Go to lift seven in the morning
for mining duty.

771
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:52,593
I'll see you there. Don't disappoint me.

772
01:04:55,973 --> 01:04:59,600
-What is it with you, anyway?
-Still think we're finished?

773
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:01,435
More than ever.

774
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,776
-I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
-What is it?

775
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,070
Starfleet urgently requests
any data we have

776
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:13,614
on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

777
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:17,493
What?

778
01:05:17,828 --> 01:05:20,246
Well, apparently, they're refusing
to acknowledge signal

779
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,498
to return to spacedock, sir.

780
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:30,715
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea
location Enterprise.

781
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,842
Sir?

782
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:37,179
-You have hearing problems, mister?
-No, sir.

783
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:22,642
Klingon blood.

784
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:25,853
They must have walked through it
when it was floating

785
01:06:25,937 --> 01:06:27,938
and tracked it back here.

786
01:06:29,066 --> 01:06:32,151
This is the first evidence
which corroborates our theory.

787
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:33,486
Now we go to Starfleet.

788
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:37,198
Now we expand our search
to include uniforms.

789
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,909
All uniforms?

790
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,167
Take those out.

791
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,759
-Continue scanning.
-Nothing, sir.

792
01:06:59,638 --> 01:07:01,013
Clear, sir.

793
01:07:02,683 --> 01:07:04,975
Coming through. Coming through.

794
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:08,854
Computer well seven clear.

795
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:13,192
Nothing. Nothing.

796
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,613
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing. Nothing so far.

797
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:19,323
Sir! Sir!

798
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:54,108
-I think we've been had.
-No, you weren't, Doctor.

799
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:58,487
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.

800
01:07:58,989 --> 01:08:00,823
They don't take girls.

801
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,544
You are Crewman Dax?

802
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:16,630
Yes, Commander. What is the problem?

803
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:21,844
Perhaps you know
Russian epic of Cinderella?

804
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:27,725
If shoe fits, wear it.

805
01:08:29,644 --> 01:08:31,020
Mr. Chekov.

806
01:08:46,912 --> 01:08:48,204
Watch me.

807
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:53,834
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...

808
01:08:53,919 --> 01:08:55,544
Don't remind me.

809
01:08:58,423 --> 01:08:59,632
Get in.

810
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:13,455
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

811
01:10:31,141 --> 01:10:32,308
Hurry.

812
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:37,730
Up there.

813
01:10:40,317 --> 01:10:41,859
Come on, climb.

814
01:10:53,288 --> 01:10:55,664
Here. You'll need these. Quickly!

815
01:11:17,312 --> 01:11:18,687
Stay close.

816
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:36,724
There they are.

817
01:12:36,808 --> 01:12:39,184
They're emerging
from the beaming shield.

818
01:12:39,269 --> 01:12:41,729
-Mr. Scott, start your engines.
-Aye, aye, sir.

819
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:44,523
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.

820
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:48,318
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe
is deep inside the Klingon frontier.

821
01:12:48,778 --> 01:12:51,238
-If we are discovered...
-Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.

822
01:12:51,322 --> 01:12:54,074
What is required now
is a feat of linguistic legerdemain

823
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:56,160
and a degree of intrepidity

824
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:58,829
before the Captain and Dr McCoy
freeze to death.

825
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:08,547
-Leave me. I'm finished.
-No!

826
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:14,094
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch
on my back.

827
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:18,182
Spock slapped it there
just before we went on Gorkon's ship.

828
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:23,771
-Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
-Come on. We're in the clear.

829
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,399
Now that we're outside the shield,

830
01:13:27,484 --> 01:13:30,152
they'll be able to locate us
two sectors away.

831
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:32,488
If they're even looking for us.

832
01:14:02,352 --> 01:14:04,978
This is listening post Morska.

833
01:14:06,356 --> 01:14:08,524
What ship is that? Over.

834
01:14:20,203 --> 01:14:21,787
We must respond personally.

835
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:24,623
A universal translator
would be recognized.

836
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:36,510
We am thy freighter Ursva.

837
01:14:38,304 --> 01:14:40,389
Six weeks out of

838
01:14:41,057 --> 01:14:43,058
Kronos.

839
01:14:57,866 --> 01:14:59,992
What is your destination? Over.

840
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:07,916
We is condemning food,

841
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:13,630
things and supplies.

842
01:15:18,094 --> 01:15:21,263
Don't catch any bugs!

843
01:15:52,295 --> 01:15:55,547
Would you mind explaining
that little trick you do?

844
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:59,343
-I'm a chameloid.
-I've heard about you.

845
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:02,554
Shapeshifters.

846
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:08,227
-I thought you were mythical.
-Give a girl a chance, Captain.

847
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,066
-It takes a lot of effort.
-I don't doubt it.

848
01:16:15,652 --> 01:16:17,444
Stop me if I'm wrong,

849
01:16:17,862 --> 01:16:21,782
but do we have any way of knowing
whether this is the real you?

850
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:25,077
I thought I would assume
a pleasing shape.

851
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:35,420
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.

852
01:16:36,464 --> 01:16:37,965
If you say so.

853
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:41,510
Are you crazy?

854
01:16:41,678 --> 01:16:43,178
She didn't need our help
getting anywhere.

855
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:45,097
Where'd you get
these convenient clothes?

856
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:48,058
Don't tell me that flare
is standard prison issue.

857
01:16:48,518 --> 01:16:52,521
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.

858
01:16:52,605 --> 01:16:54,106
A full pardon,

859
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:57,150
which doesn't cover this.

860
01:16:57,235 --> 01:17:00,320
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.

861
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:04,449
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.

862
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:10,163
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.

863
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:16,128
Surprise!

864
01:17:28,141 --> 01:17:30,976
-Your friends are late.
-They'll be along.

865
01:17:34,522 --> 01:17:38,775
-I can't believe I kissed you.
-Must have been your lifelong ambition.

866
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:56,668
Isn't it about time
you became something else?

867
01:17:56,753 --> 01:17:58,295
I like it here.

868
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:10,640
Well, well, well.

869
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:20,275
What took you so long?

870
01:18:21,694 --> 01:18:25,447
-Kill him. He's the one.
-Not me, you idiot. Him!

871
01:18:28,326 --> 01:18:31,620
-No witnesses.
-Killed while trying to escape.

872
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:35,749
-Damn clever, if you ask me.
-It's a classic.

873
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:39,419
-That's what he wanted.
-Who? Who wanted us killed?

874
01:18:40,046 --> 01:18:43,965
Since you're all going to die anyway,
why not tell you?

875
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:46,009
His name is...

876
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:56,603
Damn it to hell! Of all the... Son of a...

877
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:59,064
-Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
-Captain?

878
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:01,274
He was just about to explain
the whole thing.

879
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:02,651
You want to go back?

880
01:19:02,735 --> 01:19:05,237
-Absolutely not!
-It's cold.

881
01:19:06,823 --> 01:19:09,741
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.

882
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:14,871
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.

883
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:50,907
They were beamed aboard
a Federation starship.

884
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:53,743
I could trace...

885
01:20:00,001 --> 01:20:02,085
Escaped.

886
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:07,966
Kirk cannot know the location
of the peace conference.

887
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,886
Are you sure?

888
01:20:11,554 --> 01:20:14,890
Will you take that chance?

889
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:19,436
Helmsman, make course
to intercept Enterprise.

890
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,027
The Klingons have a new weapon,

891
01:20:27,111 --> 01:20:29,029
a bird-of-prey that can fire
when cloaked.

892
01:20:29,113 --> 01:20:31,364
-She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
-So that's it.

893
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:34,075
Not entirely. I have reason to believe
that Gorkon's murderers

894
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,912
-are aboard this vessel.
-I have a thought about that.

895
01:20:36,996 --> 01:20:38,371
Has the peace conference begun?

896
01:20:38,456 --> 01:20:40,248
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.

897
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,167
-There's always something.
-Captain!

898
01:20:42,585 --> 01:20:47,047
Mr. Spock! I found the missing uniforms
with the Klingon blood on them.

899
01:21:02,438 --> 01:21:05,899
But the uniforms belong
to these two men,

900
01:21:05,983 --> 01:21:08,235
Burke and Samno.

901
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:12,239
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.

902
01:21:12,323 --> 01:21:15,534
First rule of assassination,
kill the assassins.

903
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:19,788
-Now we're back to square one.
-Can I talk to you?

904
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:25,043
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.

905
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,171
It would set off the alarm.

906
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:36,805
It's possible.

907
01:21:37,515 --> 01:21:42,978
Now hear this. Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.

908
01:21:43,187 --> 01:21:47,148
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once

909
01:21:47,233 --> 01:21:52,445
from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat. Court reporter to sickbay.

910
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,782
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken.

911
01:21:56,784 --> 01:22:00,829
Repeat. Statements to be taken
from yeomen Burke and Samno.

912
01:22:39,869 --> 01:22:41,536
You have to shoot.

913
01:22:45,374 --> 01:22:49,377
If you are logical, you have to shoot.

914
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:55,467
I do not want to.

915
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:59,220
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.

916
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:02,515
I'd just as soon you didn't.

917
01:23:10,107 --> 01:23:11,983
The operation is over.

918
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:21,576
I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.

919
01:23:21,869 --> 01:23:26,498
Yes, I can. At my trial,
my personal log was used against me.

920
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:30,835
How long did you wait outside
my quarters before I noticed you?

921
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:34,047
You knew?

922
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,302
I tried to tell you,
but you would not listen.

923
01:23:40,346 --> 01:23:43,473
Neither of us was hearing
very well that night, Lieutenant.

924
01:23:43,557 --> 01:23:47,102
There were things I tried to tell you
about having faith.

925
01:23:47,353 --> 01:23:49,771
You have betrayed the Federation.

926
01:23:50,773 --> 01:23:52,148
All of you.

927
01:23:52,358 --> 01:23:54,025
And what do you think
you've been doing?

928
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:57,737
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.

929
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:00,031
Sir.

930
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:04,452
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.

931
01:24:05,162 --> 01:24:08,456
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.

932
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:10,458
Did I misinterpret you?

933
01:24:13,337 --> 01:24:15,088
And you were right.

934
01:24:16,006 --> 01:24:19,718
They conspired with us
to assassinate their own chancellor.

935
01:24:19,802 --> 01:24:21,970
How trustworthy can they be?

936
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:26,057
Klingons and Federation members
conspiring together?

937
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,892
Who is "us"?

938
01:24:27,977 --> 01:24:30,645
Everyone who stands
to lose from peace.

939
01:24:31,147 --> 01:24:34,899
-Names, Lieutenant.
-My comrades will make certain

940
01:24:34,984 --> 01:24:38,236
all your ship-to-shore transmissions
are jammed.

941
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,988
Names, Lieutenant.

942
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:42,699
I do not remember.

943
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:46,995
A lie?

944
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:50,206
A choice.

945
01:24:54,962 --> 01:24:56,129
Spock?

946
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:43,468
Admiral Cartwright.

947
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,221
From Starfleet?

948
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,480
Who else?

949
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:02,195
-General...
-General...

950
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:04,906
-...Chang.
-...Chang.

951
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:12,247
Who else?

952
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,666
-Romulan...
-Romulan...

953
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,501
-...Ambassador...
-...Ambassador...

954
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,253
-...Nanclus.
-...Nanclus.

955
01:26:22,091 --> 01:26:24,342
Where is the peace conference?

956
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:28,847
Where is the peace conference?

957
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:04,424
She does not know.

958
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:08,469
Then we're dead.

959
01:27:19,064 --> 01:27:22,317
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.

960
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:27,780
-She'll have the coordinates.
-I've already got him, sir.

961
01:27:28,908 --> 01:27:30,408
Standing by, Captain Kirk.

962
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:31,576
Sulu!

963
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:36,205
You realize that by even talking to us,
you're violating regulations.

964
01:27:36,332 --> 01:27:39,167
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.

965
01:27:39,251 --> 01:27:42,337
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?

966
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,131
They're going to attempt
another assassination.

967
01:27:45,215 --> 01:27:48,968
The conference is at Camp Khitomer,
near the Romulan border.

968
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:53,264
I'm sending the exact coordinates
on a coded frequency.

969
01:27:53,349 --> 01:27:55,350
I'm afraid
we're gonna need more than that.

970
01:27:55,434 --> 01:27:57,977
There's a bird-of-prey
on the lookout for us,

971
01:27:58,062 --> 01:27:59,604
and she can fire while cloaked.

972
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:01,105
Surely not.

973
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:04,067
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?

974
01:28:04,485 --> 01:28:06,235
Come on, Lieutenant.

975
01:28:06,862 --> 01:28:09,572
-Just the prototype.
-You hear that?

976
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:13,785
I'm getting underway now,
but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.

977
01:28:13,869 --> 01:28:17,246
The chances of our reaching
the conference in time are slim.

978
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:19,666
When does this conference start?

979
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,251
According to my information, today.

980
01:28:23,587 --> 01:28:25,380
Thank you, Captain Sulu.

981
01:28:25,589 --> 01:28:27,090
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

982
01:28:33,889 --> 01:28:35,056
Spock?

983
01:28:36,475 --> 01:28:38,101
I prefer it dark.

984
01:28:45,401 --> 01:28:46,985
Dining on ashes?

985
01:28:47,945 --> 01:28:49,487
You were right.

986
01:28:49,905 --> 01:28:55,326
It was arrogant presumption on my part
that got us into this situation.

987
01:28:57,246 --> 01:29:00,081
You and the doctor
might have been killed.

988
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,500
The night is young.

989
01:29:03,419 --> 01:29:07,922
You said it yourself. It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.

990
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:14,012
You're a great one for logic.

991
01:29:14,096 --> 01:29:17,724
I'm a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread.

992
01:29:19,393 --> 01:29:21,269
We're both extremists.

993
01:29:21,645 --> 01:29:24,689
Reality is probably
somewhere in between.

994
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:32,530
I couldn't get past the death of my son.

995
01:29:32,948 --> 01:29:36,993
I was prejudiced
by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.

996
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,789
Gorkon had to die before I understood
how prejudiced I was.

997
01:29:49,673 --> 01:29:54,093
Is it possible that we two, you and I,

998
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:59,390
have grown so old and so inflexible

999
01:30:00,309 --> 01:30:02,894
that we have outlived our usefulness?

1000
01:30:05,147 --> 01:30:07,690
Would that constitute a joke?

1001
01:30:09,193 --> 01:30:11,402
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

1002
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:13,154
I was responsible.

1003
01:30:14,531 --> 01:30:18,868
-For no actions but your own.
-That is not what you said at your trial.

1004
01:30:20,162 --> 01:30:22,413
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...

1005
01:30:22,498 --> 01:30:25,792
But, Captain, we both know
that I am not human.

1006
01:30:26,293 --> 01:30:29,670
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.

1007
01:30:30,714 --> 01:30:33,841
I find that remark insulting.

1008
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,427
Come on. I need you.

1009
01:30:40,974 --> 01:30:42,600
Madam Chancellor,

1010
01:30:43,477 --> 01:30:47,688
members of the Diplomatic Corps,
honored guests,

1011
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:53,277
the United Federation of Planets
welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.

1012
01:31:10,504 --> 01:31:12,755
She's out here somewhere.

1013
01:31:13,215 --> 01:31:15,174
But if she is cloaked...

1014
01:31:15,801 --> 01:31:17,969
Then all we have
is a neutron radiation surge,

1015
01:31:18,053 --> 01:31:21,139
and by the time we're close enough
to record it, we're ashes.

1016
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:22,640
209.

1017
01:31:25,644 --> 01:31:26,853
206.

1018
01:31:30,482 --> 01:31:31,983
203.

1019
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:38,322
-Close enough to beam down?
-Not yet, Captain. In two minutes. 158.

1020
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:43,494
-Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
-Aye, sir.

1021
01:31:52,296 --> 01:31:57,633
Let us redefine progress to mean
that just because we can do a thing,

1022
01:31:57,718 --> 01:32:02,138
it does not necessarily follow
that we must do that thing.

1023
01:32:05,934 --> 01:32:08,019
-Uhura?
-Nothing, Captain.

1024
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,814
If she's here,
she's rigged for silent running.

1025
01:32:18,697 --> 01:32:21,782
Coming up on transporter range
in 57 seconds.

1026
01:32:22,784 --> 01:32:25,453
Transporter Room,
stand by to beam down.

1027
01:32:28,624 --> 01:32:29,665
...53...

1028
01:32:34,504 --> 01:32:35,880
...48 seconds.

1029
01:32:41,386 --> 01:32:42,428
...44...

1030
01:32:45,724 --> 01:32:47,558
I can see you, Kirk.

1031
01:32:49,478 --> 01:32:50,645
Chang.

1032
01:32:51,813 --> 01:32:53,356
Can you see me?

1033
01:32:54,524 --> 01:32:58,569
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior,

1034
01:32:59,363 --> 01:33:03,115
you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.

1035
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:06,035
No peace in our time.

1036
01:33:06,745 --> 01:33:11,499
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

1037
01:33:27,516 --> 01:33:30,768
-This is fun.
-Reverse engines. All astern.

1038
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:34,021
One and a half impulse power.
Back off! Back off!

1039
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,027
What's she doing?

1040
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:42,697
What's she waiting for?

1041
01:33:43,699 --> 01:33:47,118
Probably attempting to ascertain
why we are reversing,

1042
01:33:47,536 --> 01:33:49,870
wondering whether we detect her.

1043
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,460
Incoming!

1044
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:03,467
-In range?
-Not yet, sir.

1045
01:34:03,552 --> 01:34:04,969
Come on. Come on.

1046
01:34:05,053 --> 01:34:07,054
-She'll fly apart.
-Fly her apart, then!

1047
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:11,434
Many speculated
about my father's motives.

1048
01:34:12,728 --> 01:34:15,688
There were those who said
he was an idealist.

1049
01:34:15,856 --> 01:34:18,065
Others said he had no choice.

1050
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:22,403
If Praxis had not exploded,
then quite possibly his idealism

1051
01:34:22,654 --> 01:34:27,199
would not have found expression.
We are a proud race,

1052
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:32,496
and we are here because
we intend to go on being proud.

1053
01:34:42,382 --> 01:34:46,427
-Go to auxiliary power!
-Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.

1054
01:34:52,434 --> 01:34:56,437
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?

1055
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:58,439
"Wrong us,

1056
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:01,525
"shall we not revenge?"

1057
01:35:02,486 --> 01:35:03,569
Gas.

1058
01:35:05,489 --> 01:35:09,992
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power,
she expends fuel like any other vessel.

1059
01:35:10,327 --> 01:35:13,037
We call it plasma,
but whatever the Klingon designation,

1060
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:15,373
it is merely ionized gas.

1061
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:18,709
Well, what about all
of that equipment we're carrying

1062
01:35:18,794 --> 01:35:20,961
to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

1063
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:27,885
-Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
-Doctor, would you care to assist me

1064
01:35:27,969 --> 01:35:31,305
-in performing surgery on a torpedo?
-Fascinating.

1065
01:35:33,183 --> 01:35:34,850
Hard to starboard!

1066
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:41,273
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos

1067
01:35:41,358 --> 01:35:45,111
has been calculated
within the 50-Earth-year time span.

1068
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:47,696
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.

1069
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:56,163
Come on, reach up!

1070
01:35:57,999 --> 01:36:01,961
Captain! She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!

1071
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:11,846
Shields up. All right.

1072
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:13,848
Now we've given them
something else to shoot at.

1073
01:36:13,932 --> 01:36:15,182
Aye, sir.

1074
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:23,732
The game's afoot, huh?

1075
01:36:32,033 --> 01:36:36,036
-Excelsior's been hit.
-"Our revels now are ended," Kirk.

1076
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:49,884
"Cry 'Havoc!'
and let slip the dogs of war."

1077
01:36:51,011 --> 01:36:53,053
Bones, where's my torpedo?

1078
01:36:53,138 --> 01:36:54,805
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.

1079
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:56,974
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!

1080
01:36:57,058 --> 01:36:58,767
Shields collapsing!

1081
01:37:01,062 --> 01:37:03,189
The key, please, Doctor. Time is short.

1082
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:13,407
The hull has been compromised.

1083
01:37:13,492 --> 01:37:16,076
-I wonder how bad?
-Connect echobars.

1084
01:37:16,203 --> 01:37:18,787
...to discuss the report on phase two.

1085
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,916
-Alter circuit "A."
-Sensor.

1086
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:25,169
I propose that we commence
with the minutes of the preparation.

1087
01:37:25,462 --> 01:37:28,172
"I am constant as the northern star."

1088
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:30,799
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.

1089
01:37:30,926 --> 01:37:32,218
-Plate, please.
-Plate.

1090
01:37:32,302 --> 01:37:34,053
...and assimilation will consume...

1091
01:37:34,137 --> 01:37:36,013
We've got a heartbeat.

1092
01:37:37,182 --> 01:37:39,183
The Klingon empire, the ecological...

1093
01:37:39,476 --> 01:37:41,060
-Key, please.
-Key.

1094
01:37:41,144 --> 01:37:42,561
Where's that damn torpedo?

1095
01:37:42,646 --> 01:37:44,980
She's ready, Jim. Lock and load.

1096
01:37:47,609 --> 01:37:48,734
Fire.

1097
01:38:01,581 --> 01:38:02,790
To be,

1098
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:04,667
or not

1099
01:38:05,502 --> 01:38:06,794
to be.

1100
01:38:08,547 --> 01:38:10,631
Target that explosion and fire.

1101
01:38:12,592 --> 01:38:13,592
Fire.

1102
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:26,397
As I imagine this work will occupy us

1103
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:29,358
throughout most of the week,
it would be my hope

1104
01:38:29,442 --> 01:38:31,860
that the delegation
could return to their capitals

1105
01:38:31,945 --> 01:38:34,363
to implement the provisions
of phase one,

1106
01:38:34,447 --> 01:38:36,699
no later than the first of next month.

1107
01:38:36,783 --> 01:38:37,783
Scotty.

1108
01:38:37,867 --> 01:38:40,369
As you know, time is of the essence.

1109
01:38:41,329 --> 01:38:43,664
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!

1110
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,584
Mr. President!

1111
01:38:48,503 --> 01:38:50,713
Mr. President! Mr. President!

1112
01:38:51,673 --> 01:38:53,173
Mr. President!

1113
01:38:55,302 --> 01:38:56,927
Kirk, Enterprise.

1114
01:38:59,097 --> 01:39:00,598
Protect the Chancellor!

1115
01:39:08,064 --> 01:39:10,566
-Arrest those men!
-Arrest yourself.

1116
01:39:15,822 --> 01:39:17,948
We've got a full confession.

1117
01:39:33,048 --> 01:39:35,049
Cartwright, just a minute.

1118
01:39:37,385 --> 01:39:40,679
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?

1119
01:39:41,139 --> 01:39:43,891
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.

1120
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:47,311
Some people think the future
means the end of history.

1121
01:39:47,395 --> 01:39:51,398
Well, we haven't run out
of history quite yet.

1122
01:39:53,902 --> 01:39:57,071
Your father called the future

1123
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,240
the undiscovered country.

1124
01:40:03,745 --> 01:40:06,413
People can be very frightened
of change.

1125
01:40:11,419 --> 01:40:13,879
You've restored my father's faith.

1126
01:40:14,798 --> 01:40:17,007
And you've restored my son's.

1127
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:08,726
Once again, we've saved civilization
as we know it.

1128
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:11,270
And the good news is,
they're not going to prosecute.

1129
01:41:11,354 --> 01:41:15,232
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.

1130
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:18,193
Well, they don't arrest people
for having feelings.

1131
01:41:18,278 --> 01:41:22,865
And it's a good thing, too. If they did,
we'd all have to turn ourselves in.

1132
01:41:24,993 --> 01:41:26,452
Captain Kirk.

1133
01:41:26,995 --> 01:41:28,454
Captain Sulu.

1134
01:41:29,414 --> 01:41:33,125
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
I owe you my thanks.

1135
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:37,212
Nice to see you in action
one more time, Captain Kirk.

1136
01:41:37,797 --> 01:41:39,131
Take care.

1137
01:41:51,269 --> 01:41:53,353
By God, that's a big ship.

1138
01:41:53,813 --> 01:41:59,777
-Not so big as her captain, I think.
-So, this is goodbye.

1139
01:42:01,321 --> 01:42:04,281
I think it's about time
we got underway ourselves.

1140
01:42:04,365 --> 01:42:07,743
Captain, I have orders
from Starfleet Command.

1141
01:42:07,827 --> 01:42:10,537
We're to put back
to spacedock immediately

1142
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:12,414
to be decommissioned.

1143
01:42:27,597 --> 01:42:29,223
If I were human,

1144
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:32,226
I believe my response would be,

1145
01:42:33,436 --> 01:42:34,895
"Go to hell."

1146
01:42:38,691 --> 01:42:40,275
If I were human.

1147
01:42:44,656 --> 01:42:46,615
Course heading, Captain?

1148
01:42:52,831 --> 01:42:54,915
Second star to the right,

1149
01:42:56,751 --> 01:42:58,877
and straight on till morning.

1150
01:43:16,312 --> 01:43:19,398
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.

1151
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,943
This is the final cruise
of the Starship Enterprise

1152
01:43:23,027 --> 01:43:24,528
under my command.

1153
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:30,033
This ship and her history will shortly
become the care of another crew.

1154
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:33,537
To them and their posterity
will we commit our future.

1155
01:43:34,163 --> 01:43:36,665
They will continue the voyages
we have begun,

1156
01:43:36,749 --> 01:43:39,209
and journey to all
the undiscovered countries,

1157
01:43:39,294 --> 01:43:41,461
boldly going where no man...

1158
01:43:42,255 --> 01:43:43,797
Where no one
