1
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,388
Senators, consider the opportunities
for the Empire.

2
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:46,804
At last the destinies of the planets
Romulus and Remus will be united.

3
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,897
Shinzon of Remus offers us a chance to
make ourselves

4
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,936
stronger than ever.

5
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,262
It would be madness to reject it.

6
00:01:55,466 --> 00:02:01,096
I beg you not to let prejudice or politics
interfere with this alliance.

7
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:05,766
By joining Shinzon's forces with ours,
not even the Federation

8
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,594
- will be able to stand in our way...
- Enough!

9
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:14,352
The decision is made. The military
does not dictate policy on Romulus.

10
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:19,324
The Senate has considered
Shinzon's proposal and rejected it.

11
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:25,634
He and his followers will be met with
force and sent back to their black rock!

12
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:31,044
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

13
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:45,921
Praetor, I have an appointment
with the Tholian ambassador.

14
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,175
Of course.

15
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,508
Senators, are there any others
who wish to speak?

16
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:59,798
Then I call for a vote on the motion to
open trade negotiations with Celes II.

17
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:03,524
The Reman mines have not
been filling their quotas.

18
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,615
Consider the trade committee's findings.

19
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:09,788
As much as we don't want...

20
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,100
Someone alert security!
Bring back Senator Tal'Aura!

21
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:19,612
Duty. A starship captain's life
is filled with solemn duty.

22
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:27,225
I have commanded in battle, negotiated
peace between implacable enemies.

23
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:32,983
I have represented the Federation
in first contact with 27 alien species.

24
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:38,341
But none of this compares
with my solemn duty today...

25
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,500
...as best man.

26
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:47,588
Now, on an occasion such as this,
it is expected that I be gracious

27
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,874
and fulsome in my praise
on the wonders of this blessed union.

28
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:57,887
But have the two of you
considered what you are doing to me?

29
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:04,932
You're happy, but what about my needs?
This is all a damned inconvenience.

30
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:09,317
While you're settling in on the Titan,

31
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:12,168
I will be training my new first officer.

32
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:14,091
You know him.

33
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:19,624
He's a tyrannical martinet who will never,
ever allow me to go on away missions!

34
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,338
That is the regulation, sir.
Starfleet Code, section 12...

35
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,915
- Data.
- Sir?

36
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,603
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:33,130
15 years I've been waiting to say that.

38
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:40,322
No, seriously, Will, Deanna,
there's still time to reconsider. Yes?

39
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,951
- No.
- No? Very well, then.

40
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:55,643
Will Riker, you have been
my trusted right arm for 15 years.

41
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:01,451
You have kept my course
true and steady.

42
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:05,713
Deanna Troi, you have been
my guide and my conscience.

43
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:12,516
You have helped me recognise
the better parts of myself.

44
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:15,810
You are my family.

45
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,473
In maritime tradition...

46
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,442
...I wish you both clear horizons.

47
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:26,896
My good friends, make it so.

48
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,079
The bride and groom!

49
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,377
You ever think about marrying again?

50
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,377
No, 23 was my limit.

51
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:00,848
Worf?

52
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,564
- Are you all right?
- Romulan ale should be illegal.

53
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,946
It is.

54
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,201
- A lovely toast.
- It was from the heart.

55
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:16,348
Don't worry. I'll brief your new counsellor
on everything she has to know.

56
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:20,529
Like hell you are!
You already know too much about me.

57
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:25,124
I take it there'll be no speeches
during the ceremony on Betazed?

58
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:28,529
No, no speeches and no clothes.

59
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,473
Ladies and gentlemen and invited
transgendered species,

60
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:40,391
in Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites,
I've discovered it is traditional

61
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,634
to present the happy couple with a gift.

62
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:49,403
Given Commander Riker's affection
for archaic musical forms,

63
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:54,889
I have elected to present the following
as my gift, in honour of their conjugation.

64
00:07:57,586 --> 00:08:00,286
Never saw the sun shining so bright

65
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:04,540
Never saw things going so right

66
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:08,242
Noticing the days hurrying by

67
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,199
When you're in love, my, how they fly!

68
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,375
- Blue skies, smiling at me
- Irving Berlin!

69
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:23,848
Nothing but blue skies do I see...

70
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:51,038
It's tradition, Worf.

71
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:55,500
- You should appreciate that.
- I will not do it!

72
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:59,575
- Won't do what, Mr Worf?
- Captain, I think it inappropriate

73
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:03,139
for a Starfleet officer to appear... naked.

74
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,883
Come, a strapping fellow like you?
What can you be afraid of?

75
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:19,192
I'm picking up an odd electromagnetic
signature from the Kolarin system.

76
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:22,600
- What sort of signature?
- Positronic.

77
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,220
It's very faint but I've isolated it to
the third planet in the Kolarin system.

78
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:39,000
- What do we know?
- Uncharted.

79
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:42,921
- We'll have to get closer for more detail.
- Theories?

80
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:46,917
Positronic signatures are only known
to emanate from androids.

81
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,835
It is logical to theorise
there is an android on Kolarus III.

82
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,610
Just what I feared. Captain?

83
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,695
Diverting there takes us close
to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

84
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:05,791
It's still well on our side. I think...

85
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,690
...it's worth a look.
Don't worry, Number One.

86
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:14,711
- We'll have you to Betazed in time.
- Thank you, sir.

87
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:18,753
Where we will all honour
the Betazoid tradition.

88
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:24,241
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the gym.

89
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:33,792
Mr Branson, lay in a course
for the Kolarin system, warp five.

90
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:40,559
What do you think, Data?
A long-Iost relative?

91
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:03,754
I read six distinct positronic signatures,
spread out over a few kilometres.

92
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:08,292
- What about the population?
- Isolated pockets of humanoids.

93
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:13,100
It appears to be a pre-warp civilisation
in early industrial development.

94
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:18,196
I wouldn't recommend the transporter.
That ion storm doesn't look neighbourly.

95
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,760
- It could head our way without warning.
- Understood.

96
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:31,658
- Data, Mr Worf, you're with me.
- I needn't remind you...

97
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,153
I appreciate your concern, Number One,
but I've been itching to try the Argo.

98
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,665
I'll bet.

99
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:42,629
Captain's prerogative.
There's no foreseeable danger.

100
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:47,298
And your wife wouldn't forgive me
if anything happened to you.

101
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,352
You have the bridge... Mr Troi.

102
00:12:57,162 --> 00:13:02,572
I am puzzled by the human predilection
for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.

103
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,371
Over that rise, sir, half a kilometre.

104
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:38,812
The electromagnetic field
is disrupting my tricorder.

105
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:43,671
- We're within metres of the signal.
- Fan out. Let's search around.

106
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:27,292
- It appears to be a robotic arm.
- Very astute.

107
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,628
Bring it to the vehicle.

108
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,150
This doesn't feel right.

109
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:16,052
The final signature is 100 metres north.

110
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:52,780
- It's you.
- The resemblance is striking.

111
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,212
Fascinating.

112
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:11,885
To the vehicle!

113
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:21,884
I think it's time
to try some unsafe velocities.

114
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:44,240
Why do you have a shiny head?

115
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,489
- Conversation isn't appropriate.
- Why?

116
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:51,087
- The captain has to concentrate.
- Why?

117
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:52,577
- Because...
- Data!

118
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:54,883
Sorry, sir.

119
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,634
Have I said something wrong?

120
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:51,822
You know, all things considered, Data,
I think you have nicer eyes.

121
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,135
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

122
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:01,558
- So what have we got, Geordi?
- Well...

123
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:05,713
...his mechanics are like Data's,
with less positronic development.

124
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:10,228
The neural pathways aren't as
sophisticated. I'd say he's a prototype.

125
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:14,103
Something Dr Soong created
prior to Data.

126
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:18,913
- Do you have a name, sir?
- I am... B-4.

127
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,086
B-4? Dr Soong's penchant
for whimsical names has no end.

128
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:31,452
How did you come to be
where we found you?

129
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,968
- I do not know.
- Do you remember anything of your life?

130
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:41,670
No. Why does the tall man
have a furry face?

131
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:49,339
Number One, keep me informed,
and Geordi, reassemble him.

132
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,765
- B-4, do you know who I am?
- You are me.

133
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:05,478
No. My name is Data.

134
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:09,276
I am your brother.

135
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:14,835
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

136
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:23,923
An Alpha Priority communication from
Starfleet Command for you, Captain.

137
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:26,007
Acknowledged.

138
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,846
Admiral Janeway, good to see you.

139
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:37,240
Jean-Luc. How would you like
a trip to Romulus?

140
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,644
- With or without the fleet?
- A diplomatic mission.

141
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:46,559
We're invited, believe it or not. There's
been an internal political shake up.

142
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:51,787
The new Praetor, Shinzon,
has requested a Federation envoy.

143
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:55,208
- New Praetor?
- Here's more. He's Reman.

144
00:20:55,415 --> 00:21:00,378
Believe me, we don't understand
it either. You're the closest ship.

145
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:04,681
Go and hear what he has to say.
Get the lay of the land.

146
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:09,005
An unstable Empire could
mean trouble for the quadrant.

147
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:12,880
- Understood.
- We're sending you all our intelligence.

148
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:17,682
But it's not much. I don't need to tell you
to watch your back.

149
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:20,777
- Hardly.
- The Son'a, the Borg,

150
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:24,614
the Romulans...
you get all the easy assignments.

151
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:30,106
- Just lucky, Admiral.
- Let's hope it holds. Janeway out.

152
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:41,459
Helmsman, lay in a new course.
Take us to Romulus. Warp eight.

153
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:44,791
Course laid in.

154
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:49,518
- Romulus?
- The Opal Sea will have to wait. Engage.

155
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:06,828
As you can see, one side
of Remus always faces the sun.

156
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:12,271
Due to the extreme temperatures on that
half, the Remans live on the dark side.

157
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,625
Little is known of the Reman homeworld,

158
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:22,789
although scans have revealed dilithium
mining and heavy weapons construction.

159
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,307
The Remans themselves are considered
an undesirable caste in the Empire.

160
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:32,291
They're said to be formidable warriors.

161
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:37,259
In the Dominion War, Reman troops
were used as assault forces.

162
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:41,255
- Cannon fodder.
- How did a Reman get to be Praetor?

163
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:44,351
- I don't get it.
- Romulan collaborators?

164
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:48,229
- Coup d'état?
- The Praetor's power is their fleet.

165
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,742
They must have been behind Shinzon.

166
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:54,960
What have we learned about Shinzon?

167
00:22:55,162 --> 00:23:01,532
Only a part of his military record.
He is young and a capable commander.

168
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:04,788
He won 12 major engagements
in the war.

169
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:11,208
- Beyond that, we know nothing.
- Well, we're sailing into the unknown.

170
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:16,842
Keep at it. Give me anything
you can. Dismissed.

171
00:23:18,185 --> 00:23:23,310
I still can't believe the captain
went along with a memory download.

172
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:26,277
He agrees that the B-4 probably has

173
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:30,826
the same self-actualisation
parameters as myself.

174
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:36,238
If my memory engrams are successfully
integrated into his positronic matrix,

175
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:41,834
- he should have all my abilities.
- He'd have all your memories as well.

176
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,500
- You feel comfortable with that?
- I feel nothing, Geordi.

177
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:52,375
With my memory engrams, he will be
able to be a more complete individual.

178
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:56,344
- An individual more like you, you mean?
- Yes.

179
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:06,344
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you.
Maybe he's supposed to be as he is.

180
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:13,601
That might be so, but he should have
the opportunity to explore his potential.

181
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:19,026
OK, we're done.

182
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,923
- B-4, do you know where you are?
- I am in a room with lights.

183
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,414
Remember our father?

184
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,965
- Our father?
- Yes, Dr Soong.

185
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:49,769
- No.
- Do you know the name of the captain?

186
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:52,823
No.

187
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:59,608
Data, he's assimilating
a lot of programming.

188
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:02,980
He's a lot less sophisticated than you.

189
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,288
We don't know if his matrix will be able
to adapt. We need to give him time.

190
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,836
Geordi, what purpose does this serve?

191
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,423
- What?
- This.

192
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:19,142
A redundant memory port.
Maybe the provisional storage

193
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:22,123
is in case
his neural pathways overload.

194
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:25,684
Mind if I keep him here?
Run a few diagnostics?

195
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:27,923
I do not mind.

196
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:31,480
- Data!
- No.

197
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:35,516
Remain with Commander La Forge.
He will try to help you.

198
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:49,824
Captain's log: Stardate 56844.9.

199
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:55,410
The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus
and waits at the designated coordinates.

200
00:25:55,635 --> 00:26:01,588
All our hails have gone unanswered.
We've been waiting for 17 hours.

201
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:10,836
- Counsellor?
- They're out there, sir.

202
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:33,824
- Captain! Recommend we raise shields.
- Not yet, Mr Worf.

203
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:39,173
With due respect to diplomatic protocol,
the Federation Council isn't here.

204
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:44,123
- We are.
- Patience. Diplomacy is very exacting.

205
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,927
- We will wait.
- Captain...

206
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,856
- Shields!
- No!

207
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:57,198
- Captain...
- Tactical!

208
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:04,179
52 disruptor banks,
27 photon torpedo bays,

209
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,396
primary and secondary shields.

210
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,442
She's a predator.

211
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:25,873
We're being hailed.

212
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:28,377
On screen.

213
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:39,098
Enterprise, we are the
Reman warbird, Scimitar.

214
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:45,357
- Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
- I am not Shinzon.

215
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:51,598
I am his viceroy.
We are sending transport coordinates.

216
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,298
- Not very chatty.
- Away Team, transporter room four.

217
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:51,125
I hope you'll forgive the darkness.

218
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:55,137
We are not comfortable in the light.

219
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:59,811
- Praetor Shinzon?
- Captain Picard.

220
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:04,050
Jean-Luc Picard.

221
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:10,305
I'd always imagined you taller.
Isn't that odd?

222
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:18,172
You may scan me without subterfuge,
Commander Data.

223
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,820
- You are not as we imagined you.
- No?

224
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,384
You're human.

225
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:43,898
Why have you asked us to come here?

226
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,266
Praetor?

227
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:52,232
- I've never met a human woman before.
- I'm only half human.

228
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:55,107
Deanna Troi, of Betazed.

229
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,355
Empathic and telepathic abilities,
ship's counsellor.

230
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:04,969
All this I knew. But I never knew
you were so beautiful.

231
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,789
You're quite familiar with our personnel.

232
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:13,625
I am, Commander Riker.
May I touch your hair?

233
00:30:13,832 --> 00:30:18,371
We came to Romulus on a matter we
were assured was of great importance.

234
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:24,705
If you have anything to say to us as
Federation representatives, do it now.

235
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:29,986
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
There is so much we need to talk about.

236
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:36,483
- I would be interested to know what.
- Unity, Captain!

237
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:41,579
Tearing down the walls between us
to recognise that we are one.

238
00:30:43,782 --> 00:30:46,322
I'm talking of the thing
that makes us the same.

239
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,943
Peace. We want peace.

240
00:30:56,307 --> 00:31:00,093
You're thinking this all sounds
too good to be true,

241
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:04,804
but that the chance
for peace is too promising to ignore.

242
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:09,188
I'm right?

243
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:17,644
- Yes.
- Perhaps it's time to add illumination.

244
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:21,321
Computer, raise the lighting four levels.

245
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:39,619
When I was young I had an odd disease.

246
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:45,451
I developed
a hyper-sensitivity to sound.

247
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:50,229
Even a whisper caused me agony.
No one could do anything.

248
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:55,052
Finally I was taken to a doctor
with experience of Terran illnesses.

249
00:31:55,281 --> 00:32:01,387
And he diagnosed Shalaft's Syndrome...
Do you know of it, Captain?

250
00:32:07,544 --> 00:32:08,994
Yes.

251
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:13,655
Then you know
it's a very rare syndrome.

252
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:20,747
Genetic. Apparently, all the male
members of a family have it.

253
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:27,000
Eventually I was treated and now
I can hear as well as you can, Captain.

254
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:30,756
I can see as well as you can.

255
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:35,727
I can feel everything you feel.

256
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:41,690
In fact, I feel exactly what you feel.

257
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,445
Don't I, Jean-Luc?

258
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:52,246
Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus.
Just the two of us.

259
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:56,242
Or should I say, just the one of us?

260
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:16,465
I think you'll be wanting this.

261
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,861
Until tomorrow then, Captain.
We have much to discuss.

262
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:31,108
Computer, return lighting
to previous level.

263
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:05,172
There's no doubt. Right down to
your strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.

264
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:09,951
He's a clone. They probably used
a hair follicle or skin cell.

265
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:15,701
- Why?
- I intend to find out, Number One.

266
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:22,487
Inform Starfleet of the situation. I need
to know where the hell he came from.

267
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:25,221
Counsellor.

268
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:32,161
We supported you, Shinzon,
when you assassinated the Senate.

269
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:38,681
You told us the timing was perfect
to attack the Federation. Why the delay?

270
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,467
You don't have to understand.

271
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,960
Why bring the Enterprise here?

272
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:48,184
- I have a purpose.
- Then enlighten us.

273
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:50,980
Silence, Romulan!

274
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,693
You must learn patience, Commander.

275
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:07,117
Spend 18 hours every day
under the lash of a Romulan guard

276
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:11,387
and you'll soon understand patience.

277
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:13,422
Now go.

278
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,778
Commander Donatra.

279
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:28,230
Remain.

280
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:41,815
There's a word I want you to consider.

281
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,487
Allegiance. It's something I demand
from those who serve me.

282
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:52,239
- Do I serve you?
- Yes... And I think faithfully.

283
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:58,889
Commander Suran, on the other hand,
gives me pause.

284
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:02,878
Here's another word, Praetor.

285
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,047
Trust.

286
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:10,599
Do you trust me?

287
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:13,655
How far does that trust extend?

288
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:18,775
How deep does it go?

289
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:23,056
What must a commander do
to prove herself faithful?

290
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,992
What must a woman do?

291
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:34,413
You are not a woman.
You are a Romulan.

292
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:40,092
Serve me faithfully
and you will be rewarded.

293
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:45,842
Keep those lovely eyes
on Commander Suran.

294
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:51,128
And at the first sign of treachery...

295
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:55,681
Dispose of him.

296
00:36:56,695 --> 00:37:01,110
Then you will have proven yourself.

297
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,009
Now go.

298
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:21,009
Commander!

299
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:27,976
If you ever touch me again...

300
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,733
...I'll kill you.

301
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:48,027
The Romulans had gained possession
of your DNA and created me.

302
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:53,724
And when I was ready,
they were going to replace you with me.

303
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:58,896
Put a Romulan agent at the heart
of Starfleet. It was a bold plan.

304
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:03,521
- What happened?
- As happens frequently on Romulus,

305
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:08,471
a new government came to power
and abandoned the plan.

306
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:13,614
They were afraid I'd be discovered
and that it would lead to war.

307
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,914
- Not quite the face you remember.
- Not quite.

308
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:30,625
A lifetime of violence will do that.
They broke my nose, my jaw.

309
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:36,097
But so much is the same. The eyes.

310
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:40,016
- Surely you recognise the eyes?
- Yes.

311
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:46,275
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
And yours are so confident.

312
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:59,056
- So I'm not as tall as you expected?
- I'd always hoped I might hit two metres.

313
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:01,786
As had I.

314
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,987
How did you end up on Remus?

315
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:12,880
They sent me there to die.

316
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:17,809
How could a mere human survive
the dilithium mines?

317
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:23,688
Not that it mattered, as I was no longer
part of their plans against the Federation.

318
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:30,577
In those terrible depths lived only the
damned. Along with the Reman slaves,

319
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:34,219
I was condemned
to unceasing labour and starvation

320
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:37,786
under the brutal heel
of the Romulan guards.

321
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:41,362
Only the strongest
had any hope of survival.

322
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:44,670
I was only a child when they took me.

323
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:48,240
I didn't see the sun or the stars
for ten years.

324
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:55,501
The only thing the Romulan guards
hated more than the Remans...

325
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:57,554
...was me.

326
00:41:02,346 --> 00:41:06,213
But one man took pity on me,

327
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:13,688
the man that became my viceroy and
protected me from the guards' cruelty.

328
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:16,940
He taught me how to survive.

329
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:21,483
And in that dark place,
where there was nothing of myself,

330
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:24,940
I found my Reman brothers.

331
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,610
They showed me the only kindness
I've ever known.

332
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:37,695
- This is all to liberate the Remans?
- The single thought behind all I've done.

333
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:41,458
From secretly building the Scimitar
to assembling my army.

334
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:46,711
Finally coming to Romulus, in force.
I knew they'd never give us freedom.

335
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:51,757
- I would have to take it!
- But how many Romulans died for it?

336
00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:00,103
Too many. But finally the Empire
is realising that there is a better way.

337
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:03,271
And that way is peace.

338
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:11,913
- You don't trust me.
- I have no reason to.

339
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:16,621
You have every reason.
If you had lived my life,

340
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:21,992
and experienced the suffering of my
people, you'd be standing where I am.

341
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:26,420
If you'd lived mine, you'd understand
my responsibility to the Federation.

342
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:31,461
I cannot allow my personal feelings
to unduly influence my decisions.

343
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:34,635
All I have are my personal feelings!

344
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:46,818
I want to know what being human
means. The Remans gave me a future.

345
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:52,490
- You can tell me about my past.
- I can tell you about mine.

346
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:59,664
- Were we Picards always warriors?
- I think of myself as an explorer.

347
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:03,541
Well, were we always explorers?

348
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:06,628
I was the first Picard
to leave our system.

349
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:11,521
It caused quite a stir in the family,

350
00:43:11,726 --> 00:43:15,559
but I'd spent my youth...

351
00:43:15,764 --> 00:43:20,143
Looking at the stars, dreaming
about what was up there, about...

352
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:21,820
New worlds.

353
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:38,155
I'm trying to believe you.

354
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:47,789
If there is one ideal
the Federation holds most dear,

355
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:53,226
it is that all men,
all races, can be united.

356
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,186
What better example?

357
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:02,599
A Starfleet captain
standing in the Romulan Senate.

358
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:12,655
Nothing would make me more proud
than to take your hand in friendship.

359
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,936
In time. When trust has been earned.

360
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,751
- Sir, the main computer was accessed.
- Source?

361
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:33,800
It'll take time to figure out. The data
stream was re-routed all over the ship.

362
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:38,260
- What was accessed?
- That's what I can't figure out.

363
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:44,599
It's mostly basic stellar cartography:
Star charts, protocols, colony uplinks.

364
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:49,065
- It's not even restricted material.
- We must still learn the source.

365
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:55,407
Captain, there's something else.
I was reviewing the sensor logs. Look!

366
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:03,052
When the Scimitar de-cloaked, there
was a spike in the tertiary EM band.

367
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:06,760
You're not going to believe this.
It's Thalaron.

368
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:15,429
- I thought Thalaron radiation was theory.
- That's why initial scans missed it.

369
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,268
He's got it.

370
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:21,599
Research was banned in the Federation
because Thalaron is biogenic.

371
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:25,849
It can consume organic material
at the subatomic level.

372
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:30,112
I can't overestimate the danger
of Thalaron radiation.

373
00:45:30,313 --> 00:45:34,454
A microscopic amount could kill
all of us in seconds.

374
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:40,603
Understood. I want to know what he has
and how we can neutralise any threat.

375
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,777
I need options.

376
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:58,420
This was a mistake. We're wasting time.

377
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,804
My time. And I'll spend it how I choose.

378
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:12,137
Do not forget our mission, Shinzon.
We must act. Now!

379
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:23,646
We'll return to the Scimitar.
I was merely curious about him.

380
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,375
Come.

381
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:44,003
Come in.

382
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:50,887
Remember him?

383
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:57,518
- He was a bit cocky as I recall.
- He was a damned fool.

384
00:46:57,746 --> 00:47:02,056
Selfish. Ambitious.
Very much in need of seasoning.

385
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:05,536
He turned out all right.

386
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:10,590
I really wanted to believe Shinzon.

387
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:16,501
But this Thalaron radiation
just can't be explained away.

388
00:47:18,164 --> 00:47:22,922
Whatever he's after, it isn't peace.

389
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,222
Is he very much the way you were?

390
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,389
Oh, yes.

391
00:47:31,594 --> 00:47:34,231
- Data to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead.

392
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,731
We have identified the source
of the unauthorised computer access.

393
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:42,862
We have found a tactical advantage.

394
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,657
On my way.

395
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,420
Will?

396
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:03,849
As ship's counsellor,
I recommend you get some sleep.

397
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,934
Some honeymoon!

398
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:13,764
Come to bed.

399
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:18,612
Imzadi.

400
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:42,465
Imzadi.

401
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:50,882
He can never know you as I can.
He can never touch you as I can.

402
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:53,623
- This isn't real!
- Feel my lips.

403
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,737
I'm with you, Imzadi.

404
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,739
I'll always be with you now.

405
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:11,318
- This isn't real!
- What is it?

406
00:49:11,525 --> 00:49:13,702
- No!
- Deanna?

407
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:15,532
- Deanna!
- No!

408
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:22,327
The bond has been broken.

409
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:27,219
Find her again.

410
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:33,719
We've received the transponder signal.

411
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:50,784
It's accelerating.
You have no more time for games.

412
00:49:54,403 --> 00:49:57,367
Have the doctors prepare.

413
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,621
Transport.

414
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:23,807
Begin the download.

415
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,755
Tea, hot.

416
00:50:57,802 --> 00:51:03,670
Aside from elevated levels of adrenalin
and serotonin, you're perfectly normal.

417
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:10,438
Deanna, can you describe it?

418
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:16,110
It was... It was a violation.

419
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,028
Shinzon's viceroy seems able
to reach into my thoughts.

420
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:26,456
I'm a liability. I request to be relieved.

421
00:51:26,664 --> 00:51:33,161
Permission denied. If you can endure
more of these assaults, I need you.

422
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:38,126
Now more than ever. The Enterprise
is far from Federation space...

423
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,163
Shields up!

424
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:54,887
Hello.

425
00:51:57,202 --> 00:52:00,059
Why am I here? Why do this?

426
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:02,911
I was Ionely.

427
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,411
- What are you going to do?
- I need a blood sample.

428
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:23,170
What is it your Borg friends say?
Resistance is futile.

429
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,443
Oh, yes, the android.

430
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:38,744
- The bait you couldn't refuse.
- All of this to capture me?

431
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:42,199
Don't be so vain.

432
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:47,324
After we found it, we had to make
a few modifications.

433
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,202
An extra memory port,
a hidden transponder.

434
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:55,373
I've now gained access to Starfleet's
communications protocol.

435
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,293
I now know the exact location
of your entire fleet.

436
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:04,471
- You may go.
- Where?

437
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:09,059
Out of my sight.

438
00:53:11,806 --> 00:53:16,378
- What is all this about?
- It's about destiny!

439
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:21,155
- About a Reman outcast...
- You're not Reman!

440
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,742
And I'm not quite human! So what am I?

441
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:31,657
My life is meaningless
as long as you're still alive.

442
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:38,344
What am I while you exist?
A shadow? An echo?

443
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,672
If your issues are with me,
then deal with me.

444
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,128
This has nothing to do with my ship
or the Federation!

445
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,416
But it does. We will no longer
bow before anyone as slaves.

446
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:55,021
Not the Romulans
and not your mighty Federation.

447
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,983
We are a race bred for war.

448
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:01,324
And conquest.

449
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:07,367
You're ready to plunge the quadrant into
war to satisfy your personal demons?

450
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:11,436
It's amazing how little you know yourself.

451
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:14,653
- I'm incapable of such an act!
- You are me!

452
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,204
The same noble Picard blood
runs through our veins.

453
00:54:26,168 --> 00:54:30,472
Had you lived my life,
you'd be doing exactly as I am!

454
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:35,056
So look in the mirror. See yourself.

455
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:44,143
Consider that, Captain.
I can think of no greater torment for you.

456
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:56,670
Shinzon... I'm a mirror for you as well.

457
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,005
Not for long, Captain.

458
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:08,541
I'm afraid you won't survive to witness
the victory of the echo over the voice.

459
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:31,786
His cloak is perfect. No tachyon
emissions, no residual antiprotons.

460
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:34,692
Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in.

461
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:46,878
Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner.

462
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:00,639
- About time, Data.
- My mission succeeded.

463
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:09,065
I have located the radiation source.
This entire ship is a Thalaron generator.

464
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:12,099
The activation matrix is on the bridge.

465
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:15,407
It's a weapon, then... And the download?

466
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,235
Shinzon believes he has
our communication protocols.

467
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:21,740
They'll give him inaccurate locations
for all Starfleet vessels.

468
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,835
- Good work.
- Sir...

469
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:32,177
Geordi fitted the prototype
for the Emergency Transport Unit.

470
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:35,000
Use this, sir, to return to the Enterprise.

471
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,847
- It'll only work for one of us.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,282
We'll find a way off together.

473
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:04,952
It is time for the procedure.

474
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:24,179
Move, puny human animal!

475
00:57:24,384 --> 00:57:28,137
A bit less florid, Data.

476
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,922
Kill him!

477
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:16,260
This way, sir. There is a shuttlebay
94 metres from our current position.

478
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:36,195
- There it is, sir!
- Go!

479
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:09,650
It has encrypted security.

480
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,652
Alacrity would be appreciated!

481
00:59:12,885 --> 00:59:17,329
Reman is a complex language
with pictographs as verb roots...

482
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,335
That's fascinating, Data,
but we really need that door open!

483
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:05,211
According to the ship's manifest,
they are Scorpion-class attack fliers.

484
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,222
- Data, what do you imagine this is?
- Port thruster.

485
01:00:26,157 --> 01:00:29,989
Would you like me to drive, sir?

486
01:00:41,706 --> 01:00:47,221
- Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
- Negative. A forcefield is now in place.

487
01:00:47,422 --> 01:00:50,429
Well, then... only one way to go.

488
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,384
- Is this wise, sir?
- We're about to find out.

489
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:08,722
- Power up the disruptors.
- Ready, Captain.

490
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:10,762
Fire!

491
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:51,483
Tractor beam!

492
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:56,219
Lock on transporter!

493
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:05,235
I have them.

494
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,762
- This has gone far enough!
- I thought we'd discussed patience.

495
01:02:20,974 --> 01:02:27,146
Mine is waning. We supported you as
you promised action. Yet you delay.

496
01:02:30,688 --> 01:02:37,608
The Enterprise is immaterial. They
won't make it out of the Neutral Zone.

497
01:02:37,815 --> 01:02:42,487
In two days, the Federation will be
crippled beyond repair.

498
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:44,947
Satisfied?

499
01:02:46,664 --> 01:02:49,945
- For the moment.
- And when I return

500
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:56,619
you and I shall have a little talk
about showing proper respect!

501
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:05,295
What's happening to his face?

502
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:13,481
Commander, a moment.

503
01:03:16,617 --> 01:03:20,289
Are you prepared
to have your hands drenched in blood?

504
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:26,019
He's not planning to defeat Earth.
He's planning its annihilation.

505
01:03:27,197 --> 01:03:30,664
His sins will mark us all, for generations.

506
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:41,835
The more I studied his DNA, the more
confusing it got. I drew one conclusion.

507
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:46,998
Shinzon was created
with temporal RNA sequencing

508
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:50,516
so that his aging
process could be accelerated

509
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:55,885
to reach your age more quickly
and skip 30 years of his life.

510
01:03:56,096 --> 01:04:01,485
But the sequencing wasn't activated,
so his cellular structure is decaying.

511
01:04:01,692 --> 01:04:05,445
- He's dying.
- Dying?

512
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,523
- Can anything be done for him?
- Only a complete transfusion

513
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:15,585
from the only donor
with compatible DNA... You.

514
01:04:21,427 --> 01:04:25,215
- How long does he have?
- I can't say for sure.

515
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,893
But the rate of decay is accelerating.

516
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:35,717
Then he'll come for me.

517
01:04:50,588 --> 01:04:52,288
I know.

518
01:05:02,177 --> 01:05:07,338
- Brother, I cannot move.
- No.

519
01:05:07,554 --> 01:05:11,972
I have only activated your cognitive
and communications subroutines.

520
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:15,385
- Why?
- Because you are dangerous.

521
01:05:15,592 --> 01:05:17,507
Why?

522
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:22,940
You were programmed to gather
information to use against this ship.

523
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:26,190
I do not understand.

524
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,467
It's called a cascading biogenic pulse.

525
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:52,684
Thalaron's properties allow the energy
beam to expand almost without limit.

526
01:05:52,902 --> 01:05:57,981
Depending on its radiant intensity,
it could encompass a ship.

527
01:05:58,192 --> 01:06:01,157
Or a planet.

528
01:06:01,364 --> 01:06:09,338
He'd only have built such a weapon
for one reason. He's going after Earth.

529
01:06:09,543 --> 01:06:14,507
- How can you be certain?
- I know how he thinks.

530
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:18,300
Destroy humanity,
you cripple the Federation.

531
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,706
- The Romulans invade.
- No way of penetrating his cloak?

532
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:24,385
No.

533
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,376
He could be close to every Starfleet ship
and they'd never know.

534
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:37,692
We do have one advantage.
He needs your blood to live.

535
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:42,976
- He might come after you first.
- I'm counting on it.

536
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:47,141
We've been ordered to sector 10-45
to meet our fleet.

537
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:50,070
- Strength in numbers.
- So we hope.

538
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:55,909
He must not be allowed
to use that weapon.

539
01:06:56,139 --> 01:06:59,422
All other concerns are secondary.

540
01:07:02,882 --> 01:07:04,545
Understand?

541
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:13,137
Yes, sir.

542
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:19,594
All hands, battle stations.

543
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:35,414
Initiate the forcefield!

544
01:07:54,523 --> 01:07:59,603
Captain's personal log. We're heading
for Federation space at maximum warp.

545
01:07:59,813 --> 01:08:03,856
The crew has responded with
the dedication I've come to expect.

546
01:08:04,072 --> 01:08:09,362
Like a thousand other commanders
on other battlefields, I wait for the dawn.

547
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:34,626
How long?

548
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:42,885
A matter of hours...
We must begin the procedure now.

549
01:08:49,077 --> 01:08:52,159
How long until we reach the Rift?

550
01:08:53,525 --> 01:08:55,988
Seven minutes.

551
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,164
Data, what's our current position?

552
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:26,005
How soon until we reach the fleet?

553
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:32,440
At our current velocity, we will
arrive at sector 10-45 in 40 minutes.

554
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:43,373
"For now we see
but through a glass darkly."

555
01:09:44,497 --> 01:09:49,041
- Sir?
- He said he's a mirror.

556
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:51,377
- Of you, sir?
- Yes.

557
01:09:53,221 --> 01:09:58,128
I do not agree. Although you share
the same genetic structure,

558
01:09:58,353 --> 01:10:00,969
your life has created an individual.

559
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:07,318
If I had lived his life, is it possible that
I would have rejected my humanity?

560
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,399
B-4 is identical to me, although his
neural pathways are not as advanced.

561
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,653
Even if they were, he would not be me.

562
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:21,567
- How can you be sure?
- I aspire, sir. To be better than I am.

563
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:25,738
B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

564
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:33,081
We are passing through the Bassen Rift.
The projection will return.

565
01:10:33,631 --> 01:10:36,298
It's interfering with our uplink?

566
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:39,429
The Rift affects all long-range...

567
01:10:41,796 --> 01:10:43,668
Evasive manoeuvres!

568
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:56,184
Target weapons systems and shields.
I don't want the Enterprise destroyed.

569
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:24,634
Can you learn to see in the dark?

570
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,188
- Report.
- He's cloaked. We can't get a lock.

571
01:11:29,677 --> 01:11:32,640
He hit our warp drive. We're on impulse.

572
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:36,801
Full phaser spread, zero elevation!
All banks on my mark!

573
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:40,483
Scan for shield impacts!
Stand by torpedoes!

574
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:43,648
Fire!

575
01:11:54,841 --> 01:12:00,256
You're too slow, old man.
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

576
01:12:17,328 --> 01:12:23,188
- We are losing dorsal shields!
- Full to port! Fire all ventral phasers!

577
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:38,083
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

578
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:40,744
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
Shields online.

579
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,945
Already on it.

580
01:12:44,268 --> 01:12:49,261
- Counsellor Troi, report to the bridge.
- Captain, we are being hailed.

581
01:12:50,603 --> 01:12:52,560
On screen.

582
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:59,935
Captain Picard, will you join me
in your ready room?

583
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:21,914
You can't trace
my holographic emitters, Captain.

584
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:28,007
And you can't contact Starfleet.
It's just the two of us now, Jean-Luc.

585
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:31,256
- As it should be.
- Why are you here?

586
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:37,516
To accept your surrender.
I can clearly destroy you at any time.

587
01:13:39,137 --> 01:13:43,194
Lower your shields and allow me
to transport you to my ship.

588
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:46,729
And the Enterprise?

589
01:13:46,944 --> 01:13:51,189
I have little interest
in your quaint vessel, Captain.

590
01:13:51,403 --> 01:13:53,650
Look at me.

591
01:13:56,206 --> 01:14:02,996
Your heart, your hands, your eyes
are the same as mine.

592
01:14:03,213 --> 01:14:07,206
The blood within you,
the raw material is the same.

593
01:14:07,412 --> 01:14:11,163
- We have the same potential.
- That's the past...

594
01:14:11,386 --> 01:14:13,511
It can be the future.

595
01:14:13,712 --> 01:14:17,972
Buried deep within you,
beneath the years of pain and anger,

596
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:23,529
there is something never nurtured: The
potential to make yourself a better man.

597
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:30,740
That is what it is to be human:
To make yourself more than you are.

598
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:38,024
Oh, yes, I know you.

599
01:14:39,752 --> 01:14:44,131
Once, you looked at the stars
and dreamed of what might be.

600
01:14:47,038 --> 01:14:52,887
Childish dreams, Captain.
Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus.

601
01:14:53,092 --> 01:14:55,675
I am what you see now.

602
01:14:55,886 --> 01:14:58,815
I see more. I see what you could be.

603
01:14:59,018 --> 01:15:05,627
The man who is Shinzon and Picard
could never annihilate an entire planet!

604
01:15:05,856 --> 01:15:10,100
- He's better than that!
- He's what his life has made him.

605
01:15:11,113 --> 01:15:16,027
And what will you do with that life?
Waste it in a blaze of hatred?

606
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:19,867
- There is a better way.
- It's too late!

607
01:15:20,077 --> 01:15:23,658
Never! Make the right choice now!

608
01:15:23,881 --> 01:15:28,537
- I can't fight what I am!
- Yes, you can!

609
01:15:32,054 --> 01:15:38,494
I'll show you my true nature.
Our nature.

610
01:15:38,725 --> 01:15:45,143
And as Earth dies, remember
I will always be Shinzon of Remus!

611
01:15:46,233 --> 01:15:53,717
My voice shall echo through time long
after yours has faded to a dim memory!

612
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:17,916
Two ships de-cloaking, sir! Romulan!

613
01:16:29,764 --> 01:16:31,091
Captain!

614
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,435
It gets worse.

615
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,516
- We are being hailed.
- On screen.

616
01:16:47,694 --> 01:16:51,039
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
of the warbird Valdore.

617
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:55,585
Might we be of assistance?

618
01:16:55,793 --> 01:16:56,994
Assistance?

619
01:16:57,211 --> 01:17:02,800
This is a matter of internal security.
We regret you've become involved.

620
01:17:05,844 --> 01:17:08,960
When this is over, I owe you a drink.

621
01:17:09,185 --> 01:17:13,050
Romulan ale, Captain. Let's get to work.

622
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:16,970
You heard the lady. Let's go to work!

623
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:34,326
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore.

624
01:17:34,537 --> 01:17:37,496
- Triangulate fire on shield impacts.
- Aye.

625
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,046
- Aft shields at 40%.
- Keep our bow on the Scimitar.

626
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:54,055
- Power to forward shields.
- Aye.

627
01:18:03,355 --> 01:18:06,515
Target the warbird.
All forward disruptor banks.

628
01:18:27,423 --> 01:18:30,551
- Forward shields at 10%!
- Bring us about!

629
01:18:40,231 --> 01:18:44,228
Drop cloak on aft port quadrant.
Prepare for emergency stop.

630
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:48,524
- What?
- You heard me!

631
01:18:56,492 --> 01:19:00,628
He's losing his cloak!
Stand by all forward disruptor banks!

632
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:10,074
- She's almost on us!
- Not yet.

633
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:16,755
- Praetor!
- Full stop! Fire!

634
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:40,445
Restore aft cloak. Full about.

635
01:19:43,829 --> 01:19:46,466
That drink will have to wait.

636
01:19:47,706 --> 01:19:50,796
- You have life support?
- For the moment.

637
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:53,801
- But we're crippled.
- Understood.

638
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:08,480
Losing structural integrity on decks
12 to 17, sections 4 to 10.

639
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:13,985
Forcefields holding.

640
01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:17,534
Evacuate those decks.
Re-route power to shields.

641
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:25,822
Captain, I may have a way to find them.

642
01:20:28,243 --> 01:20:33,551
Prepare for a lateral run.
All starboard disruptors.

643
01:20:40,518 --> 01:20:42,719
What is it?

644
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:47,606
She's here!

645
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:21,412
He's resisting me.

646
01:21:34,118 --> 01:21:39,935
- No!
- Remember me?

647
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:44,496
Now!

648
01:21:54,421 --> 01:21:55,747
Fire!

649
01:22:07,931 --> 01:22:09,922
Bring me Picard!

650
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:14,591
You!

651
01:22:16,779 --> 01:22:23,149
Get the cloak back! Target shield
coordinates Beta-3. All disruptors. Fire!

652
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,791
Ventral shielding lost on deck 29!

653
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:37,046
Compensate!

654
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:44,667
- Intruder alert!
- Number One.

655
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:49,309
- Let's go!
- Security detail to deck 29!

656
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:12,902
- The Romulans fought with honour.
- Yes, they did, Mr Worf.

657
01:23:54,913 --> 01:23:56,399
Cover me!

658
01:25:27,757 --> 01:25:29,291
Medics!

659
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:46,985
Report!

660
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:51,488
We have no photon torpedoes.
Phaser banks down to 4%.

661
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:55,157
If we targeted all phasers in a pattern?

662
01:25:55,365 --> 01:26:00,913
Scimitar shields are still at 70%.
It would make no difference, Captain.

663
01:26:09,341 --> 01:26:12,246
What's he doing?

664
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:25,384
He wants to look me in the eye.

665
01:26:29,567 --> 01:26:32,262
We've got him!

666
01:26:34,768 --> 01:26:40,283
He thinks he knows what I'm going to do.
Divert all power to the engines.

667
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:43,189
Even from life support. Give me it all.

668
01:26:47,837 --> 01:26:50,779
- Ready, Captain.
- We are being hailed.

669
01:26:52,257 --> 01:26:55,041
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.

670
01:26:57,997 --> 01:27:02,637
- I hope you're still alive, Jean-Luc.
- Oh, yes, I am.

671
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:08,055
Don't you think it's time to surrender?
Why should the rest of your crew die?

672
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:13,988
Shinzon, I don't think I ever told you
about my first Academy evaluation.

673
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:19,619
In particular, I was thought
to be extremely... over-confident.

674
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:23,899
As much as I enjoy listening to you talk,
I really think...

675
01:27:25,877 --> 01:27:29,904
On my mark, Deanna!
All hands, brace for impact!

676
01:27:33,172 --> 01:27:34,748
Engage!

677
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:55,109
Hard to port!

678
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:31,907
Divert all power to the engines.
Full reverse!

679
01:30:44,029 --> 01:30:46,603
Computer, stand by
auto-destruct sequence Omega.

680
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:53,453
Voice pattern Jean-Luc Picard.
Authorisation Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.

681
01:30:55,869 --> 01:30:58,630
Auto-destruct is offline.

682
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,640
Disruptors are not functional, sir.

683
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:28,277
Deploy the weapon.

684
01:31:29,532 --> 01:31:34,532
Kill everything on that ship.
Then set a course for Earth.

685
01:31:35,694 --> 01:31:40,104
We must complete our mission.

686
01:31:54,753 --> 01:31:57,329
Matrix initiated.

687
01:31:58,064 --> 01:32:03,096
Sequencing procedure for Thalaron
radiation transfer activated.

688
01:32:10,326 --> 01:32:14,279
Some ideals are worth dying for,
aren't they, Jean-Luc?

689
01:32:27,094 --> 01:32:29,712
Thalaron intermix procedure initiated.

690
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:35,038
Deployment
of targeting arms commencing.

691
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:00,228
How long until he can fire?

692
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:10,045
Targeting should take seven minutes.
When the arms are fully deployed...

693
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:15,844
...the matrix on the bridge will relay the
Thalaron radiation to the firing points.

694
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:19,171
No one on the Enterprise will survive.

695
01:33:23,145 --> 01:33:28,136
- How can he? He'll kill you.
- It's not about me any more.

696
01:33:31,152 --> 01:33:34,149
- Prepare a site-to-site transport.
- I don't think...

697
01:33:34,649 --> 01:33:37,399
- That's an order!
- Let me go.

698
01:33:37,619 --> 01:33:42,239
I have to do this... You have the bridge.

699
01:33:42,444 --> 01:33:46,859
Put some distance between you
and the Scimitar. Now, Mr La Forge.

700
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:48,626
Aye, sir.

701
01:33:57,552 --> 01:34:00,126
That's it! Transporters down.

702
01:34:08,862 --> 01:34:12,904
Counsellor Troi, assume command.
Geordi, come with me.

703
01:35:08,564 --> 01:35:13,288
Thalaron intermix levels 30%.

704
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:40,734
Four minutes to firing sequence.

705
01:36:20,993 --> 01:36:24,592
Thalaron intermix level 50%.

706
01:36:37,327 --> 01:36:40,127
Three minutes to firing.

707
01:37:01,018 --> 01:37:05,310
Thalaron intermix level 60%.

708
01:38:02,577 --> 01:38:04,617
Two minutes to firing sequence.

709
01:38:28,186 --> 01:38:32,136
Thalaron intermix level 80%.

710
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:01,627
I'm glad we're together now.

711
01:39:02,884 --> 01:39:05,972
Our destiny is complete.

712
01:39:16,153 --> 01:39:18,773
One minute to firing.

713
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:23,606
Thalaron intermix level completed.

714
01:39:41,019 --> 01:39:44,347
30 seconds to firing sequence.

715
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:59,564
- Goodbye.
- Ten...

716
01:39:59,779 --> 01:40:02,645
...nine... eight... seven...

717
01:40:03,782 --> 01:40:06,271
...six... five...

718
01:40:06,484 --> 01:40:07,992
...four... three...

719
01:40:35,568 --> 01:40:38,347
Data?

720
01:41:07,273 --> 01:41:08,582
Captain!

721
01:41:15,314 --> 01:41:17,934
It's Data.

722
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:42,136
- We're being hailed.
- On screen.

723
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:47,541
Open a channel.

724
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:54,590
This is Commander Donatra.
We're dispatching medics and supplies.

725
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,847
Thank you.

726
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:02,765
You've earned a friend
in the Romulan Empire today.

727
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:07,154
I hope the first of many. Valdore out.

728
01:42:12,996 --> 01:42:18,329
Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
for arrivals.

729
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:22,905
They don't know our procedures.

730
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,829
- Just open the doors.
- I'll take care of it.

731
01:42:29,051 --> 01:42:32,806
You have the bridge, Number One.

732
01:42:48,944 --> 01:42:51,063
Thank you.

733
01:43:02,617 --> 01:43:05,997
To absent friends.

734
01:43:09,385 --> 01:43:12,167
To family.

735
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:35,859
First time I saw Data, he was leaning
against a tree in the holodeck...

736
01:43:36,073 --> 01:43:38,024
...trying to whistle.

737
01:43:38,247 --> 01:43:40,865
Funniest thing I ever saw.

738
01:43:41,073 --> 01:43:45,957
No matter what he did,
he couldn't get the tune right.

739
01:43:46,162 --> 01:43:49,287
What was that song?

740
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,962
Can't remember the song.

741
01:44:23,908 --> 01:44:25,461
Come.

742
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:30,747
- Will.
- Permission to disembark, sir.

743
01:44:30,957 --> 01:44:33,417
Granted.

744
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:36,713
So, where's the Titan off to?

745
01:44:36,914 --> 01:44:40,588
The Neutral Zone.
We're heading up the new task force.

746
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:43,889
The Romulans are interested in talking.

747
01:44:44,094 --> 01:44:47,597
I can't think of a better man for the job.

748
01:44:47,802 --> 01:44:51,472
If I may, some advice
about your first command?

749
01:44:51,698 --> 01:44:53,149
Anything.

750
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:58,016
When your first officer insists
you can't go on away missions...

751
01:44:58,247 --> 01:44:59,859
Ignore him.

752
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,702
I intend to.

753
01:45:07,086 --> 01:45:11,131
Serving with you has been an honour.

754
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:16,140
The honour was mine, Captain.

755
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:34,979
I don't know if this has made sense.

756
01:45:35,188 --> 01:45:38,470
I wanted you to know the man he was.

757
01:45:38,698 --> 01:45:42,301
In his quest to be more like us...

758
01:45:42,537 --> 01:45:48,087
...he helped us to see
what it means to be human.

759
01:45:48,292 --> 01:45:53,899
My... brother was not human.

760
01:45:55,381 --> 01:45:58,161
No, he wasn't.

761
01:45:58,386 --> 01:46:03,677
But his wonder, his curiosity about
every facet of human nature...

762
01:46:03,884 --> 01:46:07,292
...allowed us to see
the best of ourselves.

763
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,184
He evolved.

764
01:46:10,386 --> 01:46:16,015
He embraced change because he always
wanted to be better than he was.

765
01:46:19,233 --> 01:46:24,596
I... do not understand.

766
01:46:29,573 --> 01:46:33,567
Well, I hope some day you will.

767
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:38,029
Captain, the warp engines are ready.

768
01:46:38,253 --> 01:46:41,219
Coming. Inform Commander La Forge.

769
01:46:46,502 --> 01:46:49,849
We'll talk later.

770
01:46:50,054 --> 01:46:53,921
Never saw the sun...

771
01:46:55,264 --> 01:46:59,181
Never saw the sun...

772
01:47:00,898 --> 01:47:04,764
Never saw the sun...

773
01:47:05,949 --> 01:47:12,399
- Shining so bright
- Shining so bright

774
01:47:12,613 --> 01:47:16,523
Never saw things...

775
01:47:19,211 --> 01:47:21,835
Going so right.

776
01:47:22,045 --> 01:47:25,570
Going so right
