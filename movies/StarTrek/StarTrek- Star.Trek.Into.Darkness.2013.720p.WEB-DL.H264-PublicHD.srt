2
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,546
Damn it, man! That was our ride!
You just stunned our ride!

3
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,331
Oh, great.

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,633
Run!

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,707
What the hell did you take?

6
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,390
I have no idea,
but they were bowing to it.

7
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,745
Kirk to Shuttle One.

8
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,213
Locals are
out of the kill zone.

9
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,216
You are clear. Repeat.

10
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:00,284
Spock, get in there, neutralize the
volcano and let's get out of here.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,694
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain

12
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,131
the shuttle wasn't built
for this kind of heat.

13
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,299
Captain, did the indigenous
life forms see you?

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,268
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

15
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,436
The Prime Directive
clearly states

16
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,903
there can be no interference

17
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,173
with the internal development
of alien civilizations.

18
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,574
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running

19
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,643
through the jungle
wearing a disguise!

20
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,347
Now drop off your super ice
cube and let's go! Kirk out!

21
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,581
You're good.

22
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,663
If we're gonna do this,
we've got to do it now!

23
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:34,853
This ash is killing our coils.

24
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,655
You sure you don't want me
to go instead?

25
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,490
That would be highly illogical
as I am already outfitted...

26
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,658
Spock, I was kidding.

27
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,762
You got this.
Guys! We have to go! Now!

28
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,240
They're trying to kill us!

29
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,643
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

30
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,558
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

31
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,227
<i>Raising shield 2. Mark 7.</i>

32
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,450
Do it, do it!

33
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,396
<i>Prerequisite change, 2-7-3.</i>

34
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,875
<i>Reduce descent. I repeat...
I can't hold this position.</i>

35
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,610
Spock, I've got to
pull you back up.

36
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,413
Negative. This is our only
chance to save this species.

37
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,975
If this volcano erupts,
the planet dies.

38
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,319
Pull him back up. Now!

39
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,768
<i>Spock, are you okay?</i>

40
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,975
I am,

41
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,912
surprisingly, alive.
Stand by.

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,013
We have to get him back.

43
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,381
I'll suit up.
I'm gonna go down.

44
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,549
We have to abandon the shuttle.

45
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,751
We can't just leave him, Sulu!

46
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,752
We don't have a choice!
Uhura, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,254
Spock, we're going back
to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

48
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,389
<i>We'll get you out of there.</i>

49
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,423
Captain,
I'm ditching the shuttle.

50
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,625
You've got to make it to the
<i>Enterprise on your own.</i>

51
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,360
<i>Wonderful!</i>

52
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,696
Uhura! You ready to swim?
I'm ready.

53
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:27,598
Jim!

54
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,336
Jim!
The beach is that way!

55
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,704
I know!
We're not going to the beach!

56
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,673
Oh, no, no, no!

57
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,480
I hate this!

58
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,713
I know you do!

59
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,858
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous it is

60
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,394
to hide a starship
on the bottom of the ocean?

61
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,896
We've been down here
since last night!

62
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:31,963
The salt water's
gonna ruin the...

63
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,965
Scotty! Where's Spock?

64
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,007
Still in the volcano, sir.

65
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,944
Captain on the bridge!

66
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,612
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel to Mr. Spock?

67
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,776
The heat's frying his comms,
but we still have contact.

68
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,052
Spock?

69
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,120
I have activated
the device, Captain.

70
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,588
When the countdown is complete,

71
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,124
the reaction should
render the volcano inert.

72
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,625
Yeah, and that's
gonna render him inert!

73
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,728
Negative, sir. Not with
these magnetic fields.

74
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,028
I need to beam Spock
back to the ship.

75
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,031
Give me one way to do it.

76
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,401
Uh, maybe if we had
a direct line of sight.

77
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,802
You're talking about
an active volcano!

78
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,737
Sir, if that thing erupts,

79
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,706
I cannot guarantee
we can withstand the heat!

80
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,776
I don't know that we can
maintain that kind of altitude.

81
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,076
Our shuttle was concealed
by the ash cloud,

82
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,745
but the <i>Enterprise</i>
is too large.

83
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,913
If utilized in a rescue effort,

84
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,682
<i>it would be revealed
to the indigenous specie.</i>

85
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,485
Spock, nobody knows
the rules better than you,

86
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,552
but there has got to be
an exception.

87
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,889
None. Such action violates
the Prime Directive.

88
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,158
Shut up, Spock! We're trying
to save you, damn it!

89
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,759
Doctor, the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

90
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,129
Spock, we're talking
about your life!

91
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,963
<i>The rule cannot be broken...</i>

92
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,733
Spock!

93
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,815
Try to get him back online.

94
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,637
Ninety seconds to detonations.

95
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,175
If Spock were here and I were
there, what would he do?

96
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,913
He'd let you die.

97
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,081
Spock!

98
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,083
You all right?

99
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,547
Captain, you let them
see our ship.

100
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,121
He's fine.

101
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:17,989
<i>Bridge to Captain Kirk.</i>

102
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,557
Yes, Lieutenant.

103
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,592
Is Commander Spock
on board, sir?

104
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,994
<i>Safely and soundly.</i>

105
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,261
Please notify him
that his device

106
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,345
<i>has successfully detonated.</i>

107
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,826
<i>You hear that?
Congratulations, Spock.</i>

108
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,735
You just saved the world.

109
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,738
You violated
the Prime Directive.

110
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,140
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us. Big deal.

111
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,767
I can save her.

112
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,905
What did you say?

113
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,207
Your daughter.

114
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,177
I can save her.

115
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,746
Who are you?

116
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,467
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

117
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,269
Jim!

118
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,471
You're not actually gonna
answer that, are you?

119
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,077
Spock, I'm telling you, this
is why he called. I can feel it.

120
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,246
Your feeling aside, I
consider it highly unlikely

121
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,414
that we will be selected
for the new program.

122
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,884
Why else would Pike
want to see us?

123
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,285
Forget about seniority.

124
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,988
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

125
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,090
I can think of
numerous possibilities.

126
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,926
A five-year mission, Spock!

127
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,162
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

128
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,230
Think how incredible that's gonna be.
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

129
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,034
"Uneventful."
Admiral?

130
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,336
It's the way you described the survey
of Nibiru in your captain's log.

131
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,338
Uh, yes, sir, I didn't want to waste
your time going over the details.

132
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,441
Tell me more
about this volcano.

133
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,177
Data says
it was highly volatile.

134
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,477
If it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

135
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,013
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

136
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,135
Something tells me it won't.

137
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,216
Uh, well, sir,
volatile is all relative.

138
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,219
Maybe our data was off.

139
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,586
Or maybe it didn't erupt

140
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,255
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

141
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,457
inside it right after
a civilization

142
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,195
that's barely
invented the wheel

143
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,096
happened to see a starship
rising out of their ocean!

144
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,232
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

145
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,868
Admiral...
You filed a report?

146
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,870
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,239
I incorrectly assumed that you would
be truthful in your captain's log.

148
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,441
Yeah, I would have been if I
didn't have to save your life,

149
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,144
and the very reason
I felt it necessary

150
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,345
to take responsibility
for the actions...

151
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,879
Take responsibility, yeah.

152
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,181
That'd be so noble, pointy,

153
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,615
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

154
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,418
"Pointy"? Is that
a derogatory reference to...

155
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,854
Gentlemen.

156
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,557
Starfleet's mandate is to explore
and observe, not to interfere.

157
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,359
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

158
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,493
the indigenous species
would never

159
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,561
have been aware
of our interference.

160
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,263
That's a technicality.

161
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,097
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

162
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,267
Are you giving me
attitude, Spock?

163
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,534
I'm expressing multiple
attitudes simultaneously, sir.

164
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,870
To which are you referring?

165
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,636
Out.

166
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,373
You're dismissed, Commander.

167
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,085
You have any idea what
a pain in the ass you are?

168
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,519
I think so, sir.

169
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,922
So tell me what you did wrong.

170
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,364
What's the lesson
to be learned here?

171
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,625
Never trust a Vulcan.

172
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,061
Now, see, you can't even
answer the question. You lied.

173
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,163
On an official report,
you lied.

174
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,398
You think the rules
don't apply to you

175
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,299
'cause you disagree with them.

176
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,634
That's why you talked me into
signing up in the first place.

177
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,370
It's why you gave me your ship.

178
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,938
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

179
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,009
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

180
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,110
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

181
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,913
You're missing the point.

182
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,246
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

183
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,948
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

184
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,450
in the first place!

185
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,219
You were supposed
to survey a planet,

186
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,488
not alter its destiny!

187
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,556
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

188
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,524
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

189
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,427
Except I didn't!

190
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,162
You know how many crew
members I've lost? Not one!

191
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,931
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

192
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,065
You think you can't
make a mistake.

193
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,466
It's a pattern with you!

194
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,668
The rules are for other people!
Some should be.

195
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,370
And what's worse
is you using blind luck

196
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,205
to justify your playing God!

197
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,510
Given the circumstances,

198
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,446
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

199
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,182
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

200
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,584
You understand what Starfleet
regulations mandate

201
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,466
be done at this point.

202
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,878
They've taken the <i>Enterprise</i>
away from you.

203
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,961
They're sending you
back to the Academy.

204
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,701
Admiral, listen...

205
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,673
I understand regulation, but
every decision I've made...

206
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,140
No! I can't listen!

207
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,043
You don't comply
with the rules,

208
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,078
you don't take responsibility
for anything,

209
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,580
and you don't
respect the chair.

210
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,250
You know why?

211
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,253
Because you're
not ready for it.

212
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,450
<i>Blue security clearance now
permitted for airlock access.</i>

213
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,786
I'm going to need
three titanium...

214
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,469
<i>Radiation
protection is required in this area.</i>

215
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,257
How did you find me?

216
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,739
I know you better
than you think I do.

217
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
The first time I found you
was in a dive like this.

218
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,201
Remember that? You got
your ass handed to you.

219
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,635
No, I didn't.

220
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,538
You don't? No, that's
not what happened.

221
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,941
That was an epic beating.
No, it wasn't.

222
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,942
You had napkins
hanging out of your nose.

223
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,678
Did you not?

224
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,714
Yeah, that was a good fight.

225
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,351
"A good fight."

226
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,556
I think that's your problem
right there.

227
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:31,996
They gave her back to me.

228
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,432
The <i>Enterprise.</i>

229
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,010
Congratulations.

230
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,461
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

231
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,752
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

232
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,020
He's been transferred.

233
00:20:58,356 --> 00:20:59,723
<i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

234
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,295
You're going to be
my First Officer.

235
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,365
Yeah, Marcus took
some convincing.

236
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,769
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

237
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,740
What did you tell him?

238
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,576
The truth.

239
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,911
That I believe in you.

240
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,049
That if anybody deserves a
second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

241
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,327
I don't know what to say.

242
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,963
That is a first.

243
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,701
It's going to be okay, son.

244
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,876
"Emergency session,
Daystrom."

245
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:55,645
That's us.

246
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,381
Yeah.

247
00:21:58,482 --> 00:21:59,650
Suit up.

248
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:14,865
<i>All Starfleet
personnel, please be advised,</i>

249
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,701
<i>- new security protocols are in effect.
- Captain.</i>

250
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,369
Not anymore, Spock.
First Officer.

251
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,807
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

252
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,108
It is fortunate
that the consequences

253
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,676
were not more severe.

254
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,944
You've got to be kidding me.

255
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:28,846
Captain, it was never
my intention...

256
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,580
Not Captain.

257
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,781
I saved your life, Spock.

258
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,683
You wrote a report,
I lost my ship.

259
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,788
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

260
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,657
to the fact that
I submitted the report.

261
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,792
No, I'm familiar
with your compulsion

262
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,863
to follow the rules. But
you see, I can't do that.

263
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,865
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

264
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,032
you don't stab him in the back.

265
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,402
Vulcans cannot lie.

266
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,670
Then I'm talking to the
half-human part of you.

267
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,704
All right?

268
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,375
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

269
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,510
Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, <i>U.S.S.
Bradbury.</i>

270
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,612
Guess you're with me.

271
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,781
Yes, Captain.

272
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:13,990
The truth is

273
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,560
I'm going to miss you.

274
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,038
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

275
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:32,509
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

276
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,611
Be seated.

277
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,083
By now, some of you have heard
what happened in London.

278
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,519
The target was
a Starfleet data archive.

279
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,619
Now it's a damned
hole in the ground,

280
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,454
42 men and women are dead.

281
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,923
One hour ago,

282
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,857
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

283
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,161
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

284
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,695
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

285
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,900
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

286
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,063
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

287
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,204
For reasons unknown, John
Harrison has just declared

288
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:04,607
a one-man war
against Starfleet.

289
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,744
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

290
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,548
to escape Federation space.

291
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,915
You here tonight represent
the senior command

292
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,951
of all the vessels
in the region.

293
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,519
And in the name
of those we lost,

294
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,189
you will run this bastard down.

295
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:23,626
This is a manhunt, pure and
simple, so let's get to work.

296
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,596
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

297
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,096
any warp signatures
leaving the system,

298
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,180
so we know he can't be far.

299
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,169
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

300
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,471
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

301
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,875
to run down every lead.

302
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,509
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

303
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,078
so the rules of engagement
are simple.

304
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,949
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

305
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,084
or the lives of those nearby,

306
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,019
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

307
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,088
What's in the bag?
James, not now.

308
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,990
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

309
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,726
It's like bombing a library.

310
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,760
Chris?
Everything okay there?

311
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,530
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk
is just acclimating

312
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,500
to his new position
as First Officer.

313
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,901
You got something to say,
Kirk, say it.

314
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,236
Tomorrow's too late.

315
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm fine, sir.
My apologies.

316
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,275
Spit it out, son.
Don't be shy.

317
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,746
Why the archive?

318
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,147
All that information
is public record.

319
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,711
If he really wanted
to damage Starfleet,

320
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,921
this could just
be the beginning.

321
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,823
The beginning of what,
Mr. Kirk?

322
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,759
Sir, in the event of an
attack, protocol mandates

323
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,561
that senior command gather
captains and first officers

324
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,063
at Starfleet H.Q.,
right here

325
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,233
- in this room.
- It is curious Harrison

326
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,477
would commandeer a jump ship
without warp capabilities...

327
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:45,910
Clear the room!

328
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,215
No!

329
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,953
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!

330
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,657
- Let's go!
- Cover me!

331
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,834
- Target acquired.
- Take him out!

332
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:11,796
Watch my flank!

333
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,338
- Go, go, go!
- Cover me!

334
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,351
Fire!

335
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,288
Yeah?

336
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,957
<i>Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something</i>

337
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,991
<i>in the wreckage
of Harrison's ship.</i>

338
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,894
<i>He has asked
to see us right away.</i>

339
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,165
Captain! I found this
in the crashed jump ship, sir.

340
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,201
This is how
the bastard got away.

341
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,468
What do you mean?

342
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,336
It's a portable
transwarp beaming device.

343
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,904
Well, can you
figure out where he went?

344
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,273
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

345
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,085
He's gone
to the one place we...

346
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,479
We just can't go.

347
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,351
Admiral, sir,
he's not on Earth.

348
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,888
He's on Kronos, sir.

349
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,557
I request my command
be reinstated

350
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,025
and your permission
to go after him.

351
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,595
Give us a minute.

352
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,964
Kronos.
Yes, sir.

353
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,467
So Harrison's gone
to the Klingon homeworld.

354
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,102
Is he defecting?
Uh, we're not sure, sir.

355
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,502
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

356
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,538
a region uninhabited
for decades.

357
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,440
He's gotta be
hiding there, sir!

358
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:17,641
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

359
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,175
it'd be all-out war.

360
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,010
Starfleet can't go after him,
but I can.

361
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,212
Please, sir.

362
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,518
All-out war with the Klingons
is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

363
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,186
If you ask me,
it's already begun.

364
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,654
Since we first learned
of their existence,

365
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,656
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

366
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,259
two planets that we know of

367
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,227
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

368
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,963
They are coming our way.

369
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,903
London was not an archive.

370
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,270
It was a top-secret
branch of Starfleet

371
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,207
designated Section 31.

372
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,942
They were developing
defense technology

373
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,911
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

374
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,177
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

375
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,580
who means to do us harm.

376
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,316
Harrison was one
of our top agents.

377
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,397
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

378
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,689
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

379
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,126
You should have
heard him defend you.

380
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,568
He's the one who talked you into
joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

381
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,031
Yes, sir.

382
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,953
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

383
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,006
His death is on me.

384
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:25,976
And yours can't be.

385
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,176
Sir, please. All I...

386
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,979
Mr. Spock,
you said the province

387
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,247
where Harrison is hiding
is uninhabited?

388
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,048
Affirmative, sir.

389
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,987
As part of our
defensive strategy,

390
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,721
31 developed
a new photon torpedo.

391
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,460
Long-range and untraceable,

392
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,996
it would be invisible
to Klingon sensors.

393
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:49,066
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

394
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,634
You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

395
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,970
you lock onto
Harrison's position,

396
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,239
you fire, you kill him
and you haul ass.

397
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,575
Permission to reinstate
Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

398
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,345
Granted.

399
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,086
Jim!

400
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:13,356
Where were you?
For what?

401
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,258
Your medical exam.

402
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,361
Ten hours ago, you were
in a damn firefight.

403
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,496
Now it's my duty as ship's...
I'm fine, Bones.

404
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,596
The hell you are.

405
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,233
I'm fine.

406
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,541
Status report,
Mr. Spock.

407
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,643
The <i>Enterprise</i> should be
ready for launch

408
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,479
by the time we arrive.

409
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,279
Good. Good.
Captain.

410
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,890
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

411
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,519
You're welcome.

412
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,223
As I am again your First
Officer, it is now my duty

413
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,986
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

414
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:53,663
There is no Starfleet regulation that
condemns a man to die without a trial,

415
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,432
something you and Admiral
Marcus are forgetting.

416
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,769
Also, preemptively
firing torpedoes

417
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,470
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

418
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,172
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

419
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,535
There's only gonna be
one casualty.

420
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:07,243
Our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

421
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,811
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

422
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,349
Regulations aside, this
action is morally wrong.

423
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,583
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

424
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,719
And I didn't win
any points for that.

425
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,056
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

426
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,389
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

427
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,824
and therefore
find my opinion valid.

428
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,492
I wasn't asking
for your opinion.

429
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,795
Bones, get that thing
off my face.

430
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,264
Captain, our mission could
start a war with the Klingons

431
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,333
and it is, by its very
definition, immoral.

432
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,168
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

433
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,336
to arrive at this
conclusion for yourself.

434
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,304
Captain Kirk.

435
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,608
Science Officer Wallace.

436
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,771
I've been assigned to the
<i>Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.</i>

437
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,344
These are my transfer orders.

438
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:45,181
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

439
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,416
I wish I had.

440
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,786
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

441
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,389
"Doctorate in applied physics"

442
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,157
"specializing in
advanced weaponry."

443
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,320
Impressive credentials.

444
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,195
Thank you.

445
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,463
But redundant now that I am
back aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

446
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,231
And yet, the more the merrier.

447
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,565
Have a seat, Doctor.
Thank you.

448
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:08,237
Shuttle crew,
stand by for lift-off.

449
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,894
No!
I'm not signing anything!

450
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,164
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

451
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,498
Is there a problem,
Mr. Scott?

452
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,567
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

453
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,835
that I cannot authorize any
weapons on board this ship

454
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,271
without knowing
what's inside them.

455
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,771
Mr. Scott raises
yet another point...

456
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,672
Report to the bridge.

457
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,742
Captain.

458
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,577
Mr. Scott,
I understand your concerns,

459
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,880
but we need these
torpedoes on board.

460
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,382
Due respect, sir, but photon
torpedoes run on fuel.

461
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,150
Now, I cannot detect
the type of fuel

462
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,652
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

463
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,186
because it's shielded.

464
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,588
Now, I asked for the
specifications, but he said...

465
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,525
It's classified.
It's classified.

466
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,425
So I said,
"No specs, no signature!"

467
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,262
Captain.

468
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,364
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

469
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,431
Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.

470
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,715
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

471
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,903
Get down!

472
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,572
Jim, your vitals are way off.

473
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,940
Report to the med bay.
Scotty!

474
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,842
I need you to approve
those weapons.

475
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,411
I don't have time
for a lecture, Scotty.

476
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,447
Do you know what this is?
It's a warp core.

477
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,518
It's a radioactive catastrophe
waiting to happen.

478
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,619
A subtle shift
in magnetic output

479
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,322
from, say, firing one or
more of six dozen torpedoes

480
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,192
with an unknown payload

481
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,425
could set off a chain
reaction which would kill

482
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,628
every living thing
on this ship.

483
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,829
Letting those torpedoes on board
the <i>Enterprise is the last straw!</i>

484
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,766
What was the first straw?
What was the...

485
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,800
There are plenty of straws.

486
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,603
How about Starfleet confiscating
my transwarp equation?

487
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,706
And now some madman's using
it to hop across the galaxy!

488
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,706
Where do you think
he got it from?

489
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,275
We have our orders, Scotty!

490
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,543
That's what scares me.

491
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,947
This is clearly
a military operation.

492
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,815
Is that what we are now?

493
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,177
'Cause I thought
we were explorers.

494
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,818
Sign for the torpedoes,
that's an order.

495
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:06,289
Right, well,
you leave me no choice

496
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,657
but to resign my duties.

497
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,659
Oh, come on, Scotty.

498
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,327
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

499
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,528
You're not giving me
much of a choice...

500
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,663
Will you just make an
exception and sign...

501
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,764
Do you accept
my resignation or not?

502
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,432
I do!

503
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,572
I do.

504
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,710
You are relieved,
Mr. Scott.

505
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,655
Jim,

506
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,326
for the love of God,
do not use those torpedoes.

507
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:59,376
<i>Attention. Warp
core anti-matter containment check</i>

508
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,476
<i>in three minutes.</i>

509
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,768
<i>Captain! I'm so sorry
about Admiral Pike.</i>

510
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,619
We all are.

511
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,260
Are you okay?
Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

512
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,063
Actually, Scotty just quit.

513
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,300
And your boyfriend's second-guessing
me every chance he gets.

514
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,675
I'm sorry,
that was inappropriate.

515
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:34,677
It's just sometimes I want to
rip the bangs off his head.

516
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,327
You know, maybe it's me. I...
It's not you.

517
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,784
It's not?

518
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,989
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?

519
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,090
I'd rather not
talk about it, sir.

520
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,824
Oh, my God!
What is that even like?

521
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,365
Your ears burning?

522
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,568
Captain on the bridge!

523
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:58,802
Captain.

524
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:03,106
Mr. Chekov. You've been
shadowing Mr. Scott.

525
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,375
You are familiar with the
engineering systems of this ship?

526
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,057
Affirmative, sir.

527
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,409
Good.

528
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,914
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.

529
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,952
Aye, Captain.

530
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:21,824
Retract all moorings,
Mr. Sulu.

531
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,460
Yes, sir.

532
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:31,534
<i>Docking clamps
one, two, and three are released.</i>

533
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,336
<i>All moorings retracted.</i>

534
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:44,646
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a shipwide channel.

535
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,750
Yes, sir.

536
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,617
<i>Mr. Chekov,
how we looking down there?</i>

537
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,786
All systems nominal, Captain.
<i>Copy that.</i>

538
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,088
Warp available at your command.

539
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,590
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</i>

540
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,164
All right. Let's ride.
Yes, sir.

541
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,253
Channel open, sir.

542
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,043
Attention,
crew of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

543
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,447
As most of you know,
Christopher Pike,

544
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,648
former captain of this ship
and our friend,

545
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:22,751
is dead.

546
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,054
The man who killed him
has fled our system

547
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,990
and is hiding
on the Klingon homeworld,

548
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,925
<i>somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.</i>

549
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,731
<i>We are on our way there now.</i>

550
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:38,668
<i>That our presence
go undetected.</i>

551
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,170
<i>Tensions between the Federation</i>

552
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:42,172
<i>and the Klingon Empire
have been high.</i>

553
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,907
<i>Any provocation could led
to an all-out war.</i>

554
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,190
I will personally lead
a landing party

555
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,224
to an abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos

556
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,795
where we will capture
the fugitive, John Harrison,

557
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,231
and return him to Earth

558
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,567
so he can face judgment
for his actions.

559
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:16,824
All right. Let's go get this
son of a bitch. Kirk out.

560
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,614
Captain, I believe you have
made the right decision.

561
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,697
If I can be of assistance, I would be
happy to accompany you on the away team.

562
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:32,621
You? Happy?

563
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,184
I was simply attempting to use
your vernacular to convey an idea.

564
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:38,126
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

565
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:51,039
<i>All personnel, prepare
for the closing of payload bay doors.</i>

566
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,884
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

567
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,186
What are you doing, Doctor?

568
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,922
Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
You misunderstand.

569
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,590
What are you doing
aboard this ship?

570
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,059
There is no record of you being
assigned to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

571
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,295
Really? That must be
some sort of mistake.

572
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,530
My conclusion as well,
Dr. Marcus.

573
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,601
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

574
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,003
Wallace is the surname
of your mother.

575
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,838
I can only assume
the Admiral is your father.

576
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,710
Mr. Spock.

577
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,581
I'm aware that I have
no right to ask this of you.

578
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,983
But please, he cannot
know that I'm here...

579
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,226
Engineering manually
dropped us out of warp, sir.

580
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,228
Mr. Chekov,
did you break my ship?

581
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,697
Sorry, sir.
I don't know what happened!

582
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,097
The core overheated.

583
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,000
I had to activate
the emergency stop.

584
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,601
It must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.

585
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,204
<i>Sorry, Captain.
Damn it.</i>

586
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,306
Mr. Sulu,
time to our destination.

587
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,974
Twenty minutes, sir.

588
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,909
That's 20 minutes in enemy
space we weren't counting on.

589
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,744
All right.
We better hop to it.

590
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,581
Where's Spock?
Here, Captain.

591
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,315
You're coming with me
to Kronos.

592
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,583
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

593
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,018
It's rusty, but it's good.

594
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,119
Good, you're coming, too.

595
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,121
This isn't going
to be a problem, is it,

596
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,188
you two working together?

597
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,724
Absolutely not.

598
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:18,226
Unclear.

599
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,976
I'll meet you
in the shuttle bay.

600
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,833
Jim, you're not actually
going down there, are you?

601
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,036
You don't rob a bank when the
getaway car has a flat tire.

602
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,773
I'm sure engineering
will have us all patched up

603
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,041
by the time we get back.

604
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,876
<i>Isn't that right,
Mr. Chekov?</i>

605
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,644
Yes, Captain.

606
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,487
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

607
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,615
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

608
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,851
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit

609
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,655
a targeted comm burst
to Harrison's location.

610
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,956
You tell him you have a bunch of real
big torpedoes pointed at his head

611
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,278
and if he doesn't play nice,
you're not afraid to use them.

612
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,894
Is that a problem?
No, sir.

613
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,458
I've just never sat
in the chair before.

614
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:56,833
You're gonna do great.

615
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,869
Jim! Wait!

616
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,239
You just sat that man down
at a high-stakes poker game

617
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,375
with no cards
and told him to bluff.

618
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,976
Now Sulu's a good man,
but he is no captain.

619
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,648
And enough with the metaphors, all right?
That's an order.

620
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,090
Mr. Sulu, make sure that
K'normian ship is ready to fly.

621
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,128
Acting Captain Sulu
to Shuttle Bay 2.

622
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,063
<i>Please have the trade ship
we confiscated during</i>

623
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,766
<i>the Mudd incident last month
fueled and flight ready.</i>

624
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,168
<i>Captain Kirk is
en route to you now.</i>

625
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:37,806
Ready to deploy, Captain.

626
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,742
Lieutenants,
lose the red shirts.

627
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:41,077
You are K'normian arms dealers.

628
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,344
Put those on.
Sir?

629
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,780
Look, if this thing goes south,

630
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,882
there can be nothing
tying us to Starfleet.

631
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,949
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

632
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:50,152
No, sir.
No, sir.

633
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,153
Good. Me, neither.

634
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,474
I am detecting a single life
sign in the Ketha Province.

635
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,476
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

636
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,211
this is most likely
John Harrison.

637
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,780
Mr. Sulu,
I think we found our man.

638
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:18,981
You let him know
you mean business.

639
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,315
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

640
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,721
Attention, John Harrison.

641
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,123
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>

642
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:30,226
A shuttle of
highly trained officers

643
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,762
is on its way to your location.

644
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:35,431
<i>If you do not surrender
to them immediately,</i>

645
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,333
<i>I will unleash
the entire payload</i>

646
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,869
<i>of advanced
long-range torpedoes</i>

647
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,505
<i>currently locked
onto your location.</i>

648
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:45,507
<i>You have two minutes
to confirm your complain.</i>

649
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,844
<i>Refusal to do so will result
in your obliteration.</i>

650
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,248
If you test me, you will fail.

651
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,922
Mr. Sulu,

652
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,858
remind me never
to piss you off.

653
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,898
We will arrive
at Harrison's location

654
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,398
in three minutes, Captain.

655
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,467
It is unlikely
that he will come willingly.

656
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,804
I calculate the odds of him
attempting to kill us at 91.6%.

657
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,340
Fantastic.

658
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,822
Good thing you don't
care about dying.

659
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,445
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear

660
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,047
what you said.
Oh, I didn't say anything.

661
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:27,349
Actually, I'd be happy
to speak if you're

662
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,418
Lieutenant, I would prefer
to discuss this in private.

663
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,554
You'd prefer not to
discuss this at all.

664
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:35,958
What never seems to require
your undivided focus...

665
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,059
I'm sorry, Captain,
just two seconds.

666
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,994
Okay... is us.

667
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,364
At that volcano, you didn't
give a thought to us.

668
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,266
What it would do to me
if you died, Spock.

669
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,302
You didn't feel anything.

670
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,271
You didn't care.

671
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,106
And I'm not the only one
who's upset with you.

672
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,440
The Captain is, too.

673
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:54,277
Wha... No, no, no.
Don't drag me into this.

674
00:46:55,878 --> 00:46:57,579
She is right.

675
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,882
Your suggestion that I do not
care about dying is incorrect.

676
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:02,851
A sentient being's
optimal chance

677
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,320
at maximizing their utility
is a long and prosperous life.

678
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,887
Great.

679
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,289
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

680
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,190
You misunderstand.

681
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:12,360
It is true I chose
not to feel anything

682
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,597
upon realizing that
my own life was ending.

683
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,432
As Admiral Pike was dying,

684
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,036
I joined with his consciousness

685
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:23,039
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

686
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:26,375
Anger. Confusion.

687
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,610
Loneliness.

688
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,880
Fear.

689
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,215
I had experienced
those feelings before,

690
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,918
multiplied exponentially

691
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,086
on the day
my planet was destroyed.

692
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,923
Such a feeling
is something I choose

693
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,626
never to experience again.

694
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:50,432
Nyota, you mistake
my choice not to feel

695
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,501
as a reflection
of my not caring.

696
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,206
Well, I assure you, the truth
is precisely the opposite.

697
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,512
What the hell was that?

698
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,250
What happened?
Where's their signal?

699
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,985
It cut out.
I'm working to get them back.

700
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,590
We are being pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

701
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,893
I thought this sector
was abandoned!

702
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,559
It must be a random patrol.

703
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,527
Hold on!

704
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,567
This ship has
no offensive capabilities.

705
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,501
It's got us.
Give me all six fuel cells.

706
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,103
Aye, Captain.

707
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,454
They're closing fast,
bearing 285!

708
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,806
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.

709
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,597
If you are suggesting
that we utilize the passage

710
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,630
between the
approaching structures,

711
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,565
this ship will not fit.
We'll fit.

712
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,068
Captain, we will not fit.
We'll fit, we'll fit!

713
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,690
I told you we'd fit. I am
not sure that qualifies.

714
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,262
Any sign of them?

715
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,297
- No. Which worries me.
- We lost them!

716
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,197
Or they're jamming
our scanners.

717
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,099
Or we lost them.

718
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,518
They're ordering us to land.

719
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,990
Captain, they're gonna
want to know why we're here.

720
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:56,458
And they're gonna torture us.

721
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,027
Question us.

722
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,195
And they're gonna kill us.

723
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,233
So we come out shooting.

724
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,206
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

725
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,608
There's no way we survive
if we attack first.

726
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:17,512
You brought me here
because I speak Klingon.

727
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,516
Then let me speak Klingon.

728
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,766
This isn't going to work.

729
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,467
It is our only logical option.

730
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,070
And if you interrupt her now,

731
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,105
you will not only incur
the wrath of the Klingons

732
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,840
but that of
Lieutenant Uhura as well.

733
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,873
Lieutenant.
Thanks, Captain.

734
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,697
Stand down.
How many torpedoes?

735
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,998
Stand down!

736
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:07,068
The weapons you threatened
me with in your message.

737
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,403
How many are there?

738
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,472
Seventy-two.

739
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:19,782
I surrender.

740
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:38,701
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

741
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,402
my friend,

742
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,438
I accept your surrender.

743
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,731
Captain!

744
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,873
Captain.

745
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,887
Cuff him.

746
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,009
- Bones, meet me in the brig.
<i>- Be right there.</i>

747
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,079
Lieutenant.

748
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:00,782
Contact Starfleet, let them know
we have Harrison in custody,

749
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,684
and we'll be on our way once
the warp core is repaired.

750
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:03,818
Yes, sir.

751
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:23,137
<i>- Why the hell did he surrender?
- I don't know.</i>

752
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,706
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

753
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,074
I want to know how.

754
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:28,210
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

755
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,510
You tell me.

756
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,221
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

757
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,105
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

758
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:02,244
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

759
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,146
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

760
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,916
How the hell do you know that?
Bones.

761
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,085
I think you'd find my
insight valuable, Captain.

762
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:15,891
We good?
Yeah.

763
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:18,659
Let me know what you find.

764
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,097
Ignore me and you will get
everyone on this ship killed.

765
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:32,074
Captain, I believe he will
only attempt to manipulate you.

766
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,876
I would not recommend engaging
the prisoner further.

767
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:35,143
Give me a minute.

768
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,925
Let me explain
what's happening here.

769
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,860
You are a criminal.

770
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,130
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

771
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:58,166
I was authorized to end you!

772
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:01,603
And the only reason
why you are still alive

773
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,271
is because I am allowing it.

774
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,842
So shut your mouth.

775
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,143
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

776
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,146
over and over
till your arm weakens?

777
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,081
Clearly you want to,
so tell me,

778
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,686
why did you allow me to live?

779
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,820
We all make mistakes.

780
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,557
No. I surrendered
to you because,

781
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,592
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

782
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,961
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

783
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,998
If you did not, then it
would be impossible for me

784
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,833
to convince you of the truth.

785
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:38,706
23-17-46-11.

786
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,710
Coordinates not far from Earth.

787
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:45,914
If you want to know
why I did what I did,

788
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,782
go and take a look.

789
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,851
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

790
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,155
I can give you 72.

791
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:55,257
And they're on board
your ship, Captain.

792
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,726
They have been all along.

793
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:02,097
I suggest you open one up.

794
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,380
Oh!
Hi!

795
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,791
You know what really
bothers me, though?

796
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,793
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

797
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:36,331
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

798
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,132
Just for trying
to do what's right!

799
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,768
And what did you do anyway?

800
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,003
You just stood there
like an oyster,

801
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,005
looking at me!

802
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,639
What?

803
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,010
Scotty, it's Kirk.
Oh, well now!

804
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:51,213
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!

805
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,880
<i>Did you hear that? I called
him Perfect Hair.</i>

806
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,115
Where are you?
<i>Where are you?</i>

807
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,018
Are you drunk?

808
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,887
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

809
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,155
I need you to help me out
with something.

810
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,255
Will you take
these coordinates down?

811
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:04,126
23-17-46-11.

812
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,661
Hmm.
<i>Are you writing?</i>

813
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,829
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?

814
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,199
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?

815
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:14,135
<i>Forty-six.</i>

816
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,304
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

817
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,880
but I have a feeling you'll
know it when you see it.

818
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,711
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

819
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,083
I will consider that
an apology.

820
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,364
And I will
consider that apology.

821
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,119
You are the one who quit.

822
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:34,456
You made me quit!

823
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:35,891
Mr. Scott?

824
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,726
Scott. Ah...

825
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:40,762
The nerve of that guy!

826
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,099
I am not doing that man
any favors!

827
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,467
No!

828
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,271
Ach! All right, then!

829
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,273
Are you out of
your corn-fed mind?

830
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,208
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

831
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,409
He killed Pike,
he almost killed you,

832
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,311
and now you think it's a good
idea to pop open a torpedo

833
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,480
because he dared you to.

834
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,849
Why did he
save our lives, Bones?

835
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,317
The Doctor does
have a point, Captain.

836
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,751
Don't agree with me, Spock.

837
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:04,954
It makes me very uncomfortable.

838
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,221
Perhaps you too should learn

839
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,023
to govern your emotions,
Doctor.

840
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,257
In this situation,
logic dictates...

841
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,726
Logic? Oh, my God!
There's a maniac

842
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,094
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

843
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,862
That's not it. I don't
know why he surrendered,

844
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,831
but that's not it.

845
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,034
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

846
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,902
But, Jim,
without Mr. Scott on board,

847
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,269
who exactly is qualified

848
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,739
to just pop open a four-ton
stick of dynamite?

849
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,208
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

850
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,309
in the torpedoes and she
is a weapons specialist.

851
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,010
Perhaps she could be
of some use.

852
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,414
What Admiral's daughter?

853
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:35,182
Carol Marcus.
Your new science officer

854
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:36,786
concealed her identity
to board the ship.

855
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,954
When were you
going to tell me that?

856
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,023
When it became relevant.
As it just did.

857
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:43,525
Are the torpedoes
in the weapons bay?

858
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,360
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

859
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:46,827
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

860
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,063
onto your ship to find out why.

861
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:50,065
I do apologize for that.

862
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:52,467
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

863
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,902
I'm Carol Marcus.

864
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,003
James Kirk.

865
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:55,903
Torpedoes.

866
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,875
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

867
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,344
then I heard he was developing
these prototype torpedoes.

868
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,012
Uh-huh. When I went to
confront him about it,

869
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:06,248
he wouldn't even see me.

870
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,016
That's when I discovered the
torpedoes had disappeared

871
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:10,485
from all official records.

872
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,887
And then he gave them to me.

873
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,356
You're much cleverer than your
reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

874
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,391
I have a reputation?

875
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,273
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

876
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,530
Christine, yes.
How is she?

877
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,364
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

878
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,365
She's much happier now.

879
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,101
That's good.

880
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:27,943
You have no idea who I'm
talking about, do you?

881
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:30,806
What... What are
we doing in here?

882
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,873
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?
Of course it is.

883
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,197
Would you please turn around?
Why?

884
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,344
Just turn around.

885
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,081
It's too dangerous
to try and open

886
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,184
one of these torpedoes
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

887
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,552
But there is
a nearby planetoid.

888
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,320
I can open one up there.

889
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,956
But I will need some help.

890
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,891
Turn around.

891
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:52,226
Now!

892
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,597
Captain on the bridge!

893
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,565
Mr. Sulu,

894
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,268
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

895
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,070
Yes, sir. They're moving
the torpedo into position now.

896
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,753
Good. Any activity
from the Klingons?

897
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,608
Not yet.

898
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,771
But if we're stuck here much
longer, they will find us.

899
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,112
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

900
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,614
we have Harrison in custody?

901
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,315
Yes, sir.
No response yet.

902
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:17,619
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

903
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:20,054
<i>Hello. Captain,
can you hear me?</i>

904
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,289
Mr. Chekov,
give me some good news.

905
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:25,226
We found the leak, sir, but
the damage is substantial.

906
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,494
We're working on it.

907
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:29,097
<i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

908
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,132
Uh, no, sir. But I accept
full responsibility.

909
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:38,139
Something tells me it wasn't your fault.
Stay on it.

910
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,621
Shuttle is standing by,
Captain.

911
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,978
Bones, thanks for helping out.

912
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,913
Dr. Marcus asked for the
steadiest hands on the ship.

913
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,447
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

914
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,349
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

915
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,085
there was no torpedo!

916
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,385
<i>Dr. McCoy,
may I remind you,</i>

917
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,021
<i>you are not there to flirt.</i>

918
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,143
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

919
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,992
<i>Bones!</i>

920
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:58,425
To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

921
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:59,994
we need to open the warhead.

922
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,429
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

923
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,898
Unfortunately for us,

924
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,199
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

925
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:06,333
Sweetheart, I once performed

926
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,436
an emergency C-section
on a pregnant Gorn.

927
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,038
Octuplets.

928
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,340
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

929
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:15,376
I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

930
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,112
Dr. McCoy, there's a
bundle of fiber optic cables

931
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,380
against the inner casing.

932
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,449
You'll need to cut
the 23rd wire down.

933
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:23,018
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

934
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,318
Do you understand?

935
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,221
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

936
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,389
<i>Dr. McCoy,</i>

937
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:30,025
<i>wait for my word.</i>

938
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:31,592
<i>I'm rerouting
the detonation process.</i>

939
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,661
Are you ready?
And raring.

940
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:35,931
Good luck.

941
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,266
Sir, the torpedo
just armed itself.

942
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,634
The warhead's gonna
detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

943
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:42,269
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!

944
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:47,442
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

945
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,311
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

946
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,612
Dr. Marcus,
can you disarm it?

947
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,547
I'm trying. I'm trying.

948
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,715
Jim, get her
the hell out of here!

949
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,351
No! If you beam me back,
he dies!

950
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:57,552
<i>Just let me do it!</i>

951
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:01,623
Ten. Nine. Eight.

952
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,125
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

953
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,561
Four. Three.
shooot!

954
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,170
Deactivation
successful, Captain.

955
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:17,505
Dr. McCoy,
are you all right?

956
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,179
<i>Bones!</i>

957
01:06:25,246 --> 01:06:26,380
Jim?

958
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:29,451
You're going to
want to see this.

959
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,657
<i>Delta team, deliver
your thrusters to loading dock 12.</i>

960
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,623
<i>U.S.S. Vengeance,
bridge crew</i>

961
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,458
<i>requesting entry
to construction hangar.</i>

962
01:07:46,461 --> 01:07:48,181
<i>You are cleared
to enter the hangar.</i>

963
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,606
<i>I need a welding team
on the number one nacelle.</i>

964
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,478
Holy sh...

965
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:08,083
What have we got?

966
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:11,351
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

967
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,554
and retrofitted
to hide this cryo tube.

968
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,923
- Is he alive?
- He's alive.

969
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,161
But if we try to revive him

970
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,229
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

971
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,231
This technology's beyond me.

972
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,100
How advanced, Doctor?

973
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:29,470
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

974
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:32,841
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

975
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,376
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

976
01:08:36,177 --> 01:08:37,311
He's 300 years old.

977
01:08:46,588 --> 01:08:47,949
Why is there a man
in that torpedo?

978
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,792
There are men and women

979
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,493
in all those torpedoes,
Captain.

980
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:53,728
I put them there.

981
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:58,273
Who the hell are you?

982
01:09:02,604 --> 01:09:04,905
A remnant of a time long past.

983
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,710
Genetically engineered
to be superior

984
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,246
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

985
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:17,385
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

986
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,454
For centuries we slept,

987
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,226
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

988
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,462
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

989
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,532
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

990
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,233
distant quadrants of space.

991
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,801
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

992
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,671
I looked up
"John Harrison."

993
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,206
Until a year ago,
he didn't exist.

994
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,274
John Harrison was a fiction

995
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:41,943
created the moment I was awoken

996
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,412
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

997
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:48,382
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

998
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,719
My name is,

999
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,220
Khan.

1000
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,529
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1001
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,199
ask a 300-year-old
frozen man for help?

1002
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,902
Because I am better.

1003
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,204
At what?
Everything.

1004
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,208
Alexander Marcus
needed to respond to

1005
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,277
an uncivilized threat
in a civilized time

1006
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,412
and for that
he needed a warrior's mind.

1007
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,280
My mind.

1008
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:22,483
To design weapons and warships.

1009
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,586
You are suggesting the Admiral

1010
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,621
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1011
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,789
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1012
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:31,426
He wanted to exploit
my savagery.

1013
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,229
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1014
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,796
You... You can't
even break a rule.

1015
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,998
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1016
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:42,636
Marcus used me
to design weapons.

1017
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:45,405
To help him realize his vision
of a militarized Starfleet.

1018
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,475
He sent you
to use those weapons.

1019
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:51,878
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1020
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:56,283
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1021
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:59,854
in enemy space, leading to
one inevitable outcome.

1022
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,456
The Klingons
would come searching

1023
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,490
for whomever was responsible,

1024
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,792
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1025
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:09,963
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1026
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:11,632
The war he always wanted.

1027
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:13,635
No. No.

1028
01:11:15,436 --> 01:11:18,872
I watched you open fire in a room
full of unarmed Starfleet officers.

1029
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,807
You killed them in cold blood!

1030
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,444
Marcus took my crew from me.

1031
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,747
You are a murderer!

1032
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,981
He used my friends
to control me.

1033
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:35,489
I tried to smuggle them
to safety

1034
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,923
by concealing them
in the very weapons

1035
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:38,592
I had designed,

1036
01:11:40,595 --> 01:11:42,396
but I was discovered.

1037
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:47,402
I had no choice
but to escape alone.

1038
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:53,541
And when I did, I had
every reason to suspect

1039
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:57,845
that Marcus had killed
every single one

1040
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:00,847
of the people I hold most dear.

1041
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,555
So I responded in kind.

1042
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:12,827
My crew

1043
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,730
is my family, Kirk.

1044
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,734
Is there anything you would
not do for your family?

1045
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,938
<i>Proximity alert, sir!</i>

1046
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,605
<i>There's a ship at warp
heading right for us.</i>

1047
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:27,475
- Klingons?
- At warp?

1048
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,409
No, Kirk.

1049
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:31,679
- We both know who it is.
<i>- I don't think so.</i>

1050
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,046
<i>It's not coming at us
from Kronos.</i>

1051
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:39,854
Lieutenant,
move Khan to med bay.

1052
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:40,988
Post six security officers
on him.

1053
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,890
Yes, Captain.

1054
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,792
Captain on the bridge!

1055
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,127
ETA of the incoming ship.

1056
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,662
Three seconds, sir.

1057
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:51,399
Shields.
Aye, Captain.

1058
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:16,850
They're hailing us, sir.

1059
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,527
On screen.

1060
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,729
Broadcast shipwide,
for the record.

1061
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,069
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1062
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,939
Admiral Marcus.
I wasn't expecting you.

1063
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,576
That's a hell of a ship
you got there.

1064
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,646
<i>That you'd taken Harrison into
custody in violation of your orders.</i>

1065
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,850
Well, we, uh...

1066
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:44,719
We had to improvise
when our warp core

1067
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,887
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1068
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,956
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1069
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,591
I don't take your meaning.

1070
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,958
Well, that's why
you're here, isn't it?

1071
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:53,795
To assist with our repairs?

1072
01:13:54,896 --> 01:13:56,764
Why else would
the head of Starfleet

1073
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,645
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1074
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,802
Captain,
they're scanning our ship.

1075
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:03,524
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?

1076
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:06,506
<i>Where is your prisoner, Ki?</i>

1077
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:07,942
Per Starfleet regulation,

1078
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:11,645
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1079
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:14,215
Well, shooot.

1080
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,818
You talked to him.

1081
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:21,555
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1082
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,057
<i>I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard,</i>

1083
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,594
<i>believing that
his superior intelligence</i>

1084
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:27,728
could help us protect ourselves

1085
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:28,930
from whatever came at us next.

1086
01:14:30,998 --> 01:14:33,501
But I made a mistake.

1087
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,203
<i>And now the blood of everybody
he's killed is on my hands.</i>

1088
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:38,706
So I'm asking you,

1089
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,208
give him to me

1090
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:43,610
so that I can end
what I started.

1091
01:14:47,515 --> 01:14:49,050
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1092
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,685
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1093
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,090
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1094
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,024
Start a war in the process?

1095
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,962
He put those people
in those torpedoes.

1096
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,697
<i>And I simply
didn't want to burden u</i>

1097
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,899
<i>with knowing
what was inside of the.</i>

1098
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,868
<i>You saw what this man
can do all by himself.</i>

1099
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,237
<i>If we woke up
the rest of his crew?</i>

1100
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:13,940
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1101
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:17,244
<i>He's playing you, so,
don't you see that?</i>

1102
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:20,981
<i>Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.</i>

1103
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:23,117
<i>And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence</i>

1104
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:24,985
<i>before anybody else
dies because of hi.</i>

1105
01:15:27,922 --> 01:15:29,923
Now, I'm going to
ask you again!

1106
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,792
One last time, son.

1107
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,530
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

1108
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:38,666
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

1109
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,604
He's in engineering, sir.

1110
01:15:45,673 --> 01:15:47,108
But I'll have him moved

1111
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,109
to the transporter room
right away.

1112
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:50,744
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1113
01:15:52,113 --> 01:15:54,015
- Do not drop those shields, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.

1114
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,181
Captain, given your awareness

1115
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,751
of Khan's true location
in the med bay,

1116
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,853
may I know
the details of your plan?

1117
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,255
I told Marcus we were bringing
a fugitive back to Earth.

1118
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,256
That's what we're going to do.

1119
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,824
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1120
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,860
Sir, if we go to warp,

1121
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:09,997
we run the risk of
seriously damaging the core!

1122
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,198
<i>Can we do it?</i>

1123
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,970
Technically, yes, but I
would not advise it, Captain.

1124
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,005
Noted.

1125
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,006
Mr. Sulu,
set course for Earth.

1126
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:20,908
Yes, sir.

1127
01:16:22,176 --> 01:16:23,610
Punch it.

1128
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:33,087
Well, at least
we're moving again.

1129
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,826
If you think you're safe
at warp, you're wrong.

1130
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:44,931
Lieutenant Uhura,
contact Starfleet.

1131
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,266
Tell them we were pursued
into the Neutral Zone

1132
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,902
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1133
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:48,802
Comms are down, sir.

1134
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:52,707
Permission to come
on the bridge.

1135
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,809
Dr. Marcus.

1136
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,077
He's gonna catch up with us,
and when he does,

1137
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,677
the only thing that's
gonna stop him destroying

1138
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,079
this ship is me, so you
have to let me talk to him.

1139
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:00,881
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.

1140
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,248
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship

1141
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,818
that has advanced
warp capabilities...

1142
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,819
Captain! I'm getting a
reading I don't understand.

1143
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,719
Where are we? We're 237,000
kilometers from Earth.

1144
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,954
Shields are dropping.
We're defenseless, sir.

1145
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:42,422
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1146
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:44,265
Where's the damage?
Major hull damage, Captain.

1147
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:52,733
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now! CREWMAN: Aye, sir.

1148
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,770
Captain! Stop! Everybody on
this ship is going to die

1149
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,051
if you don't let me
speak to him.

1150
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,908
Uhura, hail him.

1151
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,911
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1152
01:18:13,954 --> 01:18:16,690
<i>What are you doing on that ship?</i>

1153
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,024
I heard what you said.

1154
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:21,761
That you made a mistake

1155
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,724
and now you're doing
everything you can to fix it.

1156
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:25,899
But, Dad,

1157
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,373
I don't believe
that the man who raised me

1158
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:36,377
is capable of destroying a ship

1159
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,279
full of innocent people.

1160
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,347
<i>And, if I'm wrong about that,</i>

1161
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,270
then you're gonna have to
do it with me on board.

1162
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,921
<i>Actually, Carol, I won't.</i>

1163
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,057
Oh.

1164
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:54,328
Jim...

1165
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,171
Can we intercept the transport signal?
No, sir.

1166
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:58,832
Carol!

1167
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,069
<i>Captain Kirk,
without authorization</i>

1168
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,104
<i>and in league with
the fugitive John Harris,</i>

1169
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:05,872
<i>you went rogue
in enemy territory,</i>

1170
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,207
<i>leaving me no choice</i>

1171
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,342
<i>but to hunt you don
and destroy you.</i>

1172
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:11,444
<i>Lock phasers. Wait,
sir, wait, wait, wait!</i>

1173
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:15,483
<i>Target all left torpedoes
on the Enterprise bridge.</i>

1174
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,984
Sir, my crew was just...
Was just following my orders.

1175
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:20,421
I take... I take full
responsibility for my actions.

1176
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,143
But they were mine
and they were mine alone.

1177
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,525
If I transmit
Khan's location to you now,

1178
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:27,427
all that I ask
is that you spare them.

1179
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,203
Please, sir.

1180
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,207
I'll do anything you want.

1181
01:19:41,842 --> 01:19:43,377
Just let them live.

1182
01:19:45,212 --> 01:19:47,981
That's a hell of an apology.

1183
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:50,083
But if it's any consolation,

1184
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:51,525
I was never
going to spare your crew.

1185
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,221
<i>Fire when ready...</i>

1186
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:16,543
I'm sorry.

1187
01:20:24,418 --> 01:20:26,020
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1188
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:29,856
Someone in engineering just
manually reset our systems!

1189
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:32,158
What do you mean,
"someone"? Who?

1190
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:35,095
Their weapons have
powered down. Sir.

1191
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,898
Enterprise!
<i>Can you hear me? Scotty!</i>

1192
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:42,435
Guess what I found
behind Jupiter.

1193
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:44,470
You're on that ship!
<i>I snuck on.</i>

1194
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:46,105
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1195
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:47,841
against a Starfleet Admiral,
I'd really like

1196
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:49,844
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1197
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,145
You're a miracle worker.

1198
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:52,947
We're a little low
on power right now.

1199
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,113
<i>Just stand by. Stand by.</i>

1200
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,381
What do you mean,
"low on power"?

1201
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:56,583
What happened
to the <i>Enterprise?</i>

1202
01:20:56,586 --> 01:20:58,051
Call you back.

1203
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,188
Scotty!

1204
01:21:02,556 --> 01:21:05,859
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1205
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:07,293
Our options are limited,
Captain.

1206
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:08,895
We cannot fire
and we cannot flee.

1207
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,868
There is one option.

1208
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,469
Uhura,
when you get Scotty back,

1209
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,438
patch him through.
Yes, sir.

1210
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,560
Mr. Spock,
you have the conn.

1211
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:24,979
Captain, I strongly object.

1212
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,947
To what? I haven't
said anything yet.

1213
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,481
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1214
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:30,216
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1215
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:31,618
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1216
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:32,987
it is optimal for you to take

1217
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:34,954
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1218
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:37,257
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1219
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,391
with advanced combat abilities

1220
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,627
and innate knowledge
of that ship.

1221
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,630
This indicates that
you plan to align with Khan,

1222
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:45,032
the very man
we were sent here to destroy.

1223
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,432
I'm not aligning
with him, I'm using him.

1224
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,636
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."

1225
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,671
An Arabic proverb attributed
to a prince who was

1226
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,338
betrayed and decapitated
by his own subjects.

1227
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:55,141
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1228
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:57,077
I will go with you, Captain.
No, I need you on the bridge.

1229
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,179
I cannot allow you to do this.

1230
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,015
It is my function aboard
this ship to advise you

1231
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,181
on making the wisest
decisions possible,

1232
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:03,550
something I firmly believe

1233
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:04,918
you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1234
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,086
You're right!

1235
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,622
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1236
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,658
it's not logical.
It is a gut feeling.

1237
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,664
I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do.

1238
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:22,636
I only know what I can do.

1239
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:25,878
The <i>Enterprise</i> and her crew need someone
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1240
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,244
And it's not me.

1241
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,416
It's you, Spock.

1242
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,292
Tell me everything you know
about that ship.

1243
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,643
Dreadnought class.

1244
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:04,511
Two times the size,
three times the speed.

1245
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:07,280
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.

1246
01:23:07,283 --> 01:23:08,614
Unlike most Federation vessels,

1247
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:09,777
it's built solely for combat.

1248
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:13,686
I will do everything I can

1249
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:16,222
to make you answer
for what you did.

1250
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:24,364
But right now I need your help.

1251
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:25,733
In exchange for what?

1252
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:29,703
You said you'd do anything
for your crew.

1253
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:34,041
I can guarantee their safety.
Captain.

1254
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:38,578
You can't even guarantee
the safety of your own crew.

1255
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,939
Bones, what are you doing
with that tribble?

1256
01:23:47,354 --> 01:23:49,390
The tribble's dead.

1257
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,692
I'm injecting Khan's platelets
into the deceased tissue

1258
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,726
of a necrotic host.

1259
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,796
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I've ever seen,

1260
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,230
and I want to know why.

1261
01:24:02,703 --> 01:24:04,738
You coming with me or not?

1262
01:24:07,574 --> 01:24:09,643
You want to do what?

1263
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:11,177
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering

1264
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:12,712
the <i>Enterprise</i>
into position as we speak.

1265
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,715
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

1266
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,384
There's a cargo door,
hangar 7, access port 101A.

1267
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,219
You need to find the manual
override to open that airlock.

1268
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,422
Are you crazy?
Whoever you are.

1269
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:24,224
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.

1270
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,725
It is not gonna be all right.

1271
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,728
You want me to open
an airlock into space,

1272
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,230
whereupon I will freeze,
die and explode!

1273
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,332
Lieutenant, from our current
position, is it possible

1274
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,801
to establish contact
with New Vulcan?

1275
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:37,136
I'll do my best.
Thank you.

1276
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,574
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1277
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,210
Their systems
are still offline.

1278
01:24:43,212 --> 01:24:44,677
I'm aligning our ship now.

1279
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,515
Scotty, how we doing
over there?

1280
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:24,150
<i>Captain, I wish
I had better news.</i>

1281
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:26,153
<i>They've locked out access
to the ship's computer.</i>

1282
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:27,320
<i>They'll have full weapons in</i>

1283
01:25:27,721 --> 01:25:29,555
three minutes.

1284
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,125
That means next time
I won't be able to stop them

1285
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:32,567
destroying the <i>Enterprise.</i>
Stand by.

1286
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:37,864
Access port 101A
of the other ship.

1287
01:25:37,867 --> 01:25:39,699
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1288
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:41,635
Copy that. Scotty!

1289
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,871
I'm in the hangar.
Give me a minute.

1290
01:25:48,275 --> 01:25:50,344
I'm running. Stand by.

1291
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,355
Whoa, whoa,
hold on, now, Captain.

1292
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:05,259
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.

1293
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:07,594
It's four square meters, tops.

1294
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:09,529
It's gonna be like
jumping out of a moving car,

1295
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:11,465
off a bridge,
into your shot glass.

1296
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,865
It's okay.
I've done it before.

1297
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:16,502
Yeah, it was vertical.

1298
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,372
We jumped onto a...
It was a...

1299
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:21,207
It doesn't matter.
Scotty...

1300
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,310
Did you find the manual override?
The manual override, Scotty.

1301
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:24,711
Not yet, not yet.

1302
01:26:32,186 --> 01:26:33,619
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware there is

1303
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:35,655
a considerable debris field
between our ships.

1304
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:38,492
Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
It's not easy!

1305
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,573
Just give me two seconds,
all right, you mad bastard!

1306
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:50,938
Tell me this is gonna work.

1307
01:26:52,306 --> 01:26:53,739
I have neither the information

1308
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:55,775
nor the confidence
to do so, Doctor.

1309
01:26:55,778 --> 01:26:57,344
<i>Okay, Captain, stand by.</i>

1310
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:58,511
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1311
01:27:00,547 --> 01:27:01,948
Come on, come on, come on.

1312
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:03,649
Yes!

1313
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:04,850
<i>Okay, okay!
I'm set to open the door.</i>

1314
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:05,886
You ready?

1315
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:07,520
Are you?

1316
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,164
<i>Spock, pull the trigger.</i>

1317
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:14,394
Yes, Captain.

1318
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:21,707
Launching
activation sequence on

1319
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,270
<i>three,</i>

1320
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:24,570
<i>two,</i>

1321
01:27:25,405 --> 01:27:26,372
<i>one.</i>

1322
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:39,586
Sir, Kirk is headed
for collision at .432!

1323
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,149
Captain, there is debris
directly ahead.

1324
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:42,823
Copy that.

1325
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,395
Whoa! Jim,
you're way off course!

1326
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,596
I know, I know!
I can see that.

1327
01:28:00,007 --> 01:28:01,368
Don't move.

1328
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:05,378
Use your display compass,
Captain.

1329
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:06,579
You must correct precisely

1330
01:28:06,582 --> 01:28:08,782
- 37.243 degrees.
<i>- Got it.</i>

1331
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:09,949
I'm working my way back.

1332
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,960
Scotty, you're gonna be ready
with that door, right?

1333
01:28:15,922 --> 01:28:17,957
What are you doing in here?

1334
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,427
Wee bit of maintenance on the
airlock console. You're big.

1335
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:22,895
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1336
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:24,631
Captain,
he can't seem to hear you.

1337
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,552
I'm working on getting
his signal back. Stand by.

1338
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:31,305
- Damn it.
<i>- Captain, what is it?</i>

1339
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,907
My helmet was hit. Uhura, tell
me you have Mr. Scott back.

1340
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:38,612
<i>His communicator is working. I don't
know why he isn't responding.</i>

1341
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:40,947
What is that? Are you Starfleet
or private security?

1342
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:42,916
Show me your other hand. Because
you look like private security.

1343
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,451
Imminent collision detected!

1344
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:45,786
Khan, use evasive action!

1345
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,389
There is debris directly ahead.
I see it.

1346
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:56,329
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1347
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:57,331
I don't know, Commander.
I'm having trouble

1348
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,573
tracking him
in all this debris.

1349
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:00,734
Was Khan hit?

1350
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,101
We are trying to find him now.

1351
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:03,804
Captain, you need to adjust
your target destination

1352
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,639
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1353
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,498
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.

1354
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,657
Hitting your target destination
is mathematically impossible.

1355
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:25,692
Spock, if I get back,

1356
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,627
we really need to talk
about your bedside manner.

1357
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,095
Commander,
he's not going to make it.

1358
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:37,404
My display
is still functioning.

1359
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,905
I see you, Kirk, you're 200 meters
ahead of me at my one o'clock.

1360
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:41,708
Come to your left
a few degrees and follow me.

1361
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:55,889
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.

1362
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,524
Do you copy?
Do you copy? Scotty?

1363
01:29:58,527 --> 01:30:00,092
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1364
01:30:00,095 --> 01:30:02,061
open the door in ten, nine...
Scotty!

1365
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:04,430
That person counting down, what is that?
<i>...eight...</i>

1366
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,798
I think you're hearing
things, mate... seven...

1367
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:07,400
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1368
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:10,170
...six, five...
1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.

1369
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:11,837
Scotty, where are you?
...three...

1370
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,640
Do you copy, Scotty? Please!
<i>...two...</i>

1371
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:14,975
Sorry about this.
About what?

1372
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,176
Mr. Scott, open the door!
Open the door!

1373
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,377
<i>Mr. Scott, now!</i>

1374
01:30:38,832 --> 01:30:40,000
Welcome aboard.

1375
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,211
It's good to see you, Scotty.
Who is that?

1376
01:30:47,007 --> 01:30:48,475
Khan, Scotty.
Scotty, Khan.

1377
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:49,775
Hello.

1378
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:52,212
They'll know we're here.

1379
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,913
I know the best way
to the bridge.

1380
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,920
It's locked to stun.

1381
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,555
Theirs won't be.

1382
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:02,922
Try not to get shot.

1383
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:08,895
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1384
01:31:09,529 --> 01:31:10,896
On screen, please.

1385
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:12,498
Stand by.

1386
01:31:18,738 --> 01:31:19,905
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

1387
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,775
Mr. Spock.

1388
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:28,547
Admiral.

1389
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:32,792
I'll deal with you in a...

1390
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:37,657
I am ashamed
to be your daughter.

1391
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,096
Sir, we just had a hangar
door open on deck 13.

1392
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:47,701
Khan.

1393
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:49,735
They're going to have
full power and we're walking?

1394
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:51,037
The turbolifts
are easily tracked

1395
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:52,639
and Marcus would have us
in a cage.

1396
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,041
This path runs adjacent
to the engine room.

1397
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,676
They know they won't be able
to use their weapons here

1398
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:57,844
without destabilizing
the warp core,

1399
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,613
which gives us the advantage.

1400
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:02,215
Where'd you find this guy?
Oh, it's a long story.

1401
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:03,176
<i>I will be brief.</i>

1402
01:32:04,784 --> 01:32:07,220
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1403
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,827
<i>As you know,</i>

1404
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:16,095
<i>I have made a vow
never to give you information</i>

1405
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:18,597
<i>that could potentially
alter your destiny.</i>

1406
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,104
<i>Your path is yours to worth,
and yours alone.</i>

1407
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:29,842
<i>That being said,</i>

1408
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:35,649
<i>Khan Noonien Singh is
the most dangerous adversary</i>

1409
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,583
<i>the Enterprise ever faced.</i>

1410
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:41,654
<i>He is brilliant, ruthless,</i>

1411
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:44,056
<i>and he will not
hesitate to kill</i>

1412
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,792
<i>every single one of you.</i>

1413
01:32:49,796 --> 01:32:51,131
Did you defeat him?

1414
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,601
<i>At great cost. Yes.</i>

1415
01:32:57,637 --> 01:32:59,204
How?

1416
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:01,274
I don't mean to tempt fate
here, but where is everybody?

1417
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:02,809
The ship is designed to
be flown by minimal crew,

1418
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:03,909
one, if necessary.

1419
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:04,877
One? I...

1420
01:33:26,702 --> 01:33:28,635
You all right?
Yeah. Where's Khan?

1421
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:36,876
Lieutenant, I need you to
assemble all senior medical

1422
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:38,479
and engineering staff
in the weapons bay.

1423
01:33:38,878 --> 01:33:39,945
All right.

1424
01:33:42,048 --> 01:33:45,051
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently
activated a torpedo.

1425
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:46,386
Could you replicate
the process?

1426
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,820
Why the hell
would I want to do that?

1427
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:49,722
Can you or can you not?

1428
01:33:49,725 --> 01:33:52,391
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,
not a torpedo technician!

1429
01:33:52,394 --> 01:33:53,827
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1430
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:55,390
why I need you
to listen very carefully.

1431
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,796
Where is he?

1432
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,671
shooot!

1433
01:34:05,105 --> 01:34:06,206
This way.

1434
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,244
The minute we get
to the bridge, drop him.

1435
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:15,814
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.

1436
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,137
I'm pretty sure
we're helping him.

1437
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,127
Power coming online, sir!

1438
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:29,662
Retarget the <i>Enterprise</i> now.

1439
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:30,363
Aye, sir.

1440
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:45,712
Make sure he stays down.

1441
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,014
Excuse me.
Yeah.

1442
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,887
Admiral Marcus,
you're under arrest.

1443
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:56,690
You're not actually
going to do this, are you?

1444
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:00,859
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1445
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:03,328
You better stop and think about
what you're doing, Kirk.

1446
01:35:03,331 --> 01:35:05,431
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1447
01:35:05,434 --> 01:35:08,167
You made an incursion
onto an enemy planet!

1448
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,470
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1449
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:13,872
Even if you got away without
a trace, war is coming.

1450
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,243
And who is going
to lead us? You?

1451
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:19,145
If I'm not in charge,

1452
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:21,314
our entire way of life
is decimated!

1453
01:35:22,315 --> 01:35:25,118
So you want me off this ship,

1454
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,820
you better kill me.

1455
01:35:27,823 --> 01:35:29,154
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1456
01:35:31,057 --> 01:35:34,828
But I could stun your ass and
drag you out of that chair.

1457
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:36,930
I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1458
01:35:41,034 --> 01:35:42,801
You all right?
Yes, Captain.

1459
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:45,805
Jim!

1460
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:01,220
Listen! Wait!

1461
01:36:15,034 --> 01:36:17,804
You should have let me sleep.

1462
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,110
Where is the Captain,
Mr. Sulu?

1463
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,079
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.

1464
01:36:27,983 --> 01:36:31,117
<i>I'm going to make this
very simple for you.</i>

1465
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,853
Captain.
<i>Your crew for my crew.</i>

1466
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:35,454
You betrayed us.

1467
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:37,289
<i>Oh, you are smart,
Mr. Spock.</i>

1468
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,457
<i>Spock don't...</i>

1469
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:44,096
<i>Mr. Spock,
give me my crew.</i>

1470
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:47,332
And what will you do
when you get them?

1471
01:36:47,335 --> 01:36:50,002
<i>Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.</i>

1472
01:36:50,005 --> 01:36:51,871
Which, as I understand it,
involves the mass genocide

1473
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,807
of any being you find to be
less than superior.

1474
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:57,143
<i>Shall I destroy you,
Mr. Spock?</i>

1475
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:59,244
<i>Or will you give what I want?</i>

1476
01:37:02,182 --> 01:37:04,317
We have no
transporter capabilities.

1477
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:06,019
<i>Fortunately mine a
perfectly function.</i>

1478
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:08,921
<i>Drop your shields.</i>

1479
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:10,823
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1480
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:12,457
that you will not destroy
the <i>Enterprise.</i>

1481
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,993
Well, let's play this out
logically then, Mr. Spock.

1482
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:16,829
Firstly,
I will kill your Captain

1483
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:18,564
to demonstrate my resolve.

1484
01:37:18,567 --> 01:37:21,533
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice

1485
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:23,970
but to kill you
and your entire crew.

1486
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:25,971
If you destroy our ship,

1487
01:37:25,974 --> 01:37:28,207
you will also destroy
your own people.

1488
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:31,077
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive, mine does not.

1489
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:32,845
I will target your
life support systems

1490
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,280
located behind the aft nacelle.

1491
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:38,484
And after every single person
aboard your ship suffocates,

1492
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:42,354
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1493
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,326
Now,

1494
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:49,162
shall we begin?

1495
01:37:53,266 --> 01:37:54,434
Lower shields.

1496
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:00,573
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1497
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:12,085
I see your 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1498
01:38:12,087 --> 01:38:14,220
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.

1499
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,221
Vulcans do not lie.

1500
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:19,626
The torpedoes are yours.

1501
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:32,372
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1502
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:34,274
I have fulfilled your terms.

1503
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,208
Now fulfill mine.

1504
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:38,677
Well, Kirk,

1505
01:38:39,913 --> 01:38:42,015
it seems apt
to return you to your crew.

1506
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:43,682
After all,

1507
01:38:47,253 --> 01:38:50,355
no ship should go down
without her captain.

1508
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:54,399
He's locking phasers
on us, sir!

1509
01:39:00,967 --> 01:39:02,402
Let us out of here now!

1510
01:39:11,046 --> 01:39:13,179
Shields at 6%!

1511
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:14,948
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?

1512
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,114
Twelve seconds, sir!

1513
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:17,649
Crew of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

1514
01:39:17,652 --> 01:39:19,284
prepare for imminent
proximity detonation.

1515
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,253
What's he talking about?
What detonation?

1516
01:39:21,256 --> 01:39:22,935
The torpedoes. He armed
the damn torpedoes!

1517
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,167
No!

1518
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:43,310
Sir, their weapons
have been knocked out.

1519
01:39:44,444 --> 01:39:46,179
Not bad, Commander.
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1520
01:39:47,046 --> 01:39:49,015
Bones!
Bones!

1521
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:51,050
Nurse!
I got you. I got you.

1522
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:52,318
Dr. Marcus.

1523
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,355
Good to see you, Jim.

1524
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:57,390
You helped Spock
detonate those torpedoes?

1525
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:58,490
Damn right I did.

1526
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,259
He killed Khan's crew!

1527
01:40:00,261 --> 01:40:01,761
Spock's cold,
but he's not that cold.

1528
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:04,296
I've got Khan's crew.

1529
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:06,765
Seventy-two human popsicles

1530
01:40:06,768 --> 01:40:09,002
safe and sound
in their cryo tubes.

1531
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,569
Son of a bitch!

1532
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:19,345
Sir, the central
power grid is failing!

1533
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,780
Switch to auxiliary power.
Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1534
01:40:30,123 --> 01:40:32,091
Commander, our ship's
caught in Earth's gravity!

1535
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:33,658
Can we stop?
I can't do anything.

1536
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:45,238
Sorry! Oh, no.

1537
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,472
Clear the area!

1538
01:40:47,475 --> 01:40:50,176
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.

1539
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:52,478
Do you?
Yeah.

1540
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:53,746
Lieutenant, sound evacuation,
all decks.

1541
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,416
Aye, sir.

1542
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:59,484
As acting Captain, I order
you to abandon this ship.

1543
01:41:01,287 --> 01:41:03,422
I will remain behind
and divert all power

1544
01:41:03,425 --> 01:41:05,057
to life support
and evacuation shuttle bays.

1545
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,626
<i>Evacuation protocols...</i>

1546
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:09,462
I order you to
abandon the ship!

1547
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:12,398
All due respect, Commander,
but we're not going anywhere.

1548
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:14,367
<i>Attention all decks.</i>

<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1550
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:18,805
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!

1551
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:25,478
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!

1552
01:41:29,484 --> 01:41:31,250
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1553
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:32,685
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1554
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:35,121
<i>Proceed to exit bays</i>

1555
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:36,721
<i>and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1556
01:41:36,724 --> 01:41:38,356
There won't be time
for evacuation

1557
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:41,627
if we don't get power
to stabilize the damn ship!

1558
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:44,296
Can we restore it?
Only from engineering.

1559
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:46,832
We have to get back
to the warp core.

1560
01:41:46,835 --> 01:41:49,167
<i>Attention all decks.</i>

1561
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:50,403
Jim?

1562
01:41:52,305 --> 01:41:54,466
Scotty, we got to get
the power back on! Come on!

1563
01:42:11,824 --> 01:42:13,225
Scotty, we got to jump!
What?

1564
01:42:13,228 --> 01:42:14,694
Jump! Jump!

1565
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:16,229
Oh, God.

1566
01:42:17,797 --> 01:42:20,132
Emergency power at 15%
and dropping.

1567
01:42:20,135 --> 01:42:21,434
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1568
01:42:21,435 --> 01:42:23,668
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1569
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:25,505
<i>Proceed to exit bays</i>

1570
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:26,907
<i>and report to your

1571
01:42:39,619 --> 01:42:40,853
Jim?
Hold on!

1572
01:42:41,387 --> 01:42:42,587
I can't.

1573
01:43:01,442 --> 01:43:03,242
I've got you, Captain!

1574
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:04,510
Chekov.
Don't let go!

1575
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:17,489
Even if we get
the warp core online,

1576
01:43:17,492 --> 01:43:18,823
we've still got to
redirect the power!

1577
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:20,693
He's right, Captain!
What are you talking about?

1578
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,662
Someone has to hit
the manual override.

1579
01:43:22,663 --> 01:43:24,396
Uh, laddie, there's a switch...

1580
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:26,265
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!

1581
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:27,500
Let's go!

1582
01:43:30,438 --> 01:43:31,369
Oh, no.

1583
01:43:35,841 --> 01:43:38,211
Oh-yoy! Oh-yoy!

1584
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,751
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1585
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:47,619
<i>Proceed to exit bays</i>

1586
01:43:47,622 --> 01:43:49,021
<i>and report to your
assigned shuttle.</i>

1587
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:52,725
Mr. Sulu, divert any remaining
power to stabilizers.

1588
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:54,287
Doing what I can, sir.
Doing what I can.

1589
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:13,712
<i>Core misaligned. Danger.</i>

1590
01:44:13,715 --> 01:44:15,413
Oh, no, no, no, no!
What?

1591
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:16,815
The housings are misaligned!

1592
01:44:16,818 --> 01:44:18,783
There's no way
we can redirect the power!

1593
01:44:18,786 --> 01:44:21,453
The ship's dead, sir.
She's gone.

1594
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:25,323
No, she's not.
Wait, Jim!

1595
01:44:25,326 --> 01:44:27,893
If we go in there, we'll die!

1596
01:44:27,895 --> 01:44:30,395
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!

1597
01:44:30,398 --> 01:44:32,530
Will you listen to me? What
the hell are you doing?

1598
01:44:32,533 --> 01:44:33,932
I'm opening the door.
I'm going in.

1599
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:36,002
That door is there to stop us
from getting irradiated!

1600
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:37,869
We'd be dead
before we made the climb!

1601
01:44:40,673 --> 01:44:41,806
You're not making the climb.

1602
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:45,845
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1603
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:48,480
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1604
01:45:48,074 --> 01:45:50,009
If we don't get power
or shields back online,

1605
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:51,911
we're gonna be incinerated
on re-entry!

1606
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:00,679
Warp core is back online!

1607
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,042
Maximum thrusters,
Mr. Sulu!

1608
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:09,454
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!

1609
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:39,551
Shields restored!
Commander, power online.

1610
01:47:39,554 --> 01:47:41,052
Mr. Spock,
altitude stabilizing.

1611
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:43,189
It's a miracle.

1612
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:47,659
There are no such things.

1613
01:47:49,762 --> 01:47:51,162
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

1614
01:47:51,164 --> 01:47:52,730
<i>Mr. Spock!
Mr. Scott.</i>

1615
01:47:52,733 --> 01:47:55,667
<i>Sir, you'd better
get down here.</i>

1616
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:56,801
<i>Better hurry.</i>

1617
01:48:19,525 --> 01:48:21,060
Open it.

1618
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:22,795
The decontamination process
is not complete.

1619
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:23,863
You'd flood
the whole compartment.

1620
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:25,698
The door's locked, sir.

1621
01:48:55,261 --> 01:48:56,194
How's our ship?

1622
01:48:58,097 --> 01:48:59,597
Out of danger.

1623
01:49:02,135 --> 01:49:03,969
You saved the crew.

1624
01:49:06,072 --> 01:49:08,606
You used what he wanted
against him.

1625
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:14,279
That's a nice move.

1626
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:18,016
It is what you would have done.

1627
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,052
And this,

1628
01:49:23,055 --> 01:49:24,756
this is what
you would have done.

1629
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:27,192
It was only logical.

1630
01:49:33,766 --> 01:49:35,234
I'm scared, Spock.

1631
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:40,773
Help me not be.

1632
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:47,613
How do you choose not to feel?

1633
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,921
I do not know.

1634
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:00,759
Right now I am failing.

1635
01:50:08,033 --> 01:50:10,668
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1636
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:16,341
Why I went back for you.

1637
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:20,679
Because you are my friend.

1638
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:47,131
Khan!

1639
01:51:49,935 --> 01:51:51,069
God, that was close!

1640
01:51:54,908 --> 01:51:59,377
Set destination,
Starfleet Headquarters!

1641
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:02,413
<i>Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1642
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:03,782
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1643
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:05,417
Confirm.

1644
01:53:10,048 --> 01:53:12,484
Search the enemy ship
for signs of life.

1645
01:53:12,485 --> 01:53:14,051
Sir, there's no way
anyone survived.

1646
01:53:15,354 --> 01:53:16,287
He could.

1647
01:53:17,256 --> 01:53:18,189
Yes, sir.

1648
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:52,056
Whoa!
He just jumped 30 meters!

1649
01:53:52,059 --> 01:53:53,391
Can we beam him up?

1650
01:53:53,394 --> 01:53:54,393
There's too much damage.

1651
01:53:54,395 --> 01:53:56,228
I have no incoming signal.

1652
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:58,497
But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1653
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:00,131
Go get him.

1654
01:54:05,971 --> 01:54:08,372
Stand by for coordinates.
Yes, sir.

1655
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:11,210
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1656
01:54:11,212 --> 01:54:12,911
Coordinates confirmed.

1657
01:55:51,176 --> 01:55:52,644
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1658
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:50,435
Get this guy
out of the cryo tube.

1659
01:56:50,436 --> 01:56:52,003
Keep him in an induced coma.

1660
01:56:52,006 --> 01:56:53,704
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1661
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:55,306
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1662
01:56:55,309 --> 01:56:56,774
How much of Khan's blood
is left?

1663
01:56:56,777 --> 01:56:57,743
None.

1664
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:01,546
<i>Enterprise</i> to Spock. Spock!

1665
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:05,243
Activate
the cryogenic sequence.

1666
01:58:07,146 --> 01:58:09,346
McCoy to bridge.

1667
01:58:09,349 --> 01:58:12,117
I can't reach Spock.
I need Khan alive.

1668
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:14,586
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1669
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,622
I think he can save Kirk.

1670
01:58:17,623 --> 01:58:19,256
Can we beam them up
to the ship?

1671
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:21,326
Ah, they keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1672
01:58:21,328 --> 01:58:22,394
Can you beam someone down?

1673
01:58:57,497 --> 01:58:58,395
Spock!

1674
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:06,805
Spock!

1675
01:59:07,405 --> 01:59:10,175
Spock, stop! Stop!

1676
01:59:10,176 --> 01:59:11,743
He's our only chance
to save Kirk!

1677
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:24,523
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- It's a boy.</i>

1678
01:59:24,524 --> 01:59:28,326
<i>Your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1679
01:59:28,328 --> 01:59:31,630
<i>He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.</i>

1680
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,475
Oh, don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1681
01:59:44,478 --> 01:59:46,912
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1682
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:47,779
You were out cold
for two weeks.

1683
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:49,480
Transfusion?

1684
01:59:49,483 --> 01:59:51,582
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1685
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,818
Khan?

1686
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:55,487
Once we caught him,

1687
01:59:55,488 --> 01:59:58,222
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1688
01:59:58,225 --> 02:00:00,559
Tell me, are you feeling,
uh, homicidal?

1689
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,327
Power mad? Despotic?

1690
02:00:02,328 --> 02:00:03,728
No more than usual.

1691
02:00:04,462 --> 02:00:05,396
How'd you catch him?

1692
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:07,198
I didn't.

1693
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:18,510
You saved my life.

1694
02:00:18,511 --> 02:00:20,672
Uhura and I had something to
do with it, too, you know.

1695
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,716
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1696
02:00:24,717 --> 02:00:25,884
Spock, just...

1697
02:00:27,653 --> 02:00:28,853
Thank you.

1698
02:00:30,488 --> 02:00:32,457
You are welcome, Jim.

1699
02:00:43,868 --> 02:00:46,637
<i>There will always be
those who mean to do us ha.</i>

1700
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:51,408
<i>To stop them,</i>

1701
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:54,511
<i>we risk awakening the same
evil within ourselves.</i>

1702
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,721
<i>Our first instinct
is to seek revenge</i>

1703
02:01:03,724 --> 02:01:05,523
<i>when those we love
are taken from us.</i>

1704
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:10,395
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1705
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:14,032
<i>We are here today</i>

1706
02:01:14,033 --> 02:01:17,301
<i>to rechristen
the U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1707
02:01:17,304 --> 02:01:19,570
<i>and to honor those
who lost their lives</i>

1708
02:01:20,672 --> 02:01:23,274
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1709
02:01:23,277 --> 02:01:25,476
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1710
02:01:25,479 --> 02:01:27,345
<i>he had me recite
the Captain's Oath,</i>

1711
02:01:28,648 --> 02:01:30,948
<i>words I didn't appreciate
at the time.</i>

1712
02:01:32,284 --> 02:01:34,719
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1713
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:37,454
<i>who we once were,</i>

1714
02:01:39,557 --> 02:01:41,693
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1715
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:44,496
<i>And those words?</i>

1716
02:01:45,497 --> 02:01:49,400
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1717
02:01:49,403 --> 02:01:52,436
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

1718
02:01:53,506 --> 02:01:55,472
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1719
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:58,342
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1720
02:01:58,345 --> 02:02:02,479
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1721
02:02:02,481 --> 02:02:05,649
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

1722
02:02:08,887 --> 02:02:10,587
Captain on the bridge.

1723
02:02:14,092 --> 02:02:16,461
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1724
02:02:16,462 --> 02:02:17,962
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1725
02:02:17,963 --> 02:02:20,364
"Captain" does have
a nice ring to it.

1726
02:02:20,367 --> 02:02:21,533
Chair's all yours, sir.

1727
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:25,103
Mr. Scott.

1728
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:26,438
<i>How's our core?</i>

1729
02:02:26,439 --> 02:02:28,340
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1730
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:29,873
She's ready for a long journey.

1731
02:02:30,376 --> 02:02:31,810
<i>Excellent.</i>

1732
02:02:31,811 --> 02:02:33,912
Come on, Bones!
It's gonna be fun.

1733
02:02:35,613 --> 02:02:38,783
Five years in space.
God help me.

1734
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:40,051
Dr. Marcus.

1735
02:02:41,953 --> 02:02:43,873
Uh... I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1736
02:02:44,055 --> 02:02:45,422
It's nice to have a family.

1737
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:48,893
Spock.

1738
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:50,494
Captain.

1739
02:02:53,565 --> 02:02:54,832
Where shall we go?

1740
02:02:56,801 --> 02:02:59,436
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1741
02:03:01,806 --> 02:03:03,841
I defer to your
good judgment, Captain.

1742
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:15,453
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1743
02:03:15,854 --> 02:03:16,921
Aye, Captain.

1744
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,122
