1
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:22,034
USS Kelvin, go for Starfleet base.        Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,995
We sent you a transmission. Did you receive it?

3
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,394
Kelvin, can you double-check those readings?

4
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:28,189
Our gravitational sensors are going crazy here. You should see this.

5
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,686
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,384
What you've sent us doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,981
Yes mam, I understand. That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,775
Report.        Still outta visual range. 20 seconds.

9
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:41,069
Alert captain Robau that Starfleet advised to proceed with caution...

10
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,466
Polarize the view screen.

11
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:45,161
Whatever this is... Klingon origin?        Captain, we have visual.

12
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:48,456
Repeat. Could this be Klingon?        Negative, lieutenant.

13
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:50,289
You're 75000 kilometers from the Klingon border.

14
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,051
Captain, are you seeing this?

15
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:57,043
My God.

16
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,040
I have a reading. They've locked weapons on us!

17
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,204
Red alert!

18
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:23,300
Torpedo locked on us at 320'2!        Arm weapons!

19
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,693
Evasive pattern delta 5!

20
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,187
We're being cut like grass.

21
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:39,371
Fire all phasers! Damage report.

22
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:42,668
Warp drive's been knocked out. Never seen anything like this.

23
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,760
Weapons offline. Main power at 38%.

24
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:47,027
They're firing another!

25
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:48,459
All power to forward shields!

26
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,140
Help me...

27
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,929
maneuver has been lost.

28
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,927
Are shields even on?

29
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,960
decks 17 and 13, we have confirmed casualties.

30
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,615
11% and dropping. 10%.

31
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:10,621
Shields at 9%.

32
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:12,816
All remaining power to forward shields.

33
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,014
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

34
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,205
Hello.

35
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,901
My commander requests the presence of your captain...

36
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,597
in order to negotiate a ceasefire.

37
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,492
You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft.

38
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:30,489
Your refusal would be unwise.

39
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,864
Walk with me.

40
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:53,747
If I don't report in 15 minutes evacuate the crew.

41
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:56,644
Sir, we could...        There is no outpost out here.

42
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:00,337
Use autopilot and get off this ship.

43
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:01,835
Aye captain.

44
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:04,632
You're captain now, Mr. Kirk.

45
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,307
His heart rate is elevated.

46
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,867
Look at the ship.

47
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:48,959
Are you familiar with this craft?        Who is your commander?

48
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,651
Is that him?        I will speak for captain Nero.

49
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,307
Then ask captain Nero:

50
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:58,944
What gives him the right to attack a Federation vessel.

51
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:15,216
Do you know the location of ambassador Spock?

52
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:20,406
I'm unfamiliar with ambassador Spock.

53
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:25,000
What is the current star date?        Star date?

54
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:29,393
2233.04.

55
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,086
Where are you from?

56
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,273
Terminated.

57
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,432
Sir, they have a lock on our signal.

58
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:42,132
They're launching again.

59
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:44,268
Bravo 6 maneuver fire, full spread!

60
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,978
I'm initiating general order 13, we're evacuating!

61
00:06:57,978 --> 00:06:59,442
Sir.

62
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,829
All decks, this is the captain speaking, evacuate the ship immediately.

63
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,024
Get your... to the shuttlecraft. Begin evacuating...

64
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:11,134
That's George's voice. What's happening?

65
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,120
We'll deliver it in the shuttle. Go!

66
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,194
George.        You're OK, thank God.

67
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:30,425
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by. Get to it now. Can you do that?

68
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,086
Yes.        Everything's gonna be OK.

69
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:34,490
Do exactly as I say, shuttle 37.

70
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,480
George, it's coming.

71
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,675
Our baby. It's coming now.        I'm on my way.

72
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:50,757
Autopilot function has been destroyed. Manual operation only.

73
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:54,651
Clear those decks now! Get to the shuttles! Move! Move! Move!

74
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:01,437
That was a big one!        Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

75
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,935
And the baby too, right?        And the baby too.

76
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,422
Right here.

77
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,709
Captain to shuttle 37. Is my wife on board?

78
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,968
Yes sir, she is.

79
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,406
I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

80
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:24,699
We're waiting on you sir.        No, just go, take off immediately.

81
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,630
That's an order.        Yes sir.

82
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,994
Wait. We're not going yet.

83
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,985
Please stop.

84
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:38,676
George, the shuttle's leaving. Where are you?

85
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:42,772
Sweetheart, listen to me. I'm not gonna be there.

86
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:45,066
No.        This is the only way you'll survive.

87
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,961
Please don't stay on the ship. Come to me here.

88
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,192
The shuttles will never make it if I don't fight them off.

89
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:53,152
George, I can't do this without you.

90
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:56,049
OK, I need you to push now!

91
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:37,480
SYSTEMS FAILING

92
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,168
COLLISION COURSE ENGAGED

93
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,152
What is it?        It's a boy.

94
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:16,615
A boy?

95
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:22,706
Tell me about him.        He's beautiful.

96
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,899
George, you should be here.

97
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:29,793
Impact alert.

98
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:34,384
What are we gonna call him?        We can name him after your father.

99
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,181
Tiberius, you kiddin' me? No, that's the worst.

100
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:42,873
Let's name him after your dad. Let's call him Jim.

101
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:48,663
Jim. OK. Jim it is.

102
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:55,051
Sweetheart can you hear me?        I can hear...

103
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,149
I love you so much.

104
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,845
I love you!

105
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:05,258
IOWA

106
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:19,775
Hey, are you out of your mind? That car is an antique.

107
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:22,076
You think you can get away with this just because your mother's off planet.

108
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:25,673
You get your ass back home now! You live in my house buddy.

109
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,379
You live in my house and that's my car.

110
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,283
You get one scratch on that car and I'm gonna whip your ass...

111
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,494
Hey Johnny!

112
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:20,104
Citizen, pull over.

113
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:47,715
Noooo...!

114
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:15,826
Is there a problem officer?

115
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,826
Citizen, what is your name?

116
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,668
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

117
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:27,369
Vulcan

118
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,870
What is the formula for the volume of a sphere?

119
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,570
4/3 PI times the radius cubed...

120
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,971
1.26...
1.26...

121
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,778
What is the dimensionality...

122
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:00,777
Dimensionality equals the logarithm of n divided by...

123
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,711
non-excludability and non-rivalry...

124
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:04,778
...4/3 PI times the radius...

125
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,080
...is morally praiseworthy but not morally obligatory.

126
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,283
Spock.

127
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:17,783
I presume you've prepared new insults for today?

128
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,586
Affirmative.

129
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,289
This is your 35th attempt to illicit an emotional response from me.

130
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,504
You're neither Human nor Vulcan

131
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,091
and therefore have no place in this universe.

132
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,393
Look, his Human eyes. They look sad. Don't they.

133
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,995
Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimulate.

134
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,695
He's a traitor you know? Your father.

135
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:47,898
For marrying her. That Human whore.

136
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:19,312
They called you a traitor.

137
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:26,014
Emotions run deep within our race.

138
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:28,514
In many ways more deeply than in humans.

139
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:32,817
Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience.

140
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:38,421
The control of feelings... so that they do not control you.

141
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:44,621
You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan?

142
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:46,923
And yet you married a Human.

143
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,059
As ambassador to Earth it is my duty to observe

144
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:52,427
and understand Human behavior.

145
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:57,327
Marrying your mother was... logical.

146
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,927
Spock.

147
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:05,330
You are fully capable of deciding your own destiny.

148
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,834
The question you face is: Which path will you choose?

149
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:15,435
This is something only you can decide.

150
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:23,738
Spock. Come here, let me see you.

151
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:28,240
No.        Spock.

152
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:39,846
There's no need to be anxious. You'll do fine.

153
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:42,247
I am hardly anxious, mother.

154
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:45,409
And fine has variable definitions, fine is unacceptable.

155
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,048
Okay.

156
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:59,755
May I ask a personal query?        Anything.

157
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:05,356
Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr.

158
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,759
and purge all emotion?

159
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,160
I trust you will not feel it reflects judgment upon you.

160
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,163
Oh Spock.

161
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:26,965
As always, whatever you choose to be, you will have a proud mother.

162
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,368
You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors.

163
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:39,471
Your final record is flawless. With one exception.

164
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:43,275
I see that you have applied to Starfleet as well.

165
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,074
It was logical to cultivate more options.

166
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,624
Logical, but unnecessary.

167
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:51,077
You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.

168
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,413
It is truly remarkable Spock that you have achieved so much...

169
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,778
despite your disadvantage.

170
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:59,881
All rise.

171
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:07,483
If you would clarify, minister? To what disadvantage are you referring?

172
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:10,185
Your Human mother.

173
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,987
Council, ministers, I must decline.

174
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,690
No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this Academy.

175
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,976
But as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished.

176
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:26,291
Spock, you have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan way.

177
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,492
Why did you come before this council today?

178
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,394
Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?

179
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,596
The only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude.

180
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:39,999
Thank you, ministers, for your consideration.

181
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,700
Live long and prosper.

182
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:54,295
Iowa

183
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,810
Hi.        Hey there.

184
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:16,613
Hi. I'd like a Clabmin fire tea... 3 Budweiser Classics,

185
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:20,114
2 Cardassian sunrises and...

186
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,028
Try the Slusho, it's good.

187
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:23,018
A Slusho mix, thank you.

188
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:25,917
That's a lot of drinks for a woman.

189
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:29,818
And a shot of Jack, straight up.        Make that two. Her shot's on me.

190
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:32,319
Her shot's on her. Thanks, but no thanks.

191
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,455
Don't you at least wanna know my name before you completely reject me?

192
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,021
I'm fine without it.

193
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:40,724
You are fine without it. It's Jim, Jim Kirk.

194
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:46,227
If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up.

195
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:49,028
It's Uhura.        Uhura? No way.

196
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,263
That's the name I was gonna make up for you.

197
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:54,028
Uhura what?        Just Uhura.

198
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:55,643
They don't have last names in your world?

199
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,130
Uhura is my last name.

200
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,433
Well then you have... your first name's Human?

201
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,036
Excuse me buddy.

202
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:06,286
So, you're a cadet, your studying. What's your focus?

203
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,935
Xenolinguistics. You have no idea what that means.

204
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:13,839
The study of alien languages. Morphology, phonology, syntax.

205
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,740
Means you've got a talented tongue.

206
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,140
I'm impressed.

207
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,240
For a moment there, I thought you were just a dumb-hair colonial

208
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,277
who has sex with farm animals.

209
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,644
Well, not only.

210
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,345
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

211
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:32,280
Oh, beyond belief. But it's nothing I can't handle.

212
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:34,846
You could've handled me. That's an invitation.

213
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:36,234
Hey. You better mind your manners.

214
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:38,950
Oh relax cupcake, it was a joke.

215
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,750
Hey farm boy, maybe you can't count.

216
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:43,652
There are 4 of us and 1 of you.

217
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:47,452
So get some more guys and then it'll be an even fight.

218
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,856
Guys. Stop it.

219
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:56,656
Stop it!

220
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,268
Enough!

221
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:28,571
Guys, he's had enough.

222
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:35,874
Outside. All of you.

223
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,874
Now.        Yes, sir.

224
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,477
What...        I just bought a drink.

225
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,380
You all right, son?

226
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:47,380
You can whistle really loud, you know that?

227
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,980
You know I couldn't believe it when the bartender told me who you are.

228
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,384
Who the hell am I, captain Pike?        Your father's son.

229
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:59,183
Can I get another one?

230
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:01,684
For my dissertation I was assigned USS Kelvin.

231
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:05,887
Something I admired about your dad, he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

232
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,690
Sure learned his lesson.

233
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,423
Well that depends on how you define winning.

234
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,691
You're here, aren't you?        Thanks.

235
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,890
You know that instinct to leap without looking, that was his nature too...

236
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:17,125
and in my opinion something Starfleet's lost.

237
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:19,192
Why are you talking to me man?

238
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:22,595
Because I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor.

239
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:26,295
Your aptitude tests are off the charts, so what is it?

240
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:29,832
You like being the only genius level repeat-offender in the mid-west?

241
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,397
Maybe I love it.

242
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:35,000
So your dad dies, you can saddle for less than an ordinary life.

243
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,501
Or do you feel that you were meant for something better? Something special?

244
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,703
Enlist in Starfleet.        Enlist?

245
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:49,440
You guys must be way down on your recruiting quarter for the month.

246
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:51,405
If you're half the man your father was Jim,

247
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,808
Starfleet could use you.

248
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,710
You can be an officer in 4 years, you can have your own ship in 8.

249
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,445
You understand what the Federation is, don't you? It's important,

250
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:04,412
It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada.

251
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,647
We done?

252
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:09,315
I'm done.

253
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:16,616
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow,08:00.

254
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,122
Your father was captain of a starship for 12 minutes.

255
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:29,923
He saved 800 lives, including your mother's and yours.

256
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:33,726
I dare you to do better.

257
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,864
Nice ride man.

258
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:04,964
It's yours.

259
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:08,567
4 years? I'll do it in 3.

260
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,473
At ease gentlemen.

261
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,580
Never did get that first name.

262
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:48,127
You need a doctor.        I told you people,

263
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,585
I don't need a doctor, damn it. I am a doctor.

264
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:50,685
You need to get back to your seat.

265
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:52,519
I had one, in the bathroom with no windows.

266
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,692
I suffer from aviophobia.

267
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:55,886
That means fear of dying in something that flies.

268
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:59,188
Sir, for your own safety, sit down or else I'll make you sit down!

269
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,891
Fine.        Thank you.

270
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,392
This is captain Pike, we've been cleared for takeoff.

271
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:10,592
I may throw up on you.

272
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:13,994
I think these things are pretty safe.        Don't pander with me kid.

273
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:17,496
One tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

274
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:20,497
A solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats.

275
00:27:20,498 --> 00:27:23,397
And while you're sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles,

276
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:26,799
see if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding.

277
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,701
Space is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence.

278
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:31,762
Well I hate to break this to you,

279
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,605
but Starfleet operates in space.

280
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,605
Yeah, well... I've got nowhere else to go,

281
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:39,807
the ex wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce.

282
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:42,807
All I've got left is my bones.

283
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:52,311
Jim Kirk.        McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

284
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:14,934
Three years later.

285
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:42,167
Captain Nero. You've been requested on the bridge, sir.

286
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:45,236
Ayel says it's time.

287
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,038
Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates we calculated.

288
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:56,138
There's nothing here.        What are your orders?

289
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,740
We wait.

290
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,442
We wait for the one who allowed our home to be destroyed.

291
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:04,742
As we've been doing for 25 years.

292
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,344
And once we've killed him?        Kill him?

293
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:12,646
I'm not gonna kill him. I gonna make him watch.

294
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:28,653
Capture that ship.

295
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:32,056
Welcome back, Spock.

296
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,790
Why are you so happy?        I do not know what you're talking about.

297
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:40,657
No, I don't suppose you do.        Hello ladies.

298
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,893
I'm taking the test again.        You've got to be kidding.

299
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:44,859
Yeah, tomorrow morning. And I want you there.

300
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,061
You know I've got better things to do...

301
00:29:46,063 --> 00:29:48,161
than watch you embarrass yourself for the 3rd time.

302
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,560
I am a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

303
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:51,961
Bones, it doesn't bother you that no one ever passed the test.

304
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,648
Jim, it's Kobayashi Maru. No one passes the test.

305
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,766
And no one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds.

306
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,166
I've gotta study.

307
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,468
Study, my ass.

308
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:08,070
Jim, I think I love you.

309
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:11,471
That is so weird.        Lights.

310
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,107
Did you just say that is so weird.        Yeah, I did, but I...

311
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:16,972
You don't love me too?

312
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:17,973
Oh, no, my roommate.

313
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:19,244
I thought you said she was gone for the night.

314
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:21,207
Obviously she's not, quick, you gotta... just get under the bed.

315
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,478
Under...?        Look, just get under the bed.

316
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,278
She can't see you here.        Why not?

317
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,613
Because I promised her I'd stop bringing guys back to the dorm.

318
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:30,180
Well how... how many guys have y...?        Just d... just down.

319
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,517
Hey.        Hey. How are you?

320
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,682
Good.        Strangest thing...

321
00:30:36,682 --> 00:30:38,417
I was in the long range sensor lab.

322
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,282
Yeah, I... I thought all night...

323
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:41,911
I was tracking solar systems

324
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:44,885
and I picked up an emergency transmission.

325
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,685
Really?        Yeah.

326
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:48,787
From a Klingon prison planet.

327
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:49,988
No.        Yeah.

328
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:52,788
A Klingon armada was destroyed, 47 ships.

329
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:55,990
So, you're not going back to the lab tonight?

330
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,492
Gaila, who is he?        Who's who?

331
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,894
The mouth-breather hiding under your bed.

332
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,194
You could hear me breathing?        You.

333
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:08,394
Big day tomorrow.        You're gonna fail.

334
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:09,996
Gail, see you around.        Get out.

335
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:11,492
If I pass will you tell me your first name?

336
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:12,498
No. Good night.

337
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:16,800
I think the fact that you picked up a transmission is very impress...

338
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,150
We're receiving a distress signal from the USS Kobayashi Maru.

339
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:23,352
The ship has lost power and is stranded.

340
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:25,452
Starfleet command has ordered us to rescue them.

341
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:31,154
Starfleet command has ordered us to rescue them... captain.

342
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,027
Two Klingon vessels have entered the neutral zone...

343
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:36,052
and are locking weapons on us.

344
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:38,452
That's okay.        That's okay?

345
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,153
Yeah, don't worry about it.

346
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:42,257
Did he say don't worry about it?

347
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:44,556
Is he not taking the simulation seriously?

348
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:47,455
Three more Klingon war birds decloaking and targeting our ship.

349
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:49,398
I don't suppose this is a problem either?

350
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,657
They're firing, captain.

351
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,493
Alert medical bay to prepare to receive...

352
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,153
all crew members from the damaged ship.

353
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:56,453
And how do you expect us to rescue them...

354
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:58,954
when we're surrounded by Klingons... captain?

355
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,756
Alert medical.

356
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:05,159
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

357
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,357
I understand.

358
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,258
Should we, I don't know, fight back?

359
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:12,160
No.        Of course not.

360
00:32:18,663 --> 00:32:20,963
What is this? What's going on?

361
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,767
Hm. Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon war birds.

362
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:29,001
Yes, sir.        Jim, their shields are still up.

363
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:30,769
Are they?

364
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,970
No, they're not.        Fire on all enemy ships.

365
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:38,572
One photon each should do let's not waste ammunition.

366
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:40,971
Target locked an acquired on all war birds.

367
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,873
Firing.

368
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,973
All ships destroyed, captain.

369
00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:49,273
Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

370
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:52,576
So, we've managed to eliminate all enemy ships,

371
00:32:52,577 --> 00:32:54,577
no one on board was injured,

372
00:32:54,578 --> 00:33:00,579
and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is under way.

373
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,585
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

374
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:12,684
I do not know.

375
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:16,088
This session has been called to resolve a troubling matter.

376
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:18,788
James T. Kirk, step forward.

377
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,990
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council,

378
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,925
suggesting that you violated the ethical code of conduct

379
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:29,794
pursuing to regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.

380
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:33,194
Is there anything you care to say before we begin, sir?

381
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:38,797
Yes. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly?

382
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,299
Step forward please.

383
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,000
This is commander Spock. He is one of our most distinguished graduates.

384
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:53,003
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru exam for the last 4 years.

385
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,306
Commander.

386
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:59,462
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install and activate a subroutine...

387
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:00,230
in the programming code,

388
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,808
thereby changing the conditions of the test.

389
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,510
Your point being?        In academic vernacular. You cheated.

390
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,413
Let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to.

391
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,922
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

392
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:18,114
You programmed it to be unwinnable.

393
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:20,815
Your argument precludes the ability of a no-win scenario?

394
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,016
I don't believe in no-win scenarios.

395
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,465
Then not only did you violate the rules,

396
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:26,617
you also failed to understand the principle lesson.

397
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:28,117
Please, enlighten me.

398
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,326
You of all people should know, cadet Kirk,

399
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:32,922
a captain cannot cheat death.

400
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:38,322
I of all people?        Your father,

401
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:40,525
Lt. George Kirk assumed command of his vessel...

402
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:42,123
before being killed in action, did he not?

403
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,128
I don't think you like the fact that I beat your test.

404
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,527
Further more you have failed to define the purpose of the test.

405
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:49,929
Enlighten me again.        The purpose to experience fear.

406
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:54,230
Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear

407
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:57,231
and maintain control of oneself and one's crew.

408
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,632
This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.

409
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,135
Excuse me, sir.

410
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:13,838
We've received a distress call from Vulcan.

411
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,840
With our primary fleet engaged in the Laurentian system,

412
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,442
I hereby order all cadets to report to hangar 1 immediately.

413
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:21,943
Dismissed.

414
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:30,744
Who was that pointy-eared bastard?        I do not know.

415
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:33,148
But I like him.

416
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,650
Bracer, USS Farragut.

417
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,050
McCoy, USS Enterprise. McGrath, USS Walcott.

418
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:44,552
Spader, USS Hood.

419
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:46,755
Welcome to Starfleet. Godspeed.

420
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:51,255
He didn't call my name.

421
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:56,255
Commander, sir, you didn't call my name, Kirk, James T.

422
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:59,657
Kirk, you're on academic suspension, that means you're grounded

423
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,858
until the academy board rules.

424
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,360
Jim, the board will rule in your favor.

425
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:09,461
Most likely.

426
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:13,465
Look Jim, I've gotta go.

427
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:16,565
Yeah. Yeah, go. Be safe.

428
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:26,570
Excuse me.        Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

429
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,773
Damn it.

430
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,273
Come with me.

431
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:38,264
Uhura, USS Farragut.

432
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,876
Petrovsky, USS Antares.

433
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:42,376
Go to your stations and good luck.

434
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:49,079
Bones, where are we going?        You'll see.

435
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,981
Commander, a word?        Yes, lieutenant?

436
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:54,382
Was I not one of your top students?        Indeed you were.

437
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:57,184
And did I not on multiple occasions demonstrate...

438
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:59,391
an exceptional oral sensitivity, and I quote...

439
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:02,284
"an unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies...

440
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,121
in subspace transmission tests"?

441
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,588
Consistently, yes.

442
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,389
And while you were well aware that I'm qualified...

443
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:09,123
and desire to serve on the USS Enterprise,

444
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:11,188
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

445
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:14,391
It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.

446
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,992
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

447
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:23,195
Yes, I believe you are.        Thank you.

448
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:26,295
What are you doing?        I'm doing you a favor.

449
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:29,297
I couldn't just leave you there looking all pathetic. Take a seat.

450
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,128
Let me give you a vaccine against viral infection...

451
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,298
from the Ovaran mud flies.

452
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,699
What for?        To give you the symptoms.

453
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:37,802
What're you talking about?

454
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:39,702
You're gonna start to lose vision in your left eye.

455
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,101
Yeah, I already have.

456
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:44,103
Oh, and you're gonna get a really bad headache and flop sweat.

457
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:47,206
You call this a favor?        Yeah, you owe me one.

458
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:53,307
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise.

459
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:56,179
Medical code states the treatment and transport of a patient is...

460
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:59,108
to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician.

461
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,911
Which is me. So I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

462
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:04,512
Or you would you like to explain to captain Pike...

463
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,248
why Enterprise warped into a crisis...

464
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:09,114
without one of its senior medical officers?

465
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:12,615
As you were.        As you were. Come on.

466
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:32,425
I might throw up on you.

467
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:35,226
Jim, you've gotta look at this.

468
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:37,827
Jim, look.        What?

469
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:36,552
We need to get you changed.

470
00:39:36,552 --> 00:39:38,487
I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

471
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:41,054
Damn, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

472
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,161
Mr. Spock.        Captain.

473
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:04,164
Engineering reports ready for launch.        Thank you.

474
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:06,800
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden voyage of our newest flagship

475
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,867
deserves more pompon circumstance that we can afford today.

476
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:13,268
The christening will just have to be our reward for a safe return.

477
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:14,969
Carry on.

478
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,369
All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare for immediate departure.

479
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:18,670
Helm, thrusters.

480
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,271
retracted, captain, dock control reports ready.

481
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:24,273
Thrusters fired. Separating from space dock.

482
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:36,579
The fleet's cleared space dock, captain. All ships ready for warp.

483
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:39,181
Set course for Vulcan.        Aye-aye, captain.

484
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Course laid in.

485
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,681
Maximum warp. Punch it.

486
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,364
Lieutenant, where's helmsmen McKenna?

487
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:04,425
He has lung worms sir.

488
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:06,391
He couldn't report to his post.

489
00:41:06,391 --> 00:41:09,994
I'm Hikaru Sulu.        And you are a pilot, right?

490
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:14,594
Very much so, sir. I'm... I'm not sure what's wrong here.

491
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:16,896
Is the parking brake on?

492
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:17,996
No.

493
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:18,996
I figured it out, I'm just...

494
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:21,697
Have you disengaged the external inertial dampener?

495
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,101
Ready for warp, sir.        Let's punch it.

496
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:37,706
Where are we?        Medical bay.

497
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:38,567
This isn't worth it.

498
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:39,742
A little suffering's good for the soul.

499
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:41,206
Hi, how are you?

500
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:42,989
My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?

501
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,108
Well, those symptoms won't last long.

502
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:48,244
I'm going to give you a mild sedative.        Oh, I wish I didn't know you.

503
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:49,911
Don't be such an infant.

504
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,612
How long is it supposed to...

505
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,713
Unbelievable.

506
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,813
Engines at maximum warp captain.

507
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,215
Russian whiz kid, what's your name? Cheikov? Chirpov?

508
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:03,416
Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic, sir.        Fine.

509
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,416
Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic, begin ship wide mission broadcast.

510
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:08,619
Yes, sir. Happy to.

511
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,719
Ensign authorization code 95 Wictor Wictor 2.

512
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:14,920
Authorization not recognized.

513
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:21,724
Ensign authorization code 95 Victor Victor 2.

514
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:23,824
Access granted.

515
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:26,827
May I have your attention please.

516
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:32,427
At 22:00, telemetry detected an anomaly in the neutral zone.

517
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:36,128
What appeared to be a lightning storm in space.

518
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,371
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress signal

519
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:41,032
from the Vulcan high command

520
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:44,932
that their planet was experiencing seismic activity.

521
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:48,835
Our mission is to assess the condition of Vulcan

522
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:52,836
and assist in evacuations if necessary.

523
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:58,039
We should be arriving at Vulcan within 3 minutes. Thank you for your time.

524
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:01,039
Lightning storm.

525
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:04,242
Aah Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

526
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:07,844
Good God, man!        What? Aah!

527
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,844
What the hell's this?        A reaction to the vaccine. Damn it.

528
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:15,447
Nurse Chapel, I need 50cc of cortisone.

529
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:16,949
Yes, sir.

530
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,750
May I... Appeared to be a lightning storm in space.

531
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,851
We've gotta stop the ship.

532
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:27,853
Jim. I'm not kidding. You need to keep your heart rate down.

533
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,452
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

534
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:33,039
I haven't seen a reaction this severe since medical school.

535
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,056
We're flying into a trap!        Damn it, Jim! Stand still.

536
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:39,257
Stop it!

537
00:43:47,362 --> 00:43:49,574
Uhura, Uhura...        Kirk. What're you doing here?

538
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:51,413
Transmission from the Klingon prison planet, what exactly did it say?

539
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:53,766
Oh my God, what's wrong with your hands?

540
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,065
Who is responsible for the Klingon attack?

541
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:58,565
And was the ship Romu...?        Was the ship what?

542
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,601
What's happening to my mouth?        You got numb tongue?

543
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,867
Numb tongue?!        I can fix that.

544
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:04,905
Was the ship what?        Romulan.

545
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:06,471
What?        Romulan.

546
00:44:06,472 --> 00:44:07,572
Romulan?        Yeah.

547
00:44:07,572 --> 00:44:09,672
Yes.        Yeah!

548
00:44:44,086 --> 00:44:47,989
Prod Nero seven Federation ships are on their way.

549
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,172
Jim!        What's going on?

550
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:52,989
Jim, come back.        Captain!

551
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,590
Captain Pike, sir, we have to stop the ship.

552
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:57,092
Kirk, how the hell did you get on board the Enterprise?

553
00:44:57,092 --> 00:44:58,893
Captain, this man is under the influence of a...

554
00:44:58,893 --> 00:45:00,492
severe reaction to a vaccine.        Bones, plea...

555
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,592
He's completely delusional...

556
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:03,795
Vulcan is not a experiencing a natural disaster,

557
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:05,195
it's being attacked by Romulans.

558
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:06,733
Romulans? Cadet Kirk,

559
00:45:06,735 --> 00:45:08,597
I think you've had enough attention for one day...

560
00:45:08,597 --> 00:45:11,132
McCoy, take him back to medical. We'll have words later.

561
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:12,998
Aye captain.        Sir, that same anomaly...

562
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:15,097
Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel, captain...

563
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:16,498
Look, I get it, you're a great...

564
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,099
I'd love to do it again with you soon...

565
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:19,686
I can remove the cadet...        Try it!

566
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:21,300
This cadet is trying to save the bridge!

567
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:24,302
By recommending a full stop mid-warp doing a rescue mission?

568
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,038
It's not a rescue mission. Listen to me. It's an attack.

569
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,704
Based on what facts?

570
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:32,806
That same anomaly, a lightning storm in space

571
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:34,806
that we saw today, also occurred on the day of my birth.

572
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:37,809
Before a Romulan ship attacked the USS Kelvin.

573
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,909
You know that, sir. I've read your dissertation.

574
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:42,510
That ship, which had formidable and advanced weaponry...

575
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,411
was never seen or heard from again.

576
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:46,447
The Kelvin attacked a place on the edge of Klingon space.

577
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:49,114
And at 23:00 last night there was an attack.

578
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:53,014
47 Klingon war birds destroyed by Romulans, sir.

579
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,150
And it was reported that the Romulans were in one ship, one massive ship.

580
00:45:56,152 --> 00:45:59,119
And you know of this Klingon attack how?

581
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:04,820
Sir, I intercepted and translated the message myself.

582
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:07,755
Kirk's report is accurate.        We're warping into a trap, sir.

583
00:46:07,757 --> 00:46:10,724
The Romulans are waiting for us. I promise you that.

584
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:14,025
The cadet's logic is sound.

585
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:16,467
And Lt. Uhura's is unmatched in xenolinguistics.

586
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:18,126
We would be wise to accept her conclusion.

587
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:19,588
Scan Vulcan space.

588
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,226
Check for any transmissions in Romulan.

589
00:46:21,226 --> 00:46:24,829
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan.

590
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,764
What about you? Do you speak Romulan, cadet?

591
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,431
Uhura. All 3 dialects, sir.

592
00:46:28,431 --> 00:46:31,731
Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.        Yes, sir.

593
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:33,231
Hannity, hail the USS Truman.

594
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,869
All the other ships are out of warp sir and have arrived at Vulcan,

595
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:38,135
but we seem to have lost all contact.

596
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:40,668
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission

597
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,737
or transmission of any kind in the area.

598
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:45,637
It's because they're being attacked.

599
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,541
Shields up. Red alert.

600
00:46:53,442 --> 00:46:56,041
Arrival at Vulcan in 5 seconds.

601
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:59,646
4... 3... 2...

602
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:03,246
Emergency evasives.        Running, sir.

603
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:12,385
Damage report.        Deflector shields are holding.

604
00:47:12,385 --> 00:47:15,052
All stations. Engineering, Olson, report.

605
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:26,356
Full reverse. Come about starboard, 90?

606
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:28,458
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

607
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,467
Sir, there's another Federation ship.        Destroy it too.

608
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,467
Fire torpedoes.

609
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:52,666
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

610
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:55,869
Divert auxiliary power from port nossel to forward shields.

611
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:05,572
Sulu, status report.        Shields at 32%.

612
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:06,931
Their weapons are powerful, sir.

613
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:07,974
We can't take another hit like that.

614
00:48:07,974 --> 00:48:09,675
Get me Starfleet command.        Captain.

615
00:48:09,675 --> 00:48:12,574
The Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device

616
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:13,775
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

617
00:48:13,777 --> 00:48:15,798
It's signal appears to be blocking our communications

618
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,679
and transporter abilities.

619
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:19,380
All power to forward shields. Prepare to fire all weapons.

620
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:25,179
Weapons ready.

621
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,682
Wait!

622
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:30,083
Gohol, magnify!        Yes, sir.

623
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:36,485
Captain, we're being hailed.

624
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:40,088
Hello.

625
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:43,188
I am the captain Christopher Pike. To whom am I speaking?

626
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:45,489
Hi Christopher. I am Nero.

627
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,291
You've declared war against the Federation. Withdraw...

628
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,891
and I'll agree to arrange a conference...

629
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,590
with Romulan leadership at a neutral location.

630
00:48:51,592 --> 00:48:56,195
I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart.

631
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:01,197
As does your Vulcan crew member. Isn't that right, Spock?

632
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:06,599
Pardon me, I do not believe that you and I are acquainted.

633
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,199
No, we're not.

634
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,101
Not yet.

635
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:13,601
Spock, there's something I would like you to see.

636
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:19,105
Captain Pike, your transporter has been disabled.

637
00:49:19,106 --> 00:49:23,106
As you can see, by the rest of the armada, you have no choice.

638
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:27,909
You will man a shuttle. Come aboard the Narada for negotiations.

639
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,510
That is all.

640
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:40,813
They'll kill you, you know that.        Your survival is unlikely.

641
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:42,300
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.

642
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,914
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

643
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,617
I too agree. You should rethink your strategy.

644
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,318
I understand that.

645
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,420
I need officers who've been trained in advanced hand to hand combat.

646
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:53,820
I have training, sir.

647
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,820
Come with me.

648
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:58,222
Kirk, you too. You're not supposed to be here anyway.

649
00:49:58,222 --> 00:50:01,224
Chekov, you have the con.        Aye, Captain.

650
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:24,032
Prepare the red matter.

651
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:28,034
Yes, sir.

652
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:07,237
Without transporters we can't beam off the ship.

653
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:09,653
We can't assist Vulcan. We can't do our job.

654
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:12,338
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and engineer Olson

655
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,755
will space-jump from the shuttle.

656
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:17,556
You will land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere...

657
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:18,873
that's scrambling our gear,

658
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:20,759
you'll get inside, you'll disable it...

659
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:22,358
then you'll beam back to the ship.

660
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:25,760
Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the Enterprise.

661
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,460
Once we have transport capability and communication back up

662
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:31,461
you'll contact Starfleet and report what the hell's going on here.

663
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,561
And if all else fails, fall back...

664
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:35,597
and rendezvous with the fleet in the Laurentian system.

665
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,164
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

666
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:38,364
What?        Captain?

667
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:41,666
Please, I apologize. The complexities of Human pranks escape me.

668
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,766
It's not a prank, Spock.

669
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:46,969
And I am not the captain, you are.

670
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:49,371
Let's go.

671
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:54,170
Sir, after we knock out that drill, what happens to you?

672
00:51:54,172 --> 00:51:55,972
I guess you have to come and get me.

673
00:51:56,373 --> 00:51:59,474
Careful with the ship, Spock. She's brand new.

674
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:12,864
Dr. Puri, report.        It's McCoy.

675
00:52:12,865 --> 00:52:15,882
Doctor Puri was on deck 6. He's dead.

676
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:19,583
Then you have just inherited his responsibility as chief medical officer.

677
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,284
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

678
00:52:25,686 --> 00:52:29,887
Shuttle 89, USS Enterprise, you are clear...

679
00:52:31,688 --> 00:52:33,788
You've got the charges, right?        Oh yeah.

680
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:36,690
Can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.

681
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,492
Yeah.        Oh yeah.

682
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,300
So what kinda combat training do you have?

683
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,802
Fencing.

684
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:06,704
Pre-jump.

685
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:14,306
Shuttle commander, you are clear from USS Enterprise...

686
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,710
Gentlemen, we're approaching the drop zone.

687
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,610
You have one shot to land on that platform.

688
00:53:25,612 --> 00:53:26,923
They may have defenses,

689
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:28,914
so pull your chute as late as possible.

690
00:53:29,014 --> 00:53:32,715
3... 2... 1.

691
00:53:33,615 --> 00:53:35,907
Remember, the Enterprise won't be able to beam you back...

692
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:38,016
until you've turned off that drill.

693
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,420
Good luck.

694
00:54:02,228 --> 00:54:05,128
Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir.

695
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,231
20000 m.

696
00:54:31,242 --> 00:54:33,541
Approaching the platform at 5800 m.

697
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:37,744
Kirk to Enterprise. Distance to target 5000 m.

698
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,244
4600 m from the platform.

699
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,945
4100 m to target.

700
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:47,246
4000 m.

701
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,646
3000 m.

702
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:52,449
2000 m. Pull the chute.

703
00:54:57,351 --> 00:55:00,952
2000 m.        Pull your chute, Olson.

704
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:02,851
No, not yet. Not yet.

705
00:55:02,853 --> 00:55:06,155
1500 m.        Open the chute!

706
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:09,356
Olson, pull your chute!        1000 m.

707
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:23,561
Olson!

708
00:55:23,563 --> 00:55:26,264
Olson is gone, sir.

709
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:47,673
Kirk has landed, sir.

710
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:53,228
Gimme your hand.

711
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,532
Olson had the charges.

712
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:05,333
I know.

713
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,335
What do we do?        This.

714
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:24,739
The jamming signal's gone. Transport abilities are reestablished.

715
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,742
Transporter control is reengaged sir.

716
00:58:26,742 --> 00:58:28,547
Check all gravitational sensors.

717
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:29,778
I wanna know what they were doing to the planet.

718
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:32,744
Aye, Commander. Captain. Sorry, captain.

719
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:40,648
The drill's been sabotaged sir but we have reached the planet's core.

720
00:58:40,648 --> 00:58:43,150
Launch red matter.

721
00:58:56,655 --> 00:59:00,108
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched something at the planet...

722
00:59:00,108 --> 00:59:01,856
through the hole they just drilled.

723
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:04,858
Do you copy Enterprise?        Yes, sir.

724
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,559
Captain, gravitational sensors are off the scale.

725
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:13,362
If my calculations are correct, they're creating a singularity...

726
00:59:13,362 --> 00:59:16,864
that will consume the planet.

727
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:21,865
They're creating a black hole at the center of Vulcan?

728
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,367
Yes.

729
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:25,467
How long does the planet have?

730
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:29,070
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

731
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:32,271
Alert Vulcan command center to signal a planet wide evacuation...

732
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:33,362
all channels, all frequencies.

733
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:34,606
Spock, wait.        Maintain standard orbit.

734
00:59:34,606 --> 00:59:36,472
Yes, sir.        Where are you going?

735
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,273
To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

736
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,773
Their task is to protect our cultural history,

737
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:41,153
My parents will be among them.

738
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:42,202
Can't you beam them out?

739
00:59:42,202 --> 00:59:44,376
That is impossible. They will be in the Katric ark.

740
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:46,076
I must get them myself.

741
00:59:46,077 --> 00:59:49,378
Chekov, you have the con.        Aye.

742
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,614
Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us out of here.

743
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:56,581
Stand by, locking on your signal.

744
00:59:56,882 --> 00:59:59,382
Retract the drill. Let's move out        Yes, sir.

745
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:01,284
Fold up.

746
01:00:03,585 --> 01:00:06,585
I can't lock on to them. Don't move. Don't move!

747
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:08,887
Hey, Sulu!

748
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:17,891
Sulu!

749
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,293
Hold on.

750
01:00:23,793 --> 01:00:26,293
I've gotcha. Now pull my chute.

751
01:00:32,398 --> 01:00:34,304
Kirk to Enterprise!

752
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:36,699
We're falling without a chute!

753
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:37,760
Beam us up!

754
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:39,735
I'm sorry I can't lock on to your signal.

755
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:41,601
Beam us up!        You're moving too fast.

756
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:44,403
I can do that. I can do that!

757
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:46,402
Take the con.        Aye, sir.

758
01:00:46,403 --> 01:00:48,005
The black hole's expanding.

759
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:50,856
We won't reach minimum safe distance if we don't leave immediately.

760
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,907
Move. Move... I can do that. I can do that. Move. Move...

761
01:00:57,007 --> 01:01:00,309
Give me manual control, I can lock on. Beam us up!

762
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:04,510
Enterprise, where are you?        Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

763
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:09,512
Now! Now! Now! Do it now! Now! Now! Now!

764
01:01:09,512 --> 01:01:15,414
Hold on. Hold on. Compensating gravitational pull. Aaand...

765
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:20,317
Gotcha.

766
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:32,422
Thanks.        No problem.

767
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:37,224
Clear the pad. I'm beaming to the surface.

768
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:40,326
The surface of what?

769
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,427
What, you're going down there? Are you nuts?

770
01:01:43,427 --> 01:01:46,228
Spock, you can't do that.        Energize.

771
01:02:25,076 --> 01:02:26,277
Spock?

772
01:02:26,277 --> 01:02:28,646
The planet has only seconds left, we must evacuate.

773
01:02:29,347 --> 01:02:31,648
Mother, now.

774
01:02:52,492 --> 01:02:54,590
Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.

775
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:57,393
Locking on to you. Don't move. Stay right where you are.

776
01:03:03,393 --> 01:03:08,494
Transport in 5... 4... 3... 2...

777
01:03:10,293 --> 01:03:14,295
Mother!        I'm losing her! I'm losing her!...

778
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:17,295
I've lost her! I've lost her.

779
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:17,601
Acting captain's log, star date 2258.42.

780
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:21,802
We have had no word from captain Pike.

781
01:04:22,702 --> 01:04:24,367
I have therefore classified him a hostage...

782
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:26,902
of the war criminal known as Nero...

783
01:04:27,302 --> 01:04:29,277
Nero, who has destroyed my home planet

784
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:32,605
and most of its 6 billion inhabitants.

785
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,914
While the essence of our culture has been saved...

786
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:38,704
in the elders who now reside upon this ship...

787
01:04:40,704 --> 01:04:44,405
I estimate no more than 10000 have survived.

788
01:04:46,905 --> 01:04:51,206
I am now a member of an endangered species.

789
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:20,809
I'm sorry.

790
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:26,811
I'm so sorry.

791
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:44,913
What do you need. Tell me. Tell me.

792
01:05:52,813 --> 01:05:55,614
I need everyone...

793
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:59,614
to continue performing admirably.

794
01:06:05,246 --> 01:06:07,594
Okay.

795
01:06:26,018 --> 01:06:28,717
You must have a lotta questions for me.

796
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,818
I only have one for you.

797
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:37,217
I need the subspace frequencies of Starfleet's border protection grids.

798
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:40,619
Specifically those surrounding Earth.

799
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:44,918
Christopher, answer my question.

800
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,079
No, you answer for the genocide you just committed

801
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:48,155
against a peaceful planet.

802
01:06:48,155 --> 01:06:51,521
No, I prevented genocide.

803
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:58,722
In my time, where I come from, this is a simple mining vessel.

804
01:06:58,822 --> 01:07:02,121
I chose a life of honest labor.

805
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:06,021
to provide for myself and the wife who was expecting my child.

806
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:08,422
I was off planet doing my job...

807
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:10,922
while your Federation did nothing.

808
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:14,523
And allowed my people to burn while their planet broke in half.

809
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:17,722
And Spock, he didn't help us. He betrayed us.

810
01:07:17,724 --> 01:07:19,922
No, no... you're confused. You're misinformed.

811
01:07:19,923 --> 01:07:21,422
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

812
01:07:21,423 --> 01:07:22,784
It's out there right now.

813
01:07:22,784 --> 01:07:25,023
You're blaming the Federation for something that hasn't happened...

814
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:28,324
It has happened! I watched it happen! I saw it happen!

815
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:30,625
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

816
01:07:34,626 --> 01:07:39,525
And when I lost her. I promised myself retribution.

817
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:43,726
And for 25 years I planned my revenge against the Federation.

818
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:47,326
And forgot what it was like to live a normal life.

819
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,027
I did not forget the pain.

820
01:07:51,128 --> 01:07:55,327
It's a pain that every surviving Vulcan now shares.

821
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:58,427
My purpose, Christopher,

822
01:07:58,429 --> 01:07:59,730
is to not simply...

823
01:07:59,731 --> 01:08:02,929
avoid the destruction of the home that I love...

824
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:09,429
but to create a Romulus that exists free of the Federation.

825
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:15,530
You see only then will she be truly saved.

826
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:20,229
That is why I will destroy all the remaining Federation planets.

827
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,731
Starting with yours.

828
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:26,131
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

829
01:08:29,632 --> 01:08:33,233
You will give me the frequencies to disable Earth's defenses.

830
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:40,734
Centaurian slugs. They latch on to your brain stem...

831
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:45,033
and release a toxin that will force you to answer.

832
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:48,635
Frequencies please, sir.

833
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:50,969
Christopher Pike, captain of the USS Enterprise...

834
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,734
As you wish.

835
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,734
Have you confirmed that Nero is heading for Earth?

836
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:05,036
Their trajectory suggests no other destination, captain.

837
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:06,536
Thank you, It.

838
01:09:06,537 --> 01:09:08,935
Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume...

839
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,872
every Federation planet's a target.

840
01:09:10,872 --> 01:09:12,436
Out of the chair.

841
01:09:12,438 --> 01:09:16,636
Well, if the Federation is the target, why didn't they destroy us?

842
01:09:16,637 --> 01:09:18,447
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?

843
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:19,639
We obviously weren't a threat.

844
01:09:19,639 --> 01:09:22,537
That is not it. He said he wanted me to see something.

845
01:09:22,538 --> 01:09:24,337
The destruction of my home planet.

846
01:09:24,338 --> 01:09:26,238
How the hell did they do that, by the way?

847
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,538
And where did the Romulans get that kind of weaponry?

848
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:32,238
The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole

849
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:33,838
may suggest an answer.

850
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,340
Such technology could theoretically be manipulated...

851
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:38,539
to create a tunnel through space-time.

852
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,439
Damn it man, I am a doctor, not physicist.

853
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,640
Are you actually suggesting they're from the future?

854
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,740
If you eliminate the impossible, what ever remains, however improbable...

855
01:09:45,742 --> 01:09:47,041
must be the truth.

856
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:48,041
How poetic.

857
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:50,273
Then what would an angry future Romulan

858
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:51,676
want with captain Pike?

859
01:09:51,676 --> 01:09:54,341
As captain he does know details of Starfleet's defenses.

860
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:56,042
What we need to do is catch up to that ship,

861
01:09:56,042 --> 01:09:58,141
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

862
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,643
We are technologically outmatched in every way.

863
01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:02,643
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

864
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:05,542
Nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake it.

865
01:10:05,543 --> 01:10:07,661
Then what about assigning engineering crews

866
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,845
to try and boost our warp yield?

867
01:10:08,845 --> 01:10:10,944
Remaining power and crew are being used to repair radiation leaks...

868
01:10:10,944 --> 01:10:12,844
on the lower decks.        Okay. Alright. Alright.

869
01:10:12,845 --> 01:10:13,863
The damage communications. Without it...

870
01:10:13,864 --> 01:10:15,344
There's got to be some way.        we cannot contact Starfleet.

871
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,430
We must gather with the rest of Starfleet.

872
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:20,145
To balance the terms of the next engagement,

873
01:10:20,145 --> 01:10:21,645
There won't be a next engagement.

874
01:10:21,645 --> 01:10:25,045
By the time we gather it'll be too late.

875
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,180
Look, you say he's from the future and knows what's gonna happen...

876
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,645
then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

877
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:33,046
You're assuming that Nero knows how event's are predicted to unfold.

878
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:35,596
The contrary. Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history...

879
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:37,447
beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin,

880
01:10:37,448 --> 01:10:38,796
culminating with the events of today,

881
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:40,947
thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents...

882
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:43,948
that cannot be anticipated by either party.

883
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,048
An alternate reality.

884
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:48,448
Precisely.

885
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:50,134
Whatever our lives might have been

886
01:10:50,135 --> 01:10:52,449
if the time continuum was disrupted

887
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:55,149
our destinies have changed.

888
01:10:55,149 --> 01:10:57,748
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system. Warp factor 3.

889
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,149
Spock, don't do that.

890
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:02,355
Running back to the rest of the fleet for a con fab

891
01:11:02,356 --> 01:11:03,650
is a massive waste of time...

892
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,385
These orders were issued by captain Pike when he left.

893
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,051
He also ordered us to go back and get him.

894
01:11:07,051 --> 01:11:08,954
Spock, you are captain now. You have...

895
01:11:08,956 --> 01:11:10,551
I am aware of my responsibilities...

896
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:12,951
Every second we waste Nero's getting closer to his next target.

897
01:11:12,952 --> 01:11:15,154
That is correct and why I'm instructing you to accept the fact that I'm...

898
01:11:15,155 --> 01:11:20,051
I will not allow us to go backwards... ... instead of hunting Nero down.

899
01:11:20,052 --> 01:11:23,052
Security, escort him out.

900
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,555
No.        Jim!

901
01:11:38,055 --> 01:11:40,756
Get him off this ship.

902
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:01,457
Computer, where am I?

903
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:04,957
Location: Delta Vega. Class M planet. Unsafe.

904
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:08,858
There is a Starfleet outpost 14km to the northwest.

905
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:12,958
Remain in your pod...        Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

906
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:59,164
Star date 2258.42.

907
01:12:59,265 --> 01:13:03,064
...for... for... Whatever.

908
01:13:03,065 --> 01:13:06,765
Acting captain Spock has marooned me on Delta Vega.

909
01:13:06,765 --> 01:13:11,466
What I believe to be a violation of security protocol 49.09

910
01:13:11,466 --> 01:13:14,667
governing the treatment of prisoners aboard a starship.

911
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:27,783
James T. Kirk.

912
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:31,282
Excuse me?        How did you find me?

913
01:15:32,984 --> 01:15:35,684
How do you know my name?

914
01:15:35,984 --> 01:15:40,684
I have been and always shall be your friend.

915
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:46,219
Look, I don't know you.

916
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:49,586
I am Spock.

917
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:54,585
Bullshit.

918
01:15:54,586 --> 01:15:57,787
It is remarkably pleasing to see you again old friend.

919
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,087
Especially after the events today.

920
01:16:02,487 --> 01:16:04,485
Sir, I appreciate what you did for me today

921
01:16:04,487 --> 01:16:06,127
but if you were Spock,

922
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,287
you'd know we're not friends at all.

923
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:09,427
You hate me.

924
01:16:09,429 --> 01:16:10,787
You marooned me here for mutiny.

925
01:16:10,787 --> 01:16:12,787
Mutiny?        Yes.

926
01:16:12,787 --> 01:16:15,488
You are not the captain?

927
01:16:17,889 --> 01:16:22,087
No, no... You're the captain.

928
01:16:22,088 --> 01:16:24,788
Pike was taken hostage.

929
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:27,489
By Nero?

930
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,789
What do you know about him?

931
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:38,291
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

932
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,591
Please. Allow me.

933
01:16:41,692 --> 01:16:43,292
It will be easier.

934
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:47,594
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?        Our minds, one and together.

935
01:16:49,394 --> 01:16:53,426
129 years from now, a star will explode

936
01:16:53,427 --> 01:16:55,996
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

937
01:16:56,994 --> 01:16:59,894
That is where I'm from Jim.

938
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:01,994
The future.

939
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:08,395
A star went supernova.

940
01:17:09,395 --> 01:17:11,994
Consuming everything in its path.

941
01:17:11,996 --> 01:17:15,997
I promised the Romulans that I will save their planet.

942
01:17:20,797 --> 01:17:23,797
We outfitted our fastest ship.

943
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:26,896
Using red matter I would create a black hole

944
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:30,298
which would absorb the exploding star.

945
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:34,599
I was on root when the unthinkable happened.

946
01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:39,600
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

947
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,801
I had little time.

948
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,242
I had to extract the red matter

949
01:17:50,418 --> 01:17:53,002
and shoot it into the supernova.

950
01:18:08,903 --> 01:18:11,703
As I began my return trip I was intercepted.

951
01:18:11,703 --> 01:18:15,903
He called himself Nero,        ... collapse of Romulan Empire.

952
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:20,404
In my attempt to escape, both of us were pulled into the black hole.

953
01:18:28,405 --> 01:18:32,605
Nero went through first. He was the first to arrive.

954
01:18:39,306 --> 01:18:42,506
Nero spent the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.

955
01:18:42,506 --> 01:18:45,307
But what was years for Nero

956
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:49,007
was only seconds for me.

957
01:18:49,207 --> 01:18:52,208
I went through the black hole.

958
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:57,309
Nero was waiting for me.

959
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:05,510
He held me responsible for the loss of his world.

960
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:10,011
He captured my vessel and spared my life.

961
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:11,979
For one reason.

962
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:16,112
So that I would know his pain.

963
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:22,212
He beamed me here so that I can observe his vengeance.

964
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:26,511
As he was helpless to save his planet

965
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:30,912
I would be helpless to save mine.

966
01:19:32,512 --> 01:19:36,912
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

967
01:19:36,913 --> 01:19:40,514
Because I failed.

968
01:19:42,114 --> 01:19:46,914
Forgive me. Emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld.

969
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:56,614
So you do feel.        Yes.

970
01:19:56,615 --> 01:20:00,117
Going back in time you changed all our lives.

971
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:03,815
Jim! We must go.

972
01:20:03,817 --> 01:20:06,817
There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.

973
01:20:07,717 --> 01:20:10,016
Wait.

974
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:12,917
Where you came from...

975
01:20:14,318 --> 01:20:16,918
did I know my father?

976
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:19,118
Yes.

977
01:20:19,118 --> 01:20:23,118
You often spoke of him as being your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

978
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,519
He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise.

979
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,819
Captain?

980
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:32,421
A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.

981
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:43,020
Warp 3, sir.        Course 151-3.

982
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:45,720
Laurentian system, sir.        Thank you gentlemen.

983
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:49,922
You wanted to see me?        Yes. Doctor.

984
01:20:50,523 --> 01:20:52,822
I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours.

985
01:20:52,823 --> 01:20:55,756
I recognize that supporting me as you did must have been difficult.

986
01:20:55,757 --> 01:20:57,722
Is that thank you?

987
01:20:57,724 --> 01:21:00,724
I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.

988
01:21:00,725 --> 01:21:02,923
Permission to speak freely, sir.

989
01:21:03,623 --> 01:21:06,125
I welcome it.        Do you?

990
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:09,923
Okay then. Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

991
01:21:09,925 --> 01:21:12,501
Are you making a logical choice sending Kirk away?

992
01:21:12,502 --> 01:21:14,324
Probably. But the right one?

993
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:15,962
Back home we've got a saying.

994
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,376
If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky derby...

995
01:21:17,376 --> 01:21:19,625
you don't leave your prize stallion in the stable...

996
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:23,426
A curious metaphor, Doctor, as a stallion must first be broken...

997
01:21:23,426 --> 01:21:25,926
before it can reach its potential.

998
01:21:25,926 --> 01:21:28,431
My God man. You could at least act like it was a hard decision.

999
01:21:28,432 --> 01:21:29,966
I intend to insist in the effort...

1000
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:32,027
to reestablish communication with Starfleet.

1001
01:21:32,028 --> 01:21:34,127
However, if crew moral is better served...

1002
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:35,926
by my roaming the halls weeping...

1003
01:21:35,927 --> 01:21:39,729
I would gladly defer to your medical expertise.

1004
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,628
Excuse me.

1005
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:48,829
Green blooded little goblin.

1006
01:23:08,838 --> 01:23:11,039
What?

1007
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:16,238
You realize how unacceptable this is?

1008
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:17,939
Fascinating.        What?

1009
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,340
I am sure you're just doing your job,

1010
01:23:19,341 --> 01:23:20,739
but could you not come a wee bit sooner?

1011
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,539
Six months I've been here.

1012
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:25,640
Living off Starfleet botty nips and a promise of a good meal.

1013
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,140
And I know exactly what's going on here.

1014
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:29,716
Ok? Punishment, isn't it?

1015
01:23:29,717 --> 01:23:32,341
Ongoing. For something that was clearly an accident.

1016
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,341
You are Montgomery Scott.        You know him?

1017
01:23:35,342 --> 01:23:37,341
Yeah, it's me. You're in the right place.

1018
01:23:37,342 --> 01:23:40,442
Unless there's another hard working equally starved Starfleet officer around.

1019
01:23:40,443 --> 01:23:43,344
Me.        Getup, shut up.

1020
01:23:43,444 --> 01:23:46,943
You aren't doing anything. You can eat, like, a bean and you're done.

1021
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:49,143
I'm talking about food, real food.

1022
01:23:49,144 --> 01:23:51,844
But you're here now. So, thank you. Where is it?

1023
01:23:51,845 --> 01:23:53,944
You are in fact a Mr. Scott...

1024
01:23:53,944 --> 01:23:55,944
who postulated the theory of transwarp beaming?

1025
01:23:55,944 --> 01:23:57,608
That's what I'm talking about.

1026
01:23:58,086 --> 01:23:59,445
How'd ya think I wound up here?

1027
01:23:59,445 --> 01:24:01,944
I had a little debate with my instructor on the issue...

1028
01:24:01,945 --> 01:24:03,645
of relativistic physics...

1029
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:04,944
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

1030
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:07,645
He seemed to think that the range of transporting...

1031
01:24:07,646 --> 01:24:09,046
something like a grapefruit...

1032
01:24:09,046 --> 01:24:10,945
was limited to about a 100 miles.

1033
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:13,145
I told him that I could not only beam a grapefruit...

1034
01:24:13,146 --> 01:24:15,083
from one planet to the adjacent planet...

1035
01:24:15,085 --> 01:24:17,447
in the same system, which is easy by the way...

1036
01:24:17,448 --> 01:24:19,947
I could do it with a life form.

1037
01:24:19,948 --> 01:24:22,381
So, I tested it on admiral Archer's prize beagle.

1038
01:24:22,382 --> 01:24:24,448
I know that dog. What happened to it?

1039
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,247
I'll tell you when it reappears.

1040
01:24:26,248 --> 01:24:27,847
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

1041
01:24:27,849 --> 01:24:30,847
What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct?

1042
01:24:30,849 --> 01:24:32,582
That it is indeed possible to beam

1043
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,582
onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

1044
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,748
I think that if that equation had been discovered I'd have heard about it.

1045
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,783
The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott,

1046
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:41,751
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

1047
01:24:46,551 --> 01:24:50,451
Are you from the future?        He is. I'm not.

1048
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:53,851
Well that's brilliant. Do they still have sandwiches there?

1049
01:24:54,152 --> 01:24:56,650
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy. Shield emitters are...

1050
01:24:56,652 --> 01:24:59,152
totally bum jacked as well as a few other things.

1051
01:24:59,153 --> 01:25:01,152
In you go.

1052
01:25:01,153 --> 01:25:03,587
So, the Enterprise has had it's maiden voyage, has it?

1053
01:25:03,587 --> 01:25:05,351
She is one well endowed lady.

1054
01:25:05,353 --> 01:25:07,753
I'd like to get my hands on her ample nossels,

1055
01:25:07,755 --> 01:25:10,054
if you'd pardon the engineering parlance.

1056
01:25:11,654 --> 01:25:13,793
Except, the thing is, even if I believed you.

1057
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:15,793
Where you're from, what I've done...

1058
01:25:15,795 --> 01:25:17,793
Which I don't, by the way.

1059
01:25:17,795 --> 01:25:20,154
We're still talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise...

1060
01:25:20,154 --> 01:25:23,055
while she's travelling faster than light without a proper receiving pad.

1061
01:25:23,055 --> 01:25:26,055
Get off there. It's not a climbing frame.

1062
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:27,354
The notion of transwarp beaming...

1063
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:30,756
is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet...

1064
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:33,756
whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

1065
01:25:33,756 --> 01:25:34,756
What's that?

1066
01:25:34,756 --> 01:25:38,657
Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.

1067
01:25:40,358 --> 01:25:42,858
You're out of it...

1068
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:48,052
Imagine that. It never occurred to me...

1069
01:25:48,054 --> 01:25:50,158
to think of space as the thing that was moving...

1070
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:52,859
You're coming with us, right?

1071
01:25:54,059 --> 01:25:56,960
No, Jim. That is not my destiny.

1072
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,359
Your dest...

1073
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:01,793
He. The other Spock is not gonna believe me, only you can explain...

1074
01:26:01,795 --> 01:26:03,694
what the hell has happened.        Under no circumstances...

1075
01:26:03,694 --> 01:26:04,659
can he be made aware...

1076
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:06,659
of my existence. You must promise me this.

1077
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,159
So you're telling me I can't tell you...

1078
01:26:08,161 --> 01:26:10,560
that I'm following you're own orders, why not? What happens?

1079
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,961
Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1080
01:26:12,962 --> 01:26:16,661
To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.

1081
01:26:16,662 --> 01:26:18,496
How? Over your dead body?

1082
01:26:18,497 --> 01:26:19,560
Preferably, not.

1083
01:26:19,561 --> 01:26:22,761
However, there is Starfleet regulation 619.

1084
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:26,162
619 states that any command officer...

1085
01:26:26,163 --> 01:26:29,072
who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand...

1086
01:26:30,372 --> 01:26:32,064
must resign set command.

1087
01:26:33,663 --> 01:26:37,871
So, you're saying that I have to emotionally compromise you... guys?

1088
01:26:38,171 --> 01:26:41,465
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1089
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:46,270
I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised.

1090
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:49,070
What you must do is get me to show it.

1091
01:26:49,072 --> 01:26:52,471
Aye then lady. Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1092
01:26:58,573 --> 01:27:01,372
You cannot come with me. Go on.

1093
01:27:01,872 --> 01:27:06,974
Coming back in time, changing history, that's cheating.

1094
01:27:08,774 --> 01:27:12,175
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1095
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:24,076
Live long and prosper.

1096
01:27:42,677 --> 01:27:45,479
Mr. Scott?

1097
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:52,078
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

1098
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:02,581
Hold on a second.

1099
01:28:19,082 --> 01:28:20,983
No. No!

1100
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,761
RELEASE VALVE.

1101
01:28:39,484 --> 01:28:42,985
Purifier release valve activated.

1102
01:28:48,784 --> 01:28:52,087
You all right? You all right?

1103
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:56,086
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked, but otherwise I'm fine.

1104
01:28:56,087 --> 01:28:59,863
Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized access

1105
01:28:59,864 --> 01:29:01,887
to water turbine control board.

1106
01:29:01,887 --> 01:29:04,287
Bring up the video.

1107
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:09,592
Security, seal the engineering deck.

1108
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,590
We have intruders in turbine section 3.

1109
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:14,288
Set phasers to stun.

1110
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,490
Halt!

1111
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,292
Come with me...

1112
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:34,992
cupcake!

1113
01:29:41,912 --> 01:29:42,654
Who are you?

1114
01:29:42,655 --> 01:29:43,555
I'm with him.        He's with me.

1115
01:29:43,654 --> 01:29:45,043
We're travelling at warp speed.

1116
01:29:45,253 --> 01:29:47,153
How did you manage to beam aboard this ship?

1117
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:48,653
You're the genius, you figure it out.

1118
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:51,088
As acting captain of this vessel I order you to answer the question.

1119
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:54,055
Well I'm not telling, acting captain.

1120
01:29:54,854 --> 01:29:56,154
What?

1121
01:29:56,155 --> 01:29:58,354
What now? That doesn't frustrate you, does it?

1122
01:29:58,355 --> 01:30:01,055
My lack of cooperation, that doesn't make you angry?

1123
01:30:01,055 --> 01:30:04,454
Are you a member of Starfleet?        Um... yes. Can I get a towel?

1124
01:30:04,456 --> 01:30:07,055
Under penalty of court martial I order you to explain to me...

1125
01:30:07,056 --> 01:30:08,319
how you were able to beam aboard the ship

1126
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:09,136
while moving at warp?

1127
01:30:09,136 --> 01:30:10,150
Well.

1128
01:30:10,152 --> 01:30:13,356
Don't answer him.        You will answer me.

1129
01:30:14,757 --> 01:30:18,057
I'd rather not take sides.        What is it with you, Spock?

1130
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:19,157
Hm?

1131
01:30:19,158 --> 01:30:21,457
Your planet was just destroyed,

1132
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,358
your mother murdered, and you're not even upset.

1133
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:26,858
If you are presuming that these experiences in any way...

1134
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:29,257
impede my ability to command this ship you are mistaking.

1135
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:30,917
And yet you were the one who said

1136
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:32,760
fear was necessary for command.

1137
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,359
I mean, did you his ship? Did you see what he did?

1138
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,060
Yes, of course I did.        So are you afraid or aren't you?

1139
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:42,045
I will not allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.

1140
01:30:42,046 --> 01:30:43,460
Then why don't you stop me?        Step away from me Mr. Kirk.

1141
01:30:43,461 --> 01:30:47,360
What is it like not to feel anger or heartbreak?

1142
01:30:47,362 --> 01:30:48,761
Or the need to stop at nothing...

1143
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:50,961
to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you.

1144
01:30:50,962 --> 01:30:52,895
Back away from me.        You feel nothing!

1145
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:55,762
It must not even compute for you.

1146
01:30:55,764 --> 01:30:58,262
You never loved her!        No!

1147
01:31:21,865 --> 01:31:23,966
Spock.

1148
01:32:00,841 --> 01:32:03,641
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1149
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:06,780
I relinquish my command based on the fact

1150
01:32:06,782 --> 01:32:09,344
that I have been emotionally compromised.

1151
01:32:09,643 --> 01:32:12,543
Please note the time and date in the ship's log.

1152
01:32:38,747 --> 01:32:40,945
I like this ship.

1153
01:32:40,947 --> 01:32:43,247
You know it's exciting.

1154
01:32:45,047 --> 01:32:48,346
Well congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no captain...

1155
01:32:48,347 --> 01:32:50,948
and no God damn first officer to replace him.

1156
01:32:51,748 --> 01:32:53,448
Yeah we do.

1157
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:56,347
What?        Pike made him first officer.

1158
01:32:56,349 --> 01:32:59,748
You've gotta be kidding me.        Thanks for the support.

1159
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:06,750
I sure hope you know what you're doing, captain.

1160
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:10,051
So do I.

1161
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,135
Attention, crew of the Enterprise,

1162
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,953
this is James Kirk.

1163
01:33:17,652 --> 01:33:19,774
Mr. Spock has resigned commission

1164
01:33:19,774 --> 01:33:21,953
and advanced me to acting captain.

1165
01:33:22,452 --> 01:33:25,850
I know you're all expecting a regroup with the fleet,

1166
01:33:25,851 --> 01:33:28,570
but I'm ordering a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth.

1167
01:33:28,572 --> 01:33:31,653
I want all departments at battle stations and ready in 10 minutes.

1168
01:33:31,853 --> 01:33:36,752
Either we're going down or they are.

1169
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:38,854
Kirk out.

1170
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:48,854
Speak your mind Spock.

1171
01:33:50,756 --> 01:33:52,755
That would be unwise.

1172
01:33:52,756 --> 01:33:57,256
What is necessary is never unwise.

1173
01:33:58,056 --> 01:34:01,856
I am as conflicted as I once was as a child.

1174
01:34:02,856 --> 01:34:06,358
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1175
01:34:07,557 --> 01:34:10,957
I am grateful for this.

1176
01:34:11,358 --> 01:34:14,057
And for you.

1177
01:34:14,859 --> 01:34:18,759
I feel anger for the one who took mother's life.

1178
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:22,958
An anger I cannot control.

1179
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:31,860
I believe, as she would say...

1180
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:35,359
do not try to.

1181
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:40,561
You asked me once why I married your mother.

1182
01:34:44,162 --> 01:34:47,662
I married her because I loved her.

1183
01:34:54,762 --> 01:34:57,797
Whatever the case we need to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1184
01:34:57,798 --> 01:34:59,762
Just can't just go in there guns blazing, Jim.

1185
01:34:59,764 --> 01:35:01,563
I'm telling you to...

1186
01:35:01,564 --> 01:35:03,131
Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk.

1187
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:04,465
Yes, Chekov. What is it?

1188
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:07,061
Based on the Nerada course from Vulcan...

1189
01:35:07,063 --> 01:35:09,949
I have projected that Nero will travel pass Saturn.

1190
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:13,465
Like you said we need to stay invisible to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1191
01:35:13,466 --> 01:35:16,064
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4...

1192
01:35:16,065 --> 01:35:20,664
and if we drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say Titan.

1193
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:23,166
The magnetic distortion from the planet's rings...

1194
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:25,565
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1195
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:28,065
From there, as long as the drill is not activated...

1196
01:35:28,067 --> 01:35:29,502
we can beam aboard the enemy ship.

1197
01:35:29,502 --> 01:35:31,867
Aye, that might work.

1198
01:35:31,868 --> 01:35:34,966
Wait a minute kid, how old are you?        17, sir.

1199
01:35:34,967 --> 01:35:36,301
Oh good, he's 17.

1200
01:35:36,302 --> 01:35:37,967
Doctor.

1201
01:35:37,969 --> 01:35:41,868
Mr. Chekov is correct. I can confirm his telemetry.

1202
01:35:41,868 --> 01:35:43,967
If Mr. Sulu is able to maneuver us into position

1203
01:35:43,969 --> 01:35:46,261
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,

1204
01:35:46,261 --> 01:35:47,661
steal back the black hole device

1205
01:35:47,662 --> 01:35:49,568
and if possible bring back captain Pike.

1206
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:52,170
I won't allow you to do that Mr. Spock.

1207
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:55,470
Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry.

1208
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:57,970
Our cultural similarities will make it easier...

1209
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:59,569
for me to access the ship's computer...

1210
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,270
to locate the device.

1211
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:04,051
Also my mother was human.

1212
01:36:04,052 --> 01:36:06,872
Which makes Earth the only home I have left.

1213
01:36:13,472 --> 01:36:15,671
I'm coming with you.

1214
01:36:15,672 --> 01:36:19,573
I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it.

1215
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:25,373
See? We are getting to know each other.

1216
01:36:39,975 --> 01:36:42,775
Prepare the drill.

1217
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:04,279
All stop in 3... 2... 1.

1218
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:11,729
Give me 1/4 impulse burst for 5 seconds.

1219
01:37:11,729 --> 01:37:13,644
I'll do the rest with thrusters. On my mark.

1220
01:37:13,645 --> 01:37:15,078
Aye.

1221
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,779
Fire.

1222
01:37:42,884 --> 01:37:45,932
Transporter room. We are in position above Titan.

1223
01:37:45,934 --> 01:37:49,033
Really? Fine job Mr. Sulu, well done.

1224
01:37:49,034 --> 01:37:50,735
How are we Scotty?

1225
01:37:50,737 --> 01:37:53,185
Unbelievably sir. The ship is in position.

1226
01:37:56,284 --> 01:37:58,185
Whatever happens Mr. Sulu,

1227
01:37:58,185 --> 01:38:00,585
if you think you have the tactical advantage...

1228
01:38:00,586 --> 01:38:04,185
you fire on that ship even if we're still on board. That's an order.

1229
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:06,885
Yes, sir.

1230
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:10,386
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise when we're ready to be beamed back.

1231
01:38:10,787 --> 01:38:13,586
Good luck.

1232
01:38:24,988 --> 01:38:28,588
I will be back.        You better be.

1233
01:38:29,288 --> 01:38:33,890
I'll be monitoring your frequency.        Thank you, Nyota.

1234
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:52,390
So her first name's Nyota?        I have no comment on the matter.

1235
01:38:52,391 --> 01:38:54,064
Oky doky then.

1236
01:38:54,065 --> 01:38:55,577
If there's any common sense in the design of the enemy's ship

1237
01:38:55,577 --> 01:38:58,372
I should be putting you somewhere in the cargo bay,

1238
01:38:58,373 --> 01:38:59,743
shouldn't be a soul in site.

1239
01:38:59,743 --> 01:39:00,893
Energize.

1240
01:39:43,597 --> 01:39:46,296
Captain, we have Starfleet officers aboard the ship.

1241
01:39:46,297 --> 01:39:49,599
One of them is Vulcan.        No.

1242
01:39:53,398 --> 01:39:55,899
Ayel!

1243
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:11,534
I'll cover ya.        Are you certain?

1244
01:40:11,536 --> 01:40:13,702
Yeah, I've gotcha.

1245
01:40:32,703 --> 01:40:36,805
Do you know where it is? The black hole device?

1246
01:40:37,904 --> 01:40:40,704
And captain Pike.

1247
01:41:02,108 --> 01:41:03,908
Move.

1248
01:41:04,108 --> 01:41:06,807
They have activated the drill.

1249
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:08,806
Communication and transportation are inoperative.

1250
01:41:08,807 --> 01:41:10,408
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1251
01:41:10,408 --> 01:41:12,042
Otherwise we won't be able to beam them back.

1252
01:41:12,043 --> 01:41:14,609
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1253
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:35,810
I foresee a complication. The design of this ship...

1254
01:41:35,811 --> 01:41:37,310
is far more advanced than I have anticipated.

1255
01:41:37,311 --> 01:41:40,211
Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled.

1256
01:41:40,212 --> 01:41:42,411
Welcome back ambassador Spock.

1257
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:44,511
That's weird.

1258
01:41:45,212 --> 01:41:48,212
Computer, what is your manufacturing origin?

1259
01:41:48,212 --> 01:41:53,413
Star date 2387. Commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy.

1260
01:41:55,713 --> 01:41:58,412
It appears that you have been keeping important information from me.

1261
01:41:58,413 --> 01:42:00,349
You'll be able to fly this thing, right?

1262
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:02,614
Something tells me I already have.

1263
01:42:03,215 --> 01:42:06,113
Good luck.        Jim.

1264
01:42:06,113 --> 01:42:08,386
The statistical likelihood that our plan will succeed...

1265
01:42:08,387 --> 01:42:10,715
is less than 4.3%.        It'll work.

1266
01:42:10,716 --> 01:42:12,614
In the event that I do not return please tell Lt. Uhura...

1267
01:42:12,615 --> 01:42:15,216
Spock, it'll work.

1268
01:42:25,217 --> 01:42:27,318
Fascinating.

1269
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:38,519
Startup sequence initiated.

1270
01:43:21,623 --> 01:43:24,925
Nero, order your men to disable the drill or I will...

1271
01:43:34,326 --> 01:43:38,025
I know your face from Earth's history.

1272
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:25,832
James T. Kirk was considered to be a great man.

1273
01:44:25,832 --> 01:44:28,734
He went on to captain the USS Enterprise.

1274
01:44:28,734 --> 01:44:30,632
But that was another life.

1275
01:44:30,634 --> 01:44:34,033
A life I will deprive you of just like I did your father.

1276
01:45:06,337 --> 01:45:10,837
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship's been taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1277
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:15,939
Spock! Spock!

1278
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:35,541
Open a channel.        Yes, sir.

1279
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:39,440
Spock, I knew I should have killed you when I had the chance.

1280
01:45:39,442 --> 01:45:41,475
I hereby confiscate this illegally obtained ship...

1281
01:45:41,476 --> 01:45:43,541
and order you to surrender your vessel. No terms.

1282
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,042
That ship... take it out.

1283
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:46,707
Sir, if you ignite the red matter...

1284
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:48,844
I want the Spock dead now!

1285
01:46:03,845 --> 01:46:05,679
He went to warp.        Go after him.

1286
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,345
Yes, sir.

1287
01:46:37,048 --> 01:46:40,248
Your species is even weaker than I expected.

1288
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:46,149
You can't even speak.

1289
01:46:47,649 --> 01:46:49,349
What?

1290
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:52,350
I got your gun.

1291
01:47:17,654 --> 01:47:19,052
What's he doing?

1292
01:47:19,054 --> 01:47:22,453
Ambassador Spock, you are on a collision course.

1293
01:47:22,453 --> 01:47:24,854
Fire everything.

1294
01:47:30,854 --> 01:47:35,154
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit, the red matter will be ignited.

1295
01:47:35,155 --> 01:47:37,655
Understood.

1296
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:45,157
Captain, I've picked up another ship.

1297
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:09,260
What are you doing here?        Following orders.

1298
01:48:29,261 --> 01:48:31,863
Enterprise now!

1299
01:48:53,765 --> 01:48:56,164
Nice timing Scotty.

1300
01:48:56,365 --> 01:48:58,664
I've never beamed three people from two targets

1301
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:00,465
onto one pad before.

1302
01:49:00,466 --> 01:49:02,449
Jim.        Bones.

1303
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:03,649
I've got him.

1304
01:49:06,167 --> 01:49:08,666
That was pretty good.

1305
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:11,966
Captain, the enemy ship is loosing power. They're shields are down.

1306
01:49:11,967 --> 01:49:14,568
Hail them now.        Aye.

1307
01:49:48,945 --> 01:49:51,345
This is captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise.

1308
01:49:52,045 --> 01:49:54,744
Your ship is compromised. You're too close to the singularity

1309
01:49:54,746 --> 01:49:58,445
to survive without assistance which we are willing to provide.

1310
01:50:00,947 --> 01:50:02,845
Captain, what are you doing?

1311
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:04,480
Showing them compassion may be the only way...

1312
01:50:04,481 --> 01:50:05,480
to make peace with Romulus, Spock.

1313
01:50:05,481 --> 01:50:08,845
It's logical, Spock. Thought you'd like that.

1314
01:50:08,846 --> 01:50:11,546
No, not really. Not this time.

1315
01:50:11,547 --> 01:50:15,846
I would rather suffer the end of Romulus a thousand times,

1316
01:50:15,847 --> 01:50:20,347
I would rather die in agony than accept assistance from you.

1317
01:50:20,349 --> 01:50:22,247
You've got it.

1318
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,582
Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.

1319
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:26,250
Yes, sir.

1320
01:51:10,454 --> 01:51:13,255
Sulu, let's go home.        Yes, sir.

1321
01:51:23,756 --> 01:51:26,256
Why aren't we at warp?        We are, sir.

1322
01:51:26,256 --> 01:51:28,490
Kirk to engineering. Get us out of here, Scotty.

1323
01:51:28,492 --> 01:51:31,157
You bet your ass captain.

1324
01:51:33,557 --> 01:51:35,692
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well. It's got us.

1325
01:51:35,693 --> 01:51:37,256
Go to maximum warp. Push it!

1326
01:51:37,257 --> 01:51:39,957
I'm giving it all she's got captain.

1327
01:51:48,559 --> 01:51:51,094
All she's got isn't good enough. What else you got?

1328
01:51:51,095 --> 01:51:53,819
Ok, if we eject the core and detonate the blast...

1329
01:51:53,819 --> 01:51:56,960
could be enough to push us away. I can't promise anything though.

1330
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:02,159
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1331
01:52:02,161 --> 01:52:04,661
Clear the area. Go!        Yes, sir.

1332
01:53:31,572 --> 01:53:33,671
Father?

1333
01:53:41,573 --> 01:53:44,872
I am not our father.

1334
01:53:51,073 --> 01:53:52,823
There are so few Vulcans left

1335
01:53:53,823 --> 01:53:56,376
we cannot afford to ignore each other.

1336
01:53:58,774 --> 01:54:00,034
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1337
01:54:00,036 --> 01:54:01,775
when you alone could have explained the truth?

1338
01:54:01,775 --> 01:54:03,774
Because you needed each other.

1339
01:54:03,775 --> 01:54:06,234
I could not deprive you of the revelation

1340
01:54:06,234 --> 01:54:08,176
of all that you can accomplish together.

1341
01:54:08,176 --> 01:54:11,576
Of a friendship that will define you both.

1342
01:54:11,577 --> 01:54:14,476
In ways you cannot yet realize.

1343
01:54:15,176 --> 01:54:17,775
How'd you persuade him to keep your secret?

1344
01:54:17,777 --> 01:54:21,077
He inferred that universe ending paradoxes would ensue

1345
01:54:21,078 --> 01:54:22,712
should he break his promise.

1346
01:54:22,712 --> 01:54:25,078
You lied?

1347
01:54:25,377 --> 01:54:28,578
Oh. I implied.        A gamble?

1348
01:54:28,578 --> 01:54:30,377
An act of faith.

1349
01:54:30,378 --> 01:54:34,078
One I hope you will repeat in the future in Starfleet.

1350
01:54:34,078 --> 01:54:37,479
In the face of extinction it is only logical I resign my Starfleet commission

1351
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:38,578
and help rebuild our race.

1352
01:54:38,579 --> 01:54:41,880
And yet you can be in two places at once.

1353
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:45,081
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1354
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,579
I've already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1355
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:54,181
Spock, in this case do yourself a favor...

1356
01:54:54,881 --> 01:54:58,981
put aside logic, do what feels right.

1357
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:07,416
Since my customary farewell would appear awfully self serving...

1358
01:55:07,882 --> 01:55:11,583
I shall simply say good luck.

1359
01:55:22,585 --> 01:55:26,685
This assembly calls captain James Tiberius Kirk.

1360
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:30,185
Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades...

1361
01:55:30,185 --> 01:55:33,185
is in keeping with the highest traditions of service.

1362
01:55:33,287 --> 01:55:38,487
And reflect at most credit to yourself, your crew and the Federation.

1363
01:55:38,987 --> 01:55:42,787
It is my honor to award you with this commendation.

1364
01:55:46,387 --> 01:55:48,725
By Starfleet order 28455,

1365
01:55:48,725 --> 01:55:51,389
you are hereby directed to report to admiral Pike...

1366
01:55:51,389 --> 01:55:55,689
USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

1367
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:05,489
I relieve you, sir.

1368
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:08,291
I am relieved.

1369
01:56:09,291 --> 01:56:12,591
Thank you, sir.        Congratulations, captain.

1370
01:56:13,690 --> 01:56:16,591
Your father would be proud of you.

1371
01:56:45,295 --> 01:56:47,394
Thrusters on full.
