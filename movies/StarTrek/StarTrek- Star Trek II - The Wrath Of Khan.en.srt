00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:04,816
Captain's Log:
Stardate 81 30.3.

2
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,876
Starship Enterprise
on training mission...

3
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,548
to Gamma Hydra, section 1 4...

4
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:13,855
coordinates 22-87-4.

5
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,554
Approaching Neutral Zone.

6
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,928
All systems normal
and functioning.

7
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,867
Leaving section 1 4
for section 1 5.

8
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,269
Stand by. Project parabolic course
to avoid entering Neutral Zone.

9
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,602
Aye, Captain.

10
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,767
Course change projected.

11
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,678
Captain, I'm getting something
on the distress channel.

12
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,512
- On speakers.
- Imperative.

13
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,314
This is the Kobayashi Maru
out of Altair VI.

14
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,982
We have struck a gravitic mine
and have lost all power.

15
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,992
Our hull is penetrated and we have
sustained many casualties.

16
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,461
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Your message is breaking up.

17
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,659
Can you give us your coordinates?.
Repeat, this is the--

18
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,137
Enterprise, our position
is Gamma Hydra, section 10.

19
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,174
- In the Neutral Zone.
- Hull penetrated.

20
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,642
Life support systems failing.
Can you assist us, Enterprise?.

21
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,406
Data on Kobayashi Maru.

22
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,176
Subject vessel is third-class
neutronic fuel carrier...

23
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,241
crew of 81,
300 passengers.

24
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,153
Damn.

25
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,687
Mr. Sulu,
plot an intercept course.

26
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,256
May I remind the captain that
if a starship enters the Zone--

27
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,198
I'm aware of my responsibilities,
mister.

28
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,874
Estimating two minutes
to intercept.

29
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,176
Now entering the Neutral Zone.

30
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,909
Warning.
We have entered NeutralZone.

31
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,912
We are now in violation
of treaty, Captain.

32
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,149
Stand by, transporter room.
Ready to beam survivors aboard.

33
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,987
Captain,
I've lost their signal.

34
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,425
Alert. Sensors indicate
three Klingon cruisers.

35
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,895
-Bearing 3 16 markk 4, closing fast.
-Visual.

36
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,427
Battle stations.
Activate shields.

37
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,805
Shields activated.

38
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,465
Inform the Klingons
we are on a rescue mission.

39
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,099
They're jamming
all the frequencies.

40
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,303
Klingons on attack course
and closing.

41
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,506
We're over our heads.
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.

42
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,845
I'll try, Captain.

43
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,715
Alert. Klingon torpedoes
activated. Alert.

44
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,753
Evasive action.

45
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,295
- Engineering, damage report.
- Main energizer hit, Captain.

46
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,796
Engage auxiliary power.

47
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,491
Prepare to return fire.

48
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,902
Shields collapsing, Captain.

49
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,907
- Fire all phasers.
- No power to the weapons, Captain.

50
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,184
Captain, it's no use.

51
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,084
We're dead in space.

52
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,355
Activate escape pods.
Send out the log buoy.

53
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,790
All hands abandon ship.
Repeat, all hands abandon ship.

54
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,953
All right, open her up.

55
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,971
Any suggestions, Admiral?.

56
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,976
Prayer, Mr. Saavik.
The Klingons don't take prisoners.

57
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,036
Lights.

58
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,546
Blowers on.

59
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,643
Captain.

60
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,983
Trainees,
to the briefing room.

61
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,318
Maintenance crew,
report to bridge simulator.

62
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,366
Maintenance crew,
report to bridge simulator.

63
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,867
Physician, heal thyself.

64
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,234
Is that all you gotta say?.
What about my performance?.

65
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,239
I'm not a drama critic.

66
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,767
Mr. Saavik, you gonna
stay with a sinking ship?.

67
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,645
- Permission to speak candidly, sir.
- Granted.

68
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,708
I don't believe this was a fair
test of my command abilities.

69
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,721
- And why not?.
- Because there was no way to win.

70
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,758
A no-win situation's a possibility
every commander may face.

71
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:10,092
- Has that never occurred to you?.
- No, sir. It has not.

72
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,222
How we deal with death...

73
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,960
is as least as important
as how we deal with life.

74
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,899
Wouldn't you say?.

75
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,336
As I indicated, Admiral,
that thought had not occurred to me.

76
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,772
Well, now you have something
new to think about. Carry on.

77
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,243
Engineering cadets,
assemble on C level.

78
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,439
Admiral.

79
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,677
Wouldn't it be easier to put an
experienced crew back on the ship?.

80
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,448
Galloping around the cosmos
is a game for the young, Doctor.

81
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,956
Now, what is that
supposed to mean?.

82
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,731
Aren't you dead?.

83
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,902
I assume you're
loitering around here...

84
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,462
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets.

85
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,338
I am understandably curious.

86
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,902
They destroyed the simulator room,
and you with it.

87
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,778
The Kobayashi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc...

88
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,044
with students and equipment.

89
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,849
As I recall, you took the test
three times yourself.

90
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,449
Your final solution was,
shall we say, unique.

91
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,153
It had the virtue of
never having been tried.

92
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,791
Oh, by the way,
thank you for this.

93
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,493
I know of your fondness
for antiques.

94
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,495
""It was the best of times...

95
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,937
it was the worst of times."

96
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,565
Message, Spock?.

97
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,237
None that I'm conscious of.
Except, of course, happy birthday.

98
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,906
Surely the best of times.

99
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,381
Captain Spock, Captain Spock.

100
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,147
Space shuttle leaving
in 15 minutes.

101
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,381
- Where are you off to now?.
- The Enterprise.

102
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,914
I must check in before
your inspection. And you?.

103
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,853
Home.

104
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,737
Why, bless me, Doctor. What beams
you into this neck of the woods?.

105
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,785
Beware Romulans bearing gifts.

106
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,615
- Happy birthday,Jim.
- Thanks.

107
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,326
Romulan ale. Why, Bones,
you know this is illegal.

108
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,922
I only use it for
medicinal purposes.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,264
I got a border ship brings me
in a case now and then...

110
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,133
across the Neutral Zone.

111
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,798
- Now, don't be a prig.
- 2283.

112
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,967
Well, it takes this stuff
a while to ferment.

113
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:42,045
Here, give me.
Now, you open this one.

114
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,345
I'm almost afraid to.

115
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,489
What is it?.
Klingon aphrodisiacs?.

116
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,420
More antiques
for your collection.

117
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:57,022
Bones, this is charming.

118
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,761
They're 400 years old. You don't
find many with the lenses intact.

119
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,362
- What is it?.
- They're for your eyes.

120
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,739
For most patients your age,
I'd administer Retnax V.

121
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,109
- I'm allergic to Retnax.
- Exactly. Cheers.

122
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,613
Cheers.

123
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,015
Happy birthday.

124
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:32,026
- I don't know what to say.
- You could say "thank you."

125
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,623
Thank you.

126
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,198
Damn it,Jim, what the hell's
the matter with you?.

127
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,972
Other people have birthdays. Why are
we treating yours like a funeral?.

128
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,537
- I don't want to be lectured.
- What the hell do you want?.

129
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,316
This is not about age,
and you know it.

130
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,882
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console...

131
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,985
when you want to be
out there hopping galaxies.

132
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,963
Spare me your notions of poetry.
We all have our assigned duty.

133
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,057
Bull!

134
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:11,628
You're hiding-- hiding behind
rules and regulations.

135
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:15,641
- Who am I hiding from?.
- From yourself, Admiral.

136
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,278
Don't mince words, Bones.
What do you really think?.

137
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,555
Jim, I'm your doctor...

138
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,255
and I'm your friend.

139
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,060
Get back your command.

140
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,192
Get it back before you turn
into part of this collection.

141
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,039
Before you really do grow old.

142
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,249
Starship Log:
Stardate 8130.4.

143
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,262
Log entry by
First Officer Pavel Chekov.

144
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,925
Starship Reliant on orbital
approach to Ceti Alpha VI...

145
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,129
in connection
with Project Genesis.

146
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,138
We are continuing our search
for a lifeless planet...

147
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,071
to satisfy the requirement
of a test site...

148
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,701
for the Genesis Experiment.

149
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,803
- So far, no success.
- Standard orbit, please.

150
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,940
Mr. Beach,
any change in the surface scan?.

151
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:34,249
Negative. Limited atmosphere
dominated by Craylon gas...

152
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,983
sand, high-velocity winds.

153
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,854
Incapable of supporting
life-forms.

154
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,824
Does it have to be
completely lifeless?.

155
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,228
Don't tell me
you found something.

156
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,701
We picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dynoscanner.

157
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,567
Damn. Are you sure?.

158
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,402
Maybe the scanner's
out of adjustment.

159
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:58,535
I suppose it could be a particle
of preanimate matter...

160
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,103
caught in the matrix.

161
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:04,480
All right.
Get on the comm-pic to Dr. Marcus.

162
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,678
Aye, sir.

163
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,517
Maybe it's something
we can transplant, hmm?.

164
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,716
You know what she'll say.

165
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,852
Let me get this straight.
Something you can transplant?

166
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,759
Yes, Doctor.

167
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,764
Something you can transplant?.

168
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:26,105
- I don't know.
- It may only be preanimate matter.

169
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,641
Then again, it may not.

170
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,904
You boys have to be
clear on this.

171
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,572
There can't be so much as a microbe,
or the show's off.

172
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,017
Why don't you have a look?.
But if it can be moved--

173
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,053
You bet, Doctor.
We're on our way.

174
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,155
Well, don't have kittens.
Genesis is going to work.

175
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,720
They'll remember you in one breath
with Newton, Einstein, Surak.

176
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,858
Thanks a lot.
No respect from my offspring.

177
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,165
Par for the course.

178
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,864
You teaming up with me
for bridge after dinner?.

179
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,736
Maybe.

180
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,741
What is it?.

181
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,973
Every time we have dealings
with Starfleet, I get nervous.

182
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,275
We are dealing with
something that...

183
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,843
could be perverted
into a dreadful weapon.

184
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,020
Remember that overgrown Boy Scout
you used to hang around with?.

185
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,424
- That's the kind of man--
- Listen, kiddo.

186
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:26,455
Jim Kirk was many things,
but he was never a Boy Scout.

187
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,130
Captain Terrell,
stand by to beam down.

188
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,952
Chekov, are you sure
these are the correct coordinates?

189
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,923
Captain,
this is the garden spot...

190
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,926
of Ceti Alpha VI.

191
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,188
I can barely see it.

192
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,700
There's nothing here.

193
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,369
The tricorder must be brokken.

194
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,682
Chekov, over here.

195
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,060
Those look like cargo carriers.

196
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,073
Hey, give me a hand.

197
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,280
What the hell happened?.

198
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,792
If they crashed,
then where's the rest of the ship?.

199
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,669
What the hell is that?.

200
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,723
Botany Bay?

201
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:10,761
Botany Bay!! Oh, no!

202
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,425
We've got to get out of here now!
Damn! Hurry!

203
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,061
- What about the tricorder?.
- Never mind that. Hurry! Hurry!

204
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,833
Chekov, what's the matter
with you?.

205
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,972
Come on! Hurry!

206
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,519
Starship Reliant
to Captain Terrell.

207
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,791
This is Commander Kyle.
Will you please respond, Captain?.

208
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,792
Captain Terrell,
respond, please.

209
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,337
Let's give them
a little more time.

210
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,371
Khan.

211
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,460
I don't know you.

212
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,335
But you--

213
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,330
I never forget a face.

214
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,841
Mr....

215
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,311
Chekov.

216
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,080
Isn't it?.

217
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,779
I never thought
to see your face again.

218
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,484
- Chekov, who is this man?.
- A criminal, Captain.

219
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,119
A product of late 20th-century
genetic engineering.

220
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,356
What do you want with us?.
Sir, I demand to be--

221
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,094
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

222
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,965
I, on the other hand,
am in a position...

223
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,440
to grant nothing.

224
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,307
What you see
is all that remains...

225
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,007
of the ship's company and crew
of the Botany Bay...

226
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:49,851
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

227
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,323
- Listen, you men and women--
- Captain, Captain.

228
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,690
Save your strength, Captain.

229
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:04,801
These people had sworn
to live and die at my command...

230
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,239
200 years before you were born.

231
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:14,075
Do you mean he never
told you the tale?.

232
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,740
To amuse your captain?. No?.

233
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,218
Never told you how the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay...

234
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,655
Iost in space
from the year 1996...

235
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,387
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?.

236
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,488
- I've never even met Admiral Kirk.
- Admiral?.

237
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,965
Admiral.

238
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,234
Admiral.

239
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,440
Never told you
how Admiral Kirk...

240
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,742
sent 70 of us into exile...

241
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,045
on this barren sand heap...

242
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:56,679
with only the contents of
these cargo bays to sustain us?.

243
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,521
You lie!
On Ceti Alpha V, there was life.

244
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,154
- A fair chance--
- This is Ceti Alpha V!

245
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,269
Ceti Alpha VI exploded...

246
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,937
six months after
we were left here.

247
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,310
The shock shifted the orbit
of this planet...

248
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,748
and everything was laid waste.

249
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:31,085
Admiral Kirk never bothered
to check on our progress.

250
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,758
It was only the fact of my
genetically engineered intellect...

251
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,925
that allowed us to survive.

252
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,105
On Earth...

253
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,710
200 years ago...

254
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,081
I was a prince...

255
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,377
with power over millions.

256
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,319
Captain Kirk was your host.

257
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,756
You repaid his hospitality by
trying to steal his ship...

258
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,759
and murder him.

259
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,462
You didn't expect to find me.

260
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,443
You thought
this was Ceti Alpha VI.

261
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,783
Why are you here?.

262
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,194
Why?.

263
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,368
Allow me to introduce you
to Ceti Alpha V's...

264
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,275
only remaining
indigenous life-form.

265
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,587
What do you think?.

266
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,490
It killed 20 of my people...

267
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,023
including my beloved wife.

268
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,179
Oh, no, not all at once.

269
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,748
And not instantly,
to be sure.

270
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:03,238
You see, their young
enter through the ears...

271
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:07,039
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

272
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,080
This has the effect
of rendering the victim...

273
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:13,084
extremely susceptible
to suggestion.

274
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:18,922
Later, as they grow...

275
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,758
follows madness...

276
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,525
and death.

277
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,197
Khan, listen to me.

278
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,767
These are pets, of course.

279
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:46,384
Not quite domesticated.

280
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,751
Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty.

281
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:21,720
That's better.

282
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:28,351
Now tell me,
why are you here?.

283
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:32,592
And tell me where I may find...

284
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,634
James Kirk.

285
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:41,237
Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's
shuttle. You're cleared for docking.

286
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:43,503
Approach port side torpedo bay.

287
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,179
Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
party on final approach.

288
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,117
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

289
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,635
I hate inspections.

290
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:14,839
I'm delighted. Any chance
to go aboard the Enterprise.

291
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,586
I, for one, am glad to have you
at the helm for three weeks.

292
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,246
I don't think
these kids can steer.

293
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,473
Open the airlock.

294
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,942
- Permission to come aboard.
- Welcome, Admiral.

295
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,707
I think you know
my trainee crew.

296
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,873
Certainly, they have
come to know you.

297
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,474
Yes, we've been through
death and life together.

298
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:06,690
Mr. Scott, you old space dog.
You're well.

299
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,389
I had a wee bout, sir,
but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.

300
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,158
Wee bout of what?.

301
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:14,223
- Shore leave, Admiral.
- Oh, I see.

302
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,803
And who do we have here?.

303
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:22,137
Midshipman First Class Peter
Preston, engineer's mate, sir.

304
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,803
-First training voyage, Mr. Preston?.
-Yes, sir.

305
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,710
I see.

306
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,046
Well, shall we start
with the engine room?.

307
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,449
We'll see you there, sir.
Everything is in order.

308
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,818
That'll be a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Scott.

309
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,556
I'll see you on the bridge,
Admiral.

310
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,493
Company, dismissed.

311
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,076
I believe you'll find
everything shipshape, Admiral.

312
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:40,085
Oh, do you?.

313
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,554
Do you have any idea,
Midshipman Preston...

314
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:44,954
how many times I've had to listen
to Mr. Scott on the comm...

315
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,548
telling me his trouble?.

316
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:48,560
Do you have any idea the ribbing
I've had to endure...

317
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:50,892
in the officer's mess
to the effect that...

318
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:54,195
the Enterprise is
a flying deathtrap?.

319
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,201
Oh, no, sir!

320
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:59,602
This is the finest engine room
in the whole Starfleet!

321
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:03,699
If the admiral can't see the facts,
then with all due respect...

322
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:06,871
he's as blind
as a Tiberian bat.

323
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,846
Sir.

324
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:12,043
Midshipman, you're a tiger.

325
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:16,612
My sister's youngest, Admiral.
Crazy to get to space.

326
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:20,557
Every young man's fantasy.
I seem to remember it myself.

327
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:25,655
Mr. Scott, are your engines capable
of handling a training cruise?.

328
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,666
Give the word, Admiral.

329
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:31,470
- The word is given.
- Aye, sir.

330
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,564
But, Admiral, how about
the rest of the inspection?.

331
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:52,755
This is Starfleet Operations.
Enterprise is clear for departure.

332
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:55,294
Admiral on the bridge.

333
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:58,592
- Prestage flux chamber, port.
- On.

334
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:01,429
- Prestage flux chamber, starboard.
- On.

335
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,935
- Main stage flux chamber, port.
- Enabled.

336
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,528
- Running lights on.
- Main stage flux chamber starboard.

337
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,506
- Enabled.
- Intercooler status.

338
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:11,408
- Standby.
- Very well, Mr. Saavik.

339
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,344
- You may clear all moorings.
- Aye, sir.

340
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,542
- All moorings are cleared, Captain.
- Thankyou.

341
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:25,650
Lieutenant...

342
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:28,758
have you ever piloted
a starship out of space dock?.

343
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:32,163
Never, sir.

344
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,102
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

345
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,445
Aye, sir.

346
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,784
For everything there is
a first time, Lieutenant.

347
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,122
Don't you agree, Admiral?.

348
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:05,096
- Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Aft thrusters.

349
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,164
- Would you like a tranquilizer?.
- Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

350
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,227
Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

351
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,907
- We are free to navigate.
- Course heading, Captain?.

352
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,208
Captain's discretion.

353
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,374
Mr. Sulu...

354
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,283
you may indulge yourself.

355
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,421
Aye, sir.

356
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,881
Does that about do it?.

357
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,440
I don't think there's
another piece of information...

358
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,645
we could squeeze
into the memory banks.

359
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,688
- We'll design a bigger one.
- Who would want to build it?.

360
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,851
Dr. Marcus.

361
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,157
Comm-pic coming in
on hyperchannel.

362
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,663
It's the starship Reliant.

363
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,699
On the screen, please,Jedda.

364
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:27,262
Come in, please. This is
the Reliant calling Regula I.

365
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,740
Repeat, this is USS Reliant.

366
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,643
Commander, we are receiving.
This is Regula I. Go ahead.

367
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,807
Ah, Dr. Marcus. Good.

368
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:40,977
We're en route to you
and should be there in three days.

369
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:45,717
En route?. Why?. We weren't
expecting you for three months.

370
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,316
- Has something happened?.
- Nothing has happened.

371
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,861
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

372
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,625
Then I don't understand
why you're coming.

373
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,166
We have received new orders.

374
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,895
Upon arrival at Regula I...

375
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,904
all materials
of Project Genesis...

376
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,837
will be transferred
to this ship...

377
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,467
for immediate testing
on Ceti Alpha VI.

378
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,103
- Who do they think they are?.
- Please, be quiet.

379
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,478
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

380
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,518
Who gave the order?.

381
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,486
The order comes from
Starfleet Command, Dr. Marcus...

382
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,318
direct from the general staff.

383
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,381
It's a civilian--

384
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,451
Genesis is a civilian project
under my control.

385
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,154
I have my orders.

386
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,530
Pin him down, Mother.
Who gave the order?.

387
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,994
The order comes from...

388
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,231
Admiral James T. Kirk.

389
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,300
I knew it! I knew it!

390
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,369
The military's wanted
to get their hands on this.

391
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,573
This is completely improper.

392
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,913
I have no intention
of allowing Reliant...

393
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,852
or any unauthorized personnel
access to ourwork or materials.

394
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,247
I am sorry that you
feel that way, Doctor.

395
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:56,021
Admiral Kirk's orders
are confirmed.

396
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,087
Please prepare to deliver Genesis
to us upon our arrival.

397
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,598
Reliant out.

398
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,505
Well done, Commander.

399
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,373
You realize, sir, they will attempt
to contact Admiral Kirk...

400
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,378
and confirm the order.

401
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,458
Hold, please.

402
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,029
Thank you, sir.

403
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:39,131
Lieutenant, are you wearing
your hair differently?.

404
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,138
It's still regulation,
Admiral.

405
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,143
May I speak, sir?.

406
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,946
Self-expression doesn't seem
to be one of your problems.

407
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:59,150
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

408
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,954
- I failed to resolve the situation.
- There's no correct resolution.

409
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,689
It's a test of character.

410
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,664
May I ask how you
dealt with the test?.

411
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,069
You may ask.

412
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,701
That's a little joke.

413
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:21,235
Humor.
It is a difficult concept.

414
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:26,114
- It is not logical.
- We learn by doing.

415
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,414
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?.

416
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:31,012
Thank you, sir.

417
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,786
- She change her hairstyle?.
- I hadn't noticed.

418
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,693
Wonderful stuff,
that Romulan ale.

419
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:40,698
-Admiral Kirk.
- Kirk here.

420
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:44,031
I have an urgent comm-pic
from Space Lab Regula I, sir.

421
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,535
Dr. Carol Marcus.

422
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,667
- I'll take it in my quarters.
-Aye, sir.

423
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,506
It never rains, but it pours.

424
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,448
As a physician,
you should appreciate...

425
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:00,178
the dangers of reopening
old wounds.

426
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,848
- Sorry.
-Jim, canyou read me?

427
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:10,156
I can hearyou, Carol.
What's wrong?. What's the matter?.

428
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,925
Why are you taking
Genesis away from us?

429
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:17,901
Taking Genesis?. Who's taking
Genesis?. Who is taking Genesis?.

430
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,302
- I can see you, but I can't hear.
- Carol--

431
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,604
Jim, did you give the order?

432
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:28,373
- What order?. Who's taking Genesis?.
- Please help us.

433
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,244
I will not let them have Genesis
without proper authorization.

434
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,806
Have Genesis?.

435
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,045
On whose authority
can they do this?

436
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,054
No one's authority.

437
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,384
- Uhura, what's happening?.
- Transmission jammed at the source.

438
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,021
Alert Starfleet headquarters.

439
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,725
Aye, sir.

440
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,734
I want to talk
to Starfleet Command.

441
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:55,199
We must have order in here.
This has to be a mistake.

442
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,731
Mistake.
We're all alone here.

443
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,574
They waited until everyone
was on leave to do this.

444
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,774
Reliant is supposed to be at
our disposal, not vice versa.

445
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,308
- Starfleet never intended--
- I can't believe Starfleet--

446
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,822
I tried warning you. Scientists
are always pawns of the military.

447
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,551
Starfleet has kept the peace
for 100 years.

448
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,584
I cannot subscribe to your
interpretation of this event.

449
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,960
You may be right, Doctor...

450
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,795
but what about Reliant?

451
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,666
She's on her way.

452
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:30,299
- Well, get your gear together.
- Where are we going?.

453
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,900
That's for us to know
and Reliant to find out.

454
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:47,185
We have a problem.
Something may be wrong on Regula I.

455
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,352
We've been ordered
to investigate.

456
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:55,433
If memory serves, Regula I is
a scientific research laboratory.

457
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,596
I told Starfleet Command all we had
was a boatload of children.

458
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:05,505
But we're the only ship
in the quadrant.

459
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:08,512
Spock, these cadets of yours,
how good are they?.

460
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,775
How will they respond
under real pressure?.

461
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,874
As with all living things...

462
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,442
each according to his gifts.

463
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,217
Of course, the ship is yours.

464
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:24,229
No, that won't be necessary.
Just get me to Regula I.

465
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,796
As a teacher on
a training mission...

466
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,298
I am content to command
the Enterprise.

467
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,267
If we are to go
on actual duty...

468
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:35,295
it is clear that the senior officer
on board must assume command.

469
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,308
It may be nothing.

470
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,310
Garbled communications.

471
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,114
- You take the ship.
-Jim...

472
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,946
you proceed from
a false assumption.

473
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,818
I am a Vulcan.
I have no ego to bruise.

474
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,153
You're about to remind me that
logic alone dictates your actions?.

475
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,164
I would not remind you of that
which you know so well.

476
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,393
If I may be so bold...

477
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,993
It was a mistake foryou
to accept promotion.

478
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,734
Commanding a starship
is your first, best destiny.

479
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,869
Anything else is
a waste of material.

480
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,643
- I would not presume to debate you.
- That is wise.

481
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:23,045
In any case,
were I to invoke logic...

482
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:26,022
Iogic clearly dictates
that the needs of the many...

483
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,523
outweigh the needs
of the few.

484
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,725
Or the one.

485
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,662
You're my superior officer.

486
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,967
You are also my friend.

487
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,339
I have been and always
shall be yours.

488
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,237
- Stop the energizers.
- Stop energizers.

489
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,249
Put me on speakers.

490
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,747
An emergency situation
has arisen.

491
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,950
By order of Starfleet Command,
as of now, 1 800 hours...

492
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,788
I'm assuming command
of this vessel.

493
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,158
Duty officer,
so note in ship's log.

494
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,426
Plot a new course for Space
Laboratory Regula I. Engine room.

495
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,965
- Mr. Scott.
-Aye, sir?

496
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,971
- We'll be going to warp speed.
-Aye, sir.

497
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,507
Course plotted for Regula I,
Admiral.

498
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,271
Engage warp engines.

499
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,939
- Prepare forwarp speed.
- Ready, sir.

500
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,285
I know none ofyou
were expecting this.

501
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,911
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,320
I'm going to have to ask you to
grow up sooner than you expected.

503
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,259
Warp five, Sulu.

504
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,461
So much for
the little training cruise.

505
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,639
Course to intercept
Enterprise ready, sir.

506
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,006
Excellent.

507
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:56,171
- Helmsman?.
- Sir, may I speak?.

508
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,917
We're all with you, sir.

509
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,514
But consider this--

510
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,617
We are free.

511
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,357
We have a ship and the means
to go where we will.

512
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,925
We have escaped permanent exile
on Ceti Alpha V.

513
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,768
You have proved
your superior intellect...

514
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,605
and defeated the plans
of Admiral Kirk.

515
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,873
You do not need
to defeat him again.

516
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,642
He tasks me.

517
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,948
He tasks me,
and I shall have him.

518
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,353
I'll chase him
'round the moons of Nibia...

519
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:42,257
and 'round
the Antares maelstrom...

520
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,851
and 'round
perdition's flames...

521
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,022
before I give him up.

522
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,997
Prepare to alter course.

523
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,964
Space Station Regula I,
please come in.

524
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,668
Dr. Marcus, please respond.

525
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,879
This is Enterprise call--

526
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:06,810
It's no use.
There's no response from Regula I.

527
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,285
- But no longer jammed.
- No, sir. No nothing.

528
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,419
There are two possibilities--

529
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:23,024
They are unable to respond;
they are unwilling to respond.

530
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,362
How far?.

531
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,063
Twelve hours, forty-three minutes,
present speed.

532
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,639
"Give up Genesis," she said.

533
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,076
What in God's name does it mean?.
Give it up to whom?.

534
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:39,014
It might help my analysis
if I knew what Genesis was...

535
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,017
beyond the biblical reference.

536
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,713
Uhura, have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

537
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,722
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Saavik.

538
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,055
You have the con.

539
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:57,028
Well, I've got sick bay ready.
Please tell me what's going on.

540
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:02,566
Computer, request
security procedure...

541
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,074
and access to
Project Genesis summary.

542
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,305
Identify for retina scan.

543
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,813
Kirk, Admiral James T.

544
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:21,081
Security scan approved.

545
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,420
Summary, please.

546
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,766
Project Genesis--
a proposal to the Federation.

547
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,268
Carol Marcus.

548
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,034
What exactly is Genesis?

549
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:40,236
Well, put simply,
Genesis is life...

550
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:43,109
from lifelessness.

551
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,478
It is a process
whereby molecular structure...

552
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,916
is reorganized
at the subatomic level...

553
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,944
into life-generating matter
of equal mass.

554
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,356
Stage one of our experiments
was conducted in the laboratory.

555
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:59,692
Stage two ofthe series will be
attempted in a lifeless underground.

556
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,928
Stage three will involve
the process on a planetary scale.

557
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,198
It is our intention to introduce
the Genesis Device...

558
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,365
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body--

559
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,205
a moon or other dead form.

560
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:16,405
The device is delivered,
instantaneously causing...

561
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,347
what we call
the Genesis effect.

562
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:23,615
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

563
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,805
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet...

564
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,067
capable of sustaining
whatever life-forms...

565
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,268
we see fit to deposit on it.

566
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,471
-Fascinating.
-The reformed moon simulated here...

567
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:53,642
represents the merest fraction
ofthe Genesis potential...

568
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:56,152
should the Federation wish
to fund these experiments...

569
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,848
to their logical conclusion.

570
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:03,383
When we consider the problems
of population and food supply...

571
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:06,396
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

572
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:10,093
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you for your attention.

573
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,102
It literally is Genesis.

574
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,639
Power of creation.

575
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,877
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?.

576
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:26,144
The tape was made about a year ago.
I assume they've reached stage two.

577
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:30,483
Dear Lord, do you think
we're intelligent enough to--

578
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,488
Suppose--

579
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,389
What if this thing was used
where life already exists?.

580
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:39,793
It would destroy such life
in favor of its new matrix.

581
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,697
Its new matrix.

582
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:45,361
Do have any idea
what you're saying?.

583
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:49,497
I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.

584
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,167
As a matter of cosmic history,
it has always been...

585
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,803
easier to destroy
than to create.

586
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:58,246
Not anymore.
Now we can do both at the same time.

587
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,375
According to myth,
the earth was created in six days.

588
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:05,857
Now watch out! Genesis will
do it for you in six minutes.

589
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,652
I do not dispute that
in the wrong hands--

590
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,887
In the wrong hands?.

591
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:13,294
Would you mind telling me
whose are the right hands...

592
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:15,298
my logical friend?.

593
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,995
Are you, by any chance,
in favor of these experiments?.

594
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:24,064
- Gentlemen, this isn't--
- Really, Dr. McCoy.

595
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:28,168
You must govern your passions.
They will be your undoing.

596
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,407
- Logic suggests--
- Logic?.

597
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:34,178
My God, the man's
talking about logic.

598
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,447
We're talking about
universal armageddon.

599
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,889
- You green-blooded, inhuman--
- Bridge to Admiral Kirkk.

600
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:45,554
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area, closing fast.

601
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,327
- What do you make of her?.
- It's one ofours. It's Reliant.

602
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,698
Reliant?.

603
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,972
Try the emergency channels.

604
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:02,211
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

605
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,830
Slow to one-half impulse power.

606
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,566
Let's be friends.

607
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,569
Slowing to one-half
impulse power.

608
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:31,199
Reliant in our section--
this quadrant, sir, and slowing.

609
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:35,769
Sir, may I quote general order 1 2?.
"On the approach of any vessel...

610
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,541
when communications
have not been established--"

611
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:42,314
Lieutenant, the admiral is
well aware of the regulations.

612
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,819
Aye, sir.

613
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,982
Is it possible their
comm system has failed?.

614
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,825
It would explain
a great many things.

615
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:56,298
They're requesting
communication, sir.

616
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:57,925
Let them eat static.

617
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,571
They're still running
with shields down.

618
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,168
Of course.
We are one big happy fleet.

619
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:11,374
Ah, Kirk, my old friend.

620
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,145
Do you know the Klingon proverb
that tells us...

621
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:18,348
revenge is a dish
that is best served cold?.

622
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,554
It is very cold in space.

623
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,273
This is damn peculiar.

624
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,801
- Yellow alert.
- Energize defense fields.

625
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,748
I'm getting a voice message.

626
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,586
They say their chambers coil
is overloading their comm system.

627
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,955
- Spock?.
- Scanning.

628
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,995
Their coil emissions
are normal.

629
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,163
They still haven't raised
their shields.

630
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:04,724
Raise ours.

631
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,130
- Their shields are going up.
- Lock phasers on target.

632
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,067
Locking phasers on target.

633
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,169
- Locking phasers.
- Raise shields.

634
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,577
Fire!

635
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,526
- Get those shields up!
- Trying, sir!

636
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,147
I can't get power.

637
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,694
- Turn off those damn channels!
- Mr. Scott on the screen.

638
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,857
We're just hanging on, sir.

639
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,867
The main energizer's out.

640
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:14,234
- Try auxiliary power.
- Aye, aye, sir,

641
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,738
Damage report.

642
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:26,073
- They knew exactly where to hit us.
- Who?.

643
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,209
Who knew where to hit us?.
And why?.

644
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,812
One thing is certain.
We cannot escape on auxiliary power.

645
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:35,491
Visual.

646
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,562
Sulu, divert power to phasers.

647
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,154
- Too late.
- Hang on!

648
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:57,207
- Scotty, what's left?.
-Just the battery, sir.

649
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,340
I can have auxiliary power
in a few minutes.

650
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,884
We don't have a few minutes!

651
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,694
- Can you give me phaser power?.
- A few shots, sir.

652
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,355
- Not enough against their shields.
- Who the hell are they?.

653
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,763
Admiral, the commander of
the Reliant is signaling.

654
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:19,462
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

655
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,246
Put it on screen.

656
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,545
- Admiral--
- Do it!

657
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,710
While we still have time.

658
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:42,658
On screen, sir.

659
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:55,503
You still remember, Admiral.

660
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:58,269
I cannot help but be touched.

661
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,833
I, of course, remember you.

662
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,245
What is the meaning of this attack?.
Where's the crew of the Reliant?

663
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:09,013
Surely, I have made
my meaning plain.

664
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:12,487
I mean to avenge myself upon you,
Admiral.

665
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:15,684
I deprived your ship of power,
and when I swing around...

666
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,159
I mean to deprive you
of your life.

667
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,695
But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you.

668
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,267
If it's me you want...

669
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:34,709
I'll have myself beamed aboard.

670
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,942
- Spare my crew.
- I make you a counterproposal.

671
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,746
I'll agree to your terms if--

672
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,150
if--

673
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,688
in addition to yourself...

674
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,418
you hand over to me
all data and material...

675
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:52,223
regarding the project
called Genesis.

676
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,957
Genesis?. What's that?.

677
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,864
Don't insult my intelligence,
Kirk.

678
00:53:56,934 --> 00:54:00,233
Give me time to recall
the data on our computers.

679
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:03,569
I give you 60 seconds,
Admiral.

680
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,948
Clear the bridge.

681
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,378
At least we know he
doesn't have Genesis.

682
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,620
Keep nodding as though
I'm still giving orders.

683
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:27,027
Mr. Saavik, punch up the data charts
of Reliant's command console.

684
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,564
Reliant's command?.

685
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,065
- Hurry.
- Forty-five seconds.

686
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,136
- The prefix code?.
- It's all we've got.

687
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,070
- Chart's up, sir.
-Admiral?

688
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,079
We're finding it.

689
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,578
Please.
Please, you've got to give us time.

690
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,416
The bridge is smashed.
The computer's inoperative.

691
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,184
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

692
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,131
Damn!

693
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:07,261
It's coming through now, Khan.

694
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:16,946
- Reliant's prefix number is 16309.
- I don't understand.

695
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,949
You have to learn why
things work on a starship.

696
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:22,178
Each ship has its own
combination code--

697
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,653
To prevent an enemy from
doing what we're attempting.

698
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,418
We're using our console...

699
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,427
to order Reliant
to lower her shields.

700
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,987
Assuming he hasn't changed the
combination. He's quite intelligent.

701
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,999
Fifteen seconds, Admiral.

702
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,406
How do we know
you'll keep your word?.

703
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,637
I've given you no word to keep,
Admiral.

704
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,771
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

705
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:56,747
I see your point.

706
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,981
Stand by to receive
our transmission.

707
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,187
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target
and await my command.

708
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:05,626
Phasers locked.

709
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,630
Time's up, Admiral.

710
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,534
Here it comes. Now, Mr. Spock.

711
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,538
Sir, our shields are dropping.

712
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:28,210
- Raise them!
- I can't!

713
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,818
Where's the override?.
The override?.

714
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,686
Fire!

715
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,057
Fire!

716
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,924
Fire! Fire!

717
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:47,470
- We can't fire, sir!
- Why can't you?.

718
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,700
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive.

719
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,232
We must withdraw! Sir, we must!

720
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:05,421
Enterprise will wait.
She's not going anywhere.

721
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:16,926
- Sir, you did it.
- I did nothing!

722
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,799
Except get caught
with my britches down.

723
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,896
I must be getting senile.

724
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:26,374
Mr. Saavik, you go right
on quoting regulations.

725
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,106
Meantime, let's find out
how badly we've been hurt.

726
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,425
- Is the word given, Admiral?.
- The word is given.

727
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,925
Warp speed.

728
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,435
Aye.

729
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:46,988
Why?.

730
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:54,354
He wants to kill me for passing
sentence on him 15 years ago.

731
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:59,198
He doesn't care who stands
between him and his vengeance.

732
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,362
I'm sorry, Scotty.

733
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:07,202
He stayed at his post
when the trainees ran.

734
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,438
Admiral, this is Spock.

735
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:14,115
Engine room reports
auxiliary power restored.

736
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,415
We can proceed
at impulse power.

737
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,887
Best speed to Regula I.
Kirk out.

738
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:28,164
Scotty, I have to ask.

739
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,893
Is there any chance of getting
the mains back on the line?.

740
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,959
I do not think so, sir,
but you'll have my best.

741
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:39,298
Thanks.
I know you tried, Doctor.

742
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,010
You all right?.

743
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:51,521
I don't know.

744
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,148
Doctors lose patients sometimes.

745
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:58,718
Damn it. I'm still in the dark.
How did he know about Genesis?.

746
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,729
I don't know.

747
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:05,130
But what's important is to prevent
him from getting his hands on it.

748
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:09,195
You said it yourself, it's a bang
that could rearrange the universe.

749
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,796
There still may be time.

750
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,334
You gave as good as you got.

751
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,508
We're alive only because I knew
something about these ships...

752
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,518
that he didn't.

753
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,823
Approaching Regula
and Space Lab Regula I.

754
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,728
Space Station Regula I,
this is the Starship Enterprise.

755
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,732
Please come in.

756
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,932
Space Station Regula I,
do you read?

757
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:49,837
Space Station Regula I, this is
Enterprise. Please ackknowledge.

758
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:53,981
This is Enterprise.
Do you read me?

759
01:00:56,887 --> 01:01:00,152
Space Station Regula I,
do you read?

760
01:01:00,224 --> 01:01:01,851
Please come in.

761
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:03,859
There's no response, sir.

762
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,523
Sensors, Captain?.

763
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,727
Scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

764
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,293
There's no way to ascertain
what's inside the station.

765
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,168
No way of telling if Reliant
is still in the area.

766
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,502
Precisely.

767
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,606
What do you make of that planetoid
beyond?.

768
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,475
Regula is class D.

769
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:26,573
It consists of various
unremarkable ores.

770
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,584
Essentially a great rock in space.

771
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,552
Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

772
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,755
A distinct possibility.

773
01:01:34,568 --> 01:01:36,798
-Engineering.
-Aye, sir.

774
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:40,772
Mr. Scott, do you have enough power
for transporters?.

775
01:01:40,841 --> 01:01:42,274
Barely, sir.

776
01:01:45,312 --> 01:01:47,803
- I'm going down there.
- Khan could be down there.

777
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:50,315
He's been there. Hasn't found what
he wants. Can you spare someone?.

778
01:01:50,384 --> 01:01:52,909
- There may be people hurt.
- Yeah. I can spare me.

779
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:55,819
Begging the admiral's pardon,
general order 15--

780
01:01:55,889 --> 01:01:58,323
"No flag officer shall
beam into a hazardous area...

781
01:01:58,392 --> 01:01:59,916
without armed escort."

782
01:01:59,993 --> 01:02:01,620
There's no such regulation.

783
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:09,158
All right. Join the party.
Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

784
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:11,204
Jim. Be careful.

785
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:13,372
We will.

786
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:39,861
Indeterminate life signs.

787
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:44,870
Phasers on stun.

788
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,808
Move out.

789
01:04:06,653 --> 01:04:08,086
Well, rigor
hasn't set in.

790
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:11,022
This couldn't have happened
too long ago,Jim.

791
01:04:11,091 --> 01:04:12,524
Carol.

792
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:16,654
This is Enterprise calling
Space Lab Regula I. Respond please.

793
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,790
Admiral. Over here.

794
01:04:19,866 --> 01:04:21,891
Dr. Marcus, come in, please.

795
01:04:46,827 --> 01:04:48,260
Oh, my God.

796
01:04:48,328 --> 01:04:51,024
Please acknowledge signal.
Please--

797
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:53,225
Commander Uhura,
this is Lieutenant Saavik.

798
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,292
We're all right.
Please stand by. Out.

799
01:04:58,138 --> 01:05:02,165
Oh, sir, it was Khan.

800
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:04,472
We found him
on Ceti Alpha V.

801
01:05:04,544 --> 01:05:06,512
- Easy. Easy.
- He--

802
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,244
He put creatures
in our bodies...

803
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:13,252
to control our minds.

804
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:17,016
It's all right.
You're safe now.

805
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,251
Made us say lies...

806
01:05:19,326 --> 01:05:21,123
do things...

807
01:05:21,194 --> 01:05:23,094
but we beat him.

808
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:26,929
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

809
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,661
The captain was strong.

810
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:30,669
Captain.

811
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:35,504
Where's Dr. Marcus?.
Where are the Genesis materials?.

812
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:39,511
He couldn't find them.
Even the data banks were empty.

813
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:41,069
Erased?.

814
01:05:41,148 --> 01:05:44,083
He tortured those people.

815
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:48,087
But none of them would tell him
anything. He went wild.

816
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:50,817
He slit their throats.

817
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:55,885
He wanted to tear the place apart,
but he was late.

818
01:05:55,962 --> 01:05:59,762
He had to get back to the Reliant
in time to blow you to bits.

819
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:02,597
Where's Reliant's crew?. Dead?.

820
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:07,402
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V.

821
01:06:07,474 --> 01:06:09,408
He's completely mad, Admiral.

822
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:11,410
He blames you
for the death of his wife.

823
01:06:11,478 --> 01:06:13,412
I know what
he blames me for.

824
01:06:17,684 --> 01:06:20,050
The escape pods
are all in place.

825
01:06:21,955 --> 01:06:23,855
Where's the transporter room?.

826
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:28,726
- Did he make it down here?.
- It was not my impression.

827
01:06:28,795 --> 01:06:32,094
He spent most of his time trying to
wring the information out of people.

828
01:06:32,165 --> 01:06:33,928
Anything?.

829
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,594
The unit's been left on...

830
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,831
which means nobody remained
to turn it off.

831
01:06:38,905 --> 01:06:41,965
Those people back there bought
escape time for Genesis...

832
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:43,475
with their lives.

833
01:06:43,543 --> 01:06:45,738
This is not logical.

834
01:06:45,812 --> 01:06:48,337
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula...

835
01:06:48,415 --> 01:06:50,542
a planetoid we know
to be lifeless.

836
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:56,953
If stage two is completed,
it was going to be underground.

837
01:06:57,023 --> 01:06:59,355
It was going to be
underground, she said.

838
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:01,360
Stage two ofwhat?.

839
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:05,129
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Spock here.

840
01:07:05,198 --> 01:07:07,257
Captain Spock, damage report.

841
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:11,566
Admiral, if we go by the book,
like Lieutenant Saavik...

842
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:13,833
hours could seem like days.

843
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,633
I read you, Captain.
Let's have it.

844
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,644
The situation
is grave, Admiral.

845
01:07:18,712 --> 01:07:21,476
We won't have main power
for six days.

846
01:07:21,548 --> 01:07:24,381
Auxiliary power
has temporarily failed.

847
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:30,014
Restoration may be possible
in two days. By the book, Admiral.

848
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,081
Meaning you can't
even beam us back?

849
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:34,093
Not at present.

850
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:38,320
Captain Spock...

851
01:07:38,398 --> 01:07:40,195
if you don't hear from us
within one hour...

852
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:42,667
your orders are to restore
what power you can...

853
01:07:42,736 --> 01:07:45,864
take the Enterprise
to the nearest starbase...

854
01:07:45,939 --> 01:07:48,703
and alert Starfleet Command as soon
as you're out of jamming range.

855
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:51,141
Sir, we won't leave you behind.

856
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:56,774
If you don't hear from us, there
won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.

857
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,819
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or--

858
01:07:59,886 --> 01:08:04,721
If it's all the same, Admiral,
we'd like to share the risk.

859
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:06,554
Right. Let's go.

860
01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:08,059
Saavik?.

861
01:08:09,763 --> 01:08:12,323
- Go?. Where are we going?.
- Where they went.

862
01:08:14,301 --> 01:08:16,929
Suppose they went nowhere?.

863
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:19,939
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

864
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:51,236
Admiral.

865
01:09:05,419 --> 01:09:07,353
Genesis, I presume.

866
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:16,889
Phasers down!

867
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:19,530
You!

868
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:30,301
- Where's Dr. Marcus?.
- I'm Dr. Marcus.

869
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:32,004
Jim!

870
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:45,857
Is that David?.

871
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:49,862
Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

872
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:54,267
Oh, of course he didn't.

873
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:56,268
David, you're just
making this harder.

874
01:09:56,336 --> 01:10:00,136
I'm afraid it's even harder
than you think, Doctor.

875
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:03,199
Please don't move.

876
01:10:03,276 --> 01:10:04,402
Chekov?.

877
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:06,969
I'm...

878
01:10:07,047 --> 01:10:08,480
sorry, Admiral.

879
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:12,649
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?.

880
01:10:15,956 --> 01:10:20,086
I have indeed, Captain.
You have done well.

881
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,253
I knew it.
You son of a bitch!

882
01:10:24,965 --> 01:10:29,459
- Don't move, anybody!
- Captain? We are waiting.

883
01:10:30,203 --> 01:10:31,534
What's the delay?.

884
01:10:31,605 --> 01:10:33,539
All is well, sir.

885
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:35,871
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

886
01:10:37,944 --> 01:10:41,209
First things first, Captain.

887
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,984
Kill Admiral Kirk.

888
01:10:56,463 --> 01:10:59,057
Sir, it is difficult. I--

889
01:10:59,132 --> 01:11:01,157
I try to obey, but--

890
01:11:01,234 --> 01:11:02,724
Kill him.

891
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:04,236
I--

892
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:14,674
Kill him, Terrell, now!

893
01:11:37,904 --> 01:11:39,371
God sakes!

894
01:11:41,374 --> 01:11:43,137
What is it?.

895
01:12:03,296 --> 01:12:04,729
Khan, you bloodsucker!

896
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:07,289
You're gonna have to do
your own dirty work now.

897
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,198
Do you hear me? Do you?

898
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,672
Kirk.

899
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:19,942
Kirk, you're still alive,
my old friend.

900
01:12:20,013 --> 01:12:24,541
Still, "old friend."

901
01:12:24,618 --> 01:12:26,745
You've managed to kill
just about everyone else.

902
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:31,086
But like a poor marksman,
you keep missing the target.

903
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,397
Perhaps I no longer
need to try, Admiral.

904
01:12:50,443 --> 01:12:52,377
They can't take it!

905
01:13:01,588 --> 01:13:03,078
Khan, you've got Genesis.

906
01:13:03,156 --> 01:13:05,750
But you don't have me.
You were going to kill me.

907
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:10,888
You're going to
have to come down here!

908
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:13,865
I've done far worse
than kill you.

909
01:13:16,536 --> 01:13:19,266
I've hurt you...

910
01:13:19,339 --> 01:13:22,968
and I wish to go on
hurting you.

911
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,411
I shall leave you
as you left me--

912
01:13:29,082 --> 01:13:30,879
as you left her--

913
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:33,283
marooned for all eternity...

914
01:13:33,353 --> 01:13:36,413
in the center
of a dead planet.

915
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:39,791
Buried alive.

916
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,001
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise.

917
01:13:56,076 --> 01:13:59,136
Can you read us?.

918
01:14:02,182 --> 01:14:03,843
He's coming around.

919
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:05,851
Can you read us?.

920
01:14:07,821 --> 01:14:09,618
It's no use, Admiral.

921
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:12,021
They're still jamming
all channels.

922
01:14:12,092 --> 01:14:14,652
If Enterprise followed orders,
she's long since gone.

923
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:17,891
If she couldn't obey,
she's finished.

924
01:14:17,964 --> 01:14:20,228
So are we, it looks like.

925
01:14:22,002 --> 01:14:26,166
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?.

926
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,672
Who is Khan?.

927
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:29,641
Well, it's a long story.

928
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:31,802
We appear to have
plenty oftime.

929
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:37,407
Is there anything to eat?.

930
01:14:37,484 --> 01:14:40,578
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm starved.

931
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:43,247
How can you think of food
at a time like this?.

932
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:46,292
First order of business--
survival.

933
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:49,328
There is food
in the Genesis cave...

934
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:52,695
enough to last a lifetime...

935
01:14:52,766 --> 01:14:54,961
if necessary.

936
01:14:55,035 --> 01:14:56,662
We thought this was Genesis.

937
01:14:56,736 --> 01:14:58,670
This?.

938
01:15:01,074 --> 01:15:03,269
It took the Starfleet
Corps of Engineers...

939
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:06,039
ten months in space suits
to tunnel out all this.

940
01:15:08,648 --> 01:15:10,639
What we did in there,
we did in a day.

941
01:15:11,818 --> 01:15:16,846
David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
and the lieutenant our idea of food?.

942
01:15:16,923 --> 01:15:18,891
We can't just sit here.

943
01:15:20,627 --> 01:15:22,060
Oh, yes, we can.

944
01:15:22,128 --> 01:15:24,230
This is just to give us
something to do, isn't it?.

945
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:29,566
Come on.

946
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:39,341
Admiral?.

947
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,345
As your teacher Mr. Spock
is fond of saying...

948
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:45,247
I like to think that there
always are possibilities.

949
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,398
I did what you wanted.

950
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:02,400
I stayed away.

951
01:16:04,203 --> 01:16:05,636
Why didn't you tell him?.

952
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:10,532
How can you ask me that?.

953
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:13,043
Were we together?.

954
01:16:13,112 --> 01:16:15,546
Were we going to be?.

955
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:18,640
You had your world,
and I had mine.

956
01:16:19,885 --> 01:16:22,718
And I wanted him in mine...

957
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:25,279
not chasing through the universe
with his father.

958
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:37,434
Actually...

959
01:16:38,704 --> 01:16:40,672
he's a lot like you...

960
01:16:41,307 --> 01:16:42,740
in many ways.

961
01:16:46,445 --> 01:16:48,003
Please tell me
what you're feeling.

962
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:55,648
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 15 years...

963
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:57,655
who's trying to kill me.

964
01:16:59,992 --> 01:17:02,222
You show me your son
that would be happy to help him.

965
01:17:06,231 --> 01:17:07,664
My son.

966
01:17:11,804 --> 01:17:15,331
My life that
could have been...

967
01:17:15,407 --> 01:17:16,840
and wasn't.

968
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:21,545
What am I feeling?.

969
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:26,850
Old.

970
01:17:30,289 --> 01:17:31,722
Worn out.

971
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:41,825
Let me show you something...

972
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,869
that'll make you feel young...

973
01:17:44,937 --> 01:17:46,905
as when the world was new.

974
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:02,253
Impulse power restored.

975
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:05,787
Excellent.

976
01:18:05,858 --> 01:18:08,554
More than a match
for poor Enterprise.

977
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:32,483
You did all this in a day?.

978
01:18:32,551 --> 01:18:35,213
The matrix formed in a day.

979
01:18:35,287 --> 01:18:40,520
The life-forms grew later
at a substantially accelerated rate.

980
01:18:43,896 --> 01:18:46,888
Jim! This is incredible!

981
01:18:46,965 --> 01:18:49,126
Have you ever seen the like?.

982
01:18:51,203 --> 01:18:53,569
Can I cook or can't I?.

983
01:19:12,424 --> 01:19:14,358
Where is she?.

984
01:19:20,065 --> 01:19:22,260
Sir, may I ask you
a question?.

985
01:19:22,334 --> 01:19:23,733
What's on your mind?.

986
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:25,770
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

987
01:19:25,838 --> 01:19:28,272
Are you asking me if we're
playing out that scenario now?.

988
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,934
On the test, sir.

989
01:19:31,009 --> 01:19:34,775
Will you tell me what you did?.
I would really like to know.

990
01:19:34,847 --> 01:19:39,181
Lieutenant, you are looking
at the only Starfleet cadet...

991
01:19:39,251 --> 01:19:42,152
who ever beat the no-win scenario.

992
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:44,451
How?.

993
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:47,617
I reprogrammed the simulation so it
was possible to rescue the ship.

994
01:19:47,693 --> 01:19:49,320
What?.

995
01:19:49,394 --> 01:19:50,952
He cheated.

996
01:19:51,029 --> 01:19:53,793
Changed the conditions
of the test.

997
01:19:53,866 --> 01:19:58,860
Got a commendation for original
thinking. I don't like to lose.

998
01:19:58,937 --> 01:20:03,033
Then you never faced
that situation-- faced death.

999
01:20:03,108 --> 01:20:05,702
I don't believe
in the no-win scenario.

1000
01:20:09,248 --> 01:20:11,182
Kirk to Spock.
It's two hours. Are you ready?.

1001
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:15,209
On schedule. Give us coordinates,
and we'll beam you aboard.

1002
01:20:15,287 --> 01:20:17,221
All right.

1003
01:20:20,592 --> 01:20:22,423
I don't like to lose.

1004
01:20:22,494 --> 01:20:26,760
We were immobilized. Captain Spock
said it would be two days.

1005
01:20:26,832 --> 01:20:31,064
You go by the book.
Spock, you know Dr. Marcus.

1006
01:20:31,136 --> 01:20:32,728
- Why, of course.
- Hello, Mr. Spock.

1007
01:20:32,804 --> 01:20:35,238
- I'm taking this bunch to sickbay.
- By the book?.

1008
01:20:35,307 --> 01:20:38,538
By the book.
Regulation 46-A.

1009
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,840
"If transmissions are being
monitored during battle--"

1010
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:43,609
"No uncoded messages
on an open channel."

1011
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:47,784
You lied.

1012
01:20:49,087 --> 01:20:51,681
- I exaggerated.
- Hours instead of days.

1013
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:55,158
Now we have minutes
instead ofhours.

1014
01:20:59,064 --> 01:21:01,692
- They're inoperative below C deck.
- What is working?.

1015
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:03,826
Not much, Admiral.
We have partial main power.

1016
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:06,564
- That's it?.
- Best we could do in two hours.

1017
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:10,875
That young man, he's my son.

1018
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:14,611
Fascinating.

1019
01:21:36,435 --> 01:21:38,369
- Admiral on the bridge.
- Battle stations.

1020
01:21:41,273 --> 01:21:43,207
Tactical.

1021
01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:45,909
Uh-oh.

1022
01:21:48,747 --> 01:21:51,272
She can still outrun us
and outgun us...

1023
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:55,347
but there is the Mutara Nebula
at 153 mark 4.

1024
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,910
Scotty, can we make it inside?.

1025
01:21:56,989 --> 01:21:59,082
The energizer's bypassed
like a Christmas tree...

1026
01:21:59,157 --> 01:22:00,920
so don't give me
too many bumps.

1027
01:22:00,993 --> 01:22:03,052
No promises. On yourway.

1028
01:22:03,128 --> 01:22:06,529
Trouble with the nebula, sir, is
all that static discharging gas...

1029
01:22:06,598 --> 01:22:08,532
clouds our tactical display.

1030
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,763
Visual won't function,
and shields will be useless.

1031
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:15,272
Sauce for the goose,
Mr. Saavik.

1032
01:22:16,908 --> 01:22:18,603
The odds will be even.

1033
01:22:56,915 --> 01:22:59,217
Ready to fire away one.

1034
01:23:04,388 --> 01:23:07,084
There she is!

1035
01:23:11,762 --> 01:23:15,755
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

1036
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:17,460
So much the better.

1037
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:47,493
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

1038
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:50,667
Reliant is closing.

1039
01:23:59,644 --> 01:24:01,908
If they go in there,
we'll lose them.

1040
01:24:03,481 --> 01:24:04,948
Explain it to them.

1041
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,784
That was close.

1042
01:24:17,862 --> 01:24:19,420
They don't want us
going in there.

1043
01:24:19,497 --> 01:24:24,764
Admiral, what happens if Reliant
fails to follow us into the nebula?.

1044
01:24:24,835 --> 01:24:27,998
I think we can guarantee that
she'll follow us, Lieutenant.

1045
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:31,473
Remind me to explain to you
the concept of the human ego.

1046
01:24:33,978 --> 01:24:35,411
Best speed, Scotty.

1047
01:24:43,154 --> 01:24:44,883
One minute
to nebula perimeter.

1048
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,889
Why are we slowing?.

1049
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,252
We daren't follow them
into the nebula, sir.

1050
01:24:50,328 --> 01:24:52,660
Our shields would be useless.

1051
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,990
They are reducing speed.

1052
01:24:58,069 --> 01:25:01,766
- Uhura, patch me in.
- Aye, sir.

1053
01:25:01,839 --> 01:25:04,399
You're on, Admiral.

1054
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,136
This is Admiral Kirkk.

1055
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:10,510
We tried it once your way, Khan.
Are you game for a rematch?

1056
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:16,720
I'm laughing at
the superior intellect.

1057
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:20,817
Full impulse power.

1058
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:25,453
No, sir! You have Genesis.
You can have whatever you--

1059
01:25:25,529 --> 01:25:27,053
Full power!

1060
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:29,065
Damn you!

1061
01:25:34,805 --> 01:25:36,636
I'll say this for him--
he's consistent.

1062
01:25:38,242 --> 01:25:41,177
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

1063
01:25:50,254 --> 01:25:52,552
Emergency lights.

1064
01:26:21,852 --> 01:26:23,285
Tactical.

1065
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,488
Inoperative.

1066
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:32,287
Raise the shields.

1067
01:26:32,363 --> 01:26:35,423
As I feared, sir--
not functional.

1068
01:26:35,499 --> 01:26:37,433
I'm reducing speed.

1069
01:27:19,343 --> 01:27:21,038
Target, sir.

1070
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:24,478
- Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
- Best guess. Fire when ready.

1071
01:27:33,824 --> 01:27:35,758
Aft torpedoes, fire!

1072
01:27:44,401 --> 01:27:46,335
Hold your course.

1073
01:28:08,692 --> 01:28:10,626
Phasers starboard!

1074
01:28:21,038 --> 01:28:22,403
Fire!

1075
01:28:44,094 --> 01:28:46,028
Damage, Mr. Scott.

1076
01:28:47,598 --> 01:28:51,466
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

1077
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:53,503
It's radiation.

1078
01:28:54,972 --> 01:28:57,202
Joachim.

1079
01:28:58,475 --> 01:28:59,908
Yours...

1080
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:04,171
is superior.

1081
01:29:11,488 --> 01:29:12,921
I shall avenge you.

1082
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:26,165
Could you use
another hand, Admiral?.

1083
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,602
Man the weapons console,
Mr. Chekov.

1084
01:29:34,945 --> 01:29:37,470
Sporadic energy readings,
port side aft.

1085
01:29:37,548 --> 01:29:41,211
Could be an impulse turn.

1086
01:29:41,285 --> 01:29:44,721
He won't break off now.

1087
01:29:44,788 --> 01:29:47,154
He followed me this far.
He'll be back.

1088
01:29:49,293 --> 01:29:51,955
But from where?.

1089
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:55,556
He's intelligent,
but not experienced.

1090
01:29:55,633 --> 01:29:59,000
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

1091
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:08,100
- Full stop.
- Full stop, sir.

1092
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,446
Z minus 10,000 meters.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

1093
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:07,769
Torpedoes ready, sir.

1094
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:20,380
Look sharp.

1095
01:31:24,255 --> 01:31:25,688
Fire.

1096
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:33,720
Fire.

1097
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:10,731
Uhura, send to commander,
Reliant.

1098
01:32:10,801 --> 01:32:13,326
- Prepare to be boarded.
- Aye, sir.

1099
01:32:15,005 --> 01:32:17,371
Commander, Reliant.
this is Enterprise.

1100
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:21,138
Surrender and prepare
to be boarded.

1101
01:32:21,211 --> 01:32:22,872
Enterprise to Reliant.

1102
01:32:22,947 --> 01:32:25,609
You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

1103
01:32:37,394 --> 01:32:39,328
Reliant.
Come in, Reliant.

1104
01:32:40,464 --> 01:32:43,092
You are ordered
to surrender your vessel.

1105
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:44,896
Enterprise to Reliant.

1106
01:32:44,969 --> 01:32:47,802
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel. Respond.

1107
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,353
No, Kirk.

1108
01:33:05,889 --> 01:33:08,790
The game's not over.

1109
01:33:44,428 --> 01:33:48,421
To the last
I will grapple with thee.

1110
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:04,203
Admiral.

1111
01:34:04,281 --> 01:34:07,773
Scanning an energy
source on Reliant.

1112
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,081
A pattern I've
never seen before.

1113
01:34:15,793 --> 01:34:17,317
It's the Genesis wave.

1114
01:34:17,394 --> 01:34:21,956
- What?.
- They're building up to detonation.

1115
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:25,126
- How soon?.
- We encoded four minutes.

1116
01:34:25,202 --> 01:34:26,931
We'll beam aboard
and stop it.

1117
01:34:27,004 --> 01:34:28,437
You can't.

1118
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:34,841
Scotty, I need warp speed in
three minutes, or we're all dead.

1119
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:39,281
- No response, Admiral.
- Scotty!

1120
01:34:39,349 --> 01:34:41,943
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

1121
01:34:42,019 --> 01:34:43,452
Aye, sir.

1122
01:35:21,825 --> 01:35:23,884
Are you out
of your Vulcan mind?.

1123
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:26,486
No human can tolerate
the radiation that's in there!

1124
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:30,124
As you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I am not human.

1125
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:33,369
You're not going in there.

1126
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:36,902
Perhaps you're right.

1127
01:35:36,974 --> 01:35:41,343
- What is Mr. Scott's condition?.
- Well, I don't think that he--

1128
01:35:42,246 --> 01:35:45,613
I'm sorry, Doctor. I have no time
to discuss this logically.

1129
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:52,217
Remember.

1130
01:36:01,165 --> 01:36:03,360
Spock! Get out of there!

1131
01:36:05,202 --> 01:36:07,261
Spock, get out of there!

1132
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:21,842
- Time, from my mark.
- Two minutes, ten seconds.

1133
01:36:21,919 --> 01:36:24,854
Engine room! What's happening?.

1134
01:36:27,257 --> 01:36:29,919
Good God, man!
Get out of there!

1135
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,426
No! Don't!

1136
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,923
Time.

1137
01:37:06,597 --> 01:37:08,997
Three minutes, thirty seconds.

1138
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:15,865
Distance from Reliant.

1139
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:18,407
Four thousand kilometers.

1140
01:37:18,475 --> 01:37:20,067
We're not gonna make it, are we?.

1141
01:37:36,026 --> 01:37:38,426
No, you can't get away.

1142
01:37:40,998 --> 01:37:45,094
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

1143
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:49,261
For hate's sake...

1144
01:37:49,339 --> 01:37:52,866
I spit my last breath...

1145
01:37:52,943 --> 01:37:54,376
at thee.

1146
01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:07,457
Sir, the mains
are back on line.

1147
01:38:07,457 --> 01:38:08,719
Sir, the mains
are back on line.

1148
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,622
Bless you, Scotty.
Go, Sulu!

1149
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,828
My God, Carol, look at it.

1150
01:39:08,751 --> 01:39:10,184
Engine room.

1151
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:13,785
Well done, Scotty.

1152
01:39:13,856 --> 01:39:15,551
Jim...

1153
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:18,856
I think you'd better
get down here.

1154
01:39:18,928 --> 01:39:21,692
- Bones?.
- Better hurry.

1155
01:39:26,068 --> 01:39:28,002
Saavik, take the con.

1156
01:39:56,299 --> 01:39:58,995
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment.

1157
01:39:59,068 --> 01:40:02,094
- He'll die.
- Sir, he's dead already.

1158
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,309
It's too late.

1159
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:03,864
Ship...

1160
01:41:05,001 --> 01:41:06,935
out of danger?.

1161
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,603
Yes.

1162
01:41:12,908 --> 01:41:14,842
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1163
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:19,881
It is logical.

1164
01:41:22,985 --> 01:41:26,011
The needs of the many
outweigh--

1165
01:41:28,557 --> 01:41:30,491
The needs of the few.

1166
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:33,060
Or the one.

1167
01:41:41,937 --> 01:41:46,067
I never took
the Kobayashi Maru test...

1168
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:49,243
until now.

1169
01:41:51,414 --> 01:41:54,178
What do you think
of my solution?.

1170
01:42:09,699 --> 01:42:11,394
I have been...

1171
01:42:11,467 --> 01:42:14,061
and always shall be...

1172
01:42:14,136 --> 01:42:16,070
your friend.

1173
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:24,111
Live long...

1174
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,613
and prosper.

1175
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,303
No.

1176
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:11,855
We are assembled here today...

1177
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:14,760
to pay final respects
to our honored dead.

1178
01:43:21,303 --> 01:43:25,364
And yet it should be noted that
in the midst of our sorrow...

1179
01:43:25,441 --> 01:43:28,501
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life...

1180
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:31,171
the sunrise of a new world...

1181
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:35,240
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect.

1182
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:40,188
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one...

1183
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:44,249
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom at these proceedings.

1184
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,623
Of my friend,
I can only say this.

1185
01:43:55,237 --> 01:43:59,537
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels...

1186
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:01,542
his was the most...

1187
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,814
human.

1188
01:44:08,017 --> 01:44:09,609
Honors...

1189
01:44:09,685 --> 01:44:11,118
hup.

1190
01:45:34,737 --> 01:45:36,170
Come.

1191
01:45:39,308 --> 01:45:41,242
I don't mean to intrude.

1192
01:45:42,344 --> 01:45:44,403
No, not at all.

1193
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,916
I should be on the bridge.

1194
01:45:47,983 --> 01:45:50,042
Can I talk to you
for a minute?.

1195
01:45:50,119 --> 01:45:52,349
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?.

1196
01:45:52,421 --> 01:45:54,981
Lieutenant Saavik was right.

1197
01:45:56,592 --> 01:45:58,184
You never have faced death.

1198
01:46:08,003 --> 01:46:09,937
No, not like this.

1199
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,869
I haven't faced death.

1200
01:46:14,944 --> 01:46:16,878
I've cheated death.

1201
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:22,148
I've tricked my way
out of death...

1202
01:46:22,217 --> 01:46:25,084
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1203
01:46:28,991 --> 01:46:30,424
I know nothing.

1204
01:46:30,492 --> 01:46:33,222
You knew enough to tell Saavik
that how we face death...

1205
01:46:33,295 --> 01:46:35,820
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1206
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:39,700
Just words.

1207
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:41,702
But good words.

1208
01:46:42,871 --> 01:46:47,706
That's where ideas begin.
Maybe you should listen to them.

1209
01:46:50,346 --> 01:46:53,213
I was wrong about you...

1210
01:46:53,282 --> 01:46:54,715
and I'm sorry.

1211
01:46:58,821 --> 01:47:01,984
Is that what
you came here to say?.

1212
01:47:02,057 --> 01:47:03,490
Mainly.

1213
01:47:09,832 --> 01:47:11,891
And also that I'm...

1214
01:47:13,369 --> 01:47:14,802
proud.

1215
01:47:16,338 --> 01:47:18,363
Very proud...

1216
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,873
to be your son.

1217
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:53,066
Captain's Log:
Stardate 8141.6.

1218
01:47:53,142 --> 01:47:55,838
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V...

1219
01:47:55,911 --> 01:47:59,574
to pick up the crew
of USS Reliant.

1220
01:47:59,648 --> 01:48:01,809
All is well.

1221
01:48:01,884 --> 01:48:05,411
And yet I can't help wondering
about the friend I leave behind.

1222
01:48:07,489 --> 01:48:10,322
"There are always
possibilities, '"Spock said.

1223
01:48:10,392 --> 01:48:13,327
And if Genesis is indeed...

1224
01:48:13,395 --> 01:48:15,556
Iife from death...

1225
01:48:16,632 --> 01:48:19,192
I must return
to this place again.

1226
01:48:23,939 --> 01:48:25,964
He's really not dead...

1227
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:29,139
as long as we remember him.

1228
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:37,682
"It's a far, far
better thing I do...

1229
01:48:37,753 --> 01:48:39,687
than I have
ever done before."

1230
01:48:41,957 --> 01:48:47,862
A far better
resting place I go to...

1231
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:49,363
than I have ever known.

1232
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:52,195
- Is that a poem?.
- No.

1233
01:48:54,002 --> 01:48:57,062
Something Spock was trying
to tell me on my birthday.

1234
01:48:57,139 --> 01:48:59,004
You okay,Jim?.

1235
01:49:00,843 --> 01:49:02,777
How do you feel?.

1236
01:49:05,114 --> 01:49:06,547
Young.

1237
01:49:10,652 --> 01:49:12,313
I feel young.

1238
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,096
Space, the final frontier.

1239
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,894
These are
the continuing voyages...

1240
01:50:31,967 --> 01:50:36,063
of the Starship Enterprise.

1241
01:50:36,138 --> 01:50:38,299
Her ongoing mission...

1242
01:50:38,373 --> 01:50:42,707
to explore strange, new worlds...

1243
01:50:42,778 --> 01:50:48,478
to seek out new life-forms
and new civilizations...

1244
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:52,350
to boldly go
where no man has gone...

1245
01:50:53,589 --> 01:50:55,022
before.
