1
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:05,293
There he is! Let's get him.

2
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,052
Come on!

3
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:29,314
I'm over here!

4
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,081
Verify materialization sequence.

5
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,881
Bring up the resolution
on radar unit 12.

6
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,618
<i>- Area 7 to Command.
- Go ahead.</i>

7
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:18,794
<i>We could use another
survey team out here, sir.</i>

8
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:21,622
Base to Ensign McCauley
and Ensign Gilles,

9
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,198
please report to Area 7
and assist the edaphology team.

10
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,060
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

11
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,569
Transferring anthropometric-data files
to secondary processor.

12
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:40,939
Still working on correlating
that unidentified blood groupings.

13
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,277
Comparative linguistic analysis
is complete, sir.

14
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:50,987
Admiral Dougherty is waiting
for this. Transmit it to the ship.

15
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:54,253
<i>Alert. Area 12.</i>

16
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:05,700
<i>- The android, he's out of control.
- Report.</i>

17
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:09,604
<i>He's headed toward the village.
We're trying to stop him.</i>

18
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:10,973
Over there!

19
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,373
Magnify.

20
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:23,848
Hold your fire.

21
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,519
What is it? What's happening?

22
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:34,668
Base to Commander Data.

23
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:39,834
<i>Rerouting microhydraulic
power distribution.</i>

24
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:44,336
<i>- Regulating thermal overload.
- Data, report to base immediately.</i>

25
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,913
<i>Transferring positronic-matrix
functions.</i>

26
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:49,016
<i>Engaging secondary protocol.</i>

27
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:51,346
He's trying to remove the headpiece.

28
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:55,254
All field units,
intercept the android.

29
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,593
Artim, it's all right.

30
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:12,106
Get inside, now.

31
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,379
Find shelter. Everyone, get inside.
Now! Back to your homes. Move it!

32
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,559
Now! Move!

33
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,488
Secondary protocol's active.

34
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:35,129
- They can see him.
- Stop him. Now.

35
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:48,637
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order.

36
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,143
I repeat, stand down!

37
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,608
Who are they?

38
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:52,737
It's an M-class planet.
Population 300 million.

39
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,466
<i>- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-cheen chef-faw.</i>

40
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:58,077
<i>Emphasis on the "cheen"
and the "faw."</i>

41
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,975
You either need a new uniform
or a new neck.

42
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:01,480
<i>"Yew-cheen chef-faw."</i>

43
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:03,810
My collar size is exactly
as it was at the academy.

44
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,420
Of course it is.

45
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:07,790
Our guests have arrived.

46
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,254
They're eating the floral arrangements
on the banquet tables.

47
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,427
I guess they don't believe
in cocktails before dinner.

48
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,257
Oh, my God. Are they vegetarian?
That's not in there.

49
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:18,627
Perhaps we should have the chef
whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette,

50
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,701
something that goes well
with chrysanthemums.

51
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,367
<i>- Yew-cheen.
- Chef-faw.</i>

52
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:25,904
<i>Yew-cheen chef-faw.</i>

53
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,043
<i>- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead, ensign.</i>

54
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,108
<i>Command wants to know
our ETA at the Goren system.</i>

55
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:31,507
The Goren system?

56
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,704
They need us
to mediate some territorial dispute.

57
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,908
No, no. We can't delay the
archeological expedition to Hanoran II.

58
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,213
That'll put us right in the middle
of the monsoon season.

59
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,151
- Captain.
- Thank you.

60
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,552
The diplomatic corps is busy
with Dominion negotiations.

61
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,163
Oh, yes. So they need us
to put out one more brushfire.

62
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:52,060
Can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers?

63
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:54,793
Deck 10.

64
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:58,995
Remember, they have a significantly
less advanced technology than ours.

65
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:01,403
They only achieved warp drive
last year.

66
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,637
And the Federation Council decided to
make them a protectorate so quickly.

67
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:06,747
In view of our losses to the Borg
and the Dominion,

68
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,851
the council feels we need
all the allies we can get these days.

69
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,583
Captain on deck.

70
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:21,928
You'll be expected to dance
with Regent Cuzar.

71
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,689
Can she mambo?

72
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,596
- Very funny.
- The captain used to cut quite a rug.

73
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:30,033
<i>La Forge to Picard. Captain, I need
to talk to you before the reception.</i>

74
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:32,139
- Captain.
- Mr. Worf.

75
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,139
- Worf.
- What the hell are you doing here?

76
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,710
- I was at the Manzar colony...
- He's late. Can it wait?

77
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:38,504
- I don't think so, commander.
- Excuse me.

78
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:41,946
Tell him I'm already here. I'll talk
to him when he arrives. Mr. Worf...

79
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,846
Geordi, the captain
would like you to come up.

80
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:46,350
<i>Tell him we received a communiqu√©
from Admiral Dougherty.</i>

81
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,547
<i>It's about Data.</i>

82
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:02,793
<i>Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise.</i>

83
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,133
Captain Picard, may I welcome you

84
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:08,332
in the time-honored tradition
of my people.

85
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:21,315
We are so honored to be accepted
within the great Federation family.

86
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:25,187
- We have a dance later, I believe.
- I look forward to it.

87
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:34,894
Counselor.

88
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:39,437
- Nice beadwork.
- Captain. Excuse me. Captain.

89
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:43,009
Captain, Admiral Dougherty is
onboard a Son'a ship in Sector 441.

90
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,769
He's requesting Data's schematics.

91
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,176
- Is something wrong?
- The message doesn't say.

92
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,873
Well, Data should have
been back by now.

93
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,918
They were only scheduled to observe
the Ba'ku village for one week.

94
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,054
Geordi, would you set up
a secure com-link

95
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:56,418
- to the admiral in the anteroom.
- Aye, sir.

96
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:01,461
Captain, Hars Adislo. We met at
the Nel Bato conference last year.

97
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:03,221
Did you ever have a chance
to read my paper

98
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:06,027
on thermionic transconductance?

99
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,168
Would you excuse me?

100
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,570
<i>He's not acknowledging
any Starfleet protocol.</i>

101
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,745
<i>He's not responding
to any of our hails.</i>

102
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:20,437
Have you any idea what precipitated
this behavior?

103
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,745
<i>None. Now he's holding
our people hostage down there.</i>

104
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:27,422
<i>The Enterprise could be
at your position in two days, admiral.</i>

105
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:29,557
<i>That's probably not a good idea.</i>

106
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,692
<i>Your ship hasn't been fitted
for this region.</i>

107
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:35,886
<i>- There are environmental concerns.
- What kind of concerns?</i>

108
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:38,397
<i>We haven't fully identified
the anomalies yet.</i>

109
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,899
<i>They're calling this whole area
the Briar Patch.</i>

110
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:42,662
<i>It took us a day to reach a location</i>

111
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,567
<i>where we could even get
a signal to you.</i>

112
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:49,643
<i>Just get me Data's schematics.
I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.</i>

113
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,080
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.

114
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,621
- Send the admiral Data's schematics.
- Aye, sir.

115
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,230
- Yes, sir.
- Ensign, would you report to the galley

116
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,797
and tell the chef to skip
the fish course.

117
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,298
- Aye, sir.
- I would like our guests to depart

118
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,163
as soon as etiquette allows.

119
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,898
I'm going to ask Worf to delay his
return to DS9 so that he can join us.

120
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:22,304
We're gonna stop by Sector 441
on our way to the Goren system.

121
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:26,538
- They are in opposite directions, sir.
- Are they?

122
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:50,504
I never should have let you talk me
into that duck blind in the first place.

123
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,004
Your Federation procedures
have made this mission

124
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,971
ten times as difficult
as it needed to be.

125
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:56,668
Our procedures were in place

126
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,678
to protect the planet's population
from unnecessary risk.

127
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:04,784
Planet's population?
Six hundred people.

128
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,553
If you want to avoid
unnecessary risks,

129
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,090
next time, leave your android home.

130
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,229
<i>Bridge to Ahdar Ru'afo,
we are approaching the planet.</i>

131
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,557
Take us into a high orbit.

132
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:21,202
Lie down, admiral, the girls
will take 20 years off your face.

133
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,134
Another time, perhaps.

134
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,706
Your self-restraint
puzzles me, admiral.

135
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:31,312
You continue to deny yourself
every benefit this mission has to offer.

136
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:34,647
I prefer to wait until we can share
the benefits

137
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,546
with all the people of the Federation.

138
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:43,591
- Report.
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.

139
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:45,760
Raise shields.

140
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:51,834
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes. Brace for impact.

141
00:12:56,972 --> 00:13:00,067
- The vessel has broken off pursuit, sir.
- Visual contact.

142
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:06,206
That's our ship.

143
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,565
Captain, we're about to lose all
communications with Starfleet.

144
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,238
Do you have everything you need?

145
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:33,966
I've downloaded all the files on the
duck-blind mission and the Son'a.

146
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:36,040
You have two days
to become experts.

147
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,384
Mr. Worf, our job is to come up
with a plan to safely capture Data.

148
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:46,577
I've already had Commander La Forge
modify this tricorder

149
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:49,279
with one of Data's actuation servos.

150
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:53,655
Its operational range is only 4 meters,
but it will shut him down.

151
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:57,927
Good to have you back, Mr. Worf.

152
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,967
Slow to one-third. Take us in.

153
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,780
Half century ago,
they conquered two primitive races,

154
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,455
the Tarlac and the Ellora,

155
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:24,250
and then integrated them into
their culture as a labor class.

156
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:28,886
Look at this. "The Son'a
are known to have produced

157
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:33,591
mass quantities of the narcotic
ketracel-white."

158
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,128
"Their ships are rumored
to be equipped

159
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,773
with isolytic subspace weapons

160
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,840
outlawed by the second
Khitomer Accord."

161
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,908
Why would we be involved
with these people?

162
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,773
Good question.

163
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,649
- You haven't done that in a long time.
- What?

164
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:54,788
- What you're doing to my neck.
- Was I doing something to your neck?

165
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,327
<i>Bridge to Commander Worf.</i>

166
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,298
<i>- Worf?
- Captain.</i>

167
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:09,437
I don't know how they do it
on Deep Space Nine,

168
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:13,698
<i>but on the Enterprise,
we still report for duty on time.</i>

169
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:18,769
<i>Sorry, sir. I'm on my way.</i>

170
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,211
We'll skip the court martial this time.

171
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:22,941
Picard out.

172
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:29,120
When was the last time we aligned
the torque sensors?

173
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:30,792
Two months ago, sir.

174
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:32,893
They don't sound right.

175
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,388
The torque sensors
are out of alignment.

176
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:37,725
By 12 microns.

177
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:40,230
- You could hear that?
- When I was an ensign,

178
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:43,200
I could detect
a 3-micron misalignment.

179
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,806
Excuse me, sir, the Son'a ship
with Admiral Dougherty aboard

180
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,100
has entered tracking range.

181
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,712
Straighten your baldric, commander.
On screen.

182
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:57,182
<i>Captain, I wasn't expecting you.</i>

183
00:15:57,385 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>This is too important for the Enterprise
to be on the sidelines, admiral.</i>

184
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:02,657
<i>I wish I had better news.</i>

185
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:05,850
<i>Commander Data attacked us
in a mission scout ship yesterday.</i>

186
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:09,225
<i>Ru'afo and I have decided
to send in an assault team.</i>

187
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,692
Commander Worf and I are working
on several tactical plans to save...

188
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,303
Your android has turned
dangerously violent, captain.

189
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,565
Considerable damage
was done to my ship.

190
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,408
He must be destroyed.

191
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,203
<i>I know what Data means to Starfleet,
Jean-Luc,</i>

192
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:27,075
<i>but our crew is at the mercy
of those people on the planet.</i>

193
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:32,216
If our first attempt
to capture Data fails...

194
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,048
...I will terminate him.

195
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:38,225
I should be the one to do it.
I'm his captain...

196
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:39,654
...and his friend.

197
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:43,562
<i>All right.</i>

198
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,393
<i>You have 12 hours, captain,</i>

199
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,727
<i>then I want you out
of the Briar Patch.</i>

200
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,063
<i>In the meantime, we'll head out
to the perimeter to call</i>

201
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:52,899
<i>for Son'a reinforcements,
in case you fail.</i>

202
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:54,576
Understood.

203
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,437
<i>Good luck, captain.</i>

204
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:58,942
<i>Dougherty out.</i>

205
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,082
Sensors are not picking up any ships
coming from the surface.

206
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:15,525
Transmit a wide-band covariant signal.
That ought to get his attention.

207
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,358
He must be using the planet's rings
to mask his approach.

208
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,694
The metaphasic radiation of
the rings is in a state of extreme flux.

209
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,303
We'll steer clear of those.

210
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:30,605
<i>Come out, come out
Wherever you are</i>

211
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:34,973
- Sir?
- It's something that my mother...

212
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,711
Hold on.

213
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,124
Open all hailing frequencies.

214
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:50,461
Data, this is Captain Picard.

215
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:53,395
<i>Data, please respond.</i>

216
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:02,409
If we fire tachyon bursts, it might force
him to reset his shield harmonics.

217
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:05,045
When he does,
we can beam him out.

218
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:06,976
Make it so.

219
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:14,421
Direct hit.
He is resetting his shield harmonics.

220
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:16,250
Beam him out.

221
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,565
He has activated
a transport inhibitor.

222
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,393
Prepare to enter the atmosphere.

223
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:27,830
We'll use the ionospheric boundary
to shake him.

224
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:36,044
Scanners are off-line.

225
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:39,681
Evasive maneuvers.
Heading 1-4-0, mark 3-1.

226
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:02,394
He can fly a ship.

227
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,766
He can anticipate tactical strategies.

228
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,134
Clearly, his brain is functioning.

229
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:08,741
We've seen how he responds
to threats.

230
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:10,638
I wonder how he would respond...

231
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:17,176
Mr. Worf, do you know
Gilbert and Sullivan?

232
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:19,911
No sir, I have not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members

233
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:22,249
since I have been back.

234
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,049
They're composers, Worf.

235
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:28,153
From the 19th century.

236
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,933
<i>Data was rehearsing a production
of H.M.S. Pinafore just before he left.</i>

237
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,403
<i>A British tar
Is a soaring soul</i>

238
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,942
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

239
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:47,582
<i>His energetic fist
should be ready to resist</i>

240
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,910
<i>A dictatorial word</i>

241
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,346
Sing, Worf, sing.

242
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:54,214
<i>- His nose should pant
- And his lip should curl</i>

243
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:57,619
<i>- His cheeks should flame
- And his brow should furl</i>

244
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:00,852
<i>- His bosom should heave
- And his heart should glow</i>

245
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:03,122
<i>And his fist be ever ready for a...</i>

246
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,855
<i>Knockdown blow</i>

247
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,798
<i>- His nose should pant
- And his lips should curl</i>

248
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:11,301
<i>His cheeks should flame
And his brow should furl</i>

249
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:13,974
<i>His bosom should heave
And his heart should glow</i>

250
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:17,338
<i>And his fist be ever ready
For a knockdown blow</i>

251
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,308
Prepare the docking clamps.

252
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:22,608
<i>His eyes should flash
With an inborn fire</i>

253
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,480
<i>His brow with scorn be wrung</i>

254
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:28,748
<i>He never should bow down
To a domineering frown</i>

255
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:32,085
<i>Or the tang of a tyrant tongue</i>

256
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:35,855
<i>- His heart should stamp
- And his throat should growl</i>

257
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:39,000
<i>- His hair should curl
- And his face should scowl</i>

258
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:42,465
<i>- His eyes should flash
- And his breast protrude</i>

259
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:46,198
<i>And this should be
His customary attitude</i>

260
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,105
<i>- His foot should stamp
- And his throat should...</i>

261
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:52,371
<i>His hair should curl
And his face...</i>

262
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:57,781
Inertial coupling
is exceeding tolerance.

263
00:20:57,986 --> 00:21:00,510
If we do not release him,
he may destroy both vessels.

264
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,190
I'm not letting go of him.

265
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:09,355
We must stabilize
the damping field.

266
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:13,125
Reroute emergency power
to inertial dampers.

267
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,769
The auto-sequencer was
damaged by phaser fire.

268
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,904
Transferring controls to manual.

269
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:27,446
Power sequence realigned,
engaging stabilizers.

270
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:29,340
Damping field established.

271
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:31,674
Maximum power.

272
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:44,163
Now, Mr. Worf.

273
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,773
Captain, Commander Data
is safely in custody.

274
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,223
Got it!

275
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,509
Captain, Subahdar Gallatin,
Son'a command.

276
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:40,153
<i>Lieutenant Curtis,
attach√© to Admiral Dougherty.</i>

277
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:43,346
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.

278
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:48,255
They have incredible
mental discipline.

279
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:50,489
Clarity of perception.

280
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:51,996
My name is Sojef.

281
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,595
Jean-Luc Picard.

282
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,531
These are my officers,
Dr. Crusher, Counselor Troi.

283
00:22:56,738 --> 00:23:00,401
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we are here to...

284
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,008
...rescue them.

285
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:04,842
As you wish.

286
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,880
But I would ask you
to disarm yourselves.

287
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,449
This village is a sanctuary of life.

288
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,215
Prepare the hostages
for transport to the ship.

289
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:20,394
They should be quarantined
before joining the ship's population.

290
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,867
We were under the impression they
were being held against their will.

291
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,403
It's not our custom
to have guests here at all,

292
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,403
let alone hold anyone
against their will.

293
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:36,544
The artificial life form
would not allow them to leave.

294
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:40,306
In fact, he told us they were our
enemies and that more would follow.

295
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:42,507
- Are you our enemy?
- Anij.

296
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:46,148
My people have a strict policy
of noninterference in other cultures.

297
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:48,380
It's our Prime Directive.

298
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:52,685
Your directive apparently doesn't
include spying on other cultures.

299
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:57,932
The artificial life form is
a member of my crew.

300
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,067
Apparently, he was taken ill.

301
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:02,766
There was a phase variance
in his positronic matrix,

302
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:05,097
which we were unable to repair.

303
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:07,270
I think the captain finds
it hard to believe

304
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:10,536
that we'd have any skills
repairing a positronic device.

305
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,009
Our technological abilities
are not apparent

306
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:16,240
because we have chosen not
to employ them in our daily lives.

307
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:19,385
We believe that when you create
a machine to do the work of a man,

308
00:24:19,587 --> 00:24:21,613
you take something away
from the man.

309
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:25,781
But at one time we explored
the galaxy just as you do.

310
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:30,226
- You have warp capability?
- Capability, yes.

311
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:34,424
But where can warp drive take us
except away from here?

312
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:48,241
I apologize for our intrusion.

313
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:58,988
And because they have
warp capability,

314
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,458
the consequences
to their society will be minimal.

315
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:03,824
<i>You've done a terrific job, Jean-Luc.</i>

316
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:06,625
<i>Now, pack your bags
and get the hell out of there.</i>

317
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:09,836
<i>- How's Data?
- In stasis.</i>

318
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:11,938
La Forge is completing
the diagnostic.

319
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,040
<i>I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow.
We're heading back your way.</i>

320
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:17,768
<i>Set a course to rendezvous with us
so you can transfer the crew</i>

321
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,845
<i>and equipment on your way out.</i>

322
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:21,640
You're not finished here?

323
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:24,614
<i>Just a few loose ends to tie up.</i>

324
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:26,309
<i>Dougherty out.</i>

325
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,076
Come in.

326
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,813
- Hi.
- You got a minute?

327
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,586
Sure.

328
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,721
I need a little counseling.

329
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:09,390
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

330
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:12,363
So do I lie down or what?

331
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,693
Well, whatever
makes you comfortable.

332
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:18,430
But this isn't one
of the usual therapeutic postures.

333
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,368
But it is comfortable.

334
00:26:20,575 --> 00:26:23,202
Why don't you try sitting up.

335
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,936
Why don't you try lying down.

336
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:28,406
Well, you're in quite a mood today.

337
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:32,314
Do you really need counseling,
or did you come down here to play?

338
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,421
I think I'm having a midlife crisis.

339
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:36,385
- I believe you.
- I'm not sleeping well.

340
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,718
Dr. Crusher has something
that can take care of that.

341
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:42,294
What I need, I can't get
from Dr. Crusher.

342
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:46,626
Counselor, do you think it's possible
for two people to go back in time,

343
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:48,665
fix a mistake they've made?

344
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:52,169
On this ship, anything's possible.

345
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,544
- Yuck.
- "Yuck"?

346
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,873
I never kissed you
with a beard before.

347
00:27:00,082 --> 00:27:03,313
I kiss you, and you say, "Yuck"?

348
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:12,416
I had to reconstruct Data's neural net
and replace these.

349
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:13,923
They contain memory engrams.

350
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:16,256
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.

351
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:17,761
There's no doubt about it, captain.

352
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:20,093
That's what caused Data
to malfunction.

353
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:23,567
But the Son'a report claims that they
didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.

354
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:26,969
Well, I don't believe
it happened that way.

355
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,770
Why would they fire on him
without provocation?

356
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:32,538
All I know is that he was functioning
normally until he was shot.

357
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,271
Then his fail-safe system
was activated.

358
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:36,541
- Fail-safe?
- His ethical and moral subroutines

359
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,447
took over all of his basic functions.

360
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:41,451
But you're saying he still knew the
difference between right and wrong.

361
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:42,884
In a sense, that's all he knew.

362
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,286
The system was designed
to protect Data against anyone

363
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:47,394
who might try and take advantage
of his memory loss.

364
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:51,054
And yet he attacked us, and he told
the Ba'ku that we were a threat.

365
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,233
- The implants bothering you?
- I'm all right.

366
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:56,063
I think I'm just tired.

367
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:07,746
Geordi?

368
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:10,440
<i>- Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.</i>

369
00:28:11,886 --> 00:28:15,584
I seem to be missing
several memory engrams.

370
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:17,856
There they are.

371
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:25,923
Data, what's the last thing
that you remember?

372
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,967
<i>His nose should pant
And his lip should curl</i>

373
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,865
From the mission.

374
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,701
I was in an isolation suit gathering
physiometric data on the Ba'ku.

375
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,107
My last memory is going into the hills,
following some children.

376
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:48,944
Artim? Do you remember where
you were on the day of lightning

377
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:51,215
when the artificial life form
appeared to us?

378
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,189
In the hills by the dam.

379
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:54,720
Can you show us?

380
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:14,915
There is no reason to fear me.

381
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:17,346
I am now operating
within normal parameters.

382
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:20,520
- What?
- They fixed me.

383
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:27,256
Captain, the boy is afraid of me.

384
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,861
It's nothing personal, Data.

385
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:32,192
You have to remember, these people
have rejected technology.

386
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,096
I am the personification
of everything they have rejected.

387
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:38,567
Until this week, that young man
probably never saw a machine,

388
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,933
let alone one that walks and talks.

389
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:50,611
<i>Bridge to Riker.</i>

390
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,109
Can I get back to you, Mr. Worf?

391
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,050
<i>Admiral Dougherty
is on the com-link, sir.</i>

392
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:58,384
Patch him through.

393
00:29:58,593 --> 00:30:01,117
- Yes, admiral?
- Why haven't you left orbit?

394
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,229
<i>Captain Picard
is still on the surface, sir.</i>

395
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:05,296
<i>- Doing what?
- He didn't want to leave</i>

396
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,366
<i>until we could adequately explain
why Data malfunctioned.</i>

397
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,265
His future in Starfleet
could depend on it.

398
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:16,767
Remind the captain
his 12 hours are up.

399
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:19,970
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Dougherty out.</i>

400
00:30:24,118 --> 00:30:26,144
Your body is producing
far too many toxins.

401
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:30,653
We've reached the limit
of genetic manipulation.

402
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:34,251
I won't need any more
genetic manipulation

403
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:38,625
if our Federation friends will allow us
to complete this mission.

404
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,775
Tricorder functions are limited

405
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:53,345
due to heavy deposits of kelbonite
in these hills.

406
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:56,073
How about a passive radiation scan?

407
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:00,354
Curious.

408
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:04,513
There appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake.

409
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:23,105
Can he breathe underwater?

410
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:26,644
Data doesn't breathe.

411
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:30,080
Won't he rust?

412
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,151
No.

413
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:58,675
Captain! Captain!

414
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:02,948
I believe I know what is causing
the neutrino emissions.

415
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:45,080
The vessel is clearly Federation
in origin, captain.

416
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,420
"Just a few loose ends to tie up."

417
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,989
We're not interested in such things.

418
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,691
I am.

419
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:59,837
- I think it would be wiser...
- I'm going with you.

420
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:52,422
It is a holographic projection.

421
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:59,697
Incomplete, I might add.

422
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,336
What you're seeing is
a computer-driven image

423
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,436
created by photons and force fields.

424
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:07,506
I know what a hologram is, captain.

425
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:11,873
The question is, why would anyone
want to create one of our village?

426
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:17,112
Data, if you were following the children
and discovered this ship...

427
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:21,619
It is conceivable I was shot to protect
the secret of its existence.

428
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:27,556
Why would they duplicate this village,
except to deceive the Ba'ku?

429
00:34:27,762 --> 00:34:31,391
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.

430
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,465
You go to sleep one night
in the village,

431
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:38,798
wake up the next morning
on this flying holodeck,

432
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:40,907
transported en masse.

433
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:42,632
Within a few days,

434
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:47,246
they're relocated on a similar planet
without ever realizing it.

435
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:51,748
Why would the Federation or the Son'a
wish to move the Ba'ku?

436
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,317
I don't know.

437
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,119
Computer, end program.

438
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:36,297
Decloak the vessel.

439
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,733
Help!

440
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:42,266
I can't swim!

441
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:52,070
Don't panic.

442
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,978
I've been shot at, thrown into the lake
out of a ship that's come to abduct us,

443
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:59,585
what's there to panic about?

444
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:02,086
In the event of a water landing,

445
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:05,690
I have been designed to serve
as a flotation device.

446
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:13,429
Mr. Worf, did the hostages mention

447
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,898
anything about a cloaked ship
during their debriefing?

448
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,764
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.

449
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:21,440
Have you been in a fight, Mr. Worf?

450
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:23,338
No, sir. It is a gorch.

451
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,735
Gorch?

452
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:28,775
Pimple, sir.

453
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:35,547
Oh, well, it's... It's hardly noticeable.

454
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:52,567
Smooth as an android's bottom,
eh, Data?

455
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:53,967
I beg your pardon, sir?

456
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:56,405
Admiral Dougherty wants to know
why we haven't left yet.

457
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,804
We're not going anywhere.

458
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:00,742
Deck 5.

459
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:08,414
Klingons never do anything small,
do you?

460
00:37:08,623 --> 00:37:11,489
Dr. Crusher asked to speak
to you when you returned.

461
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:15,186
- Picard to Crusher.
- Captain,

462
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:17,864
the Son'a hostages declined
to be examined.

463
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:19,931
I had them confined to quarters.

464
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:21,657
<i>- And our people?
- They're fine.</i>

465
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:23,199
In fact, they're better than fine.

466
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:26,202
Increased metabolism,
improved muscle tone, high energy.

467
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,237
We should all be so lucky.

468
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:31,077
Very well, doctor. Picard out.

469
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:34,438
Worf, don't release the Son'a officers
until I've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.

470
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:36,344
Aye, sir.

471
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,782
Commander, may I?

472
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,057
Computer, music.

473
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:51,561
No, no, not that. Something Latin.

474
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:55,059
<i>- Specify.
- The mambo.</i>

475
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:01,268
That's more like it.

476
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:24,420
How old are you?

477
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:30,936
We came here from a solar system
on the verge of self-annihilation,

478
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:35,735
where technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life.

479
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:39,806
A small group of us set off
to find a new home,

480
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:45,445
a home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds.

481
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:49,282
That was 309 years ago.

482
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:51,818
And you haven't aged
a day since then.

483
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:54,119
Actually, I was a good deal older
when we arrived,

484
00:38:54,327 --> 00:38:56,728
in terms of my physical condition.

485
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:59,126
There's an unusual
metaphasic radiation

486
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,061
coming from the planet's rings.

487
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:04,295
It continuously regenerates
our genetic structure.

488
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:06,699
You must have noticed
the effects by now.

489
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:09,068
We've just begun to.

490
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:13,242
And I suppose you're 75.

491
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:15,416
No, I'm 12.

492
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:19,909
The metaphasic radiation won't begin
to affect him until he reaches maturity.

493
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:23,420
To most offlanders,
what you have here

494
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,922
is more valuable than...

495
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,753
...gold-pressed latinum.

496
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:31,025
I'm afraid that's the reason
that someone

497
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:33,597
may be trying to take
your world away from you.

498
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,768
The artificial life form was right.

499
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:42,505
If it were not for Data, it's probable
that you would be relocated by now.

500
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,541
How can we possibly
defend ourselves?

501
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:47,713
The moment we pick up a weapon,
we become one of them.

502
00:39:47,914 --> 00:39:49,711
We lose everything we are.

503
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,179
It may not come to that.

504
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,956
Clearly, the architects of this
conspiracy want to keep it a secret.

505
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:59,648
Not only from you
but from my people as well.

506
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,396
I don't intend to let them.

507
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:15,733
We've always known that to survive,
we had to remain apart.

508
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:18,309
Hasn't been easy.

509
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:22,574
Many of the young people want
to know more about the offland.

510
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:27,253
They're attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life.

511
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,583
Most of my people
who live that fast a life,

512
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:34,090
would sell their souls
to slow it down.

513
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:36,159
But not you?

514
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:39,492
There are days.

515
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:45,836
You don't live up to your reputation
as an offlander, Picard.

516
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,603
Well, in defense of offlanders,
there are many more people like me.

517
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:55,440
Who wouldn't be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth?

518
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,777
I don't think so.

519
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:02,280
You give me more credit
than I deserve.

520
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:05,548
Well, of course I'm tempted.
Who wouldn't be?

521
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,217
But some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world

522
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:13,958
involve the forced relocation
of a small group of people

523
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:18,070
to satisfy the demands
of a large one.

524
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,536
I'd hoped that we'd learn
from our mistakes, but...

525
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:27,077
...it seems that some of us haven't.

526
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:38,588
This is extraordinary craftsmanship.

527
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:40,987
It's the work of students.

528
00:41:42,663 --> 00:41:45,826
They're almost ready
to become apprentices.

529
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:48,159
In 30 or 40 years,
some of them will take their place

530
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:50,336
among the artisans.

531
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:54,503
Apprenticing for 30 years.

532
00:41:56,978 --> 00:42:00,846
Did your people's
mental discipline develop here?

533
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:03,507
More questions.

534
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:06,117
Always the explorer.

535
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,887
If you stay long enough,
that will change.

536
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:12,956
Will it?

537
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,128
You stop reviewing
what happened yesterday.

538
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:19,231
Stop planning for tomorrow.

539
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:23,001
Let me ask you a question.

540
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:27,331
Have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time?

541
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:29,367
A perfect moment?

542
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:34,775
When time seemed to stop, and you
could almost live in that moment.

543
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,148
Seeing my home planet
from space for the first time.

544
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:47,983
Yes, exactly.

545
00:42:48,295 --> 00:42:51,355
Nothing more complicated
than perception.

546
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:57,364
You explore the universe.

547
00:42:58,304 --> 00:43:04,335
We've discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself.

548
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:07,943
Full of powerful forces.

549
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:13,041
Most people aren't aware enough
of the now to even notice.

550
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:17,952
I wish I could spare
a few centuries to learn.

551
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:23,092
It took us centuries to learn that it
doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

552
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:27,295
There's one thing I don't understand.

553
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:31,159
In 300 years,
you never learned to swim?

554
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,409
I just haven't got around to it yet.

555
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:47,079
I wonder if you're aware of the trust
you engender, Jean-Luc Picard.

556
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:51,012
- In my experience, it's unusual for...
- For an offlander?

557
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:54,427
For someone so young.

558
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:31,961
Geordi.

559
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:33,963
Captain.

560
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,563
As it turns out, there wasn't anything
wrong with my implants at all.

561
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:41,764
There was something right
with my eyes.

562
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:49,913
When Dr. Crusher removed
the ocular connections,

563
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:53,313
she found that the cells
around my optic nerve had...

564
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:56,148
Started to regenerate.

565
00:44:59,626 --> 00:45:01,492
It may not last.

566
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:04,822
And if it doesn't, I just...

567
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:07,762
I just wanted, before we go...

568
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:12,969
You know, I've never seen a sunrise.

569
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:17,440
At least not the way you see them.

570
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,829
Come.

571
00:45:51,846 --> 00:45:55,907
Am I to understand that you are
not releasing my men, captain?

572
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:59,041
We found the holoship.

573
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:02,655
Ru'afo, why don't you let
the captain and me...

574
00:46:02,856 --> 00:46:05,416
No!

575
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:17,768
This entire mission has been
one Federation blunder after another.

576
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:21,840
You will return my men,

577
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:26,034
or this alliance will end
with the destruction of your ship.

578
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:39,021
You're looking well,
Jean-Luc. Rested.

579
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:41,518
I won't let you move them, admiral.

580
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:43,889
I will take this
to the Federation Council.

581
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:46,565
I'm acting on orders
from the Federation Council.

582
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,235
How can there be an order
to abandon the Prime Directive?

583
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:52,132
The Prime Directive doesn't apply.

584
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:54,239
These people are not indigenous
to this planet.

585
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,806
They were never meant
to be immortal.

586
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,740
We'll simply be restoring them
to their natural evolution.

587
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:02,137
Who the hell are we to determine

588
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:04,248
the next course of evolution
for these people?

589
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:07,909
Jean-Luc, there are 600 people
down there.

590
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:10,181
We'll be able to use
the regenerative properties

591
00:47:10,391 --> 00:47:13,757
of this radiation to help billions.

592
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:16,192
The Son'a have developed
a procedure to collect

593
00:47:16,396 --> 00:47:19,264
the metaphasic particles
from the planet's rings.

594
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:21,490
A planet in Federation space.

595
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:25,364
That's right. We have the planet.
They have the technology.

596
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:28,438
A technology we can't duplicate.

597
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,974
You know what that makes us?

598
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:32,838
Partners.

599
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,072
Our partners are nothing more
than petty thugs.

600
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,952
On Earth, petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders.

601
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:47,784
Warp drive transformed a bunch
of Romulan thugs into an empire.

602
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,789
We can handle the Son'a.

603
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:51,461
I'm not worried about that.

604
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:55,429
Someone probably said the same thing
about the Romulans a century ago.

605
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:58,601
With metaphasics,
life spans will be doubled.

606
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:02,204
An entire new medical science
will evolve.

607
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:04,375
I understand your chief engineer
has the use

608
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:06,543
of his eyes for the first time
in his life.

609
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,746
Would you take that away from him?

610
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:12,438
There are metaphasic particles
all over the Briar Patch.

611
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,139
Why does it have to be
this one planet?

612
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:17,514
It's the concentration in the rings
that makes the whole damn thing work.

613
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:20,213
Don't ask me to explain it.
I only know they inject something

614
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:23,222
into the rings that starts
a thermolytic reaction.

615
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:26,329
When it's over, the planet will be
uninhabitable for generations.

616
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,692
Admiral, delay the procedure.

617
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,992
Let my people look at the technology.

618
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:33,601
Our best scientific minds
already have.

619
00:48:33,804 --> 00:48:36,706
We can't find any other way
to do this.

620
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:38,876
Then the Son'a can establish
a separate colony

621
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:40,476
on the planet until we do.

622
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:42,543
It would take ten years
of normal exposure

623
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:45,079
to begin to reverse their condition.

624
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:47,114
Some of them won't survive that long.

625
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:50,548
Besides, they don't want to live
in the middle of the Briar Patch.

626
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:52,188
Who would?

627
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:55,085
The Ba'ku.

628
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:05,565
We are betraying the principles upon
which the Federation was founded.

629
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:08,262
It's an attack upon its very soul.

630
00:49:17,614 --> 00:49:20,344
And it will destroy the Ba'ku.

631
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:25,255
Just as cultures have been destroyed

632
00:49:25,456 --> 00:49:29,860
in every other forced relocation
throughout history.

633
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:34,724
Jean-Luc, we're only moving
600 people.

634
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,862
How many people does it take,
admiral, before it becomes wrong?

635
00:49:42,072 --> 00:49:44,007
A thousand?

636
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:47,371
Fifty thousand? A million?

637
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,376
How many people
does it take, admiral?

638
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:52,981
I'm ordering you
to the Goren system.

639
00:49:53,184 --> 00:49:56,619
I'm also ordering the release
of the Son'a officers.

640
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,552
File whatever protests
you wish to, captain.

641
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:08,461
By the time you do,
this will all be done.

642
00:50:58,815 --> 00:51:00,681
Gallatin.

643
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:05,878
So the righteous Starfleet captain
finally released you.

644
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,284
Yes.

645
00:51:07,492 --> 00:51:10,052
Did you encounter any problems
on the surface?

646
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,286
No, sir.

647
00:51:13,597 --> 00:51:15,724
But it wasn't easy being among them.

648
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,298
I'm sure.

649
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:20,902
Just don't forget what they did to us.

650
00:51:23,942 --> 00:51:26,739
We'll have them rounded up
in a day or two.

651
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:30,244
We needn't bother with the
Federation's holoship anymore.

652
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:34,248
- Just get the holding cells ready.
- Yes, sir.

653
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:37,913
I'm going to miss these
little flesh-stretching sessions

654
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:39,918
of ours, my dear.

655
00:52:03,547 --> 00:52:07,278
Rerouting the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise, sir.

656
00:52:07,485 --> 00:52:11,717
However, the transporter
is rarely used after 0200 hours.

657
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:14,221
Taking the captain's yacht
out for a spin?

658
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:16,619
Seven metric tons
of ultritium explosives.

659
00:52:16,827 --> 00:52:20,355
Eight tetryon pulse launchers
and ten isomagnetic disintegrators.

660
00:52:20,565 --> 00:52:22,362
Looks like you're planning
on doing some hunting.

661
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,795
Return to your quarters.

662
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,728
That's an order.

663
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,737
No uniform, no orders.

664
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:33,739
Captain, how could I look
at another sunrise

665
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:35,775
knowing what my sight
cost these people?

666
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,574
I feel obliged to point out
that the environmental anomalies

667
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:42,309
may have stimulated certain rebellious
instincts common to youth,

668
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:45,148
which could affect
everyone's judgment.

669
00:52:45,356 --> 00:52:46,550
Except mine, of course.

670
00:52:46,757 --> 00:52:49,818
Okay, Data,
what do you think we should do?

671
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:53,925
Saddle up.

672
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:56,326
Lock and load.

673
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:03,936
They won't begin the procedure
while the planet is still inhabited.

674
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:07,474
So our job is to keep
the planet inhabited.

675
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,739
Will, Geordi, go back and put
a face on what's happening here.

676
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:13,438
Make the council see the Ba'ku.

677
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:18,782
It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the
suffering of a people you don't know.

678
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:21,889
I'll be back before you know it.

679
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:25,288
We'll hold out as long as we can.

680
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:50,318
The injector performs perfectly
in every simulation.

681
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:52,648
<i>Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit,</i>

682
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:54,824
one of their support craft
went down to the surface.

683
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:57,585
- What?
- It appeared to be the captain's yacht.

684
00:53:57,795 --> 00:53:59,786
Five persons onboard.

685
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:01,657
We're not waiting until morning.

686
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:04,333
Take the shuttles and get everyone
off the surface tonight.

687
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,936
Gallatin.

688
00:54:09,773 --> 00:54:13,005
If Picard or any
of his people interfere...

689
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,472
...eliminate them.

690
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:24,784
We're leaving the village.
Take only what you need.

691
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:29,449
Bring food.
We may not be back for days.

692
00:54:42,005 --> 00:54:44,132
It is a transport inhibitor.

693
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:48,744
It will help prevent spaceships
from beaming anyone off the surface.

694
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:52,248
These veins of kelbonite
running through the hills

695
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,246
will interfere with their transporters.

696
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:57,250
And when the terrain forces us
away from the deposits,

697
00:54:57,454 --> 00:55:00,423
then we'll use transport inhibitors
as a compensation.

698
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:03,422
The mountains have the heaviest
concentration of kelbonite.

699
00:55:03,628 --> 00:55:06,027
Once there, it'll make transport
virtually impossible.

700
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,594
There are caves in those mountains.

701
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:11,599
Then we should be able to hold out
for a long time once we're there,

702
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:13,929
but they're not gonna make it
easy for us to get there.

703
00:55:14,137 --> 00:55:18,074
Captain? We've activated the
transport inhibitors around the village.

704
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,902
Good.

705
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:26,139
Let's move these people out!

706
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,454
Transporters are not functioning.

707
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:36,889
They're blocking the beams
with some kind of inhibitors.

708
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:39,789
We'll have to locate
and destroy them.

709
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:55,268
No, no. Son, you're carrying too much.
We have a long climb ahead of us.

710
00:56:05,956 --> 00:56:09,289
We've lost three transport inhibitors.
There's a gap in the field.

711
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:46,121
Artim.

712
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:49,362
Father!

713
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,739
They're following
the kelbonite deposits,

714
00:57:01,945 --> 00:57:03,811
using the interference
to block our transporters.

715
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:07,472
- Recommendations?
- Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.

716
00:57:07,684 --> 00:57:09,016
Talk?

717
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:11,585
We should send down an assault team
and take them by force.

718
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:14,349
That is not an acceptable option.

719
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,322
If people get hurt, all the support
we have in the Federation...

720
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:23,090
Federation support, Federation
procedures, Federation rules.

721
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,699
Look in the mirror, admiral.

722
00:57:24,902 --> 00:57:27,530
The Federation is old.

723
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,932
In the past 24 months,
they've been challenged

724
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:31,768
by every major power
in the quadrant.

725
00:57:31,976 --> 00:57:34,773
The Borg, the Cardassians,
the Dominion.

726
00:57:34,978 --> 00:57:38,710
They all smell the scent of death
on the Federation.

727
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,780
That's why you've embraced
our offer.

728
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:44,079
Because it will give
your dear Federation new life.

729
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:46,780
Well, how badly
do you want it, admiral?

730
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,119
Because there are hard choices
to be made now.

731
00:57:50,661 --> 00:57:52,561
<i>If the Enterprise gets through
with news</i>

732
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:55,231
about their brave captain's
valiant struggle

733
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:59,893
on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku,
your Federation politicians will waver.

734
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:04,063
Your Federation opinion polls
will open up public debate.

735
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:07,574
Your Federation allies
will want their say. You...

736
00:58:08,211 --> 00:58:09,702
Need I go on?

737
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:12,041
There's an alternative
to an all-out assault.

738
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:14,945
Isolinear tags would allow
our transporters to lock on to them.

739
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:17,552
We'd have to tag every one of them.
That would take time.

740
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:21,190
<i>And we don't have it.
The Enterprise is only 19 hours</i>

741
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,586
from communications range
with the Federation.

742
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:25,989
I'll order Riker to turn around.

743
00:58:26,197 --> 00:58:28,757
Picard's first officer.

744
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:32,197
Do you really believe he'll listen?

745
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,436
<i>My ships are capable
of intercepting the Enterprise</i>

746
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:37,699
before it reaches the perimeter.

747
00:58:37,907 --> 00:58:40,034
I could send them to...

748
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,375
To escort it back.

749
00:58:44,748 --> 00:58:47,615
But Commander Riker
might not want to come.

750
00:58:52,657 --> 00:58:55,284
Send your ships.

751
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:20,342
Do you like being a machine?

752
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,677
I aspire to be more than I am.

753
00:59:22,887 --> 00:59:24,081
I know why.

754
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:28,088
So people like us won't be afraid
of you anymore.

755
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:29,782
Perhaps.

756
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:34,092
Don't you ever get tired?

757
00:59:34,297 --> 00:59:38,199
My power cells continually
recharge themselves.

758
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:43,804
I can't imagine what it's like
to be a machine.

759
00:59:44,974 --> 00:59:46,532
Perhaps it would
surprise you to know

760
00:59:46,744 --> 00:59:49,541
that I have often tried to imagine
what it is like to be a child.

761
00:59:49,746 --> 00:59:51,373
- Really?
- Really.

762
00:59:51,581 --> 00:59:53,981
For one thing, your legs are shorter
than everyone else's.

763
00:59:54,652 --> 00:59:57,552
But they are in a constant state
of growth.

764
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:00,985
- Do you find it difficult to adapt?
- Adapt?

765
01:00:01,592 --> 01:00:06,052
A child's specifications are never
the same from one moment to the next.

766
01:00:06,262 --> 01:00:09,197
It is a wonder you do not trip
over your own feet.

767
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,557
Sometimes I do.

768
01:00:12,268 --> 01:00:17,137
My legs are exactly
87.2 centimeters in length.

769
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,742
They were 87.2 centimeters
the day I was created.

770
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:24,244
They will be 87.2 centimeters
the day I go off-line.

771
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:28,577
My operation depends on
specifications that do not change.

772
01:00:28,786 --> 01:00:32,244
I will never know the experience
of growing up

773
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:35,481
or tripping over my own feet.

774
01:00:35,693 --> 01:00:38,320
But you've never had adults
telling you what to do all the time

775
01:00:38,528 --> 01:00:42,090
or bedtimes or having
to eat food you don't like.

776
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:44,597
I would gladly accept
the requirement of a bedtime

777
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:48,431
in exchange for knowing
what it is like to be a child.

778
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:51,134
Do machines ever play?

779
01:00:51,342 --> 01:00:53,434
Yes, I play the violin.

780
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:55,338
And my chess routines
are quite advanced.

781
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:57,844
No, I mean, haven't
you ever just played?

782
01:00:58,047 --> 01:01:00,106
For fun?

783
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:04,445
Androids do not have fun.

784
01:01:04,655 --> 01:01:09,717
Look, if you wanna know what it's like
to be a child, you need to learn to play.

785
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:24,735
Captain.

786
01:01:26,342 --> 01:01:27,969
Mr. Worf, you need a haircut.

787
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:30,204
Accelerated hair growth
is often experienced

788
01:01:30,414 --> 01:01:32,313
by Klingons during Jak'tahla.

789
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:35,643
- Jak'tahla?
- Roughly translated, puberty.

790
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:38,514
Although for a Klingon,
that scarcely does it justice.

791
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:42,489
Any severe mood swings,
unusual aggressive tendencies,

792
01:01:42,693 --> 01:01:44,922
you let me know at once.

793
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:46,824
Yes, sir.

794
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,931
The Ba'ku need some rest, sir.

795
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:51,032
According to the geo-scan,
this is the safest area

796
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:52,827
within the next few kilometers.

797
01:01:53,036 --> 01:01:55,096
Very well, we'll take an hour.

798
01:01:55,306 --> 01:01:57,170
- Have them break out some rations.
- Aye, sir.

799
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:03,438
Right beyond that ridge
is where the caves begin.

800
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:05,273
We can hide there for days.

801
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:07,449
By now the Son'a
will have scanned this area.

802
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,311
They'll know that as well as we do.

803
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:17,820
It's been 300 years
since I've seen a bald man.

804
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,628
How is it that you never married?

805
01:02:25,835 --> 01:02:29,737
And don't tell me it's just because
you haven't got around to it yet.

806
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,965
What's the rush?

807
01:02:33,177 --> 01:02:36,737
I should warn you, I've always
been attracted to older women.

808
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:03,431
How are you doing this?

809
01:03:03,706 --> 01:03:06,369
No more questions.

810
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:23,822
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a
ships on an intercept course.

811
01:03:24,027 --> 01:03:25,858
- How long till they reach us?
- Eighteen minutes.

812
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:28,588
We won't be able to get a transmission
out of here for another hour.

813
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:31,130
- They're hailing us.
- Tell them our transceiver assembly

814
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:35,237
is down, that we can send messages
but not receive them.

815
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:36,905
I don't think they believe us.

816
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:38,802
Why not?

817
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,577
Photon torpedo.

818
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:44,110
Isn't that the universal greeting
when communications are down?

819
01:03:44,315 --> 01:03:47,250
I think it's the universal greeting
when you don't like someone.

820
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:48,644
Full impulse.

821
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:51,650
Manifolds can't handle full impulse
in the Patch, commander.

822
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:55,313
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds
will be the only thing left on this ship.

823
01:03:55,525 --> 01:03:57,255
I'll be in Engineering.

824
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,985
Red alert! All hands! Battle stations.

825
01:04:00,797 --> 01:04:04,097
And have you noticed how your boobs
have started to firm up?

826
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,565
Not that we care about such things
in this day and age.

827
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:10,603
Thank you, Data.

828
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:23,550
I have an odd craving for the blood
of a live Kolar beast.

829
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:25,813
This environment
must be affecting me again.

830
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:30,782
And have you noticed how
your boobs have started to firm up?

831
01:04:30,994 --> 01:04:32,485
Not that we care about...

832
01:04:34,297 --> 01:04:35,822
Take cover!

833
01:05:22,813 --> 01:05:25,043
Isolinear tags.
The transporters can lock on to them.

834
01:05:25,248 --> 01:05:26,773
We have to find shelter.

835
01:05:26,983 --> 01:05:28,713
There's a cavern at the base
of the next hill.

836
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:30,385
This way.

837
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:04,753
Shields at 60 percent!

838
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:06,547
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

839
01:06:06,757 --> 01:06:10,193
We're burning deuterium down here!
We're gonna blow ourselves up.

840
01:06:10,393 --> 01:06:12,293
We won't need any help
from the Son'a.

841
01:06:13,396 --> 01:06:14,920
What's inside that nebula cluster?

842
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:18,362
Cometary debris,
pockets of unstable metreon gas.

843
01:06:18,568 --> 01:06:20,400
- We don't want to go in there, sir.
- Yes, we do.

844
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:22,936
I'll take it from here, ensign.

845
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:26,701
It's time to use the Briar Patch
the way Brer Rabbit did.

846
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:43,827
Inside the caves! Quickly!

847
01:06:44,027 --> 01:06:45,960
Everyone! This way!

848
01:06:46,163 --> 01:06:47,152
Inside.

849
01:06:58,842 --> 01:07:00,833
Definitely feeling
aggressive tendencies, sir.

850
01:07:05,548 --> 01:07:07,744
They've detonated an isolytic burst!

851
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:10,077
A subspace tear is forming!

852
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:12,414
On screen.

853
01:07:12,956 --> 01:07:16,585
I thought subspace weapons were
banned by the Khitomer Accord.

854
01:07:16,793 --> 01:07:18,351
Remind me to lodge a protest.

855
01:07:18,561 --> 01:07:21,860
Our warp core is acting
like a magnet to the tear.

856
01:07:22,632 --> 01:07:24,692
We're pulling it like a zipper
across space.

857
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:27,028
Options?

858
01:07:27,237 --> 01:07:28,704
We could eject the core.

859
01:07:28,905 --> 01:07:31,032
- Will that stop the tear?
- You got me, commander.

860
01:07:31,742 --> 01:07:33,471
That's your expert opinion?

861
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:35,769
Detonating the warp core
might neutralize the cascade.

862
01:07:35,978 --> 01:07:37,708
Then again, it might not.

863
01:07:37,914 --> 01:07:41,282
Subspace weapons are unpredictable.
That's why they were banned.

864
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:44,277
Tear is closing on us.

865
01:07:44,922 --> 01:07:47,288
Impact in 15 seconds.

866
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:50,824
- Eject the core.
- I just did.

867
01:07:51,762 --> 01:07:54,322
Impact in ten seconds.

868
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,398
Detonate.

869
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:14,481
Get me a medic over here!

870
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:26,855
It worked, commander!

871
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:28,587
The tear has been sealed.

872
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:31,029
Yeah, but there's nothing to stop
them from doing it again.

873
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:33,328
And we're fresh out of warp cores.

874
01:08:33,537 --> 01:08:36,096
We're still 36 minutes
from transmission range, sir.

875
01:08:36,305 --> 01:08:39,240
We're through running
from these bastards.

876
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:01,064
Another 43 reported taken, sir.

877
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:15,078
Captain, they're trying to drive us out
so their drones can tag us.

878
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,405
With all the hydrothermal vents
in the substrata,

879
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:20,412
the structural integrity of this cavern
is not going to hold for long.

880
01:09:20,617 --> 01:09:22,516
- Is there another way out of here?
- I don't know.

881
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,516
Captain, tracking the water's course
may reveal another exit.

882
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:28,020
Mr. Worf, come with us.

883
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:42,431
I am reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow
behind that calcite formation, captain.

884
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:45,436
Will this structure hold
if we were to blast through?

885
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:48,171
I believe it is safe, sir.

886
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,208
Fire.

887
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:12,463
Get everybody into those caves.

888
01:10:13,337 --> 01:10:14,963
And set up force fields
once they're inside.

889
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:17,230
Aye, sir.

890
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,177
Geordi, are those pockets
of metreon gas?

891
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:28,073
Yes, commander. Highly volatile.

892
01:10:28,284 --> 01:10:30,752
- I recommend we keep our distance.
- Negative.

893
01:10:30,953 --> 01:10:33,717
I want to use the ramscoop
to collect as much of it as we can.

894
01:10:33,923 --> 01:10:36,654
- The purpose being?
- The purpose being,

895
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:39,385
I intend to shove it
down the Son'as' throats.

896
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:42,854
Commander, if one of their weapons
hits that gas...

897
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:45,626
It's our only way out of here,
Mr. Daniels.

898
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:48,497
I wouldn't be surprised if history
remembers this as the Riker Maneuver.

899
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:50,137
If it works.

900
01:10:53,743 --> 01:10:55,837
Computer, access
manual steering column.

901
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,912
Transfer helm controls to manual.

902
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:03,347
<i>Bridge, storage cells
are at maximum capacity.</i>

903
01:11:03,552 --> 01:11:06,453
They're powering
their forward weapons array, sir.

904
01:11:06,756 --> 01:11:09,555
Blow out the ramscoop.
Stand by. Full thrusters.

905
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,126
<i>Ramscoop released.</i>

906
01:11:29,212 --> 01:11:30,645
Captain.

907
01:11:32,015 --> 01:11:34,414
Data, Troi,
keep these people moving!

908
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:35,948
Bring them out!

909
01:11:45,028 --> 01:11:48,327
I suspect it won't be long
before the drones get here.

910
01:11:49,632 --> 01:11:51,100
Keep moving.

911
01:11:51,301 --> 01:11:53,599
Keep moving.

912
01:11:53,804 --> 01:11:56,931
They found caves on higher ground.

913
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,438
We'll be safe there.

914
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:07,271
Captain, take a look
at this med-scan.

915
01:12:07,484 --> 01:12:09,280
His DNA profile.

916
01:12:11,421 --> 01:12:13,115
How can that be possible?

917
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,251
Maybe we should ask them.

918
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:32,971
Artim, what are you doing? Come.

919
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:43,149
- Is this the last group?
- Yes, sir.

920
01:12:43,353 --> 01:12:45,650
Get them ready to move out.

921
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:48,984
- We need to hurry.
- Anij went to find Artim.

922
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:16,610
- Go with Tournel!
- No! I want to stay with you.

923
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:18,150
It is safer there, go!

924
01:13:32,435 --> 01:13:34,733
- Worf to Picard.
- Two life signs.

925
01:13:34,938 --> 01:13:36,564
One of them extremely faint.

926
01:13:36,773 --> 01:13:39,867
There are almost 4 metric tons
of rock blocking our way.

927
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,511
No. That might cause
another cave-in.

928
01:14:04,301 --> 01:14:05,927
Anij?

929
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,199
Anij?

930
01:14:12,475 --> 01:14:13,600
<i>Worf to Picard.</i>

931
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:16,369
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

932
01:14:16,579 --> 01:14:18,945
<i>We are trying to get to you, sir.</i>

933
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:23,045
Anij?

934
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,127
Help is on the way.

935
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:35,394
Worf, hurry.

936
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:36,860
Anij is hurt.

937
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:39,057
<i>How bad is she, captain?</i>

938
01:14:41,438 --> 01:14:42,802
I'm losing her.

939
01:14:43,006 --> 01:14:45,634
<i>We're coming as fast as we can.</i>

940
01:14:54,451 --> 01:14:56,315
Anij...

941
01:14:57,287 --> 01:14:59,481
...stay with me.

942
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:06,591
Help me find the power
to keep you in this moment.

943
01:15:06,796 --> 01:15:08,729
Stay with me.

944
01:15:08,931 --> 01:15:12,128
Don't let go of this moment.

945
01:15:29,586 --> 01:15:31,052
She's stabilizing.

946
01:15:31,253 --> 01:15:33,118
Is it safe to move her?

947
01:15:33,323 --> 01:15:35,882
Safer than leaving her here.

948
01:15:40,764 --> 01:15:43,961
And you thought it would take
centuries to learn.

949
01:17:17,226 --> 01:17:21,185
Order them to surrender, and I promise
you won't be court-martialed.

950
01:17:21,396 --> 01:17:24,524
If a court martial is the only way
to let the people of the Federation

951
01:17:24,734 --> 01:17:27,532
know what is happening here,
I welcome it.

952
01:17:27,737 --> 01:17:30,706
<i>The Enterprise has destroyed
one of my ships!</i>

953
01:17:30,907 --> 01:17:32,703
The other is on fire,
requesting assistance.

954
01:17:32,908 --> 01:17:35,469
<i>The Enterprise
would only fire to defend itself.</i>

955
01:17:35,677 --> 01:17:37,042
Ru'afo must have ordered the attack.

956
01:17:37,247 --> 01:17:41,979
I can't believe he would have given that
order without your consent, admiral.

957
01:17:42,851 --> 01:17:46,287
I wonder which of us
will be facing that court martial.

958
01:17:47,756 --> 01:17:50,783
There is nothing further
to be gained from this.

959
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:54,054
You're right.
This is going to end now.

960
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:56,630
The Ba'ku want to stay on the planet?
Let them.

961
01:17:56,832 --> 01:17:59,596
- I'm going to launch the injector.
- You're not going to launch anything.

962
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:04,796
In six hours, every living thing
in this system will be dead or dying.

963
01:18:05,007 --> 01:18:07,738
You would kill your own people,
Ru'afo?

964
01:18:08,278 --> 01:18:11,475
Your own parents? Brothers, sisters?

965
01:18:13,716 --> 01:18:15,979
Didn't you know, admiral,

966
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:19,587
the Son'a and the Ba'ku
are the same race.

967
01:18:22,725 --> 01:18:24,954
Picard just told us.

968
01:18:25,795 --> 01:18:27,921
Our DNA is identical.

969
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:33,194
Which one were you?

970
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:35,734
Gal'na? Ro'tin?

971
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:38,998
Those names, those children,
are gone forever.

972
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,971
What's he talking about?

973
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,110
A century ago,
a group of our young people

974
01:18:43,313 --> 01:18:46,110
wanted to follow the ways
of the offlanders.

975
01:18:46,315 --> 01:18:48,876
They tried to take over the colony,
and when they failed...

976
01:18:49,085 --> 01:18:51,985
When we failed,
you exiled us to die slowly.

977
01:18:52,188 --> 01:18:54,314
You're Ro'tin, aren't you?

978
01:18:55,925 --> 01:18:58,189
There's something in the voice.

979
01:19:00,762 --> 01:19:02,627
Would you be his friend Gal'na?

980
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:06,965
I helped your mother bathe you
when you were a child.

981
01:19:07,703 --> 01:19:10,069
She still speaks of you.

982
01:19:10,273 --> 01:19:14,073
You brought the Federation into
the middle of a blood feud, admiral.

983
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:17,543
The children have returned
to expel their elders,

984
01:19:17,747 --> 01:19:19,338
just as they were once expelled.

985
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:23,979
Except that Ru'afo's need for revenge
has now escalated into parricide.

986
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:31,349
It was for the Federation.

987
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,587
It was all for the Federation.

988
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:50,203
We're taking this ship out of here.

989
01:19:50,412 --> 01:19:52,438
This mission is over.

990
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:56,050
- It is not over.
- It is over!

991
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:05,060
I do not take orders from you.

992
01:20:17,172 --> 01:20:21,371
If you launch the injector
while the planet's still populated,

993
01:20:21,577 --> 01:20:25,707
- the Federation will pursue you until...
- The Federation...

994
01:20:26,349 --> 01:20:30,911
...will never know
what happened here.

995
01:20:57,212 --> 01:21:00,944
Admiral Dougherty
will not be joining us for dinner.

996
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:03,140
Deploy the collector.

997
01:21:06,922 --> 01:21:08,890
Do you have a problem
with that order?

998
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:10,854
May I talk to you alone?

999
01:21:11,994 --> 01:21:14,963
- Deploy the collector.
- Yes, sir.

1000
01:21:19,502 --> 01:21:21,230
Moving them is one thing.
Killing them all?

1001
01:21:21,436 --> 01:21:25,134
No one hated them
more than you, Gal'na.

1002
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,636
We've come a long way together.

1003
01:21:27,844 --> 01:21:32,474
This is the moment we've planned
for so many years.

1004
01:21:35,118 --> 01:21:38,985
Separate the Starfleet personnel
and secure them in the aft cargo hold.

1005
01:21:39,188 --> 01:21:41,985
See that Picard joins them.

1006
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:44,688
The shields in that section
won't protect them

1007
01:21:44,894 --> 01:21:47,260
against the thermolytic reaction.

1008
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:49,792
Thank you for reminding me.

1009
01:22:36,712 --> 01:22:38,304
Jean-Luc.

1010
01:22:47,523 --> 01:22:49,319
Come with me.

1011
01:23:05,675 --> 01:23:08,609
It must have been strange for you
when you were a hostage.

1012
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:12,372
Surrounded by all the friends and
family you knew all those years ago.

1013
01:23:12,582 --> 01:23:16,712
Each one looking exactly
as they did then.

1014
01:23:16,918 --> 01:23:21,378
Like looking through the eyes
of childhood again.

1015
01:23:22,757 --> 01:23:26,887
And here you are,
closing those eyes.

1016
01:23:27,262 --> 01:23:30,231
Trying not to see what bitterness
has done to the Son'a.

1017
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,458
How it's turned Ru'afo
into a madman.

1018
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:35,398
And you...

1019
01:23:35,904 --> 01:23:38,600
Turned you into a coward.

1020
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:41,332
A man who denies
his own conscience.

1021
01:23:43,546 --> 01:23:45,309
Get in.

1022
01:23:51,186 --> 01:23:55,418
Coward without the moral courage
to prevent an atrocity.

1023
01:23:56,024 --> 01:23:57,492
You offend me.

1024
01:23:57,693 --> 01:24:00,594
Is this how a Federation officer
pleads for his life?

1025
01:24:00,796 --> 01:24:03,423
I'm not pleading for my life.

1026
01:24:06,469 --> 01:24:08,595
I'm pleading for yours.

1027
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:13,268
You can still go home, Gal'na.

1028
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:26,777
Computer, close turbolift doors.

1029
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:32,889
What you're asking me to do
is impossible.

1030
01:24:33,095 --> 01:24:34,618
You know how to disable
the injector?

1031
01:24:34,829 --> 01:24:36,729
I would need to be on the bridge.

1032
01:24:36,932 --> 01:24:39,457
The crew is loyal to Ru'afo,
an assault would fail.

1033
01:24:39,668 --> 01:24:41,533
Perhaps we can lure him away.

1034
01:24:41,737 --> 01:24:42,896
It doesn't matter where he is.

1035
01:24:43,104 --> 01:24:44,868
As soon as he realizes
something's happening,

1036
01:24:45,073 --> 01:24:47,474
he'll override my commands
with one word to his com-link.

1037
01:24:47,676 --> 01:24:50,805
If he doesn't realize
something's happening...

1038
01:24:52,847 --> 01:24:54,405
Can you get me to a transmitter?

1039
01:24:54,617 --> 01:24:56,983
I need to speak with Data and Worf
down on the planet.

1040
01:24:57,185 --> 01:24:59,016
We'll need their help.

1041
01:25:00,855 --> 01:25:02,823
Deck 12.

1042
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:04,752
Initiate separation protocols.

1043
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:06,929
Activating injector assembly.

1044
01:25:07,128 --> 01:25:08,756
Separation in three minutes.

1045
01:25:11,634 --> 01:25:13,568
Small craft is coming up
from the surface.

1046
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:15,430
It's powering up its weapons.

1047
01:25:15,837 --> 01:25:18,101
- On screen.
- One person aboard.

1048
01:25:18,306 --> 01:25:19,671
It's the android.

1049
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,936
He's no threat.

1050
01:25:27,617 --> 01:25:29,846
- Data to Picard.
- Go ahead, Data.

1051
01:25:30,051 --> 01:25:31,542
Captain, they're ignoring my attack.

1052
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:34,381
Keep firing tachyon bursts
into the shield grid.

1053
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,113
<i>- Is Worf in position?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1054
01:25:36,324 --> 01:25:38,384
He is ready
for simultaneous transport.

1055
01:25:38,594 --> 01:25:40,356
<i>We're approaching the bridge.
Picard out.</i>

1056
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:46,797
Separation in one minute.

1057
01:25:47,002 --> 01:25:49,631
Sir, the Federation ship is creating
a disruption in our shields.

1058
01:25:49,838 --> 01:25:51,806
If they go out of phase,
it will increase our exposure

1059
01:25:52,007 --> 01:25:54,305
to the thermolytic reaction.

1060
01:25:54,676 --> 01:25:58,738
Very well, destroy that ship.
Reset our shield harmonics.

1061
01:25:58,948 --> 01:26:01,314
Do not delay the countdown.

1062
01:26:07,456 --> 01:26:11,756
Data to Picard, they are rotating
their shield harmonics.

1063
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:14,895
I am attempting to return
to the surface, sir.

1064
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:17,690
The Federation ship
has been disabled.

1065
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:19,628
Separation in 20 seconds.

1066
01:26:21,237 --> 01:26:24,001
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1067
01:26:24,206 --> 01:26:25,672
Systems don't seem affected.

1068
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,432
Separation in ten seconds.

1069
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,947
Five seconds.

1070
01:26:35,685 --> 01:26:38,448
Injector assembly has separated.

1071
01:26:56,372 --> 01:26:59,363
Exactly as the simulations predicted.

1072
01:27:04,947 --> 01:27:07,916
I'm not showing any change
in metaphasic flux levels.

1073
01:27:08,117 --> 01:27:10,846
Your scanners
must be malfunctioning.

1074
01:27:11,052 --> 01:27:14,250
All ship functions are off-line.

1075
01:27:15,256 --> 01:27:19,353
How can there be no ship functions
if the viewscreen is working?

1076
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:22,087
Artificial gravity is stable.

1077
01:27:22,297 --> 01:27:24,323
Life support is...

1078
01:27:36,746 --> 01:27:38,940
A holodeck?

1079
01:28:09,043 --> 01:28:14,345
We were transported to the holoship
when we reset our shields.

1080
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,849
Everything we saw was an illusion.

1081
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:20,016
Ru'afo authorization Delta 2-1.

1082
01:28:20,221 --> 01:28:23,350
Override all interlink commands
to injector assembly one.

1083
01:28:23,559 --> 01:28:24,923
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

1084
01:28:25,127 --> 01:28:29,029
<i>Injector assembly one
has been deactivated.</i>

1085
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,600
All injector subsystems aboard
the collector are confirmed off-line.

1086
01:28:42,912 --> 01:28:44,936
Decloak the holoship
and engage a tractor beam.

1087
01:28:45,146 --> 01:28:46,944
Aye, sir.

1088
01:28:55,323 --> 01:28:57,622
The crew knows
something's happened.

1089
01:28:59,427 --> 01:29:00,725
I've secured the bridge.

1090
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:07,158
This ship is equipped
with 14 long-range transporters.

1091
01:29:07,368 --> 01:29:08,734
Are they all useless?

1092
01:29:08,938 --> 01:29:10,337
They must have been locked
and secured

1093
01:29:10,538 --> 01:29:12,837
after we were beamed here.

1094
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:15,510
Isolate one and reroute
its command sequence

1095
01:29:15,711 --> 01:29:17,007
through the auxiliary processor.

1096
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:21,582
Sir, there's nothing we can do.
They already have control of our ship.

1097
01:29:21,783 --> 01:29:25,242
I don't plan on going back
to our ship.

1098
01:29:25,587 --> 01:29:28,819
Mr. Worf, destroy that thing.

1099
01:29:29,024 --> 01:29:30,582
Aye, sir.

1100
01:29:32,293 --> 01:29:34,261
Weapon systems
have been taken off-line.

1101
01:29:34,462 --> 01:29:37,023
The crew is rerouting
bridge controls.

1102
01:29:39,902 --> 01:29:42,597
Captain, there's a problem
aboard the collector.

1103
01:29:42,805 --> 01:29:44,704
The launch sequence has resumed.

1104
01:29:44,907 --> 01:29:47,876
Collector's shields have been raised.
Someone's onboard.

1105
01:29:49,244 --> 01:29:50,439
It's Ru'afo.

1106
01:29:50,645 --> 01:29:52,546
Can you override
the launch sequence from here?

1107
01:29:52,747 --> 01:29:54,215
Not without his access codes.

1108
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:55,677
Is there a self-destruct?

1109
01:29:55,885 --> 01:29:57,978
Yes, but without the codes,
it would have to be activated

1110
01:29:58,186 --> 01:29:59,814
at the upper control matrix
on the collector.

1111
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:02,319
Mr. Worf, try and find some way
to beam through those shields.

1112
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:06,119
You'd have to detonate it manually.
There'd only be a two-second delay.

1113
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:09,122
We may be able to transport
between his shield generators

1114
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:10,957
if we are within 100 meters.

1115
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:13,395
Take us into position.

1116
01:30:14,603 --> 01:30:18,538
Remain at your post, commander.
I'll need you to beam me back.

1117
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,675
We're approaching the collector.

1118
01:30:20,876 --> 01:30:23,743
One minute before separation,
you'll see the cryogenic tanks venting.

1119
01:30:23,945 --> 01:30:26,311
Weapons fire could ignite
the exhaust.

1120
01:30:35,623 --> 01:30:39,150
<i>Separation in two minutes
and 15 seconds.</i>

1121
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:51,338
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

1122
01:31:26,274 --> 01:31:27,970
Captain!

1123
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,805
Worf?

1124
01:31:37,453 --> 01:31:40,979
I'm picking up Captain Picard's
bio-signature onboard the collector.

1125
01:31:41,957 --> 01:31:43,822
<i>- Enterprise to Picard.
- Number One!</i>

1126
01:31:44,025 --> 01:31:46,391
<i>We're approaching your position.
Do you need assistance?</i>

1127
01:31:48,197 --> 01:31:50,131
I may need a lift in a minute or so.

1128
01:31:50,532 --> 01:31:51,896
We're on our way.

1129
01:31:53,202 --> 01:31:56,000
<i>Separation in one minute.</i>

1130
01:32:22,163 --> 01:32:24,597
- Report.
- It's Ru'afo's ship.

1131
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,993
On screen.

1132
01:32:28,503 --> 01:32:31,234
Sensors are reading
over 100 Ba'ku onboard.

1133
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:33,305
And one Klingon.

1134
01:32:33,509 --> 01:32:36,671
Target their ventral engines
and life support.

1135
01:32:36,878 --> 01:32:38,641
Set a collision course.

1136
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,146
Stop!

1137
01:32:46,954 --> 01:32:49,252
Ru'afo, we're getting too old for this.

1138
01:32:49,457 --> 01:32:53,587
After today, that won't be a problem.
For either of us.

1139
01:32:53,796 --> 01:32:55,490
<i>Separation in 30 seconds.</i>

1140
01:32:55,698 --> 01:32:58,131
You really going to risk
igniting the exhaust?

1141
01:33:00,536 --> 01:33:01,502
All right.

1142
01:33:01,703 --> 01:33:02,829
- I will!
- No!

1143
01:33:12,914 --> 01:33:14,779
Shields at 60 percent.

1144
01:33:14,983 --> 01:33:16,712
Hold your course.

1145
01:33:18,753 --> 01:33:22,087
- He wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.

1146
01:33:24,126 --> 01:33:25,184
Now!

1147
01:33:37,005 --> 01:33:40,064
<i>Stand by, captain,
we're right around the corner.</i>

1148
01:33:40,274 --> 01:33:41,832
Sorry...

1149
01:33:42,444 --> 01:33:44,002
...time's up.

1150
01:34:22,984 --> 01:34:24,212
What kept you, Number One?

1151
01:34:24,418 --> 01:34:27,649
The Federation Council has asked me
to inform you that the Ba'ku relocation

1152
01:34:27,855 --> 01:34:30,824
will be halted while they conduct
a top-level review.

1153
01:34:31,025 --> 01:34:33,493
Sir? Ru'afo's ship is hailing us.

1154
01:34:33,996 --> 01:34:35,895
- On screen.
- On screen.

1155
01:34:36,497 --> 01:34:39,557
Captain, the Son'a crew would like
to negotiate a cease-fire.

1156
01:34:39,768 --> 01:34:41,292
It may have something to do
with the fact

1157
01:34:41,502 --> 01:34:43,333
that we have three minutes
of air left.

1158
01:34:43,604 --> 01:34:47,268
We have plenty over here, Mr. Worf.
Prepare to beam aboard.

1159
01:34:54,283 --> 01:34:56,581
You think when we get away
from this metaphasic radiation,

1160
01:34:56,784 --> 01:34:58,149
it'll change the way we feel?

1161
01:34:58,353 --> 01:34:59,911
Your feelings about her
have not changed

1162
01:35:00,122 --> 01:35:01,588
since the day I met you, commander.

1163
01:35:01,789 --> 01:35:05,088
This place just let them out
for a little fresh air.

1164
01:35:08,963 --> 01:35:11,023
I wish there were a way
to bring them back home.

1165
01:35:11,233 --> 01:35:13,097
Ask them.

1166
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:16,800
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness,
on both sides.

1167
01:35:22,644 --> 01:35:24,703
Mother and son.

1168
01:35:25,913 --> 01:35:27,108
You arranged this?

1169
01:35:27,315 --> 01:35:29,944
I thought it might begin
the healing process.

1170
01:35:40,828 --> 01:35:43,627
What am I going to do without you?

1171
01:35:44,498 --> 01:35:46,626
I wish I could stay.

1172
01:35:47,502 --> 01:35:52,564
But these are perilous times
for the Federation.

1173
01:35:52,774 --> 01:35:55,800
I can't abandon it to people
who would threaten everything

1174
01:35:56,011 --> 01:35:59,070
that I've spent a lifetime defending.

1175
01:35:59,448 --> 01:36:01,143
I have to go back,

1176
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:07,585
if only to slow things down
at the Federation Council.

1177
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:14,359
But I have 318 days
of shore leave coming...

1178
01:36:17,798 --> 01:36:20,266
...and I intend to use them.

1179
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:32,378
Data?

1180
01:36:32,581 --> 01:36:33,912
It's time to go.

1181
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:37,614
I have to go home now.

1182
01:36:38,921 --> 01:36:40,217
Bye.

1183
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:41,945
Bye.

1184
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:59,463
Mr. Data, I hope we'll see you again.

1185
01:37:05,846 --> 01:37:07,337
Oh, Data.

1186
01:37:07,548 --> 01:37:12,315
Don't forget, you have
to have a little fun every day.

1187
01:37:13,055 --> 01:37:14,818
Good advice.

1188
01:37:27,069 --> 01:37:30,368
<i>Picard to Enterprise,
seven to beam up.</i>

1189
01:37:36,243 --> 01:37:37,506
Energize.
