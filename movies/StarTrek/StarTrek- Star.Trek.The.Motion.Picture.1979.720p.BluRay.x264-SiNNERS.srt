00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:41,656
Tactical

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,220
Visual

3
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,603
Tactical, stand by on torpedoes.

4
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,781
Ready...

5
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,410
Fire!

6
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,437
Evasive!

7
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,781
This is comm station Epsilon IX
calling U.S.S. Columbia.

8
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,535
Come in, Columbia. Respond, please.

9
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:20,629
This is Epsilon IX, Columbia.
Am boosting output. How read you this?

10
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,802
Scout Columbia NCC-621,

11
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,600
to rendezvous with
Scout Revere NCC-595

12
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,478
on Stardate 7411.4.

13
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,023
Further orders will be relayed
at that time,

14
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,733
signed Commodore Probert
to Starfleet.

15
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,569
End of transmission.

16
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,158
Intruder unidentified.

17
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:54,413
Believe luminescent cloud
to be enormous power field

18
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,331
surrounding alien vessel.

19
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,209
Our sensor scans unable to penetrate.

20
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,423
Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar,
continuing to attack.

21
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:09,595
Our sensor drone is intercepting this
on Quad L-14.

22
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,348
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

23
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,932
Unknown, sir.

24
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,519
I have an exterior visual.

25
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,429
We've plotted a course
on that cloud, Commander.

26
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,100
It will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

27
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,019
Heading?

28
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,355
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.

29
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:45,292
Our ancestors cast out their animal
passions here on these sands.

30
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:52,508
Our race was saved by the
attainment of Kolinahr.

31
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:56,386
Kolinahr: through which all emotion
is finally shed.

32
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,975
You have labored long, Spock...

33
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:05,687
Now receive from us this symbol
of total logic.

34
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,299
Your thoughts... give them to me.

35
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,515
Our minds, Spock...

36
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:46,019
...one and together

37
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:02,119
This consciousness calling to you
from space...

38
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,706
It touches your human blood, Spock.

39
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,551
You have not achieved Kolinahr.

40
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,764
His answer lies elsewhere.

41
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,144
He will not achieve his goal with us.

42
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,274
Live long and prosper, Spock.

43
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,952
Commander Sonak,

44
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,746
you received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

45
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,749
Based, I am told,
on your recommendation, Admiral.

46
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,250
-Thank you.
-Then why aren't you aboard?

47
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,753
Captain Decker requested I complete
final science briefing here

48
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,505
-before we leave on our mission.
-Here? At Starfleet?

49
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,094
The Enterprise is
in final preparation to leave dock.

50
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,011
Which will require 20 more hours
at minimum.

51
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,014
Twelve.

52
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,890
I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura

53
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,184
which will not last
more than three minutes.

54
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,062
Report to me on
the Enterprise in one hour.

55
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,312
Report to you, sir?

56
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:58,235
It is my intention to be on that ship
following that meeting.

57
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,070
Report to me in one hour.

58
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,476
-Admiral!
-Mr. Scott.

59
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,687
Those departure orders, 12 hours,
Starfleet cannot be serious.

60
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,149
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters
operating, Mr. Scott?

61
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,025
A wee problem, sir. Just temporary.

62
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,445
Admiral, we have just
finished 18 months

63
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,404
redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.

64
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,200
How in the name of hell do they expect
me to have her ready in 12 hours?

65
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,993
Take me over, please.

66
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,207
She needs more work, sir.
A shakedown.

67
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:41,171
Mr. Scott, an alien object of
unbelievable destructive power

68
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,715
is less than three days away
from this planet.

69
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,469
The only starship in interception range
is the Enterprise.

70
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,639
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.

71
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,580
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time

72
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,998
with all the new equipment.

73
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,128
And the engines, they're
not even tested at warp power.

74
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,130
And an untried captain.

75
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,633
Two and a half years
as chief of Starfleet operations

76
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,759
may have made me a little stale,

77
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,513
but I wouldn't exactly consider
myself untried.

78
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,270
-They gave her back to me, Scotty.
-"Gave" her back, sir?

79
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,356
Well, I doubt it was
that easy with Nogura.

80
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,859
You're right.

81
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:50,740
Well, any man
who could manage such a feat,

82
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,784
I would not dare to disappoint.

83
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,955
She'll launch on time, sir.
And she'll be ready.

84
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,413
-Pod secured.
-Thank you, Mr. Scott.

85
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,874
-Aye, sir.
-Pressure equalized.

86
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,338
Attention, launch crew, a travel pod
is now available at cargo six.

87
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,134
-Permission to come aboard, sir.
-Granted, sir.

88
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,928
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

89
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,221
Commander Scott, you're needed
in engineering immediately.

90
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,765
Sir, you'll excuse me.

91
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,682
Attention, launch crew.

92
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,103
A travel pod is now
available at cargo six.

93
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,440
Travel pod available. Cargo six.

94
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:18,652
-Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll show you...
-I think I can find my way, Ensign.

95
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,195
Aye, sir.

96
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,534
Bridge.

97
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,999
What's the problem?

98
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,542
I thought you people had that circuit
patched in an hour ago!

99
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,046
We did. We had to disconnect it again
so we could tie in radio messaging.

100
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,547
All right. Take out...

101
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,846
All right, as soon as
somebody can get to it.

102
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,643
-What's the next program?
-Go ahead.

103
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll get somebody down there
as soon as I can.

104
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,730
Cleary, my people are all tied up now.

105
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:03,989
Captain, Starfleet just signaled your
transfer-of-command order, sir.

106
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,410
-Captain.
-I appreciate the welcome.

107
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,371
I wish the circumstances
were less critical.

108
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,249
Epsilon IX is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

109
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,583
Aye, sir.

110
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,420
Where's Captain Decker?

111
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,672
He's in engineering, sir.

112
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,507
He...

113
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,590
He doesn't know.

114
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,012
-Mr. Chekov.
-Aye, sir.

115
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,682
Assemble the crew on the recreation
deck at 0400 hours.

116
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,809
I want to show them what we're facing.

117
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,026
Engineering to all decks,

118
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:44,570
auxiliary power test in three minutes.

119
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,660
Check Cleary on number six.

120
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,078
Engineering to all decks,

121
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,750
auxiliary power test in three minutes.

122
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,167
Mark.

123
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,680
Space matrix restoration coils.

124
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,973
Dilithium crystals.

125
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,935
I knew it! The transporter sensor
was not activated.

126
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,814
Faulty modules.

127
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,567
Cleary! Put a new backup sensor
into the unit.

128
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,902
Aye, sir.

129
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,153
-Ready.
-Emergency shut-down trip.

130
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,032
Admiral Kirk!
Well, we're getting a top-brass sendoff.

131
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,201
Don't worry. She'll launch on schedule,

132
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,869
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands.

133
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:37,664
-Right, Scotty?
-Aye, that we will, sir.

134
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,169
-Let's talk.
-Sure.

135
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,461
Let me know when that backup's ready.

136
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,630
Aye, sir.

137
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,799
All due respect, sir, I hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

138
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,050
I'm really too busy.

139
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:50,220
I'm taking over the centre seat, Will.

140
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,012
You're what?

141
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,432
I'm replacing you as
captain of the Enterprise.

142
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,184
You'll stay on as executive officer,

143
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,395
temporary grade reduction
to commander.

144
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,109
You, personally,
are assuming command?

145
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,236
Yeah.

146
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,073
-May I ask why?
-My experience.

147
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,076
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

148
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,454
My familiarity with the Enterprise,
its crew.

149
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,041
Admiral, this is
an almost totally new Enterprise.

150
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,836
You don't know her
a tenth as well as I do!

151
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,878
That's why you're staying aboard.

152
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,804
I'm sorry, Will.

153
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:35,597
No, Admiral. I don't think you're sorry.

154
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,058
Not one damn bit.

155
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,313
I remember when you recommended
me for this command.

156
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,730
You told me how envious you were

157
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,609
and how much you hoped you'd find
a way to get a starship command again.

158
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,779
Well, sir,

159
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,866
it looks like you found a way.

160
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,748
Report to the bridge, Commander,
immediately.

161
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,086
Aye, sir.

162
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,267
Transporter room, come in! Urgent!

163
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,185
Red line on the transporter, Mr. Scott.

164
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,520
Transporter! Do not engage.

165
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,607
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
-Do not...

166
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:31,570
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it. Pull them back.

167
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,780
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.

168
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,954
Malfunction! Malfunction! Malfunction!

169
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,916
-Malfunction! Malfunction!
-Give it to me!

170
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,211
Malfunction!

171
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,340
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

172
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,057
-More signal!
-We're losing their pattern.

173
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,392
Oh, no. They're forming.

174
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,202
Oh, my God.

175
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,420
Starfleet, do you have them?

176
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:34,925
Enterprise, what we got back
didn't live long.

177
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,176
Fortunately.

178
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,017
Starfleet, Kirk.

179
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,021
Please express my condolences
to their families.

180
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,611
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan Embassy.

181
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,077
There was nothing you
could have done, Rand.

182
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,038
It wasn't your fault.

183
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,150
-Yeoman, turboshaft eight?
-Back that way, sir.

184
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,742
We have to replace Commander Sonak.

185
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,079
I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.

186
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,999
None available, Captain.

187
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,169
In fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

188
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,421
You are, Mr. Decker.

189
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,758
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to double as science officer.

190
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,875
That's all we know about it.

191
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,463
Except that it is now 53.4 hours
away from Earth.

192
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:44,430
Enterprise is the only Federation
starship that stands in its way.

193
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:49,059
We assume that there is a vessel of
some type at the heart of the cloud.

194
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,563
Our orders are to intercept,

195
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,483
investigate and take whatever action
is necessary

196
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,112
and possible.

197
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,911
We can only hope that there is
a life form aboard that vessel

198
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:09,622
that reasons the way we do.

199
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,712
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon IX.

200
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,882
-Put it on viewer.
-On viewer, sir.

201
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:24,679
Enterprise. The cloud is definitely
a power field of some kind.

202
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,721
Measures...

203
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,685
My God! Over 82 AUs in diameter.

204
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,605
Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.

205
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:39,986
We're transmitting linguacode
friendship messages on all frequencies.

206
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,112
No response.

207
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,072
I have a null reading
at the centre of the cloud.

208
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,951
Definitely something inside there,
but all scans are being reflected back.

209
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,371
-Some kind of power surge.
-Receiving an odd pattern now!

210
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,624
Enterprise, they could be mistaking
our scans as a hostile act.

211
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,460
They seem to be reacting
to our scans, sir.

212
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,044
Deflectors, emergency full!

213
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,467
-We are under attack!
-External view.

214
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,027
Viewer off.

215
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,821
Viewer off!

216
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:21,086
Pre-launch countdown
will commence in 40 minutes.

217
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,690
Photon torpedo load status.

218
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,193
Transporter system fully repaired
and functioning normally, sir.

219
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,695
Dock signals clear, Captain.

220
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,699
Reply we are holding position
awaiting final crew replacements.

221
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,032
Aye, sir.

222
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:56,663
Transporter personnel reports
the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia,

223
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,209
she's already aboard
and en route to the bridge, sir.

224
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,005
She's Deltan, Captain.

225
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,846
-Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
-Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

226
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,977
-Hello, Ilia.
-Decker.

227
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,146
I was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

228
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,190
Commander Decker?

229
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:26,027
Yes, our exec and science officer.

230
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,403
Captain Kirk has
the utmost confidence in me.

231
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,782
And, in you, too, Lieutenant.

232
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,536
My oath of celibacy
is on record, Captain.

233
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,913
-May I assume my duties?
-By all means.

234
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,125
Captain?

235
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,086
Starfleet reports our last six crew
members are ready to beam up,

236
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:47,798
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

237
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,051
Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up.

238
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,637
Transporter room.

239
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,286
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to the Starfleet...

240
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,579
Just a moment, Captain, sir.

241
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,083
I'll explain what happened.

242
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,292
Your revered Admiral Nogura

243
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,963
invoked a little known, seldom used
reserve activation clause.

244
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,259
In simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me.

245
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,802
They didn't.

246
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:39,141
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?

247
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,684
Bones, there's a thing out there.

248
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,938
Why is any object we don't understand
always called a "thing"?

249
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,605
Headed this way.

250
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,775
I need you.

251
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,904
Damn it, Bones. I need you.

252
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,990
Badly!

253
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,215
-Permission to come aboard?
-Permission granted, sir.

254
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,431
Well, Jim.

255
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,266
I hear Chapel's an MD now.

256
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,353
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse.

257
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,606
Not a doctor who'll argue
every little diagnosis with me.

258
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,902
And they probably redesigned
the whole sickbay, too.

259
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,655
I know engineers.
They love to change things.

260
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,971
Dock control reports ready, sir.

261
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,349
-Helm ready, sir.
-Orbital departure on plot, sir.

262
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,478
Yard command signaling clear, sir.

263
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,146
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

264
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,483
-Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
-Hold station.

265
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,360
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

266
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,715
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.

267
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:41,554
Take us out.

268
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:09,393
Intermix set, bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.

269
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:11,436
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.

270
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,231
Ahead warp 0.5.

271
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,206
-Departure angle on viewer.
-Departure angle.

272
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,757
-Viewer ahead.
-Viewer ahead.

273
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:07,326
Captain's Log, Stardate 7412.6,

274
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:09,536
1 .8 hours from launch.

275
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,373
In order to intercept the intruder
at the earliest possible time,

276
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,835
we must now risk engaging warp drive
while still within the solar system.

277
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,798
Captain, assuming
we have full warp capability,

278
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,760
accelerating to warp 7 on leaving
the solar system

279
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:30,224
will bring us to IP with
the intruder in 20.1 hours.

280
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,893
Science officer's computation
confirmed, sir.

281
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,657
Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your approval?

282
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,119
They do not. It's like working
in a damned computer centre.

283
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,161
Programming ready?

284
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,621
Program set for
standard warp entry, Captain,

285
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,666
but I still recommend
further simulation study.

286
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:01,463
Mr. Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

287
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,259
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.

288
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,554
Captain, we need further
warp simulation on the flow sensors.

289
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,097
Engineer, we need warp speed now.

290
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,349
Jim?

291
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,018
You're pushing.

292
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,771
Your people know their jobs.

293
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,568
That's it, sir. I can't do any better.

294
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,820
Aye, lad.

295
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:30,367
It's borderline
on the simulator, Captain.

296
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,786
I cannot guarantee that she'll hold up.

297
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,329
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.

298
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:38,166
-Ahead, warp 1, Mr. Sulu.
-Accelerating to warp 1, sir.

299
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,795
Warp 0.7.

300
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,007
0.8.

301
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,561
Warp 1, sir.

302
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,150
-Mr. Decker...
-Emergency alert! Emergency alert!

303
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:04,275
Emergency alert!

304
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,653
Wormhole! Get us back
on impulse power! Full reverse.

305
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,530
Emergency alert! Emergency alert!

306
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,380
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power!

307
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,675
Subspace frequencies jammed, sir!
Wormhole effect!

308
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,398
Negative control from
inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds

309
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,358
before forward velocity
slows to sub-light speed!

310
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,443
Unidentified small object

311
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,447
has been pulled into the wormhole
with us, Captain, directly ahead!

312
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,534
Force fields up full.
Put object on viewer.

313
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,416
-Go manual override on helm!
-No manual response, sir.

314
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,545
Navigational deflectors coming up, sir.

315
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,338
Wormhole distortion has overloaded
the main power systems.

316
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:10,007
Navigational deflectors
inoperative, Captain.

317
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,344
Directional control also inoperative.

318
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,353
Time to impact?

319
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:24,940
Twenty seconds.

320
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,902
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.

321
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,945
No!

322
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,119
Belay that phaser order!

323
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,090
Arm photon torpedoes!

324
00:41:57,764 --> 00:42:01,518
Photon torpedoes

325
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:08,108
armed!

326
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:20,036
Object is an asteroid,
reading mass 0.7.

327
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:28,211
Targeting asteroid!

328
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:33,007
Impact in ten seconds.

329
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:44,478
-Impact in eight seconds.
-Fire torpedoes!

330
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:45,771
Six...

331
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,273
-Torpedoes away!
-...seconds.

332
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,650
Four!

333
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,931
We're out of it!

334
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,521
Helm control restored, sir.

335
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:36,070
-Position report, Navigator.
-Computing new intersection course.

336
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,114
Communications are normal, sir.

337
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,202
Negative damage reported, Captain.
No casualties reported, Doctor.

338
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:45,414
Wrong, Mr. Chekov,
there are casualties.

339
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,039
My wits!

340
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:50,751
As in "frightened out of," Captain, sir.

341
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,255
We're at warp 0.8.

342
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,382
Engineer, report your status there.

343
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,969
In just a second, Exec.
We're picking up the pieces down here!

344
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,307
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

345
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,643
Captain, it was the engine imbalance

346
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,271
that created the wormhole
in the first place.

347
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,440
It will happen again
if we don't correct it.

348
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,483
That object is less than two days
away from Earth.

349
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,902
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

350
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,487
Navigator, lay in a new heading

351
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,742
to conform with our initial IP
with the intruder.

352
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,659
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

353
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,246
Mr. Decker, I'd like to
see you in my quarters.

354
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,583
Mind if I tag along, Captain?

355
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,713
Level five.

356
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,599
All right, explanation. Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

357
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:48,643
Sir, the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power

358
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,021
by channeling it through
the main engines.

359
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,565
When they went
into anti-matter imbalance,

360
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:56,068
the phasers were automatically cut off.

361
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,782
Then you acted properly, of course.

362
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,826
Thank you, sir.

363
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,996
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

364
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,458
-You saved the ship.
-I'm aware of that, sir.

365
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,463
Stop competing with me, Decker!

366
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,634
-Permission to speak freely, sir?
-Granted!

367
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:24,929
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two and a half years.

368
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:29,141
That, plus your unfamiliarity with
the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir,

369
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,728
seriously jeopardizes this mission.

370
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,985
I trust you will

371
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,949
nursemaid me through
these difficulties, mister?

372
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,409
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

373
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,119
Then I won't keep you from
your duties any longer, Commander.

374
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,414
-Yes, Doctor?
-Aye, sir.

375
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,463
He may be right, Jim.

376
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,851
Was it difficult?

377
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,561
No more than I expected.

378
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,855
About as difficult as seeing you again.

379
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,525
I'm sorry.

380
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:22,528
That you left Delta IV?
Or that you didn't even say goodbye?

381
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,909
If I had seen you again,

382
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,121
would you have been able to say it?

383
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,958
No.

384
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:49,597
Make your point, Doctor.

385
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,059
The point, Captain, is that
it's you who's competing.

386
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,811
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

387
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,565
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

388
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,237
And I intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

389
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:07,699
Yes. It's an obsession.

390
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,909
An obsession that can blind you

391
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,288
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

392
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,833
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

393
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,753
-Bridge to Captain.
-Viewer on.

394
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,634
Signal from a Federation-registered
long-range shuttle, sir.

395
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:29,179
She wishes to come alongside
and lock on.

396
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:30,262
For what purpose?

397
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:34,059
My security scan shows it has
a Grade 1 priority, Captain.

398
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,268
Non-belligerency confirmed.

399
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,438
I suspect it is a courier of some kind.

400
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,815
Very well, Mr. Chekov. See to it.

401
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,237
Viewer off.
Your opinion has been noted.

402
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,367
Anything further?

403
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,536
That depends on you.

404
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:11,530
Security scan. One boarder.
Identity, Starfleet. Inactive.

405
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,706
Permission to come aboard, sir.

406
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:23,543
Granted, sir! Granted.

407
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,806
-Why, why, it's Mr Spock!

408
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,811
Spock.

409
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,445
Commander, if I may?

410
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,918
I've been monitoring
your communications

411
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,338
with Starfleet Command, Captain.

412
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,175
I'm aware of your
engine design difficulties.

413
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,804
I offer my services as science officer.

414
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,431
With all due respect, Commander.

415
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,016
If our exec has no objections?

416
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,644
Of course not. I'm well aware
of Mr Spock's qualifications.

417
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:27,856
Mr Chekov, log Mr Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated,

418
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,025
list him as science officer,

419
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,489
both effective immediately.

420
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:35,657
Mr Spock!

421
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,201
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you!

422
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,717
It's how we all feel, Mr Spock.

423
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,719
Captain, with your permission,

424
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,554
I will now discuss these fuel equations
with the engineer.

425
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:06,855
Mr Spock? Welcome aboard.

426
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,215
Captain's Log, Stardate 7413.4.

427
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,094
Thanks to Mr Spock's timely arrival,
and assistance,

428
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,347
we have the engines rebalanced
into full warp capacity.

429
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,018
Repair time, less than three hours.

430
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,603
Which means, we will now
be able to intercept intruder

431
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,688
while still more than a day from Earth.

432
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,900
Warp 0.8.

433
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,449
0.9.

434
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,375
Warp 2, sir.

435
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,880
Warp 3.

436
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,925
Warp 4.

437
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,387
Warp 5.

438
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,726
Warp 6.

439
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:54,711
Science Officer Spock,
reporting as ordered, Captain.

440
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,215
Please, sit down.

441
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,217
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

442
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,054
You're just as warm and
sociable as ever.

443
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:05,347
Nor have you, Doctor,

444
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:09,143
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

445
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,811
Gentlemen.

446
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:17,693
At last report, you were on Vulcan,
apparently to stay.

447
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:21,447
Yes, you were undergoing
the Kolinahr discipline.

448
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,699
Sit down.

449
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:28,538
If you are referring to the Kolinahr,
Doctor, you are correct.

450
00:53:28,621 --> 00:53:31,498
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr Spock,

451
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:36,378
it's the Vulcan ritual that's supposed
to purge all remaining emotions.

452
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,715
The Kolinahr is also
a discipline you broke

453
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,550
to join us.

454
00:53:43,177 --> 00:53:46,972
Will you please sit down?

455
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,112
On Vulcan I began
sensing a consciousness

456
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:04,782
from a source more powerful
than I have ever encountered.

457
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:08,036
Thought patterns
of exactingly, perfect order.

458
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,039
I believe they emanate
from the intruder.

459
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,458
I believe it may hold my answers.

460
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:17,420
Well, isn't it lucky for you that we just
happened to be heading your way?

461
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,547
Bones!

462
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,342
We need him.

463
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:26,804
I need him.

464
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,099
Then my presence is to
our mutual advantage?

465
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,193
Any thought patterns you might sense,

466
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,322
whether they appear to
affect you personally or not,

467
00:54:44,405 --> 00:54:46,615
I expect immediately reported.

468
00:54:46,699 --> 00:54:48,201
Of course, Captain.

469
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,411
Is there anything else?

470
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:52,829
No.

471
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,385
Jim?

472
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:13,476
If this super-intelligence is as important
to him as he says it is,

473
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,561
how do we know...

474
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,563
That he wouldn't put his own
interests ahead of the ship's?

475
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,275
I could never believe that.

476
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,652
Bridge to officer's lounge.

477
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:27,907
Captain Kirk, revised estimate
on cloud visual contact, 3.7 minutes.

478
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:33,079
Red Alert! Red Alert!

479
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,081
Red Alert! Red Alert!

480
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,260
Standard light, Engineer.

481
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,472
-Full mag on viewer!
-Full mag, sir.

482
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,940
Linguacode?

483
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,235
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, sir.

484
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:06,612
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status Red.

485
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,199
-Captain, we are being scanned.
-Do no return scan, Mr Spock.

486
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,036
It could be misinterpreted as hostility.

487
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,289
Intruder scans emanating from
the exact centre of the cloud.

488
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,918
Energy of a type
never before encountered.

489
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,804
There's no response to
friendship messages, sir.

490
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,264
Shall I go to battle stations, sir?

491
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,391
Negative. We'll take
no provocative action.

492
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:40,188
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.

493
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,650
No, Mr Decker. That could
also be misinterpreted as hostile.

494
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:49,322
Cloud composition, Mr Spock?

495
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,949
-Twelfth power energy field.
-Twelfth power?

496
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:53,659
Captain, we've seen what
their weapons can do.

497
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,244
Shouldn't we take
every possible precaution?

498
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,496
-Mr Decker...
-Captain.

499
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,083
I suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

500
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,672
Mr Decker, I will not provoke an attack.

501
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,217
If that order isn't clear enough for you...

502
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,721
Captain, as your exec,
it's my duty to point out alternatives.

503
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:18,101
Yes, it is.

504
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,643
I stand corrected.

505
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,394
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

506
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,775
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud centre.

507
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:29,277
Bring us parallel to whatever
we find in there.

508
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,657
-Mr Sulu, tactical plot on viewer.
-Tactical on viewer, sir.

509
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,048
That measures twelfth power energy?

510
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,719
Thousands of starships couldn't
generate that much...

511
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,222
Mr Spock?

512
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,811
Spock, tell me.

513
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,489
I sense puzzlement.

514
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,786
We have been contacted.

515
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,248
Why have we not replied?

516
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,708
Contacted?

517
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:25,918
How?

518
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,420
Standard on viewer.

519
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,547
Force fields up full! Deflectors, now!

520
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,594
Mark, zero. Incoming fire ahead.

521
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,012
Force fields and deflectors
up full, Captain!

522
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:46,731
Analysis, Mr Spock.

523
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:49,775
Alien weapon is a form of
plasma energy, Captain.

524
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,155
Exact composition, unknown.
Guidance system, unknown.

525
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,701
All decks brace for impact.

526
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,503
Registering power loss on force fields!

527
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,297
Engineering, what's happening
to our force fields?

528
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,215
Systems overloading, Captain!

529
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,978
-Medic.
-Medics are coming.

530
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,407
The new screens held.

531
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,911
Engineering to bridge.
Cannot hold full power on force fields!

532
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,789
Deflector power is down 70%!

533
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,791
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.

534
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,172
Captain.

535
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,925
The intruder has been attempting
to communicate.

536
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,179
Our previous transmission
mode was too primitive to be received.

537
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:03,266
I am now programming our computer
to transmit linguacode

538
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,851
at their frequency and rate of speed.

539
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,936
Commander.

540
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,030
Spock.

541
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,289
Here it comes!

542
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,706
Engineering! Status report!

543
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,293
Our shields cannot handle
another attack.

544
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:32,836
Mr Spock!

545
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,884
Impact in 20 seconds.

546
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,304
Spock!

547
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,806
15 seconds!

548
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,143
Spock! Transmit now!

549
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,519
10 seconds.

550
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:50,603
Transmitting.

551
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,452
It would seem our friendship messages

552
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,496
have been received
and understood, Mr Spock.

553
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,623
I would say that was
a logical assumption, Captain.

554
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,086
-Mr Sulu, hold present position.
-Holding present position, sir.

555
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,264
Tactical plot on viewer.

556
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,974
Course projection on tactical, sir.

557
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:37,233
-Opinion, Mr Spock.
-Recommend we proceed, Captain.

558
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:41,197
-Mr Decker?
-I advise caution, Captain.

559
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,032
We can't withstand another attack.

560
01:01:43,115 --> 01:01:45,742
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.

561
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,871
-We know nothing about it as yet.
-Precisely the point, Captain.

562
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:52,666
We don't know what it'll do.
Moving into that cloud at this time

563
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,753
is an unwarranted gamble.

564
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,130
How do you define "unwarranted"?

565
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,637
You asked my opinion, sir.

566
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,313
Viewer, standard ahead.

567
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:28,702
Navigator, maintain course.
Helmsman, steady as she goes.

568
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,755
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

569
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,094
Spock?

570
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,389
Instruments fluctuating, Captain.

571
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,269
Patterns unrecognizable.

572
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,000
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

573
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:46,668
Advise we are
attempting further communication.

574
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,713
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

575
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,759
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud
is being reflected back!

576
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,103
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.

577
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,907
Reduce magnification,
factor four, Mr Sulu.

578
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:19,034
We're already two settings
below that, sir.

579
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,581
Mr Sulu,

580
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:31,630
bring us into a parallel course
over the alien at 500 meters.

581
01:07:32,297 --> 01:07:34,090
500 meters?

582
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:39,554
Then take us out to 100 kilometers
distance, adjusting parallel course.

583
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,557
Aye, sir.

584
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,139
-Viewer astern.
-Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

585
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:10,497
Five hundred meters.
Viewer ahead, sir.

586
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,356
Hold relative position here.

587
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,694
Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!

588
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,698
Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!

589
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,451
Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!

590
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:26,484
Mr Spock, can that
be one of their crew?

591
01:13:27,819 --> 01:13:32,114
A probe from their vessel, Captain.
Plasma, energy combination.

592
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,619
Don't interfere with it!

593
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,913
Absolutely, I will not interfere.

594
01:13:40,957 --> 01:13:42,833
No one interfere!

595
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,878
It doesn't seem interested in us!

596
01:13:46,546 --> 01:13:48,215
Only the ship.

597
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,815
Computer off!

598
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,033
It's taken control of the computer.

599
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:24,708
It's running our records!
Earth defenses! Starfleet strength!

600
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,912
Ilia!

601
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,085
Ilia!

602
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,569
This is how I define unwarranted.

603
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:45,497
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

604
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,965
Emergency Alert!
Negative control at helm!

605
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,135
Emergency Alert!
Negative control at helm!

606
01:15:57,427 --> 01:16:00,555
Emergency Alert!
Negative control at helm!

607
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,640
Force fields! Full remaining strength!
Total reserve!

608
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,435
This ship is under attack.
Man all defensive stations.

609
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,360
Captain, we've been
seized by a tractor beam.

610
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:16,820
Get someone up here to take
the navigator's station.

611
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,614
-Engineering!
-Chief DiFalco, to the bridge!

612
01:16:18,698 --> 01:16:19,783
Emergency power!

613
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:23,118
Going to full emergency!

614
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:27,623
But, Captain, if we don't break
free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up!

615
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:29,376
We cannot break free, Captain.

616
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,752
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

617
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:36,341
Engineering, belay that order.
Disengage all main drive systems.

618
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:57,529
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant Lila’s station.

619
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,537
DiFalco, disengage engine
navigation relays now!

620
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,663
Aye, sir.

621
01:17:07,747 --> 01:17:11,333
Force field circuits E10 through 14
show ready for reactivation.

622
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,711
Confirm, please.

623
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:16,338
Scotty, drive systems
should be free now.

624
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,590
Commander?

625
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,676
Ready to launch remote
communications drone

626
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,262
with complete ships records,
including our present situation, sir.

627
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:24,889
Delay launching as long as possible.

628
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:27,475
Our drone can't escape as long
as we're held in that tractor.

629
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,643
Aye.

630
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,838
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam

631
01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:59,966
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

632
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:02,635
Break free to where, Commander?

633
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:05,637
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

634
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:07,640
We don't know that, Mr Spock.

635
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,601
Why are you opposed to trying?

636
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:07,574
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

637
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,536
They still can.

638
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,328
Curiosity, Mr Decker.

639
01:19:13,164 --> 01:19:16,000
Insatiable curiosity.

640
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:28,887
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

641
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,681
We're trapped, sir.

642
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,144
Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

643
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,753
Tractor beam has released us, Captain.

644
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:06,426
Confirmed. Vessel is floating free.
No forward momentum.

645
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,180
-Viewer ahead.
-Viewer ahead, sir.

646
01:20:16,811 --> 01:20:19,898
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr Sulu.
Ahead one third.

647
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,233
Thrusters ahead, one third.

648
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:31,658
Let's take a look.
Full sensor scan, Mr Spock.

649
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,994
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

650
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:35,497
Now that we're
looking down their throat.

651
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,957
Right. Now that we've got them
just where they want us.

652
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,185
It's closing up.

653
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:02,105
Hold position.

654
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,983
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

655
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,947
Captain?

656
01:21:11,824 --> 01:21:16,537
All our scans are being reflected back.
Sensors are useless.

657
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:18,288
Damn!

658
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:27,881
What do you make of all this?

659
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:31,594
I believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber.

660
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,430
Undoubtedly, part of
the vessel's inner mechanism.

661
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:38,518
I suspect it may be necessary...

662
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:45,692
-Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!
-Deck five, Captain. Officer's quarters.

663
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,902
Have Security meet me at deck five!
Main elevator!

664
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:50,404
Spock! Mr Decker, you have the conn.

665
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:54,993
-Hold position.
-Intruder location, a sonic shower.

666
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:59,956
Temperature at intruder location,
temperature drop rapid now.

667
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:02,207
60 degrees.

668
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:06,253
50 degrees.
Temperature curve flattening.

669
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:10,007
45 degrees. 40 degrees.

670
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,761
Temperature leveling, 39 degrees.

671
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:17,390
You are the Kirk-unit.
You will assist me.

672
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:19,975
Holding at 37.65 degrees.

673
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:25,105
I've been programmed by V'Ger
to observe and record

674
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:30,694
normal functions of the carbon-based
units infesting U.S.S. Enterprise.

675
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:34,157
Holding at 37.65 degrees.

676
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,292
-Jim, what's going on?
-Tricorder.

677
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,675
Who is V'Ger?

678
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:56,554
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

679
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:01,559
Is V'Ger the name of
the captain of the alien vessel?

680
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:07,023
-Jim, this is a mechanism.
-A probe, Captain.

681
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,402
No doubt a sensor-transceiver
combination

682
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,029
recording everything we say and do.

683
01:23:15,114 --> 01:23:19,202
-Where is Lieutenant Ilia?
-That unit no longer functions.

684
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:22,246
I've been given its form
to more readily communicate

685
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:26,292
with the carbon-based units
infesting Enterprise.

686
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:31,213
-Carbon-based units?
-Humans, Ensign Perez. Us.

687
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,842
Why does V'Ger travel
to the third planet

688
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:38,387
of the solar system directly ahead?

689
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,390
To find the Creator.

690
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:45,478
Find the Creator? Whose...

691
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,693
What does V'Ger want
with the Creator?

692
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,360
To join with him.

693
01:23:53,444 --> 01:23:56,238
To join with the Creator? How?

694
01:23:56,989 --> 01:23:59,449
V'Ger and the Creator will become one.

695
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,243
And who is the Creator?

696
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:04,122
The Creator is that
which created V'Ger.

697
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:08,167
-Who is V'Ger?
-V'Ger is that which seeks the Creator.

698
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,923
I'm ready to commence
my observations.

699
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:19,261
Doctor, a thorough examination of
this probe might provide some insight

700
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:23,056
into those who manufactured it
and how to deal with them.

701
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:26,310
Fine. Let's get her to sickbay.

702
01:24:30,314 --> 01:24:32,649
I am programmed to observe and record

703
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,319
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

704
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,448
The examination is a normal function.

705
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,328
You may proceed.

706
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,502
Micro-miniature hydraulics,

707
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,300
sensors

708
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,681
and molecule-sized
multi-processor chips.

709
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:11,730
And take a look at this.

710
01:25:11,814 --> 01:25:14,609
An osmotic micro-pump right here.

711
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,987
And even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

712
01:25:21,365 --> 01:25:23,618
Every exocrine system is the same, too.

713
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,996
Even eye moisture.

714
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,207
Decker.

715
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,711
Fascinating. Not "Decker-unit"?

716
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:39,759
Gentlemen.

717
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,136
Will.

718
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:54,231
What happened to her?

719
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:57,819
Captain, this probe may be
our key to the aliens.

720
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:59,737
Probe? "Ilia"?

721
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:03,198
Exactly. It is a programmed
mechanism, Commander.

722
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:06,993
Its body duplicates our
navigator in precise detail.

723
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,204
Suppose that beneath its programming,

724
01:26:09,288 --> 01:26:13,333
the real Lila’s memory patterns are
duplicated with equal precision.

725
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:15,962
-They had a pattern to follow.
-Indeed.

726
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,256
They may have followed it
too precisely.

727
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,676
Lila’s memory, her feelings of loyalty,

728
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,137
obedience, friendship
might all be there!

729
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:30,225
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

730
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,895
That probe, in another form,
is what killed Ilia!

731
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,604
Commander!

732
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,148
Will,

733
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,943
we're locked in an alien vessel,
six hours from Earth orbit.

734
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,444
Our only contact with
our captor is that probe.

735
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:44,698
If we could control it,
persuade it, use it...

736
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:51,622
I have recorded enough here.
You will now assist me further.

737
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:59,005
The Decker-unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

738
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,845
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr Decker.

739
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,015
Aye, sir.

740
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,149
I am concerned with that being
our only source of information, Captain.

741
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,655
Captain's Log, Stardate 7414.1.

742
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:30,161
Our best estimates place
us some four hours from Earth.

743
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,454
No significant progress thus far,

744
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:36,333
reviving Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe.

745
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:40,003
This remains our only
means of contact with our captor.

746
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:42,672
All those vessels
were called Enterprise.

747
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,854
The carbon units use this area
for recreation.

748
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,524
This is one of the games.

749
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:09,992
What types of recreation does
the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

750
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:14,454
The words "recreation" and "enjoy"

751
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,167
have no meaning to my programming.

752
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,802
Ilia enjoyed this game.

753
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,430
She nearly always won.

754
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:41,399
Good. He's using
audio-visual association.

755
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,603
This device serves no purpose.

756
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,702
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

757
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:38,956
Enterprise would be unable to
function without carbon units.

758
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,210
More data concerning this
functioning is necessary,

759
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:48,006
before carbon units can be
patterned for data storage.

760
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:53,386
What does that mean?

761
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:57,307
When my examination is
complete all carbon units

762
01:29:57,391 --> 01:30:00,435
will be reduced to data patterns.

763
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,524
Within you are the memory
patterns of a certain carbon unit.

764
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:08,234
If I can help you
to revive those patterns,

765
01:30:08,944 --> 01:30:11,072
you could understand
our functions better.

766
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:15,158
That is logical. You may proceed.

767
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:05,876
I remember Lieutenant Ilia
once mentioning she wore that.

768
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,801
On Delta. Remember?

769
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,554
Ilia?

770
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,310
Doctor Chapel.

771
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:38,074
-Will?
-Ilia.

772
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:43,581
Commander. Commander.

773
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,918
This is a mechanism.

774
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:53,591
Ilia,

775
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:59,512
help us make direct contact with V'Ger.

776
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:04,100
-I cannot.
-This Creator V'Ger is looking for,

777
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:09,731
-what is it?
-V'Ger does not know.

778
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,261
Computer, commence recording.

779
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:46,810
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail
my attempt to contact the aliens.

780
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:59,739
Warning! Your emergency evacuation
thruster pack has been armed.

781
01:32:59,823 --> 01:33:04,662
Once ignited, the burn duration is
10 seconds and may not be aborted.

782
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:09,582
Push the igniter-enable release
to begin a 10-second countdown

783
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,335
to thruster ignition.

784
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:16,006
To abort countdown,
flip the control arm up.

785
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:19,009
I intend to calculate thruster
ignition and acceleration rate

786
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,761
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

787
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:25,807
This should facilitate a better view
of the interior of the alien spacecraft.

788
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:35,149
Captain? Starfleet signals are
growing in strength, sir.

789
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:38,988
They still have the intruder
on their monitors. It's decelerating.

790
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:43,658
Confirmed, sir. Lunar beacons indicate
intruder on a course into Earth orbit.

791
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:49,539
Sir, airlock four has been opened.
A thruster suit is reported missing.

792
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:55,003
A thruster suit?

793
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:58,172
That's Spock. Damn him.

794
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:01,635
Bring him back here. No, wait!

795
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,145
-Get a fix on his position.
-Aye, sir!

796
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:33,769
I have successfully penetrated
the next chamber of the alien's interior,

797
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:36,814
and I'm witnessing some sort of
dimensional image,

798
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,400
which I believe to be a representation
of V'Ger's home planet.

799
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:51,036
I'm passing through
a connecting tunnel.

800
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:54,832
Apparently, a kind of
plasma energy conduit,

801
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:58,167
possibly a field coil
for a gigantic imaging system.

802
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:14,100
Curious. I'm seeing images of planets,
moons, stars,

803
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:17,061
whole galaxies,
all stored here, recorded.

804
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:19,939
It could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

805
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:29,783
But who or what are we dealing with?

806
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:33,578
The Epsilon IX station,
stored here with every detail.

807
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:45,548
Captain, I am now quite convinced
that all of this is V'Ger.

808
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:49,136
That we are inside a living machine.

809
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:55,725
Ilia!

810
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:06,110
The sensor must contain some
special meaning.

811
01:37:09,782 --> 01:37:11,908
I must try to mind-meld with it.

812
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:10,591
Spock! Spock! Spock!

813
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:30,487
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fiber connection.

814
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:37,578
Indications of some
neurological trauma.

815
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:41,872
The power pouring through that
mind-meld must have been staggering.

816
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:51,882
-Spock.
-Jim,

817
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,346
I should have known.

818
01:38:57,431 --> 01:39:00,350
Were you right? About V'Ger?

819
01:39:01,935 --> 01:39:03,686
A life form of its own.

820
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:09,400
-A conscious, living entity.
-A living machine?

821
01:39:09,484 --> 01:39:10,944
It considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

822
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:13,779
That's why the probe
refers to our ship as an entity.

823
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:16,699
I saw V'Ger's planet,

824
01:39:16,783 --> 01:39:20,453
a planet populated by living machines.

825
01:39:20,537 --> 01:39:23,039
Unbelievable technology.

826
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:28,002
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

827
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:33,716
And yet, with all its pure logic,

828
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:38,971
V'Ger is barren, cold.

829
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:43,435
No mystery. No beauty.

830
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,733
I should've known.

831
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:56,238
Known? Known what? Spock.

832
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:58,240
-Captain.
-Bones!

833
01:40:02,537 --> 01:40:08,085
Spock! What should you have known?
What should you have known?

834
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:14,632
Jim,

835
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:22,349
this simple feeling

836
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:26,353
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

837
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,780
No meaning. No hope.

838
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:43,244
And Jim, no answers.

839
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:48,291
-It's asking questions.
-What questions?

840
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:52,462
"Is this all that I am?"

841
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,881
"Is there nothing more?"

842
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,849
Bridge to Captain.

843
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,561
Kirk here.

844
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,646
A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.

845
01:41:11,356 --> 01:41:14,067
Intruder cloud has been
located on their outer monitors

846
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:16,194
for the past 27 minutes.

847
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,238
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

848
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,243
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

849
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:27,497
-We are three minutes from Earth orbit.
-I'll be right there.

850
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:33,920
I need Spock on the bridge.

851
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:36,131
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

852
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:42,511
A machine planet
sending a machine to Earth,

853
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:46,600
looking for its Creator.

854
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:51,688
It's absolutely incredible.

855
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:58,944
Mr. Chekov,
Commander Decker's present location?

856
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:01,072
He... They are in engineering, sir.

857
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,668
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

858
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:19,673
V'Ger is transmitting a signal.

859
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:25,305
-Jim.
-From V'Ger.

860
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:32,561
V'Ger signals the Creator.

861
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:48,328
Spock?

862
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:54,417
A simple binary code
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

863
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,253
Radio.

864
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:00,881
Radio?

865
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:10,266
Jim, V'Ger expects an answer.

866
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,311
An answer? I don't know the question.

867
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,983
The Creator has not responded.

868
01:43:32,622 --> 01:43:36,126
All planetary defense systems
have just gone inoperative!

869
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:20,295
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices
are proceeding

870
01:44:20,378 --> 01:44:23,465
toward equidistant positions,
orbiting the planet.

871
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:25,382
They're the same things that hit us.

872
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:28,094
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

873
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:29,429
From those positions,

874
01:44:29,512 --> 01:44:32,181
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

875
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:49,783
-Why?
-The Creator has not answered.

876
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:53,744
The carbon-unit infestation is to be
removed from the Creator's planet.

877
01:44:53,828 --> 01:44:57,457
-Why?
-You infest Enterprise.

878
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,292
You interfere with the Creator
in the same manner.

879
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:03,755
Machine.

880
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,261
V'Ger. V'Ger!

881
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:22,815
Captain.

882
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,780
V'Ger is a child.

883
01:45:30,992 --> 01:45:33,076
I suggest you treat her as such.

884
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:35,787
-A child?
-Yes, Captain. A child.

885
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:39,957
Evolving, learning, searching,

886
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:42,585
instinctively needing.

887
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:44,628
Needing what?

888
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:49,509
Spock, this child is about to
wipe out every living thing on Earth.

889
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:53,220
Now what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?

890
01:45:56,809 --> 01:46:00,145
It knows only that it needs, Commander,

891
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:04,940
but like so many of us,
it does not know what.

892
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:21,832
The carbon units know why
the Creator has not responded.

893
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:27,546
Disclose the information.

894
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:31,467
Not until V'Ger withdraws
the devices orbiting the third planet!

895
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:32,594
Captain!

896
01:46:35,597 --> 01:46:38,682
I'm losing Starfleet!
Interference from V'Ger!

897
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:44,021
Kirk-unit, disclose the information.

898
01:46:44,105 --> 01:46:47,108
Why has the Creator not responded?

899
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:48,693
No.

900
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:55,574
Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.

901
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:00,662
Clear the bridge, Captain?

902
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:03,207
That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge!

903
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:04,333
Aye, sir.

904
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:14,927
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.

905
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:19,015
V'Ger requires the information.

906
01:47:22,685 --> 01:47:25,270
Bridge! Secure all stations! Move out!

907
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:27,564
Jim, what the hell kind of
strategy is this?

908
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:31,694
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

909
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,113
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise,

910
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:35,989
the information that V'Ger
requires will also be destroyed!

911
01:47:36,074 --> 01:47:40,119
It is illogical to withhold
required information.

912
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:43,247
Kirk-unit! Kirk-unit.

913
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:49,253
Why do you not disclose information?

914
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,386
Because V'Ger's going to destroy
all the carbon units on the third planet.

915
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:00,430
-They have repressed the Creator.
-The information will not be disclosed!

916
01:48:01,891 --> 01:48:04,351
V'Ger needs the information.

917
01:48:04,435 --> 01:48:08,314
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

918
01:48:09,899 --> 01:48:14,737
V'Ger will comply, if the carbon units
will disclose the information.

919
01:48:21,369 --> 01:48:23,371
It learns fast, doesn't it?

920
01:48:23,538 --> 01:48:26,832
Captain, the vessel, V'Ger,

921
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:30,002
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.

922
01:48:30,962 --> 01:48:33,631
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point then?

923
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:35,257
Precisely.

924
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,729
The carbon unit's information
cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe,

925
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:51,774
but only to V'Ger directly.

926
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:18,342
-Forward motion, Captain.
-Tractor beam.

927
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:38,863
Captain, what's the next move?

928
01:49:40,823 --> 01:49:44,077
The question is, Mr. Decker,
is there a next move?

929
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:49,289
Resume duty stations.

930
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:52,793
All personnel, resume stations!

931
01:49:58,132 --> 01:50:01,927
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems
my bluff has been called.

932
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:06,765
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

933
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:14,524
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

934
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,653
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark!

935
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,036
Captain, I believe that is our destination.

936
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:36,378
Forward motion, slowing, Captain.

937
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:44,429
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

938
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,188
Forward motion, stopped, Captain.

939
01:50:58,694 --> 01:51:00,319
V'Ger.

940
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:04,364
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

941
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:06,158
It's directly ahead.

942
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:09,912
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its Creator.

943
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:19,005
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger
with the required information.

944
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,472
Mr. Spock? Bones?

945
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:35,771
Mr. Decker, I will contact you
every five minutes.

946
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:41,610
Captain, I'd like to go along.

947
01:51:44,907 --> 01:51:47,115
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

948
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:42,814
V'Ger.

949
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,682
V-G-E-R.

950
01:55:01,686 --> 01:55:02,686
V'Ger.

951
01:55:16,659 --> 01:55:20,078
V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.

952
01:55:20,162 --> 01:55:21,372
Voyager!

953
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:27,420
Voyager VI!

954
01:55:27,503 --> 01:55:29,130
NASA.

955
01:55:29,213 --> 01:55:32,007
National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

956
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:36,345
Jim, this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

957
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,684
Voyager series,

958
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,604
designed to collect data

959
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:50,192
and transmit it back to Earth.

960
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:39,449
Captain, Voyager VI disappeared into
what they used to call a black hole.

961
01:56:39,826 --> 01:56:43,496
It must have emerged on
the far side of the galaxy

962
01:56:43,579 --> 01:56:46,707
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

963
01:56:46,792 --> 01:56:50,293
The machine inhabitants found
it to be one of their own kind.

964
01:56:50,378 --> 01:56:52,962
Primitive, yet kindred.

965
01:56:53,047 --> 01:56:56,341
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming.

966
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:59,595
"Collect all data possible."

967
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:01,305
"Learn all that is learnable."

968
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:08,729
-Return that information to its Creator.
-Precisely, Mr. Decker.

969
01:57:08,814 --> 01:57:12,858
The machines interpreted it literally.
They built this entire vessel

970
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:15,860
so that Voyager could actually fulfil
its programming.

971
01:57:16,904 --> 01:57:18,363
And on its journey back,

972
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:23,118
it amassed so much knowledge,

973
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:26,956
it achieved consciousness itself.

974
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,458
It became a living thing.

975
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:49,145
Kirk-unit. V'Ger awaits the information.

976
01:57:51,148 --> 01:57:55,693
Enterprise, order up
the ship's computer library of records

977
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:59,320
on the late 20th century
NASA probe, Voyager VI.

978
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:02,283
Specifically,
we want the old NASA code signal

979
01:58:02,367 --> 01:58:04,743
that instructs the
probe to transmit its data.

980
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:07,078
-And fast, Uhura, fast!
-Aye, sir.

981
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:11,458
That's what it's been signaling!
Its readiness to transmit its information!

982
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:13,002
And there's no one on Earth

983
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:15,712
who could recognize the old signal
and send a response.

984
01:58:15,796 --> 01:58:17,672
"The Creator does not answer."

985
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:29,435
V'Ger.

986
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,234
V'Ger.

987
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:40,320
V'Ger!

988
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:48,287
We are the Creator.

989
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:52,373
That is not logical.
Carbon units are not true life forms.

990
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:54,627
We will prove it.
We will make it possible

991
01:58:54,711 --> 01:58:57,671
for you to complete your programming.

992
01:58:57,756 --> 01:59:00,048
Only the Creator could accomplish that.

993
01:59:02,469 --> 01:59:03,802
Enterprise.

994
01:59:03,886 --> 01:59:06,721
We have just received the
response code, Captain.

995
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:09,140
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency

996
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,644
and transmit the code now!

997
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:14,063
Transmitting.

998
01:59:14,146 --> 01:59:19,025
5-0-4, 3-2-9,

999
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:23,823
3-1 -7, 5-1 -0,

1000
01:59:23,907 --> 01:59:25,990
and the final sequence...

1001
01:59:26,076 --> 01:59:28,409
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.

1002
01:59:41,257 --> 01:59:43,926
Voyager is not transmitting
its data, Captain.

1003
01:59:46,095 --> 01:59:48,221
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

1004
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:53,435
Uhura! Repeat the final sequence.

1005
01:59:58,358 --> 02:00:00,609
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

1006
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:24,091
Voyager is not transmitting, Captain,

1007
02:00:24,175 --> 02:00:27,136
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

1008
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,889
Jim! We're down to 10 minutes.

1009
02:00:29,972 --> 02:00:31,556
Enterprise, stand by.

1010
02:00:40,524 --> 02:00:44,069
-The antenna leads are melted away.
-Yes, Captain, just now.

1011
02:00:44,154 --> 02:00:47,780
-By V'Ger itself.
-Why?

1012
02:00:47,865 --> 02:00:49,867
To prevent reception.

1013
02:00:49,951 --> 02:00:56,457
Of course, to bring the Creator here
to finish transmitting the code in person.

1014
02:01:00,753 --> 02:01:03,005
To touch the Creator.

1015
02:01:04,673 --> 02:01:07,051
Capture God?

1016
02:01:07,135 --> 02:01:09,970
V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell
of a disappointment.

1017
02:01:10,055 --> 02:01:11,555
Perhaps not, Doctor.

1018
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:36,372
Captain.

1019
02:01:43,421 --> 02:01:45,005
V'Ger must evolve.

1020
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:47,466
Its knowledge has reached
the limits of this universe

1021
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,217
and it must evolve.

1022
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:52,554
What it requires of its God, Doctor,
is the answer to its question,

1023
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,139
"Is there nothing more?"

1024
02:01:54,224 --> 02:01:56,891
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

1025
02:01:56,976 --> 02:01:58,978
Other dimensions,
higher levels of being.

1026
02:01:59,061 --> 02:02:01,646
The existence of which cannot
be proven logically.

1027
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:04,984
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

1028
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:09,904
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve
is a human quality,

1029
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:11,823
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

1030
02:02:16,453 --> 02:02:18,997
And joining with its Creator
might accomplish that.

1031
02:02:19,082 --> 02:02:23,042
You mean, this machine wants
to physically join with a human?

1032
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:24,586
Is that possible?

1033
02:02:28,298 --> 02:02:29,632
Let's find out.

1034
02:02:38,768 --> 02:02:41,228
-Decker!
-I'm going to key the final sequence

1035
02:02:41,311 --> 02:02:42,520
through the ground test computer.

1036
02:02:42,604 --> 02:02:45,189
Decker, you don't know what
that'll do to you!

1037
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:46,608
Yes, I do, Doctor!

1038
02:02:53,615 --> 02:02:54,824
Decker, don't!

1039
02:02:54,908 --> 02:02:57,618
Jim, I want this.

1040
02:02:57,703 --> 02:03:01,372
As much as you wanted the Enterprise,
I want this.

1041
02:05:55,131 --> 02:05:56,340
Captain.

1042
02:05:58,134 --> 02:06:02,720
Spock, did we just see
the beginning of a new life form?

1043
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:06,057
Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth.

1044
02:06:06,141 --> 02:06:10,561
-Possibly, a next step in our evolution.
-I wonder.

1045
02:06:10,646 --> 02:06:13,481
Well, it's been a long time
since I delivered a baby,

1046
02:06:13,565 --> 02:06:15,775
and I hope we got this one off
to a good start.

1047
02:06:15,859 --> 02:06:18,362
I hope so, too.

1048
02:06:18,445 --> 02:06:23,951
I think we gave it the ability to create
its own sense of purpose

1049
02:06:24,034 --> 02:06:26,244
out of our own human weaknesses

1050
02:06:27,788 --> 02:06:30,373
and the drive that compels us
to overcome.

1051
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:34,252
And a lot of foolish human
emotions, right, Mr. Spock?

1052
02:06:34,337 --> 02:06:35,962
Quite true, Doctor.

1053
02:06:36,046 --> 02:06:39,925
Unfortunately, it will have to
deal with them as well.

1054
02:06:40,009 --> 02:06:41,760
Interrogative from Starfleet.

1055
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:43,720
They're requesting damage
and injury reports

1056
02:06:43,805 --> 02:06:45,389
and complete vessel status.

1057
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:47,765
Report two casualties.

1058
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:51,770
Lieutenant Ilia. Captain Decker.

1059
02:06:52,396 --> 02:06:55,481
-Aye, sir.
-Correction. They're not casualties.

1060
02:06:55,984 --> 02:06:57,484
They are...

1061
02:07:00,529 --> 02:07:01,947
List them as missing.

1062
02:07:03,198 --> 02:07:06,033
-Vessel status, fully operational.
-Aye, sir.

1063
02:07:07,369 --> 02:07:08,703
Mr. Scott!

1064
02:07:09,538 --> 02:07:12,373
Shall we give the Enterprise
a proper shakedown?

1065
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:15,460
I would say it's time for that, sir. Aye.

1066
02:07:15,545 --> 02:07:18,380
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

1067
02:07:18,672 --> 02:07:23,385
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.
My task on Vulcan is completed.

1068
02:07:24,886 --> 02:07:28,140
-Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1.
-Warp 1, sir.

1069
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:29,765
Heading, sir?

1070
02:07:33,979 --> 02:07:35,188
Out there.

1071
02:07:37,524 --> 02:07:40,524
Thataway.
