1
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,048
How does it feel to be back
on the Enterprise bridge, Captain Kirk?

2
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:15,022
- How do you feel?
- Excuse me.

3
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,575
There will be time
for questions later.

4
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:22,958
I'm Captain John Harriman
and I'd like to welcome you aboard.

5
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:30,055
We're excited to have a group of living
legends with us on our maiden voyage.

6
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:34,817
- I read about you in grade school.
- Oh, really?

7
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:43,418
- May we have a look around?
- Please.

8
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,100
Demora!

9
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:53,693
This is the first Enterprise without
you in command. What is that like?

10
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:58,955
- I'm glad to send her on her way.
- What have you been doing?

11
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:05,718
- Keeping busy.
- Give him a chance to look around.

12
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:17,122
Captain...

13
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,800
I'd like you to meet the helmsman
of the Enterprise-B. Demora?

14
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:27,269
Ensign Demora Sulu.

15
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,823
It's a pleasure to meet you. My father's
told me interesting stories about you.

16
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:42,464
- You father is Hikaru Sulu?
- You've met her before. 12 years ago.

17
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:47,772
12 years? Incredible.

18
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:54,618
Congratulations. No Enterprise is
complete without a Sulu at the helm.

19
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:59,215
- Hikaru must be very proud of you.
- I hope so.

20
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:06,772
- I was never that young.
- No...

21
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:10,658
You were younger.

22
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,587
- Damn fine ship, if you ask me.
- Scotty, it absolutely amazes me.

23
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:22,974
- What would that be, sir?
- When did Sulu find time for a family?

24
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:30,156
If something's important, you make
the time. Is that why you're so restless?

25
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:35,545
- Finding retirement a little lonely?
- I'm glad you're an engineer.

26
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,596
You'd make a lousy psychiatrist.

27
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:46,861
- Gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
- Yes, of course.

28
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:53,376
Aft thrusters ahead one quarter,
port and starboard at station keeping.

29
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:59,055
Captain Kirk, I'd be honoured
if you'd give the order to get underway.

30
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:05,236
- Thank you very much, I...
- Please, sir... Please, I insist.

31
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:18,727
Take us out.

32
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:29,333
- Very good, sir.
- Brought a tear to my eye.

33
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:54,679
Now that you've seen the ship,
how does it feel to be back?

34
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:57,231
Fine, fine.

35
00:06:57,442 --> 00:07:05,242
We've just cleared the asteroid belt.
Today, we'll go beyond Pluto and back.

36
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,006
- Just a quick run around the block.
- Will you test the warp drive system?

37
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,978
We're picking up a distress call,
Captain.

38
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,200
On speakers.

39
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,665
This is the transport ship Lakul. We're
caught in some energy distortion.

40
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:30,010
Two ships in our... trapped
in a severe gravimetric distortion.

41
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:36,981
We can't break free, we need help.
It's tearing us apart.

42
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:41,995
The Lakul is one of two ships
flying El Aurian refugees to Earth.

43
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,422
- Can you locate them?
- They are bearing at 310/205.

44
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:52,434
Distance: Three light years.

45
00:07:55,531 --> 00:08:00,494
Signal the closest starship. We're
in no condition to mount a rescue.

46
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:07,467
- We don't have a full crew aboard.
- We're the only one in range, sir.

47
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:18,492
Well, then.
I guess it's up to us.

48
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:24,838
Helm, lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp.

49
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:37,618
Captain, is there something wrong
with your chair?

50
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:48,100
We're within visual range
of the energy distortion, Captain.

51
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:51,276
On screen.

52
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,581
What the hell is that?

53
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:02,341
I've located the transport ships.

54
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:07,352
Their hulls can't take the stress.
They won't survive much longer.

55
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:17,373
We're encountering severe gravimetric
distortions from the energy ribbon.

56
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:23,219
- We'll have to keep our distance.
- Tractor beam...

57
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:29,733
We don't have one.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.

58
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:33,579
Ensign Sulu...

59
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:40,092
Generate a subspace field around
the ships. That might break them free.

60
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:44,686
- Too much quantum interference, sir.
- What about...

61
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,824
Vent plasma from the warp nacelles.
That might disrupt the ribbon's hold.

62
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,339
- It's not having any effect...
- The starboard vessel is collapsing!

63
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,029
- How many people were on that ship?
- 265.

64
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:20,014
Sir, the Lakul's hull integrity
is down to 12%.

65
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:33,292
Captain Kirk, I'd appreciate
any suggestions you might have.

66
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:39,264
- Move us in and beam them aboard.
- The distortions will tear us apart.

67
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,900
Risk is part of the game.

68
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:47,243
- Close to within transporter range.
- And turn that damn thing off!

69
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,516
- We're within range.
- Beam them directly to sickbay.

70
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:03,277
- How big is your medical staff?
- It... doesn't arrive until Tuesday.

71
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:10,624
- You and you are now nurses.
- The warp plasma relays are unstable.

72
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:17,390
I can't lock on to them.
They are in some sort of temporal flux.

73
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:27,120
Their life signs are phasing in
and out of our space-time continuum.

74
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,759
- Their hull's collapsing!
- Beam them out, Scotty!

75
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:41,656
Transport complete.

76
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:51,677
I got 47... out of 150.

77
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:10,386
- Report!
- We're caught in a gravimetric field.

78
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:12,519
Full reverse!

79
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:22,914
We're going to help you.

80
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,717
- Everything is fine.
- Why? Why?

81
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:36,232
- You're safe here on the Enterprise.
- No, I have to go back.

82
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,455
You don't understand.
Let me go back. Let me go back!

83
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,966
Let me go back. Please!

84
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:52,604
- What was he talking about?
- I have no idea.

85
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,954
Can I help you?

86
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:06,217
It's going to be okay.
You just need to rest.

87
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:15,031
You can't disrupt
this big a gravimetric field.

88
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:20,666
- Hull integrity at 82%.
- But I do have a theory.

89
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:26,804
An anti-matter discharge ahead might
disrupt the field so we can escape.

90
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:32,276
- Photon torpedo.
- Fire torpedo at my command.

91
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:37,872
- We don't have any.
- Don't tell me... Tuesday?

92
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,173
40%.

93
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:45,931
A resonance burst from the deflector
dish could simulate a torpedo blast.

94
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:53,155
- Where are the deflector relays?
- I'll go. You have the bridge.

95
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,803
Wait.

96
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:07,062
Your place is on the bridge
of your ship. I'll take care of it.

97
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,959
- Keep things together until I get back.
- I always do.

98
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:27,534
- 45 seconds to structural collapse.
- Bridge to Captain Kirk.

99
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,466
- Kirk here.
- I can't hold her together much longer.

100
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,827
Let's go!

101
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:48,415
Activate main deflector.

102
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,186
We're breaking free.

103
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:19,650
It's all right. I'm increasing power
to compensate.

104
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:24,036
- We're clear.
- You did it, Kirk! Damage report.

105
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,172
Buckling on the starboard nacelle
and a hull breach in Engineering.

106
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:33,807
- Emergency force fields in place.
- Where?

107
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:39,236
Sections 20-28
on decks 13, 14...

108
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,706
...and 15.

109
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:49,925
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Captain Kirk, please respond.

110
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:59,030
Have Chekov meet me on deck 15.

111
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:28,973
My God! Was anyone in here?

112
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,277
Aye.

113
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:45,395
Bring out the prisoner.

114
00:18:55,964 --> 00:19:01,428
Mr Worf. I knew this day would come.
Are you prepared to face the charges?

115
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:05,148
Answer him.

116
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:09,949
I am prepared.

117
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:16,921
"We, the officers and crew
of the U.S.S. Enterprise -

118
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:21,640
- hereby make the following charges
against Lieutenant Worf."

119
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:30,280
"That he did wilfully perform above the
call of duty on countless occasions."

120
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:36,714
"Most seriously: That he has earned
the admiration of the entire crew."

121
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:41,185
I hereby promote you
to Lieutenant Commander -

122
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:47,780
- with all the rights and privileges
thereto. May God have mercy on you.

123
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,848
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

124
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:03,024
- Congratulations.
- Extend the plank.

125
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:14,301
Lower the Badge of Office.

126
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:19,899
He'll never make it. No one ever has.

127
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:49,797
I've learned never
to underestimate a Klingon.

128
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:58,440
Computer, remove the plank.

129
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:14,432
Number One, that's retract plank,
not remove plank.

130
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,698
Sorry.

131
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:32,470
I am uncertain as to why someone
falling into freezing water is amusing.

132
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:38,695
- It's all in good fun, Data.
- Fun? I do not understand.

133
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:45,336
Get into the spirit of things.
Be spontaneous, live in the moment.

134
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:49,179
- Do something unexpected. Get it?
- Got it.

135
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:17,199
Data. That was not funny.

136
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,090
All hands, make sail. T'gansuls
and courses, stand by the braces.

137
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:28,434
Will.

138
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:35,658
Just imagine what it was like.
No engines, no computers.

139
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:41,544
Just the wind and the sea
and the stars to guide you.

140
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,809
- Bad food, brutal discipline, no women.
- Bridge to Captain Picard.

141
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:54,532
- A personal message from Earth.
- Put it through down here.

142
00:22:54,747 --> 00:23:01,462
The best thing was that no one could
reach you. This was freedom, Will.

143
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:06,603
Computer, arch.

144
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,866
Look alive there.

145
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:28,610
Take the wheel.

146
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,247
Captain, are you all right?

147
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:58,133
Yes, I'm fine...
Excuse me.

148
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:03,229
Computer, exit.

149
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:13,083
- Set royals and stunsuls.
- What's a stunsul, sir?

150
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:18,595
- Just above that last yardarm...
- Bridge to Halodeck 3.

151
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:24,357
The Amargosa observatory needs help.
They say they are under attack.

152
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:28,202
Red alert! All hands to battle
stations. Captain Picard to the bridge.

153
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:45,949
- We're too late.
- There are no other ships here.

154
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:52,585
- The observatory took quite a beating.
- Survivors?

155
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:58,142
- Sensors show five life signs aboard.
- The station's complement was 19.

156
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:03,865
Stand down from red alert.

157
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:08,250
Number One...

158
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:16,223
Begin an investigation.
Make it so... Just do it!

159
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:22,573
- Mr Worf.
- Aye, sir.

160
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,821
Worf.

161
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:47,290
- It looks like a type-3 disrupter.
- Romulan, Breen or Klingon.

162
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,815
Over here!

163
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:39,453
It's all right. Do not struggle.

164
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,727
It's okay. We're right here.

165
00:26:57,957 --> 00:27:02,586
I'm Commander William Riker
from the Starship Enterprise.

166
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:06,888
Doctor Tolian Soran.

167
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:13,692
- Who attacked you, Doctor?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

168
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,620
Take a look at this.

169
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,006
Romulans.

170
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,559
What possessed you
to push her in the water?

171
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:49,776
I was attempting
to get into the spirit of things.

172
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:54,787
I thought it would be amusing.

173
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,381
- Is she still angry?
- You'd better stay away from her.

174
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,836
Data, you're not thinking
about using that thing, are you?

175
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,803
I have for many months.

176
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:25,812
In light of my recent episode,
now may be the appropriate time.

177
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:31,326
- It may overload your neural net.
- That is true.

178
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:38,840
However, my growth as an artificial
life form has reached an impasse.

179
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:43,521
For 34 years I've endeavoured
to become more "human", -

180
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:47,489
- to grow beyond my programming.

181
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:54,126
Still, I am unable to grasp
such a basic concept as humour.

182
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:59,848
This emotion chip
may be the only answer.

183
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,760
Geordi.

184
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:19,769
All right.

185
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:37,599
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll deactivate it. Agreed?

186
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:41,236
Agreed.

187
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:52,797
We found two dead Romulans. We'll
try to establish what ship they're from.

188
00:29:53,014 --> 00:29:59,521
- But why did they attack the station?
- They practically tore the place apart.

189
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:05,786
Accessed the computer, turned the
place inside out, looking for something.

190
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:11,465
This could signify
a new Romulan threat in this sector.

191
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,772
- Inform Starfleet Command.
- You want me to contact Starfleet?

192
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:22,491
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

193
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,296
One of the scientists, a Dr Soran,
insisted on speaking with you.

194
00:30:29,512 --> 00:30:34,142
I told him you were busy,
but he said it was imperative.

195
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,236
Understood. That will be all.

196
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:50,094
- Sir, is there anything?
- No, thank you.

197
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:11,266
Gentlemen. Something new
from Frocas Three.

198
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,831
What?

199
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:23,796
This beverage has produced
an emotional response.

200
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:29,097
- What are you feeling?
- I am uncertain.

201
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:34,443
I've had little experience with emotion
and can't articulate the sensation.

202
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:40,749
- Emotion?
- I'll explain later.

203
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:48,598
- It looks like he hates it.
- Yes, that is it.

204
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:53,903
- I hate this.
- Data, I think the chip is working.

205
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:02,005
- I hate this. It is revolting.
- More?

206
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:15,911
I'm looking for a Dr Soran
from the observatory.

207
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:31,276
Dr Soran. I understand there's
something urgent you wish to discuss.

208
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:38,751
I must return and continue a critical
experiment on the Amargosa Star.

209
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:45,100
When our investigation is complete,
you and your colleagues can return.

210
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:51,072
- Until then, there's nothing I can do.
- Timing is crucial to my experiments.

211
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:56,292
If it's not completed in 12 hours,
years of research will be lost.

212
00:32:56,508 --> 00:33:00,053
We're doing the best we can.

213
00:33:01,686 --> 00:33:06,065
They say time is the fire
in which we burn.

214
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:14,792
Right now, my time is running out.

215
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:21,139
We leave so many things
unfinished in our lives.

216
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:25,609
I know you understand.

217
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:31,163
I'll see what I can do.

218
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,344
We've studied the Romulans' tricorder.

219
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:19,770
They were scanning for signature
particles of the compound trilithium.

220
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:25,200
It's an experiment the Romulans have
been working on, a nuclear inhibitor.

221
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:31,795
It could stop all fusion within a star,
but the Romulans haven't stabilised it.

222
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:35,975
Why look for it
on a Federation observatory?

223
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:40,026
- I do not know.
- Send Geordi and Data over there.

224
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,202
Tell them to scan for trilithium.

225
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:53,178
There's no sign
of any trilithium over here.

226
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:04,997
- I get it! I get it!
- You get what?

227
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:09,925
When you said to Riker:
"The clown can stay, -

228
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,312
- but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit
has to go."

229
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:23,117
During the Farpoint mission. You told
a joke, and that was the punch line.

230
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:29,467
- That was seven years ago.
- I know. I just got it!

231
00:35:30,602 --> 00:35:34,314
Very funny.

232
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:57,404
Wait. There's a hidden door.
I can see the separation with my visor.

233
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,959
There's a dampening field in operation.
I can't scan beyond the bulkhead.

234
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:11,267
- No control panel or access port.
- It must be magnetically sealed.

235
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:17,199
I can reverse the polarity
by attenuating my axial servo.

236
00:36:22,593 --> 00:36:26,055
Open, Sesame.

237
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:37,453
You could say
I have a magnetic personality.

238
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,090
Humour, I love it!

239
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:05,307
Data, come take a look at this.

240
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,072
Have you ever seen a solar probe
like this?

241
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:15,330
No, Geordi, I have not. Have you?

242
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:19,840
No, it is most unusual.

243
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:22,891
Mr Tricorder.

244
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:29,693
- Just help me get these panels open.
- Make it so.

245
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:42,139
My visor's picking up something in
the theta band. A trilithium signature?

246
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:50,615
- We don't have time for this.
- I can't help it. Something is wrong.

247
00:37:57,638 --> 00:38:00,224
Data?

248
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,581
Data, are you all right?

249
00:38:15,303 --> 00:38:19,515
The emotion chip has overloaded
my positronic relay.

250
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,276
We'd better get you back.
LaForge to Enterprise.

251
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:32,584
- LaForge to Enterprise.
- Is there a problem?

252
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,349
The dampening field is blocking
our Com signal. Can you shut it off?

253
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:42,735
I'd be only too happy to.

254
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:57,100
Please...

255
00:38:57,313 --> 00:39:01,901
Do not hurt me. Please.

256
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:26,666
Yes, come.

257
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,009
Yes? Is there something
I can do for you?

258
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:36,186
- Can I do anything for you?
- It's just family matters.

259
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:44,621
You never met my brother
and his wife, did you?

260
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:47,923
Robert.

261
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:56,270
So opinionated. Pompous and arrogant.
He always had to have the last word.

262
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:02,828
But he mellowed a little bit
in the last few years.

263
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:09,801
I was going to meet them next month
and maybe go to San Francisco.

264
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:16,357
- Rene wants to see Starfleet Academy.
- Rene? Oh, your nephew.

265
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:20,745
He's so unlike his father.

266
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,462
He's a dreamer. Imaginative...

267
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:31,685
He's so very gentle.

268
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:41,249
What's happened?

269
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:45,467
Robert and Rene...

270
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:51,062
...burned to death in a fire.

271
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:57,075
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. These things happen.

272
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:01,711
Captain, it's not all right.

273
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:10,225
I can't help think about all the
experiences Rene's not going to have.

274
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:17,701
Not going to the Academy,
listening to music and falling in love.

275
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,511
Building a life.

276
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:30,858
Well, it's not going to happen now.

277
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:37,958
I didn't realise
he meant so much to you.

278
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:43,804
Rene was as close as I would get
to having a child of my own.

279
00:41:56,296 --> 00:42:01,343
Your family history
is very important to you, isn't it?

280
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:12,908
From being a boy, I can remember
hearing about the family line.

281
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:19,007
The Picard who fought at Trafalgar.
The Picard who won the Nobel Prize.

282
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:24,060
The Picards who settled
the first Martian colonies.

283
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:31,367
When Robert married
and he had a son, I...

284
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:37,633
You felt it wasn't your responsibility
to carry on the family line.

285
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:43,855
Right. That's it exactly.

286
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:54,750
Recently I've become aware that there
are fewer days ahead than behind.

287
00:42:54,969 --> 00:43:01,976
But I took some comfort from the fact
that the family would go on.

288
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:10,582
But now there'll be no more Picards.

289
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:26,702
- Report.
- A quantum implosion in Amargosa.

290
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:32,046
- All nuclear fusion is breaking down.
- How is that possible?

291
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,640
The observatory launched a solar
probe into the sun a few moments ago.

292
00:43:36,854 --> 00:43:42,610
- The star will collapse in minutes.
- It has produced a level 12 shock wave.

293
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:49,792
- That'll destroy this entire system.
- I can't locate LaForge or Data.

294
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:53,804
- Have they returned?
- No.

295
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:00,609
- When will the wave hit it?
- In four minutes, 40 seconds.

296
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:18,401
Soran, transmit your co-ordinates.

297
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:35,565
What the hell's he doing?

298
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:40,908
- You have two minutes left.
- You hear that, Soran?

299
00:44:41,122 --> 00:44:45,377
We've got a level 12 shock wave
coming in. We must get out of here!

300
00:44:47,805 --> 00:44:53,811
Sir, a Klingon "Bird of Prey"
is de-cloaking off the port bow.

301
00:45:08,058 --> 00:45:14,690
- Data, see if you can get to Geordi.
- I cannot, sir.

302
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,872
Report for transport.

303
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:38,411
- Commander Riker's team is aboard.
- Warp one, engage!

304
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:54,826
You've done it, Soran.

305
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,972
Wait!

306
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:23,511
I hope for your sake
you were initiating a mating ritual.

307
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:28,940
You got careless. The Romulans
came looking for their trilithium.

308
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:34,244
Impossible. We left no survivors
on their outpost.

309
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:40,465
If the Enterprise hadn't intervened,
they'd have found it at the observatory.

310
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:45,686
They didn't find it! And now
we have a weapon of unlimited power.

311
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:52,033
No, Lursa. I have the weapon,
and if you want me to give it to you, -

312
00:46:52,249 --> 00:46:57,295
- I would advise you to be
a little more careful in the future.

313
00:46:57,511 --> 00:47:01,014
Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

314
00:47:01,227 --> 00:47:06,274
Without my research,
the trilithium is worthless.

315
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:12,704
As are your plans
to re-conquer the Klingon Empire.

316
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,934
Set course for the Veridian system.
Maximum warp.

317
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:33,460
He's an El Aurian. Over 300 years old.
He lost his entire family -

318
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:40,140
- when the Borg destroyed his planet.
He escaped aboard the ship "Lakul".

319
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:44,361
That ship was later destroyed
by an energy ribbon.

320
00:47:44,574 --> 00:47:48,745
But Soran and 46 others were
rescued by the Enterprise-B.

321
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:53,797
- That was when James Kirk was killed.
- I checked the Lakul's passenger list.

322
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:57,850
Guess who else was on board?

323
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:05,656
- I haven't thought of Soran in ages.
- You remember him?

324
00:48:07,877 --> 00:48:12,965
Guinan, you must tell me
everything that you know.

325
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:18,768
We think Soran has developed
a terrible weapon -

326
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:21,737
- with enough power to destroy...

327
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:28,247
Soran doesn't care about weapons.
He just wants to get back to the nexus.

328
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:32,218
What the nexus?

329
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:39,230
The energy ribbon was not a random
phenomenon travelling through space.

330
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:43,743
It's a doorway to another place
that we call the nexus.

331
00:48:43,998 --> 00:48:47,627
A place I've tried hard to forget.

332
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:58,151
What happened to you?

333
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:04,957
It was like being inside joy.

334
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:12,094
As if joy was a blanket
you could wrap yourself up in.

335
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:17,358
Never in my entire life
have I ever been as content.

336
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:23,914
- And then you were beamed away.
- Pulled. Ripped away.

337
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:31,971
None of us wanted to go. I would
have done anything to get back there.

338
00:49:35,364 --> 00:49:38,950
But I realised it wasn't possible.

339
00:49:39,163 --> 00:49:46,462
- What about Soran?
- If he's still obsessed, he's dangerous.

340
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:49,767
Why would he destroy a star?

341
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:58,160
Thank you, Guinan.

342
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:06,800
If you go,
you're not going to care about anything.

343
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:15,527
Not this ship, not Soran, nothing.
You'll just want to stay in the nexus.

344
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:23,130
And you're not going
to want to come back.

345
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:42,339
Marvellous technology. This is
a remarkable piece of equipment.

346
00:50:42,555 --> 00:50:49,229
- I'm glad you approve.
- Not very stylish, though.

347
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:57,038
Have you ever considered a prosthesis
that would make you look...

348
00:50:57,296 --> 00:51:00,341
...more normal?

349
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:06,560
- What's normal?
- That's a good question.

350
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:11,281
Normal is what everyone else is
and you are not.

351
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:18,755
Get down to it. What do you want?

352
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:23,933
As you may be aware,
I am an El Aurian.

353
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,402
We are a race of listeners. We listen.

354
00:51:29,744 --> 00:51:34,749
Right now you have
my complete attention.

355
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:39,843
I want to listen to everything
you know about trilithium.

356
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:47,195
Captain's log, Stardate 48632.4.

357
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:53,123
Data's emotion chip has been fused
into his neural net.

358
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:58,552
However, he is fit for duty and is
joining me in Stellar Cartography.

359
00:51:59,853 --> 00:52:04,065
The ribbon is a conflux
of temporal energy -

360
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,576
- which travels through here
every 39.1 years.

361
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:12,459
It will pass through this sector
in 42 hours.

362
00:52:12,673 --> 00:52:17,469
Guinan was right. Soran is
trying to get back to the ribbon.

363
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:21,813
What's the connection
with the Amargosa star?

364
00:52:22,027 --> 00:52:28,450
Give me a list of anything that was
affected by the star's destruction.

365
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:32,880
- Data?
- Sorry, sir.

366
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:40,520
It will take the computer a few
moments to compile the information.

367
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:46,910
Data, are you all right?

368
00:52:48,086 --> 00:52:54,425
No, sir. I am finding it
difficult to concentrate.

369
00:52:54,642 --> 00:53:00,439
I am overwhelmed
with feelings of remorse...

370
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:06,411
...regret concerning my actions
at the observatory.

371
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:14,677
I wanted to save Geordi, but
experienced something unexpected.

372
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,779
Fear. I was afraid.

373
00:53:25,461 --> 00:53:31,216
The destruction of the star has had
the following effects in this sector.

374
00:53:31,432 --> 00:53:36,062
Gamma emissions
have increased by.05%.

375
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:41,323
The starship Bozeman altered course.
Ambient magnetic fields...

376
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,959
Wait. Why would the Bozeman
alter course?

377
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:50,301
The destruction of the star has altered
the gravitational forces in the sector.

378
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:55,855
Any ship passing through would have
to make a minor course correction.

379
00:53:56,071 --> 00:54:01,493
Minor course correction...
Where's the ribbon now?

380
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:14,856
- This is its current position.
- Can you project its course?

381
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:21,707
Captain...

382
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:31,475
I can't go on. I wish to be deactivated
until the emotion chip can be removed.

383
00:54:31,692 --> 00:54:38,908
- Are you having a malfunction?
- No, I just can't control these emotions.

384
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:44,798
I have nothing but sympathy for what
you are feeling, but right now...

385
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:51,144
I no longer want these emotions!
Deactivating me is the only solution.

386
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:57,992
Part of having feelings is learning
to live with them, Data.

387
00:54:58,209 --> 00:55:02,422
You will not be deactivated.

388
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:09,101
I require you to perform your duty
as an officer. That is an order!

389
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,329
I will try, sir.

390
00:55:19,298 --> 00:55:27,097
Sometimes it takes courage to try.
Courage can be an emotion, too.

391
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:33,530
- Can you project the ribbon's course?
- I believe so.

392
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:40,926
Enhance Grid 9-A.

393
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:46,187
Where was the Amargosa star?

394
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:53,326
The destruction of the star affected
the gravitational forces in this sector.

395
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:57,629
Did the computer project
the ribbon's course accordingly?

396
00:55:57,843 --> 00:56:02,806
No, sir. I'll make
the appropriate adjustments.

397
00:56:04,149 --> 00:56:07,819
Soran's changing
the course of the ribbon.

398
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:15,789
But why change its path?
Why not fly into it with a ship?

399
00:56:16,718 --> 00:56:23,224
Every ship that has approached the
ribbon has been destroyed or damaged.

400
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:29,408
He's trying to make the ribbon
come to him.

401
00:56:29,622 --> 00:56:35,794
- Does it pass any M-class planets?
- Yes, sir.

402
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:42,768
- There are two in the Veridian system.
- Veridian 3 isn't close enough.

403
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:51,035
Would the ribbon's course be affected
if Soran destroyed the Veridian star?

404
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:58,809
That's where he's going.

405
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:03,859
The collapse of the Veridian star
would produce a shock wave -

406
00:57:04,074 --> 00:57:07,119
- similar to the one at Amargosa.

407
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:12,128
Destroying all planets in this system.

408
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:15,679
Veridian 3 is uninhabited.

409
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:20,104
However, Veridian 4 supports
a pre-industrial humanoid society.

410
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,614
Population?

411
00:57:23,826 --> 00:57:28,539
230 million, sir.

412
00:57:29,505 --> 00:57:36,095
Picard to bridge. Set a course for
the Veridian system, maximum warp.

413
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:07,081
- Did you get anything from the human?
- No. His heart just wasn't in it.

414
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:13,389
We have entered orbit
of Veridian 3.

415
00:58:13,604 --> 00:58:20,611
- Prepare to transport me there.
- When do we get our payment?

416
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:34,310
This contains all the information
you need to make a trilithium weapon.

417
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:39,906
It's been coded.
Once I'm safely to the surface, -

418
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:44,626
- I'll transmit the decryption
sequence to you.

419
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,804
- A Federation starship is approaching.
- What? On viewer.

420
00:58:51,982 --> 00:58:56,611
- They're hailing us.
- They can't see us.

421
00:58:56,826 --> 00:59:03,582
Klingon vessel. We'll crush any probe
launched toward the Veridian star.

422
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:08,178
Return our chief engineer
and leave this system immediately.

423
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:11,688
There's no time for this.
Eliminate them.

424
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:16,030
That's a galaxy class starship.
We're no match for them.

425
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:22,587
It's time we gave
Mr LaForge his sight back.

426
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,155
Maybe they're not out there.

427
00:59:34,368 --> 00:59:39,790
They're trying to decide if a 20-year-old
Klingon ship can beat our flagship.

428
00:59:40,005 --> 00:59:43,425
Perhaps they're on the surface.

429
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,976
A solar probe launched
from the Klingon ship or the planet -

430
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:52,778
- will reach the sun in 11 seconds.
Since we don't have a point of origin -

431
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:59,916
- it'll take us 8-15 seconds
to lock our weapons onto it.

432
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:04,680
- When will the ribbon arrive?
- In 47 minutes.

433
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:11,651
- We must get to Soran.
- Klingon vessel de-cloaking ahead.

434
01:00:15,585 --> 01:00:19,380
- They are hailing.
- On screen.

435
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:25,767
- What an unexpected pleasure.
- I must speak with Soran.

436
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,986
He is no longer aboard our ship.

437
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,662
- Then I will beam to his location.
- The doctor values his privacy.

438
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:39,341
He would be alarmed if
an armed away team interrupted him.

439
01:00:39,555 --> 01:00:45,478
- Then I'll beam to your ship.
- They might kill you.

440
01:00:45,693 --> 01:00:51,991
- Your engineer is a guest of ours.
- Then return him!

441
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,379
- In exchange for what?
- Me, sir.

442
01:00:56,593 --> 01:01:03,934
Me. I'll be your prisoner. But first
beam me to where Soran is.

443
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:10,741
The captain would make
a much more valuable hostage.

444
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:17,757
- We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
- Agreed.

445
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:23,147
Have Dr Crusher meet me
in Transporter Room 3.

446
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:33,169
- Receiving the co-ordinates.
- Energise.

447
01:02:08,336 --> 01:02:12,090
Welcome, Captain.

448
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:25,075
- You must think me a madman.
- The thought had crossed my mind.

449
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:31,047
I know why you're here. You're not sure
you can shoot down my probe.

450
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:37,394
So you've come to dissuade me
from my horrific plan. Good luck.

451
01:02:38,529 --> 01:02:43,451
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm rather busy.

452
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:46,293
Soran...

453
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:58,441
That's a 50-gigawatt force field.
I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

454
01:02:58,657 --> 01:03:04,621
- I have established the link.
- Put it on viewer.

455
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:10,304
It's working. The visor's transmitting.

456
01:03:10,517 --> 01:03:12,769
Where is he?

457
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:26,255
Human females are so repulsive.

458
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,766
There's myocardial degeneration.
I've removed the nano-probe -

459
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:37,486
- and you'll be fine.
I need to run some more tests.

460
01:03:40,793 --> 01:03:46,548
- Data, it's okay.
- I am sorry I let you down.

461
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:52,437
- I have not been behaving like myself.
- No, you haven't.

462
01:03:52,653 --> 01:03:57,282
You've been behaving like a human.

463
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,541
Don't do it. We can find another way
of getting you into this nexus.

464
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:25,763
I've spent 80 years
looking for another way.

465
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:29,773
Believe me, this is the only one.

466
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:40,211
What you're doing is just as bad as
when the Borg destroyed your world.

467
01:04:40,468 --> 01:04:47,892
They killed millions, too.
Including your wife and children.

468
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:58,002
Nice try.

469
01:05:02,142 --> 01:05:08,940
There was a time when I wouldn't
hurt a fly. Then the Borg came.

470
01:05:09,157 --> 01:05:16,164
They showed me that there is
one constant in this universe... death.

471
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:25,392
We're all going to die sometime.
It's just a question of how and when.

472
01:05:25,611 --> 01:05:32,159
You will too, Captain. Aren't you
beginning to feel time gaining on you?

473
01:05:35,341 --> 01:05:39,762
Like a predator, it's stalking you.

474
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:46,860
You can try and outrun it with doctors,
medicines, new technologies, -

475
01:05:47,116 --> 01:05:52,205
- but time will hunt you down
and make the kill.

476
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:57,300
Our mortality defines us.
It's part of the truth of our existence.

477
01:06:00,939 --> 01:06:06,570
- I found a new truth.
- The nexus?

478
01:06:06,786 --> 01:06:12,083
Time has no meaning there.
The predator has no teeth.

479
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:20,434
- Where is he now?
- He bathed. Now he's roaming the ship.

480
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:26,115
He's the only engineer in Starfleet
who doesn't go to Engineering.

481
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:31,043
- Any luck?
- I cannot locate the captain.

482
01:06:32,636 --> 01:06:38,683
The sensors can't reach the planet.
Can you scan for life forms?

483
01:06:38,899 --> 01:06:45,530
I'd be happy to, sir. I just love
scanning for life forms.

484
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:50,004
Life forms...

485
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:53,761
you tiny little life forms

486
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:59,730
you precious little life forms
where are you?

487
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,007
Finally.

488
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:16,016
I'll run a diagnostic on the port plasma
relays. The generator's fluctuating.

489
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,401
Fine.

490
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:33,099
That's it!
Replay from time index 924.

491
01:07:39,618 --> 01:07:41,954
Magnify this section and enhance.

492
01:07:47,344 --> 01:07:54,893
- Shield modulation: 257.4.
- Adjust torpedo frequency to match.

493
01:08:05,509 --> 01:08:10,180
- They've penetrated our shields.
- Lock phasers and return fire!

494
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:23,375
- Take the helm. Get us out of orbit!
- Hull breach on decks 31-35.

495
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:35,736
- Any weaknesses in that old ship?
- It's a Class D-12 Bird of Prey.

496
01:08:35,952 --> 01:08:40,916
- Notorious for defective plasma coils.
- Can we take advantage of that?

497
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:45,551
I don't see how. The plasma coil
is part of their cloaking device.

498
01:08:51,278 --> 01:08:55,699
Get a stabiliser on that conduit.

499
01:08:55,913 --> 01:09:00,334
Reinforce starboard interlock. Re-route
power through secondary coupling.

500
01:09:00,757 --> 01:09:05,929
Data, would a defective plasma coil
be susceptible to an ionic pulse?

501
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:13,485
Yes, it might reset the coil and trigger
their cloaking device. Excellent idea!

502
01:09:14,998 --> 01:09:19,586
- Then their shields will drop.
- They'll be vulnerable for two seconds.

503
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,804
- Lock on the plasma coil.
- No problem.

504
01:09:26,273 --> 01:09:31,028
- Our shields are holding.
- Fire at will.

505
01:09:31,242 --> 01:09:36,664
Prepare a spread of photon torpedoes.
We must hit them when they cloak.

506
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,633
Target their primary reactor.

507
01:09:44,856 --> 01:09:49,486
- I'm initiating ionic pulse.
- Make it quick!

508
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:03,058
- Target their bridge.
- We are cloaking.

509
01:10:03,273 --> 01:10:06,943
Our shields are down!

510
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:11,079
Fire!

511
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:44,780
Yes!

512
01:11:28,253 --> 01:11:32,049
Haven't you got anything better to do?

513
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:20,069
It must have been that last torpedo.
It ruptured the magnetic interlocks.

514
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:29,801
Coolant leak!
Let's get out of here. Move!

515
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:38,362
Bridge, we're five minutes
from a warp core breach.

516
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:46,587
Evacuate everyone to the saucer
section. Prepare to separate the ship.

517
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:54,065
Starship separation in five minutes.

518
01:13:10,314 --> 01:13:14,027
Let's move him out.

519
01:13:16,704 --> 01:13:20,416
Starship separation in 4 minutes,
30 seconds.

520
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:31,230
Starship separation in 4 minutes,
15 seconds.

521
01:13:32,197 --> 01:13:35,158
Farrell!

522
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:39,208
Get these kids to the W-tube.
We'll find the parents later.

523
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,179
Starship separation in four minutes.

524
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:16,751
You'll have to excuse me.

525
01:14:16,964 --> 01:14:22,136
I have an appointment with eternity
and I don't want to be late.

526
01:14:38,136 --> 01:14:42,724
The core breach is accelerating.
We must get out.

527
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:47,276
- We're all out.
- One minute to warp core breach.

528
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:51,953
Begin separation sequence.
Full impulse power once we're clear.

529
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:12,289
Separation complete.
Core breach in progress.

530
01:15:19,729 --> 01:15:24,317
Primary stabilisers off-line.
Engaging secondary systems.

531
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:32,377
- Report!
- Helm controls are off-line!

532
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,689
Oh, shooot...

533
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:50,467
I've re-routed auxiliary power
to lateral thrusters to level our descent.

534
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,352
Brace for impact!

535
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:01,242
- Hold on tight.
- Hold their heads.

536
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:54,789
I'm okay.

537
01:22:25,137 --> 01:22:29,683
What is this? Where am I?

538
01:22:45,975 --> 01:22:49,145
- Surprise!
- We love you, Father.

539
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:54,446
- Were you scared?
- I helped decorate the tree.

540
01:22:54,662 --> 01:22:59,625
- Say Merry Christmas, Papa.
- I love you, Father.

541
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,429
Move back
and give your father some room.

542
01:23:17,044 --> 01:23:22,884
- Cup of Earl Grey?
- That would be perfect.

543
01:23:29,323 --> 01:23:34,119
- This one's for you.
- Thank you, Rene.

544
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:40,465
- Merry Christmas, Uncle.
- Rene, can you help me with the table?

545
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:43,935
Rene!

546
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:47,109
Come here.

547
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:07,360
Go help your aunt.

548
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:51,592
This isn't right. This can't be real.

549
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:59,773
- It's as real as you want it to be.
- Guinan. What's going on?

550
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:04,998
- Why am I here?
- You're in the nexus.

551
01:26:05,212 --> 01:26:11,010
- This is the nexus?
- For you. This is what you wanted.

552
01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:16,897
But... I never had a home like this.

553
01:26:20,538 --> 01:26:24,834
Nor a wife and children.
But these are all mine.

554
01:26:27,428 --> 01:26:33,142
What are you doing here? I thought
you were aboard the Enterprise.

555
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:41,784
I am. I'm also here. Think of me
as an echo of the person you know.

556
01:26:42,002 --> 01:26:48,133
- A part of herself she left behind.
- When the Enterprise-B saved you...

557
01:26:48,976 --> 01:26:54,148
- Help me build my castle.
- I will in a few minutes.

558
01:26:54,864 --> 01:27:01,830
Papa, thank you for the dolly.
She's very beautiful.

559
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:09,683
These are my children...
These are my children!

560
01:27:09,898 --> 01:27:16,196
Of course. Time has no meaning here.
You can go back and see them born, -

561
01:27:16,455 --> 01:27:21,543
- or go forward
and see your grandchildren.

562
01:27:21,759 --> 01:27:24,720
Dinner's ready.

563
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,610
Dinner's ready, Papa.

564
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:05,725
Go on. Go on without me.

565
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:30,864
- Guinan, can I leave the nexus?
- Where would you go?

566
01:28:31,079 --> 01:28:35,584
- I don't understand.
- Time has no meaning here.

567
01:28:35,798 --> 01:28:42,055
- You can go anywhere, any time.
- I know where.

568
01:28:42,271 --> 01:28:48,402
To the mountaintop on Veridian 3
just before Soran destroyed the star.

569
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:56,502
- Come back and help me stop him.
- I can't leave. I'm there already.

570
01:28:56,762 --> 01:28:58,597
But I know someone who can.

571
01:29:01,313 --> 01:29:04,942
And from his point of view,
he just got here, too.

572
01:29:13,507 --> 01:29:18,762
Kirk...
James T. Kirk.

573
01:29:23,906 --> 01:29:26,742
Beautiful day.

574
01:29:28,959 --> 01:29:32,254
Yes, it certainly is.

575
01:29:38,647 --> 01:29:41,900
Would you mind?

576
01:29:50,757 --> 01:29:55,136
Captain, I'm wondering,
do you realise?

577
01:29:55,351 --> 01:30:00,606
Hold on.
Do you smell something burning?

578
01:30:09,173 --> 01:30:14,679
Looks like somebody was trying
to cook some eggs. Come on in.

579
01:30:16,189 --> 01:30:20,152
It's all right. It's my house.

580
01:30:22,829 --> 01:30:28,043
At least it used to be.
I sold it years ago.

581
01:30:29,803 --> 01:30:35,476
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Starship... Enterprise.

582
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:41,618
The clock...

583
01:30:44,628 --> 01:30:46,672
I gave this clock to Bones.

584
01:30:46,883 --> 01:30:53,848
I'm from what you would consider
the future. The 24th century.

585
01:30:56,488 --> 01:30:59,616
Butler!

586
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:11,764
How can you be here?
He's been dead seven years.

587
01:31:11,981 --> 01:31:17,445
Jim, I'm starving. How long are you
going to rattle around in that kitchen?

588
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:20,538
Antonia.

589
01:31:23,005 --> 01:31:28,594
What are you talking about?
The future?

590
01:31:28,809 --> 01:31:34,774
This is the past. Nine years ago.

591
01:31:50,233 --> 01:31:55,780
The day I told her
I was going back to Starfleet.

592
01:32:05,057 --> 01:32:11,480
Ktarian eggs, her favourite. I was
preparing them to soften the blow.

593
01:32:11,697 --> 01:32:17,578
I know how real this must seem
to you. But it's not.

594
01:32:17,794 --> 01:32:24,050
This isn't really your house. We're
caught up in some temporal nexus.

595
01:32:26,689 --> 01:32:32,612
Dill. Dill weed.
In the cabinet, second shelf to the left.

596
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:37,416
Behind the oregano.

597
01:32:43,059 --> 01:32:47,188
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

598
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:53,950
I was aboard the Enterprise-B in
the deflector control room... Stir these.

599
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:58,880
The bulkhead disappeared and then I
found myself out there chopping wood -

600
01:32:59,095 --> 01:33:04,141
- right before you walked up
Thanks.

601
01:33:04,356 --> 01:33:08,777
Look, history records -

602
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:15,957
- that you died saving the Enterprise-B
from an energy ribbon 80 years ago.

603
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:18,927
This is the 24th century?

604
01:33:20,727 --> 01:33:24,731
- And I'm dead?
- No, this is some kind of...

605
01:33:24,944 --> 01:33:31,284
...temporal nexus.
Something is missing.

606
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:42,644
I need your help.
Leave the nexus with me.

607
01:33:42,859 --> 01:33:47,656
We have to go back to Veridian 3
and stop a man called Soran -

608
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:53,292
- from destroying a star.
Millions of lives are at stake.

609
01:33:53,549 --> 01:33:57,637
History considers me dead.
Who am I to argue with history?

610
01:33:57,850 --> 01:34:01,479
- You have a duty as a Starfleet officer!
- Don't lecture me.

611
01:34:01,693 --> 01:34:06,364
I saved the galaxy
when your grandfather was in diapers.

612
01:34:06,579 --> 01:34:11,542
Besides,
I think the galaxy owes me one.

613
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:16,638
All right...

614
01:34:18,647 --> 01:34:25,154
I was like you once. Completely
blinded by duty and obligation.

615
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:33,006
And what did it get me?
An empty house.

616
01:34:38,024 --> 01:34:41,444
Not this time.

617
01:34:41,658 --> 01:34:46,287
This time I'm going to march
into that bedroom -

618
01:34:46,502 --> 01:34:52,841
- and tell Antonia I want to marry her.
This time it's going to be different.

619
01:35:21,078 --> 01:35:25,875
- This is not your bedroom.
- No, it's better.

620
01:35:26,089 --> 01:35:30,635
- Better?
- This is my uncle's barn in Idaho.

621
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:37,190
I took this horse out for a ride
11 years ago on a spring day.

622
01:35:40,998 --> 01:35:47,088
Like this one. If I'm right,
this is the day I met Antonia.

623
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:54,478
This nexus is very clever. I can start
over and do things right from day one.

624
01:37:31,536 --> 01:37:35,874
I must have jumped that 50 times.
Scared the hell out of me each time.

625
01:37:36,088 --> 01:37:39,091
Except this time.

626
01:37:39,304 --> 01:37:42,641
Because it isn't real.

627
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:50,615
- Antonia.
- She isn't real either, is she?

628
01:37:50,829 --> 01:37:55,084
Nothing here is.
Nothing here matters.

629
01:37:56,300 --> 01:38:04,308
Maybe this is more about that empty
chair on the bridge of the Enterprise.

630
01:38:04,527 --> 01:38:10,700
Ever since I left Starfleet
I haven't made a difference.

631
01:38:20,688 --> 01:38:26,652
Captain of the Enterprise?
Close to retirement?

632
01:38:26,869 --> 01:38:30,247
- I'm not planning on it.
- Don't.

633
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:35,465
Don't let them promote or transfer you.
Don't let them do anything -

634
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:41,060
- that takes you off that ship. Because
there you can make a difference.

635
01:38:42,445 --> 01:38:47,575
Come back and help me stop Soran.
Make a difference again.

636
01:38:59,525 --> 01:39:03,654
Who am I to argue with
the captain of the Enterprise?

637
01:39:03,867 --> 01:39:09,873
Veridian 3? I take it the odds are
against us and the situation is grim.

638
01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:13,635
You could say that.

639
01:39:13,849 --> 01:39:19,229
Spock would say I was
an irrational, illogical human being -

640
01:39:19,444 --> 01:39:23,281
- for taking on a mission like that.

641
01:39:24,414 --> 01:39:28,043
Sounds like fun.

642
01:39:41,577 --> 01:39:46,123
I've re-routed auxiliary power
to lateral thrusters to level our descent.

643
01:39:46,338 --> 01:39:48,632
Brace for impact!

644
01:40:31,898 --> 01:40:37,195
- Just who the hell are you?
- He's James T. Kirk.

645
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:41,039
Don't you read history?

646
01:40:44,593 --> 01:40:47,888
I've got to get to the launcher.

647
01:40:48,101 --> 01:40:52,397
- The ribbon will be here in a minute.
- I'll take care of Soran.

648
01:41:28,691 --> 01:41:34,280
Actually, I am familiar with history.
If I'm not mistaken, you're dead.

649
01:42:18,177 --> 01:42:22,764
- Weren't you heading for the launcher?
- I changed my mind.

650
01:42:46,698 --> 01:42:48,825
We need that control pad.

651
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:57,637
Captain, look.

652
01:42:59,477 --> 01:43:03,022
Where's Soran?

653
01:44:05,542 --> 01:44:11,256
We're running out of time. The
control pad is still on the other side.

654
01:44:11,471 --> 01:44:16,101
- I'll get it. You go for the launcher.
- No, we have to work together.

655
01:44:16,315 --> 01:44:20,695
- We are working together. Trust me.
- Good luck, Captain.

656
01:44:20,909 --> 01:44:24,288
Call me Jim.

657
01:45:56,832 --> 01:46:02,254
Picard! Get away from that launcher.

658
01:46:05,852 --> 01:46:09,105
Now!

659
01:47:44,822 --> 01:47:49,953
Did we do it?
Did we make a difference?

660
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:56,926
Oh, yes. We made a difference.
Thank you.

661
01:48:00,525 --> 01:48:06,698
It's the least I could do...
for the captain of the Enterprise.

662
01:48:14,681 --> 01:48:19,728
It was... fun.

663
01:48:30,717 --> 01:48:33,970
Oh, my.

664
01:49:56,157 --> 01:49:58,493
Captain's log, Stardate 48650. 1.

665
01:49:58,705 --> 01:50:04,336
Three Starfleet vessels have come
to beam up the Enterprise survivors.

666
01:50:04,552 --> 01:50:10,641
Our casualties were light, bt the
Enterprise herself can't be salvaged.

667
01:50:10,858 --> 01:50:17,197
- It has been extremely difficult.
- Then why not have the chip removed?

668
01:50:17,414 --> 01:50:22,627
At first, I was unprepared for the
unpredictable nature of emotions.

669
01:50:22,884 --> 01:50:27,555
However, having experienced
261 emotional states, -

670
01:50:27,769 --> 01:50:33,484
- I believe I have learned to control
my feelings. They won't control me.

671
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:37,496
I hope you're successful.

672
01:50:37,709 --> 01:50:40,837
Data, I found something.

673
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,930
One life sign, very faint.

674
01:50:57,838 --> 01:51:01,341
Spot!

675
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:05,933
I'm very happy to see you, Spot.

676
01:51:07,985 --> 01:51:12,865
Another family reunited.

677
01:51:13,873 --> 01:51:19,128
Data, are you all right?

678
01:51:19,343 --> 01:51:24,390
I am uncertain, Councillor.
I am happy to see Spot, -

679
01:51:24,647 --> 01:51:31,362
- yet I am crying.
Perhaps the chip is malfunctioning.

680
01:51:33,667 --> 01:51:37,796
I think it's working perfectly.

681
01:51:43,314 --> 01:51:45,191
Hello, Spot.

682
01:51:51,749 --> 01:51:54,752
Is this it?

683
01:51:54,965 --> 01:52:00,387
Yes, that's it, Number One.
Thank you.

684
01:52:05,405 --> 01:52:11,286
I'm going to miss this ship.
She went before her time.

685
01:52:12,838 --> 01:52:18,594
Someone once said that time is
a predator that stalks us all our lives.

686
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:23,857
I believe that time is a companion
who goes with us on the journey -

687
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:30,161
- and reminds us to cherish every
moment, for they'll never come again.

688
01:52:33,342 --> 01:52:38,555
What we leave behind is not
as important as how we've lived.

689
01:52:38,812 --> 01:52:42,816
After all, we're only mortal.

690
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:48,327
Speak for yourself, sir.
I plan to live forever.

691
01:52:51,591 --> 01:52:56,554
I always thought I'd get a shot
at this chair one day.

692
01:52:56,769 --> 01:52:59,188
Perhaps you still will.

693
01:52:59,401 --> 01:53:05,115
I doubt this will be the last ship
to carry the name Enterprise.

694
01:53:12,638 --> 01:53:17,518
Picard to Farragut.
Two to beam up.
