1
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:02,560
There he is! Let's get him.

2
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:14,609
Area 7 to Command. We could
use another survey team out here.

3
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:20,532
Ensigns McCauley and Gilles,
assist edaphology team in area 7.

4
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,783
Acknowledged.

5
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:46,473
Admiral Dougherty is waiting
for this. Transmit it to the ship.

6
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,811
"Alert!"
Area 12!

7
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:01,072
- "The android is out of control."
- Report.

8
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,243
- "He's headed toward the village."
- Over there!

9
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,415
Magnify.

10
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,925
Hold your fire.

11
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:23,677
What is it?

12
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,518
Base to Commander Data.

13
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:35,355
Re-routing microhydraulic
power distribution.

14
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:39,610
- "Regulating thermal overload."
- Data, report immediately!

15
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:44,949
Transferring matrix functions.
Engaging secondary protocol.

16
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,534
He's trying to remove the headpiece.

17
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:51,706
All field units,
intercept the android.

18
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,130
Artim, it's all right.

19
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:07,471
Get inside.

20
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:24,738
Everyone get inside now.
Backto your homes.

21
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:30,452
- Secondary protocol is active.
- Stop him! Now!

22
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,511
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order! Stand down!

23
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,380
Who are they?.

24
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,322
It's an M-class planet.
Population 300 million.

25
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:52,909
- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-chin chef-faw.

26
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:56,997
You either need a new uniform
or a new neck.

27
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:01,752
- My collar size hasn't changed.
- Of course not!

28
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:05,755
Our guests
are eating the floral arrangements.

29
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:10,761
- No cocktails before dinner?.
- My God! Are they vegetarian?

30
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:16,350
Does the chef have a dressing
that goes well with chrysanthemums?

31
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:25,192
Captain Picard, Command wants
to know our ETA at the Goren system?

32
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:29,029
- The Goren system?
- Some territorial dispute.

33
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:34,451
If we delay our trip to Hanoran Il,
it'll put us in the monsoon season.

34
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,536
Captain ...

35
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:42,209
- The diplomatic corps is busy.
- So we get to put out another fire.

36
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:47,882
Can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers?

37
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,800
Deck 10.

38
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:54,721
Remember, they're not
as advanced as we are.

39
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,060
- They've just achieved warp drive.
- Nowthey're a protectorate.

40
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:05,983
With the Borg and the Dominon,
we need all the allies we can get.

41
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,235
Captain on deck.

42
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:18,161
- Regent Cuzar like to dance.
- Can she mambo?

43
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,831
- Very funny.
- The Captain cuts quite a rug.

44
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:26,920
La Forge to Picard. I need to talk
to you before the reception.

45
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:30,757
Mr Worf!
What are you doing here?

46
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,844
Can it wait?

47
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:38,682
- Tell him to come up here.
- The Captain wants you to join us.

48
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,687
There's a communiquÃ© from
Admiral Dougherty about Data.

49
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,534
Regent Cuzar, welcome aboard.

50
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:03,374
Captain Picard, I welcome you
in the tradition of my people.

51
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:16,803
We are so honoured to be accepted
within the great Federation family.

52
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:20,515
- We have a dance later.
- I look forward to it.

53
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:31,568
- Counsellor ..?
- Nice bead work.

54
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:38,325
Captain, Admiral Dougherty is aboard
a Son'a ship in sector 4-4-1 .

55
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:42,495
He's requesting Data's schematics.
He doesn't say why.

56
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:47,250
Data was only scheduled to observe
the Ba'ku village for a week.

57
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,088
Geordi, set up a secure com-link
to the Admiral.

58
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:57,094
Hars Adislo. We met at the
Nel Bato conference last year.

59
00:09:57,344 --> 00:10:01,764
Did you read my paper
on thermionic transconductance?

60
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,601
Would you excuse me?

61
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:13,360
He's not acknowledging
any Starfleet protocol.

62
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:19,490
- What precipitated this behaviour?.
- "I don't know. Now he has hostages."

63
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,786
We could be there in two days.

64
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:27,791
That's not a good idea. Your ship
hasn't been fitted for this region.

65
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,419
- "There are environmental concerns."
- Such as?

66
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:36,216
We're studying various anomalies.
They call this area the Briar Patch.

67
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:39,970
We've had trouble
even getting a signal to you.

68
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,892
Just get me Data's schematics.
I'll keep you informed.

69
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:55,152
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.

70
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:59,822
Send the Admiral Data's schematics.

71
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:06,245
Report to the galley and tell
the chef to skip the fish course.

72
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:09,832
I'd like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows.

73
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:14,087
I'm going to ask Worf
to delay his return to DS9.

74
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:17,841
Sector 4-4-1 is on our way
to the Goren system.

75
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:22,513
- They are in opposite directions.
- Are they?.

76
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,536
I should never have let you
talk me into that duck blind.

77
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:50,374
Federation procedures have made this
more difficult than it needed to be.

78
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,296
We have to protect the planet's
population from unnecessary risk.

79
00:11:56,547 --> 00:12:00,634
Planet's population?
600 people!

80
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:06,639
If you want to avoid unnecessary
risks, leave your android at home.

81
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,062
- "We are approaching the planet."
- Take us into a high orbit.

82
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:16,817
Lie down, the girls
will take 20 years off your face.

83
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:21,738
- Another time, perhaps.
- Your self-restraint puzzles me.

84
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:26,659
You deny yourself every benefit
this mission has to offer.

85
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:31,914
Such benefits are to be shared with
"all"the people of the Federation.

86
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:42,009
- Report!
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.

87
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:48,181
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes.

88
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:55,438
- The vessel has broken off pursuit.
- Visual contact.

89
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:02,028
That's our ship.

90
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:25,719
We're about to lose communications
with Starfleet.

91
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:29,889
I have all the files on the
duck-blind mission and the Son'a.

92
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,226
You have two days to become experts.

93
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:39,149
Mr Worf, we need a plan
to safely capture Data.

94
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:44,653
La Forge has modified this tricorder
with one of Data's actuation servos.

95
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:49,076
Its range is only four metres,
but it will shut him down.

96
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,330
Good to have you back.

97
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:57,334
Take us in.

98
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:15,684
Half a century ago,
they conquered two primitive races -

99
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:19,605
- and integrated them into
their culture as a labour class.

100
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:29,365
The Son'a have produced quantities
of the narcotic ketracel-white.

101
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:36,288
Their ships are rumoured to be
equipped with outlawed weapons.

102
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:40,793
- Why are we involved with them?
- Good question.

103
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,048
You haven't done that in a while.

104
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,884
- What you're doing to my neck.
- What?

105
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:59,395
Bridge to Commander Worf.

106
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:02,649
- "Worf!"
- Captain.

107
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:07,903
How are things on DS9? Don't
officers report for duty on time?

108
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:18,748
- "Sorry, sir. I'm on my way."
- We'll skip the court martial.

109
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:24,671
When was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors?

110
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:28,258
- Two months ago.
- They don't sound right.

111
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:34,179
They are out of alignment
by 12 microns. You could hear that?

112
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:38,601
When I was an ensign, I could
detect a 3-micron misalignment.

113
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:43,523
The Son'a ship with Adm. Dougherty
has entered tracking range.

114
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:48,861
Straighten your baldric.
On screen.

115
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:52,532
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

116
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:56,201
This is important to the Enterprise.

117
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:01,541
Data attacked us in the mission
scout ship, yesterday.

118
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,794
Ru'afo and I have decided
to send in an assault team.

119
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:09,798
Worf and I are working out
a tactical plan ...

120
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:16,806
Your android damaged my ship.
He must be destroyed.

121
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:23,812
I know what Data means to Starfleet,
but our crew are in danger.

122
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,818
If our attempt to capture Data
fails, I will terminate him.

123
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,823
I should be the one to do it.
I'm his captain and his friend.

124
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:43,082
All right, you have 12 hours, then
I want you out of the Briar Patch.

125
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:48,337
We'll head out to the perimeter
to call for Son'a reinforcements.

126
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,423
Understood.

127
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:53,509
Good luck. Dougherty out.

128
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,192
- We're not picking up any ships.
- Try a wide-band covariant signal.

129
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:13,195
The rings are masking his approach.

130
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:18,701
The metaphasic radiation from the
rings is in a state of extreme flux.

131
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:25,791
Come out, come out
wherever you are ...

132
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,296
- Sir?.
- That's something my mother ...

133
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:34,134
Hold on.

134
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:45,811
Open all hailing frequencies.
Data, this is Captain Picard.

135
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:48,730
Please respond.

136
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:57,824
If we fire tachyon bursts,
he'll have to reset his shields.

137
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,036
- Then we can beam him out.
- Make it so.

138
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,296
- Direct hit. His shields are down.
- Beam him out.

139
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:20,930
- He's using a transport inhibitor.
- Prepare to enter the atmosphere.

140
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,182
That will shake him.

141
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:35,028
- Scanners are off-line.
- Start evasive manoeuvres.

142
00:18:55,882 --> 00:19:02,512
He can fly a ship and anticipate our
tactics. His brain is functioning.

143
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:07,809
We know how he responds to threats.
I wonder how he would respond ...

144
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:12,690
Do you know Gilbert & Sullivan?

145
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:17,737
No, I've not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members.

146
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:24,535
They're composers,
from the 19th century.

147
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:33,086
Data was rehearsing "HMS Pinafore"
just before he left.

148
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:39,342
A Brltish tar is a soaring soul
as free as a mountain bird

149
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:44,513
his fist should be ready to resist
a dictatorial word

150
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,766
Sing, Worf.

151
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:49,519
- "his nose should pant"
- "and his lips should curl"

152
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:53,021
- "his cheeks should flame"
- "and his brow should furl"

153
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,275
- "his bosom should heave"
- "and his hea"rt "should glow"

154
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:00,278
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

155
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:04,157
his nose should pant
and his lips should curl

156
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,536
his cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl

157
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:09,122
his bosom should heave
"and his hea"rt "should glow"

158
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,709
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

159
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,044
Prepare the docking clamps.

160
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:18,005
his eyes should flash
wlth an inborn fire

161
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:21,049
his brow wlth scorn be wrung

162
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,303
he never should bow down
to a domineering frown

163
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:27,640
or the tang of a tyrant tongue

164
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:31,227
- "his hea"rt "should stamp"
- "and his throat should growl"

165
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:34,396
- "his hair should curl"
- "and his face should scowl"

166
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:37,817
- "his eyes should flash"
- "and his breast protrude"

167
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:42,238
and this should be
his customary attltude

168
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:46,075
his foot should stamp
and his voice should drop

169
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:49,327
his hair should curl
and his face ...

170
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:56,169
If we do not release him,
he may destroy both vessels.

171
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:59,255
I'm not letting go of him.

172
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:08,513
- We must stabilise.
- All power to inertial dampers.

173
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:13,269
- The auto-sequencer is damaged.
- Transfer control to manual.

174
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:23,695
Auto-sequencer realigned.
Engaging stabilisers.

175
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:27,074
- Damping field established.
- M"ax"imum power.

176
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,795
Now, Mr Worf.

177
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,729
Commander Data is safely in custody.

178
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:35,601
- Captain, Subahdar Gallatin.
- Lt. Curtis, Doughertys attachÃ©.

179
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:40,522
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.

180
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:45,653
They have incredible
mental discipline and perception.

181
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:49,198
- My name is Sojef.
- Jean-Luc Picard.

182
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:51,951
Dr Crusher and Counsellor Troi.

183
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:57,455
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we're here to rescue them.

184
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:03,378
As you wish. I would ask you
to disarm yourselves.

185
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:07,048
This village is a sanctuary of life.

186
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,637
Prepare the hostages for transport.

187
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:18,144
They should be quarantined before
joining the ship's population.

188
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,316
We believed they were being held
against their will.

189
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:29,238
It's not our custom
to hold anyone against their will.

190
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:35,411
The android told us they were our
enemies, and that more would follow.

191
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:37,913
Are you our enemy?.

192
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:43,836
Non-interference in other cultures
is my people's prime directive.

193
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:49,174
Your directive apparently doesn't
include spying on other cultures.

194
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:55,513
The android is a member of my crew.
Apparently, he was taken ill.

195
00:23:55,681 --> 00:24:00,519
We were unable to repair the phase
variance in his positronic matrix.

196
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:06,107
The captain finds it hard to believe
we possess such technical skills.

197
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:11,696
Not applying our technological
abilities is a matter of choice.

198
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:17,036
Creating a machine to do man's work
takes something away from man.

199
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:21,289
At one time, we explored the galaxy,
just as you do.

200
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,794
- You have warp capability?.
- Capability, yes.

201
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:29,882
But where can warp drive take us
except away from here?

202
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:43,479
I apologise for our intrusion.

203
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:56,909
Because they have warp capability,
the consequences will be minimal.

204
00:24:57,076 --> 00:25:02,080
Terrific job. Now pack your bags
and get the hell out of there.

205
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:07,752
- "How's Data?"
- La Forge is doing the diagnostic.

206
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:15,260
Rendezvous wlth us to transfer
crew and equipment on your way out.

207
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:22,518
- You're not finished here?
- "Just a few loose ends to tie up."

208
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,963
Come in.

209
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,054
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure.

210
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:04,809
- I need a little counselling.
- That's a first.

211
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:08,146
Do I lie down, or what?

212
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:14,068
Whatever makes you comfortable,
but it isn't a therapeutic posture.

213
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:18,490
- But it is comfortable.
- Why don't you try sitting up?

214
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:21,910
Why don't you try lying down?

215
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:27,750
You're in quite a mood today. Did
you just come down here to play?.

216
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:31,086
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.
- I believe you.

217
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:34,338
- I'm not sleeping well.
- Dr Crusher can help.

218
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:39,177
What I need
I can't get from Dr Crusher.

219
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:44,098
Can two people go back in time
and fix a mistake they've made?

220
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:47,769
On this ship, anything's possible.

221
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,941
Yuk!

222
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:59,615
- I never kissed you with a beard.
- I kiss you, and you say 'yuk'!

223
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:09,374
I reconstructed Data's neural net
and replaced these memory engrams.

224
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,463
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.

225
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:22,386
- He malfunctioned "after"they fired?
- I believe so.

226
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:30,561
- Why would they fire on him first?
- A shot caused him to malfunction.

227
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:33,981
His ethical subroutines
then took over.

228
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:38,319
So he still knewthe difference
between right and wrong.

229
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:42,657
The system prevents anyone from
taking advantage of his memory loss.

230
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:46,827
Yet he attacked us
and told the Ba'ku we were a threat.

231
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:52,000
- Are the implants bothering you?
- No, I'm just tired.

232
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:05,846
- Geordi? Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.

233
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:11,603
I seem to be missing
several memory engrams.

234
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:14,439
There they are.

235
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:21,613
What's the last thing you remember?.

236
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:27,035
- "His nose should pant..."
- From the mission.

237
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:31,455
I was gathering
phsyiometric data on the Ba'ku.

238
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:34,542
Some children walked into the hills.

239
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:46,721
Artim, where were you
the day the android appeared to us?

240
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:51,393
- In the hills by the dam.
- Can you show us?

241
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:13,330
There is no reason to fear me. I am
operating within normal parameters.

242
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:16,835
They fixed me.

243
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:24,175
- The boy is afraid of me.
- It's nothing personal.

244
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:31,098
- These people rejected technology.
- I am technology personified.

245
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:36,354
That young man has never seen
a machine that walks and talks.

246
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,781
Bridge to Riker.

247
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:51,536
- Can I get backto you, Worf?
- "It's Admiral Dougherty."

248
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:55,039
Patch him through.
Yes, Admiral?

249
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:59,961
- Why haven't you left orbit?
- "Picard is still on the surface."

250
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:03,798
He wants an explanation
as to why Data malfunctioned.

251
00:30:03,964 --> 00:30:07,134
His future at Starfleet
depends on it.

252
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:15,309
Remind the Captain
his 12 hours are up. Dougherty out.

253
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:21,566
Your body is producing
far too many toxins.

254
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:25,903
We've reached the limit
of genetic manipulation.

255
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:30,075
I won't need any more
genetic manipulation -

256
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:35,329
- if our Federation friends will
allow us to complete this mission.

257
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:47,925
Tricorder functions are limited due
to kelbonite deposits in the area.

258
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:52,596
How about a passive radiation scan?

259
00:30:54,098 --> 00:31:00,020
There appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake.

260
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:19,624
Can he breathe underwater?.

261
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:23,461
Data doesn't breathe.

262
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:28,633
- Won't he rust?
- No.

263
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:54,159
Captain!

264
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:58,579
I believe I know what is causing
the neutrino emissions.

265
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:40,872
The vessel
is clearly Federation in origin.

266
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:44,709
"Just a few loose ends
to tie up!"

267
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,547
- We're not interested in this.
- I am.

268
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:55,886
- It would be wiser ...
- I'm going with you.

269
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:49,356
It is a holographic projection.

270
00:33:52,442 --> 00:33:55,113
Incomplete, I might add.

271
00:33:55,363 --> 00:34:00,117
This is a computer-driven image
created by photons and forcefields.

272
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:03,704
I know what a hologram is.

273
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:07,959
Why would anyone want
to create one of our village?

274
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:12,547
If you were following the children
and discovered this ship ...

275
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:17,635
I may have been shot to protect
the secret of its existence.

276
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:23,224
Why would they duplicate this
village except to deceive the Ba'ku?

277
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:27,311
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.

278
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,398
You'd fall asleep in your village -

279
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:34,485
- and wake up
on this flying holodeck.

280
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:38,239
Transported en masse,
and in a few days -

281
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:43,077
- relocated on a similar planet
without ever realising it.

282
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:47,914
Why would the Federation
wish to move the Ba'ku?

283
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:51,835
I don't know.

284
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:31,208
Computer, end program.
De-cloakthe vessel.

285
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:35,213
Help!

286
00:35:35,378 --> 00:35:38,882
I can't swim.

287
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:47,809
Don't panic.

288
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:52,480
I've been shot at on a ship
that has come to abduct us.

289
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,233
What's there to panic about?

290
00:35:56,567 --> 00:36:01,572
For water landings, I am designed
to serve as a flotation device.

291
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:11,331
Did the hostages mention
anything about a cloaked ship?

292
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:14,418
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.

293
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:20,173
- Have you been in a fight?
- No, it is a gorch.

294
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,846
A pimple, sir.

295
00:36:27,014 --> 00:36:31,434
Well ... it's hardly noticeable.

296
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:49,704
Smooth as an android's bottom.

297
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:54,041
- Dougherty noticed we haven't left.
- We're not going anywhere.

298
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,210
Deck 5.

299
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:04,050
Klingons never do anything small.

300
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:09,389
- Dr Crusher asked to speakto you.
- Picard to Crusher.

301
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,811
The Son'a hostages
declined to be examined.

302
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:17,148
- And our people?
- They're fine.

303
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:23,695
In fact they're better than fine.
Improved muscle tone, high energy.

304
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:26,574
Very well, Doctor.

305
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,911
Don't release the Son'a officers
until I've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.

306
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,000
Commander, may I ..?

307
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:44,800
Computer, music.

308
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,512
- Not that, something Latin.
- "Specify."

309
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:51,599
The mambo.

310
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:57,188
That's more like it.

311
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:21,628
How old are you?

312
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,509
Our solar system was on the verge
of self-annihilation.

313
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:31,222
Technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life.

314
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:35,309
A small group of us
set off to find a new home.

315
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:41,106
A home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds.

316
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:47,362
- That was 309 years ago.
- And you haven't aged since then.

317
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:52,242
I was a lot older when we arrived,
in terms of my physical condition.

318
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:56,579
There's a metaphasic radiation
coming from the planet's rings.

319
00:38:56,746 --> 00:39:00,333
It regenerates
our genetic structure.

320
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:06,005
- You must have noticed the effects.
- We've just begun to.

321
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,927
- I suppose you're 75.
- No, I'm 12.

322
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:16,766
The radiation won't affect him
until he reaches maturity.

323
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:23,440
What you have here is more valuable
than gold-pressed latinum.

324
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:29,070
That's the reason someone may be
trying to take your world from you.

325
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,365
The android was right.

326
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:38,038
If it wasn't for Data, it's probable
that you would be relocated by now.

327
00:39:38,204 --> 00:39:42,876
The moment we pick up a weapon
we become one of them.

328
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:46,713
- We lose everything we are.
- It may not come to that.

329
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:51,760
The architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret.

330
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,431
Not only from you,
but from my people, as well.

331
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:01,936
I don't intend to let them.

332
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:12,655
We've always known that to survive
we had to remain apart.

333
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:17,911
Many of the young people want
to know more about the offland.

334
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:23,291
They're attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life.

335
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,547
Most of my people would
sell their souls to slow life down.

336
00:40:29,757 --> 00:40:32,760
But not you?

337
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,347
There are days.

338
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:41,351
You don't live up to your reputation
as an offlander.

339
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,940
In defence of offlanders,
there are many more people like me.

340
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,862
Who wouldn't be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth?

341
00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:01,288
You give me more credit than
I deserve. Of course I'm tempted.

342
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:05,626
But some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world -

343
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:12,965
- involve the forced relocation
of one people to satisfy another.

344
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,389
I had hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes, -

345
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:23,309
- but it seems
that some of us haven't.

346
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,824
- Extraordinary craftsmanship.
- It's the work of students.

347
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:41,494
They're almost ready
to become apprentices.

348
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:46,708
In 30 or 40 years
some of them will become artisans.

349
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:50,420
Apprenticing for 30 years ...

350
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:56,635
Did your people's mental discipline
develop here?

351
00:41:56,885 --> 00:42:01,514
More questions.
Always the explorer.

352
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:07,855
- If you stay, that will change.
- Will it?

353
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:14,360
You stop reviewing the past,
stop planning for tomorrow.

354
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:18,532
Let me ask you a question:

355
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:24,871
Have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time?

356
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:30,251
When time seemed to stop, and you
could almost live in that moment?

357
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:39,635
Seeing my home planet from space,
for the first time.

358
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:43,014
Yes, exactly.

359
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:46,893
Nothing more complicated
than perception.

360
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:52,815
You explore the universe.

361
00:42:53,065 --> 00:43:00,157
We discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself.

362
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:03,869
Full of powerful forces.

363
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:09,333
Most people aren't aware enough
of the "now"to even notice.

364
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:14,170
I wish I could spare
a few centuries to learn.

365
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,592
It took us centuries to learn that
it doesn't have to take that long.

366
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:23,096
There's one thing
I don't understand.

367
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:28,018
In 300 years,
you never learned to swim?

368
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:31,771
I haven't got around to it yet.

369
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:42,990
I wonder if you're aware
of the trust you engender.

370
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,371
- It's unusual ...
- For an offlander?.

371
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:51,333
For someone so young.

372
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:30,246
- Geordi?
- Captain.

373
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:34,251
There wasn't anything wrong
with my implants.

374
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:38,922
There was something right
with my eyes.

375
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:48,849
Dr Crusher found that the cells
around my optic nerve had ...

376
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:53,686
... started to regenerate.

377
00:44:54,938 --> 00:45:00,777
It may not last.
And if it doesn't ...

378
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:05,449
... I just wanted, before we go ...

379
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:09,369
You know, I've never seen a sunrise.

380
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:14,123
At least not the way you see them.

381
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:44,987
Come.

382
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:52,077
Am I to understand
that you're not releasing my men?

383
00:45:52,244 --> 00:45:56,081
We found the holoship.

384
00:45:56,333 --> 00:46:00,920
- Let the captain and me ...
- No!

385
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,266
This entire mission has been one
Federation blunder after another.

386
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:20,940
Return my men, or this alliance will
end with your ship's destruction.

387
00:46:31,117 --> 00:46:34,536
You're looking well, Jean-Luc.
Rested.

388
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:39,376
I won't let you move them. I will
take this to the Federation Council.

389
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:42,711
I'm acting on their orders.

390
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:45,882
To abandon our prime directive?

391
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:52,054
These people are not indigenous.
They're not meant to be immortal.

392
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:56,309
We'll be restoring them
to their natural evolution.

393
00:46:56,476 --> 00:47:00,730
Who the hell are we to determine
the course of evolution?

394
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:03,483
There are 600 people there.

395
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:09,239
The regenerative properties of
this radiation could help billions.

396
00:47:09,405 --> 00:47:14,827
The Son'a can collect metaphasic
particles from the planet's rings.

397
00:47:14,994 --> 00:47:20,833
- The planet is in Federation space.
- Our planet, their technology.

398
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:26,422
A technology we can't duplicate.
You know what that makes us?

399
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:34,597
- Partners.
- Our partners are petty thugs.

400
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:39,268
On Earth, petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders.

401
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:47,025
Warp drive created a Romulan empire.
We can handle the Son'a.

402
00:47:47,193 --> 00:47:50,947
We probably said the same
about the Romulans.

403
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:57,786
Lifespans will be doubled. An entire
new medical science will evolve.

404
00:47:57,954 --> 00:48:02,125
Your chief engineer has the use
of his eyes for the first time.

405
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,378
Will you take that away from him?

406
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:09,715
With the whole Briar Patch, why
does it have to be this one planet?

407
00:48:09,882 --> 00:48:14,304
The concentration in the rings
makes it work.

408
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:18,807
They'll inject something into
the rings and start a reaction.

409
00:48:18,974 --> 00:48:26,565
- The planet will be uninhabitable.
- Delay them, let us study it.

410
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:31,737
Our best scientific minds
can't find any other way to do this.

411
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:35,992
The Son'a can establish a separate
colony on the planet until we do.

412
00:48:36,242 --> 00:48:40,663
It would take ten years' exposure
to reverse their condition.

413
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:44,333
Some of them
won't survive that long.

414
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:48,838
Besides, who would want to live
in the Briar Patch?

415
00:48:49,088 --> 00:48:52,425
The Ba'ku.

416
00:48:55,427 --> 00:49:00,516
We are betraying the principles upon
which the Federation was founded.

417
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:05,021
It's an attack upon its very soul.

418
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:17,032
And it will destroy the Ba'ku.

419
00:49:19,034 --> 00:49:25,375
Cultures have been destroyed in
every forced relocation in history.

420
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:30,295
Jean-Luc,
we're only moving 600 people.

421
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:36,552
How many people does it take
before it becomes wrong?

422
00:49:37,302 --> 00:49:41,224
1,000?
50,000?

423
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:45,644
A million?
How many people does it take?

424
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:52,150
You'll proceed to the Goren system,
and release the Son'a officers.

425
00:49:52,402 --> 00:49:57,072
File whatever protests you wish to.

426
00:49:59,574 --> 00:50:04,079
By the time you do,
this will all be done.

427
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:56,047
Gallatin!

428
00:50:56,215 --> 00:51:03,139
The righteous Starfleet captain
finally released you.

429
00:51:03,306 --> 00:51:06,976
- Any problems on the surface?
- No, sir.

430
00:51:08,894 --> 00:51:12,815
But it wasn't easy being among them.

431
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:16,568
Just don't forget
what they did to us.

432
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,324
We'll have them rounded up
in a day or two.

433
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:26,161
We needn't bother
with a holoship anymore.

434
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:30,750
Get the holding cells ready.

435
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,420
I'm going to miss these little
flesh-stretching sessions of ours.

436
00:51:58,693 --> 00:52:02,864
Re-routing the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise.

437
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:07,369
However, the transporter
is rarely used after 02:00 hours.

438
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:12,123
- Going out for a spin?
- Seven tons of explosives.

439
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:16,378
Tetryon pulse launchers
and isomagnetic disintegrators.

440
00:52:16,545 --> 00:52:21,132
- A hunting trip?
- Return to your quarters.

441
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:26,304
- That's an order.
- No uniform, no orders.

442
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:31,393
How can I look at a sunrise, knowing
what my sight cost these people?

443
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:38,483
Exposure could stimulate rebellious
instincts common to youth -

444
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:42,822
- which would affect everyone's
judgement ... except mine.

445
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:46,826
What do you think we should do?

446
00:52:46,992 --> 00:52:51,914
Saddle up.
Lock and load.

447
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:59,922
They won't begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited.

448
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:04,010
Our job is to keep
the planet inhabited.

449
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,097
We'll show what's happening here.
Make the Council "see" the Ba'ku.

450
00:53:09,264 --> 00:53:14,769
Then it won't be so easy to
turn a blind eye to their suffering.

451
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:21,193
- I'll be back before you know it.
- We'll hold out as long as we can.

452
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:46,052
The injector performs perfectly
in every simulation.

453
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:51,306
The Enterprise left orbit, but a
support craft is on the surface.

454
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:55,143
It's the Captain's yacht.
Five persons on board.

455
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:59,898
We're not waiting. Get everyone
off the surface tonight.

456
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:04,903
Gallatin.

457
00:54:05,153 --> 00:54:09,992
If Picard or any of his people
interfere ... eliminate them.

458
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:20,168
We're leaving the village.
Take only what you need.

459
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:25,590
Bring food.
We may not be back for days.

460
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:39,938
It's a transport inhibitor.

461
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:44,693
It will prevent anyone
being beamed off the surface.

462
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:49,614
Kelbonite in the hills will
interfere with their transporters.

463
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:55,954
Where there aren't any deposits
we'll use transport inhibitors.

464
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:59,041
The mountains are full of kelbonite.

465
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:02,878
- Transport will be difficult there.
- There are caves in the mountains.

466
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:09,385
Good, but they're not going
to make it easy for us to get there.

467
00:55:09,635 --> 00:55:15,474
Captain, we activated the transport
inhibitors around the village.

468
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:21,730
Move these people out!

469
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:31,657
- The transporters won't function.
- They're using inhibitors.

470
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:35,077
Locate and destroy them.

471
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:50,509
You're carrying too much.
We have a long climb ahead of us.

472
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:06,275
Three transport inhibitors down.
There's a gap in the field.

473
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:44,730
Father!

474
00:56:55,907 --> 00:56:59,577
Kelbonite deposits
are blocking our transporters.

475
00:56:59,744 --> 00:57:02,998
- Recommendations?
- Let me talkto Picard.

476
00:57:03,248 --> 00:57:07,168
Talk! We should send down
an assault team.

477
00:57:07,335 --> 00:57:12,340
If people get hurt, all the support
we have in the Federation ...

478
00:57:12,507 --> 00:57:17,929
Federation support, Federation
procedures, Federation rules.

479
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:22,518
Look in the mirror,
the Federation is old.

480
00:57:22,768 --> 00:57:27,271
In the past 24 months, they've been
challenged by every major power.

481
00:57:27,438 --> 00:57:30,358
The Borg, the Cardassians,
the Dominion.

482
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:34,362
They all smell the scent of death
on the Federation.

483
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:39,451
You embraced our offer
to give the Federation new life.

484
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:45,541
How badly do you want it?
There are hard choices to be made.

485
00:57:45,706 --> 00:57:52,880
If news gets through of your
captain's brave struggle, -

486
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:59,471
- Federation politicians will waver.
There will be a public debate.

487
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:05,059
Federation allies will want
their say ... Need I go on?

488
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:10,315
Isolinear tags would allow
our transporters to lock onto them.

489
00:58:10,565 --> 00:58:14,652
We'd have to tag every one of them.
We don't have the time.

490
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,157
In 19 hours the Enterprise will
be able to contact the Federation.

491
00:58:19,407 --> 00:58:24,079
- I'll order Riker to turn around.
- Picard's first officer.

492
00:58:24,246 --> 00:58:27,916
Do you really believe he'll listen?

493
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:33,170
My ships
could intercept the Enterprise.

494
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:36,592
I could send them to ...

495
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:40,094
... escort it back.

496
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:45,016
But Commander Riker
might not want to come.

497
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:49,688
Send your ships.

498
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:18,467
- Do you like being a machine?
- I aspire to be more than I am.

499
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:26,224
I know why. So people like us
won't be afraid of you anymore.

500
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:29,478
Don't you ever get tired?

501
00:59:29,643 --> 00:59:33,898
My power cells
continually recharge themselves.

502
00:59:34,065 --> 00:59:39,153
I can't imagine
what it's like to be a machine.

503
00:59:39,403 --> 00:59:44,909
I have often tried to imagine
what it is like to be a child.

504
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:49,331
Really?. For one thing, your legs
are shorter than everyone else's.

505
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:53,168
But they are in
a constant state of growth.

506
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:56,338
- Is it difficult to adapt?
- Adapt?

507
00:59:56,588 --> 01:00:01,342
A child's specifications change
from one moment to the next.

508
01:00:01,592 --> 01:00:06,931
- Do you trip over your own feet?
- Sometimes.

509
01:00:07,181 --> 01:00:11,853
My legs are exactly
87.2 cm in length.

510
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:15,856
They were 87.2 cm
the day I was created.

511
01:00:16,108 --> 01:00:19,610
They will be 87.2 cm
the day I go off-line.

512
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:23,447
I depend on specifications
that do not change.

513
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:30,204
I will never experience growing up
or tripping over my own feet.

514
01:00:30,371 --> 01:00:37,045
But you've never had adults
telling you what to do all the time.

515
01:00:37,295 --> 01:00:44,635
I'd accept that in exchange for
knowing what childhood is like.

516
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:48,889
- Do machines ever play?.
- I play the violin.

517
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:54,478
- My chess is quite advanced.
- No, I mean play for fun.

518
01:00:56,063 --> 01:00:59,818
Androids do not have fun.

519
01:01:00,068 --> 01:01:05,657
If you want to know what it's like
to be a child, learn to play.

520
01:01:18,168 --> 01:01:23,592
- Captain.
- Worf, you need a haircut.

521
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:29,014
Rapid hair growth is experienced
by Klingons during Jaktahla.

522
01:01:29,264 --> 01:01:34,603
Puberty. Although for a Klingon
that scarcely does it justice.

523
01:01:34,768 --> 01:01:40,190
Any mood swings or aggressive
tendencies, you let me know at once.

524
01:01:40,358 --> 01:01:43,777
Yes, sir.
The Ba'ku need some rest.

525
01:01:43,945 --> 01:01:48,282
According to the geo-scan,
this is a safe area.

526
01:01:48,532 --> 01:01:51,536
Very well, break out some rations.

527
01:01:55,789 --> 01:02:00,711
The caves are just over that ridge.
We can hide there.

528
01:02:00,878 --> 01:02:04,715
The Son'a will knowthat
as well as we do.

529
01:02:10,304 --> 01:02:14,809
It's been 300 years
since I've seen a bald man.

530
01:02:17,728 --> 01:02:20,981
Why did you never marry?.

531
01:02:21,231 --> 01:02:24,985
Don't tell me it's because
you haven't got around to it yet.

532
01:02:25,235 --> 01:02:28,155
What's the rush?

533
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:32,911
I should warn you, I've always
been attracted to older women.

534
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:58,853
How are you doing this?

535
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:01,856
No more questions.

536
01:03:16,454 --> 01:03:20,291
- Two Son'a ships approaching.
- ETA?

537
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:24,045
- 18 minutes.
- We can't transmit for one hour.

538
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:29,300
- They're hailing us.
- Tell them our receiver is down.

539
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:33,387
- I don't thinkthey believe us.
- Why not?

540
01:03:34,472 --> 01:03:39,476
Photon torpedo.
A universal method of communication.

541
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:42,813
Yes, when you don't like someone.

542
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:47,068
- Full impulse.
- The manifolds can't handle it.

543
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:51,072
If we don't outrun them,
it won't matter.

544
01:03:51,322 --> 01:03:55,159
- I'll be in engineering.
- Battle stations!

545
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:59,746
Have your boobs started
to firm up?

546
01:03:59,914 --> 01:04:04,001
Not that we care about such things
in this day and age.

547
01:04:04,168 --> 01:04:07,422
Thank you, Data.

548
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:19,099
I've an odd craving for the blood
of a live Kolar beast.

549
01:04:19,266 --> 01:04:22,603
This environment is affecting me.

550
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:27,858
Have you noticed how your
boobs have started to firm up?

551
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,362
Take cover!

552
01:05:17,992 --> 01:05:22,329
Isolinear tags.
Transporters can lock onto them.

553
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:26,250
There's a cavern at the base
of the next hill.

554
01:05:58,365 --> 01:06:01,952
- Shields at 60%.
- "Engineering to bridge."

555
01:06:02,202 --> 01:06:07,708
We're going to blow ourselves up
without help from the Son'a!

556
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:13,213
- What's inside that nebula cluster?.
- Cometary debris. Metreon gas.

557
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:17,885
- We don't want go in there.
- Yes, we do.

558
01:06:18,135 --> 01:06:22,306
It's time to use the Briar Patch
the way Brer Rabbit did.

559
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,574
Inside the caves, quickly.

560
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:42,492
This way.

561
01:06:54,255 --> 01:06:56,257
Aggressive tendencies.

562
01:07:00,677 --> 01:07:06,766
They've detonated an isolytic burst.
A subspace tear is forming.

563
01:07:08,186 --> 01:07:12,273
Subspace weapons were banned
by the Khitomer accord.

564
01:07:12,523 --> 01:07:17,277
- I'll lodge a protest.
- Our warp core is magnetised.

565
01:07:17,445 --> 01:07:21,364
We're pulling the tear
like a zipper across space.

566
01:07:21,615 --> 01:07:25,452
- We could eject the core.
- Will that stop the tear?.

567
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:27,371
You got me.

568
01:07:27,621 --> 01:07:32,960
- Is that your expert opinion?
- It might neutralise the cascade.

569
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:37,213
Subspace weapons are unpredictable.
That's why they're banned.

570
01:07:37,465 --> 01:07:42,719
The tear is closing on us.
Impact in 15 seconds.

571
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,972
Eject the core.

572
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:49,559
- I just did.
- lmpact in ten seconds.

573
01:07:52,396 --> 01:07:54,815
Detonate!

574
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,248
Get me a medic over here.

575
01:08:20,507 --> 01:08:24,011
It worked. The tear is sealed.

576
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:28,765
But there's nothing to stop them
from doing it again.

577
01:08:28,932 --> 01:08:33,604
- Transmission range: 36 minutes.
- We're through running.

578
01:08:53,457 --> 01:08:56,793
Another 43 reported taken.

579
01:09:06,554 --> 01:09:10,725
They're trying to drive us out
so their drones can tag us.

580
01:09:10,975 --> 01:09:15,395
The structural integrity of this
cavern won't hold for long.

581
01:09:15,645 --> 01:09:23,237
- Is there another way out of here?
- Let's trackthe water's course.

582
01:09:33,163 --> 01:09:37,835
I'm reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow
behind that calcite formation.

583
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:41,755
Will this structure hold
if we blast through?

584
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:45,759
I believe it is safe.

585
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:49,095
Fire.

586
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:11,618
Get everybody into those caves.
Set up a forcefield.

587
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:24,631
- Are those pockets of metreon gas?
- Yes, highly volatile.

588
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:29,136
I want to use the ram-scoop
to collect as much of it as we can.

589
01:10:29,386 --> 01:10:36,060
- The purpose being?
- To shove it down their throats.

590
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:41,064
- If the gas ignites ...
- It's our only way out of here.

591
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:45,319
History will remember this
as the Riker manoeuvre.

592
01:10:49,155 --> 01:10:52,158
Access manual steering column.

593
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:58,748
- Controls to manual.
- "Storage cells are at maximum."

594
01:10:58,998 --> 01:11:02,002
They're powering forward weapons.

595
01:11:02,336 --> 01:11:05,255
Blow out the ram-scoop.

596
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:08,759
"Ram"-"scoop released."

597
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:26,944
Captain.

598
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:31,407
- Keep these people moving.
- Bring them out.

599
01:11:40,457 --> 01:11:43,793
It won't be long before
the drones get here.

600
01:11:44,877 --> 01:11:47,965
Keep moving!

601
01:11:49,216 --> 01:11:54,345
There are caves on higher ground.
We'll be safe there.

602
01:11:58,725 --> 01:12:02,770
Take a look at this med-scan.

603
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:06,649
His DNA profile.

604
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:11,654
- How can that be possible?
- Maybe we should askthem.

605
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:28,671
Artim, what are you doing? Come!

606
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:42,394
Is this the last group?
Get them ready to move out.

607
01:12:42,603 --> 01:12:45,689
Anij went to find Artim.

608
01:13:08,962 --> 01:13:15,051
- Go with Tournel!
- No, I want to stay with you!

609
01:13:27,814 --> 01:13:32,069
- Worf to Picard!
- Two life-signs, one is faint.

610
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:36,489
There are almost four metric tons
of rock blocking our way.

611
01:13:36,657 --> 01:13:40,702
That might cause another cave-in.

612
01:13:59,262 --> 01:14:02,349
Anij?

613
01:14:07,854 --> 01:14:11,858
- "Worf to Picard."
- Yes, I can hear you.

614
01:14:12,024 --> 01:14:15,153
We're trying to get to you, sir.

615
01:14:15,862 --> 01:14:19,032
Anij ...

616
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:28,875
Help is on the way.

617
01:14:29,126 --> 01:14:33,880
- Hurry, Anij is hurt.
- "How bad is she?"

618
01:14:36,507 --> 01:14:41,470
- I'm losing her.
- "We're coming as fast as we can."

619
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:54,192
Anij, stay with me.

620
01:14:57,154 --> 01:15:03,326
Help me find the power
to keep you in this moment.

621
01:15:04,493 --> 01:15:08,998
Don't let go of this moment.

622
01:15:24,972 --> 01:15:28,851
- She's stabilising.
- Is it safe to move her?.

623
01:15:29,101 --> 01:15:32,271
Safer than leaving her here.

624
01:15:35,942 --> 01:15:40,529
And you thought
it would take centuries to learn.

625
01:17:11,704 --> 01:17:16,001
Order them to surrender.
You won't be court-martialled.

626
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:23,048
A court martial will let the people
know what is happening here.

627
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,137
The Enterprise has destroyed
one ship, the other is on fire.

628
01:17:28,387 --> 01:17:33,310
The Enterprise was defending itself.
Ru'afo must have attacked.

629
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,148
I can't believe that he didn't
have your consent, Admiral.

630
01:17:38,314 --> 01:17:42,402
I wonder which one of us
will be facing that court martial.

631
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:49,492
- There's nothing to be gained here.
- Right, this is going to end now.

632
01:17:49,743 --> 01:17:55,081
- I'm going to launch the injector.
- No, you're not.

633
01:17:55,247 --> 01:18:00,252
In six hours, every living thing
in this system will be dead.

634
01:18:00,502 --> 01:18:03,840
You would kill your own people?

635
01:18:04,048 --> 01:18:09,011
Your own parents?
Brothers, sisters?

636
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:14,934
Didn't you know?. The Son'a
and the Ba'ku are the same race.

637
01:18:17,686 --> 01:18:20,439
Picard just told us.

638
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:24,819
Our DNA is identical.

639
01:18:25,694 --> 01:18:30,783
Which one were you?
Gal'na? Ro'tin?

640
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:36,456
- They're gone forever.
- What's he talking about?

641
01:18:36,622 --> 01:18:41,502
A century ago, some young people
wanted to live like offlanders.

642
01:18:41,711 --> 01:18:47,466
- They tried to take over.
- And you exiled us to die slowly.

643
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:51,054
You're Ro'tin, aren't you?

644
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:54,640
There's something in the voice.

645
01:18:55,809 --> 01:18:59,395
Would you be his friend, Gal'na?

646
01:18:59,561 --> 01:19:05,527
I helped your mother bathe you.
She still speaks of you.

647
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:09,572
You brought the Federation
into the middle of a blood feud.

648
01:19:09,738 --> 01:19:14,828
The children have returned
to expel their elders.

649
01:19:14,993 --> 01:19:20,123
Except Ru'afo's need for revenge
has escalated into parricide.

650
01:19:23,293 --> 01:19:26,922
It was for the Federation.

651
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:31,261
It was all for the Federation.

652
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:47,819
We're taking this ship out of here.
This mission is over.

653
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:51,530
- It is not over.
- It is over.

654
01:19:57,537 --> 01:20:00,622
I do not take orders from you!

655
01:20:12,385 --> 01:20:18,640
If you launch the injector,
the Federation will pursue you ...

656
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:25,981
The Federation will never know
what happened here.

657
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:56,595
Admiral Dougherty
won't be joining us.

658
01:20:56,762 --> 01:21:00,099
Deploy the collector.

659
01:21:02,435 --> 01:21:06,354
- Do you have a problem with that?
- May I talkto you alone?

660
01:21:06,605 --> 01:21:09,609
- Deploy the collector.
- Yes, sir.

661
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:20,578
- You want to kill them all?
- No one hated them more than you.

662
01:21:20,787 --> 01:21:27,210
We've come a long way. This is the
moment we've planned for so long.

663
01:21:30,128 --> 01:21:34,466
Transfer all Starfleet personnel
to the cargo hold.

664
01:21:34,675 --> 01:21:38,054
See that Picard joins them.

665
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:43,475
The shields in that section
won't protect them from the heat.

666
01:21:43,643 --> 01:21:46,729
Thank you for reminding me.

667
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:34,569
Jean-Luc.

668
01:22:42,952 --> 01:22:46,454
Come with me.

669
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:04,306
It must have been strange for you
as a hostage, -

670
01:23:04,556 --> 01:23:08,894
- surrounded by all the friends
and family you once knew.

671
01:23:09,145 --> 01:23:12,314
All looking
exactly as they did then.

672
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,360
Like looking through
the eyes of childhood again.

673
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:22,158
And here you are,
closing those eyes.

674
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:26,578
Trying not to see what bitterness
has done to the Son'a.

675
01:23:26,746 --> 01:23:31,250
How it's turned Ru'afo
into a madman. And you ...

676
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:34,337
It's turned you into a coward.

677
01:23:34,545 --> 01:23:38,841
A man who denies his own conscience.

678
01:23:39,091 --> 01:23:42,595
Get in.

679
01:23:46,556 --> 01:23:53,021
A coward without the moral courage
to prevent an atrocity.

680
01:23:53,189 --> 01:23:58,694
- Are you pleading for your life?
- I'm not pleading for my life.

681
01:24:00,945 --> 01:24:04,115
I'm pleading for yours.

682
01:24:04,283 --> 01:24:08,996
You can still go home, Gal'na.

683
01:24:18,213 --> 01:24:23,551
Computer, close turbolift doors.

684
01:24:24,386 --> 01:24:27,890
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

685
01:24:28,056 --> 01:24:32,435
- You can disable the injector.
- From the bridge.

686
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:37,065
- The crew is loyal to Ru'afo.
- Perhaps we can lure him away.

687
01:24:37,233 --> 01:24:42,988
As soon as he realises something is
wrong, he'll override my commands.

688
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:49,828
He may not realise something
is wrong. Get me to a transmitter.

689
01:24:49,994 --> 01:24:54,500
I need to speak with Data and Worf
down on the planet.

690
01:25:00,171 --> 01:25:02,632
Initiate separation.

691
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:06,177
Separation in three minutes.

692
01:25:06,427 --> 01:25:10,975
A small craft is approaching.
It's powering up its weapons.

693
01:25:11,182 --> 01:25:15,688
- On screen.
- One person aboard, the android.

694
01:25:15,854 --> 01:25:18,439
He's no threat.

695
01:25:23,112 --> 01:25:27,032
Data to Picard.
They're ignoring my attack.

696
01:25:27,283 --> 01:25:31,036
Keep firing into the shield.
Is Worf in position?

697
01:25:31,203 --> 01:25:36,041
- Yes, he's ready for transport.
- "We're approaching the bridge."

698
01:25:40,712 --> 01:25:45,216
- Separation in one minute.
- He's disrupting our shields.

699
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:50,096
If they go out of phase,
we'll be exposed to the reaction.

700
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:56,936
Very well, destroy that ship.
Do not delay the countdown.

701
01:26:02,984 --> 01:26:06,905
Data to Picard. They are
rotating their shield harmonics.

702
01:26:07,155 --> 01:26:10,408
I am attempting
to return to the surface.

703
01:26:10,576 --> 01:26:15,122
- The Federation ship has been hit.
- Separation in 20 seconds.

704
01:26:16,748 --> 01:26:19,501
- What's that?
- I don't know.

705
01:26:19,752 --> 01:26:24,590
- The systems don't seem affected.
- Separation in ten seconds.

706
01:26:26,925 --> 01:26:30,095
Five seconds.

707
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,682
The injector assembly has separated.

708
01:26:51,867 --> 01:26:56,121
Exactly
as the simulations predicted.

709
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:03,545
I'm not showing any change
in metaphasic flux levels.

710
01:27:03,712 --> 01:27:10,551
- Your scanners are malfunctioning.
- All ship functions are off-line.

711
01:27:10,802 --> 01:27:15,099
How can there be no ship functions
if the view screen is working?

712
01:27:15,306 --> 01:27:19,895
Artificial gravity is stable.
Life support is ...

713
01:27:32,157 --> 01:27:35,661
A holodeck!

714
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:09,819
We were transported to the holoship
when we reset our shields.

715
01:28:10,028 --> 01:28:15,868
Everything we saw was an illusion.
Ru'afo, authorisation Delta 2-1 .

716
01:28:16,076 --> 01:28:19,246
Override all commands
to injector assembly one.

717
01:28:19,453 --> 01:28:24,917
Unable to comply. Injector
assembly one has been deactivated.

718
01:28:33,467 --> 01:28:38,390
All injector sub-systems
aboard the collector are off-line.

719
01:28:38,556 --> 01:28:43,395
De-cloakthe holoship
and engage a tractor beam.

720
01:28:50,819 --> 01:28:56,408
The crew know something is wrong.
I've secured the bridge.

721
01:28:59,243 --> 01:29:04,166
We have 14 long-range transporters.
Are they all useless?

722
01:29:04,332 --> 01:29:08,420
They were locked
after we were beamed here.

723
01:29:08,587 --> 01:29:12,673
Isolate one and re-route it
through the auxiliary processor.

724
01:29:12,925 --> 01:29:17,095
There's nothing we can do.
They have control of our ship.

725
01:29:17,345 --> 01:29:19,722
I'm not going backto our ship.

726
01:29:22,434 --> 01:29:25,604
- Worf, destroy that thing.
- Aye, sir.

727
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:32,610
- Weapons systems are off-line.
- They're re-routing controls.

728
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:40,034
The collector launch sequence
has resumed.

729
01:29:40,577 --> 01:29:44,372
Collector shields have been raised.
Someone's on board.

730
01:29:44,872 --> 01:29:48,126
- It's Ru'afo.
- Can you override the launch?

731
01:29:48,335 --> 01:29:55,466
Not without access codes. There
is self-destruct on the collector.

732
01:29:55,676 --> 01:30:02,390
- Try to beam through those shields.
- It has to be detonated manually.

733
01:30:02,556 --> 01:30:06,978
Transport is possible between the
shield generators within 100 metres.

734
01:30:07,186 --> 01:30:11,315
Take us into position.
Remain at your post.

735
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:16,238
- I need you to beam me back.
- We're approaching the collector.

736
01:30:16,404 --> 01:30:21,993
When the fuel tanks start venting,
weapons fire may ignite the exhaust.

737
01:30:30,918 --> 01:30:35,006
Separation
in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

738
01:30:44,265 --> 01:30:46,935
"Intruder ale"rt.

739
01:31:21,636 --> 01:31:23,637
Captain!

740
01:31:23,889 --> 01:31:26,224
Worf?

741
01:31:32,814 --> 01:31:36,568
Captain Picard
is on board the collector.

742
01:31:36,734 --> 01:31:41,739
Enterprise to Picard!
Do you need assistance?

743
01:31:44,074 --> 01:31:47,412
- I may need a lift in a minute.
- We're on our way.

744
01:31:47,662 --> 01:31:51,248
Separation in one minute.

745
01:32:17,609 --> 01:32:20,278
- Report.
- It's Ru'afo's ship!

746
01:32:20,528 --> 01:32:22,948
On screen.

747
01:32:23,113 --> 01:32:28,869
Sensors are reading over 100 Ba'ku
on board and one Klingon.

748
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:34,208
Target their ventral engines and
life support. Collision course.

749
01:32:37,045 --> 01:32:39,463
Stop!

750
01:32:42,801 --> 01:32:49,056
- We're getting too old for this.
- Soon that won't be a problem.

751
01:32:49,306 --> 01:32:51,725
Separation in 30 seconds.

752
01:32:51,893 --> 01:32:55,814
You're really going to risk
igniting the exhaust?

753
01:32:55,979 --> 01:32:58,899
All right, I will!

754
01:33:08,326 --> 01:33:12,247
- Shields at 60%.
- Hold your course.

755
01:33:14,164 --> 01:33:17,668
- He wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.

756
01:33:19,671 --> 01:33:21,672
Now!

757
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,686
Stand by, Captain. We're on our way.

758
01:33:35,936 --> 01:33:39,356
Sorry, time's up.

759
01:34:15,976 --> 01:34:19,314
What kept you, Number One?

760
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:24,319
The Federation Council
has halted the Ba'ku relocation.

761
01:34:24,485 --> 01:34:27,488
There'll be a top-level review.

762
01:34:27,654 --> 01:34:31,158
- Ru'afo's ship is hailing us.
- On screen.

763
01:34:31,743 --> 01:34:38,917
The Son'a crew want a cease-fire.
We have three minutes of air left.

764
01:34:39,082 --> 01:34:41,752
Prepare to beam aboard.

765
01:34:48,676 --> 01:34:53,597
How will we feel when we leave
this metaphasic radiation?

766
01:34:53,765 --> 01:34:57,601
Your feelings about her
haven't changed.

767
01:34:57,769 --> 01:35:01,939
This place just let them out
for a little fresh air.

768
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:08,779
- How can we bring them back home?
- Askthem.

769
01:35:08,947 --> 01:35:14,284
I'm afraid there's too much
bitterness on both sides.

770
01:35:18,122 --> 01:35:21,376
Mother and son.

771
01:35:21,626 --> 01:35:25,462
- You arranged this?
- To begin the healing process.

772
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:39,726
What am I going to do without you?

773
01:35:39,894 --> 01:35:43,064
I wish I could stay ...

774
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:47,734
But these are perilous times
for the Federation.

775
01:35:47,985 --> 01:35:52,073
I can't abandon it to people
who would threaten -

776
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:56,743
- everything I've spent a lifetime
defending. I have to go back ...

777
01:35:56,994 --> 01:36:02,917
If only to slowthings down
at the Federation Council.

778
01:36:04,918 --> 01:36:10,173
I have 318 days of shore leave
coming, and ...

779
01:36:13,094 --> 01:36:15,430
... I intend to use them.

780
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,942
Data?

781
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:30,944
It's time to go.

782
01:36:31,194 --> 01:36:34,364
I have to go home now.

783
01:36:34,532 --> 01:36:37,452
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
01:36:51,215 --> 01:36:55,051
Mr Data,
I hope we'll see you again.

785
01:37:01,391 --> 01:37:08,064
Data! Don't forget, you have
to have a little fun every day.

786
01:37:08,733 --> 01:37:11,903
Good advice.

787
01:37:22,579 --> 01:37:27,585
Picard to Enterprise.
Seven to beam up.

788
01:37:31,588 --> 01:37:34,007
Energize.
