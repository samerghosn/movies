1
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,419
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

2
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,879
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,670
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

4
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,340
... if somebody told you I was just an
average ordinary guy, not a care in the world...

5
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,300
... somebody lied.

6
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,770
But let me assure you, this
like any story worth telling...

7
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,349
... is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,689
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,939
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.

10
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,780
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,949
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,870
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,039
That's me.

14
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,120
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:53,539
Stop!

16
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,960
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,210
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Blvd.

18
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,629
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,889
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,599
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:19,480
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,240
Would you date him?

23
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,340
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,220
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,970
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,600
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,019
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,230
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,069
Come on, stay together.

30
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,149
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,360
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,079
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,660
- Dad would you ask Hoskins to drive around the corner please.
- Why?

34
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,670
The entrance is right there.

35
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,550
Dad these are public school kids,
I'm not showing up for the field trip in a Rolls.

36
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,089
You want me to trade in my care for a Jetta

37
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:27,050
just because you flunked out of every private school I ever sent you to?

38
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,389
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

39
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,389
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

40
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,889
It's just...

41
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,519
Just what, Harry?

42
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,230
Forget it.

43
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,569
Pete!

44
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,069
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

45
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,569
- Harry! Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks Dad.

46
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,500
- Um, Peter may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

47
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,170
- It's a great honour to meet you sir.
- Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.

48
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,250
Y'know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

49
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,589
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really Brilliant.

50
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,800
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

51
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,300
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

52
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,019
- I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

53
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,850
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

54
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,689
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

55
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,819
I think he wants to adopt you.

56
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,740
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

57
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,709
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

58
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,000
That's amazing!

59
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,090
This is the most advanced electron
microscope in the eastern seaboard.

60
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,459
It's unreal.

61
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,420
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

62
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,139
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.

63
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,560
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

64
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,889
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

65
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,810
For the school paper?

66
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,319
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

67
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,410
...genus Kukulcania.

68
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,000
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web whose strands
have a tensile strength

69
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,459
...proportionately equal to the type of high tension wire...

70
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,589
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

71
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:29,759
Or his father will fire your father.

72
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,509
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

73
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,180
What is going on?

74
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,430
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.

75
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,639
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.

76
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:44,980
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

77
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,689
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.

78
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,029
-Those guys are jerks.
-...an imminent awareness of danger...

79
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,990
A spider-sense.

80
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,279
Hey, look at that spider.

81
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,870
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

82
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,040
It's a defense mechanism.

83
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,500
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

84
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:06,879
Who wouldn't?

85
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,879
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility has...

86
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,430
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

87
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:20,389
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

88
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,269
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

89
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,850
I love them!

90
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,069
Yeah, me too.

91
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,899
You know, spiders can change
their color...

92
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:36,909
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

93
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,200
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

94
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,789
...transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

95
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,090
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

96
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,919
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

97
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,590
There's 14.

98
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,429
I beg your pardon?

99
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,139
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,690
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

101
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:09,899
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?

102
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,149
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

103
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,070
Let's talk about how we listen.

104
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,620
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

105
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,330
...but at Midtown High...

106
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:38,549
Hey, Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

107
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,179
- Sure, yeah.
- Great.

108
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,679
Where do you want me?
Over here?

109
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,220
Yeah, that's great.

110
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,309
Don't make me look ugly.

111
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,519
That's impossible.

112
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,029
Perfect.

113
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,330
- Is that good?
- Great.

114
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,250
That's great.

115
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,840
M.J., let's go!

116
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,970
Wait. Thanks!

117
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
Parker, let's do it.

118
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,389
We've solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

119
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,100
I've already seen the glider.

120
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,559
That's not what I'm here for.

121
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
General Slocum, good to see you again.

122
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,440
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

123
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,519
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

124
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,240
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors pay us a little visit.

125
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,860
I want to see the progress report on
Human performance enhancers.

126
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,029
We tried vapour inhalation with rodent subjects.

127
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,909
They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.

128
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:28,580
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

129
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,830
-In one trial yes.
-It was an aberration.

130
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,669
All the tests since
have been successful.

131
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:36,590
In the trial that went wrong, what happen?
what were the side effects?

132
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,090
Violence, aggression...

133
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,009
...and insanity.

134
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,929
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

135
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,019
With the exception of Dr. Strom our entire staff
certifies the product

136
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,100
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

137
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,110
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

138
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,779
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

139
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,779
I'm going to be frank with you.

140
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,870
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

141
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,789
Norman, the General gave the go-ahead
to request aerospace

142
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,870
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

143
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:18,129
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your so-called performance enhancers

144
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,379
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

145
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:27,009
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

146
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,470
Gentlemen. Ladies.

147
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,990
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilŕ! There is light.

148
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,320
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

149
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,330
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

150
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,080
I'm already on my ass, May.

151
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,750
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

152
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,629
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

153
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:01,169
Hand me that dish. The green one.

154
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,169
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

155
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,509
...and upsizing their profits.

156
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,679
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

157
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,600
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

158
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,519
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

159
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:19,320
Computer...

160
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,279
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

161
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,200
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

162
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:32,789
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

163
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,870
I love you. And Peter loves you.

164
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,379
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

165
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,049
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

166
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,470
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

167
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,220
How you doing? How was the field trip?

168
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,230
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

169
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,899
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks, had a bite.

170
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,480
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

171
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,149
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

172
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,149
What's that all about?

173
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,639
In this recombination lab...

174
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,429
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

175
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,690
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

176
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,690
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,129
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

178
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,629
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

179
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,470
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

180
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,840
Don't be a coward.

181
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,889
Risks are part of laboratory science.

182
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,809
Let me reschedule,
with the proper medical staff and a volunteer.

183
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,480
- If you just give me two weeks...
- Two weeks?

184
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,149
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

185
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,070
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

186
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,909
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

187
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,830
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

188
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,409
40,000 years of evolution...

189
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,340
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

190
00:15:58,139 --> 00:15:59,519
Oh, that's cold.

191
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,240
Norman?

192
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,039
Norman!

193
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,089
Oh, my God.

194
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:20,009
Oh, my God!

195
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,519
Oh, my God! Norman!

196
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,539
Back to formula?

197
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,660
Weird.

198
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:30,960
- Peter?
- Yeah?

199
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,920
Are you all right?

200
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,470
I'm fine.

201
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:40,430
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

202
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,349
Yep. Big change.

203
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,519
- Well, hurry up. You're going to be late.
- Right.

204
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,289
Okay.

205
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,799
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

206
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:17,670
- I got better.
- See?

207
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,170
- Bye, guys.

208
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,549
- You haven't eaten anything, have you got your lunch money?
- Yeah I've got it.

209
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,059
Hey Michaelangelo don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school. Got it?

210
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,019
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

211
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,309
And don't start up with me.

212
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,569
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

213
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,240
You're trash!
You're always going to be trash just like her.

214
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,990
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

215
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:03,049
Hi, M.J.

216
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,430
Hey, M.J.

217
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,230
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

218
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,730
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

219
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,230
I got the car. Hop in.

220
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,279
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

221
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,319
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

222
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:23,819
Or not.

223
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,000
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

224
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,089
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

225
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,130
Tell him to stop.

226
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,799
- Check him out!
- Dork!

227
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,529
Dad!

228
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,869
Dad, are you all right?

229
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,990
Harry.

230
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,329
What are you doing on the floor?

231
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,829
I don't know.

232
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,000
Have you been there all night?

233
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,259
Last night I was...

234
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,839
What?

235
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,849
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

236
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,390
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

237
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,890
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

238
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,099
What?

239
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,859
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.

240
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,400
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

241
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,569
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.

242
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,269
Wow! Great reflexes!

243
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,309
- Thanks.
- No problem.

244
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:22,319
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

245
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:24,740
You just get contacts?

246
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,660
Well, see you.

247
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,960
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

248
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,789
Did you see that?

249
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:24,039
Parker?

250
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,329
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny don't you, freak?

251
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,500
- Flash it was just an accident.
-My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.

252
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,420
-C'mon Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you Flash.

253
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,009
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

254
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,230
Help him, Harry.

255
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,700
How'd he do that?

256
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,029
Which one?

257
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,579
He's all yours, man.

258
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:55,799
Flash, get up!

259
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,559
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

260
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,980
That was amazing.

261
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm out of here. Come on.

262
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,130
Go, web!

263
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,339
Fly.

264
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,009
Up, up and away, web.

265
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:03,009
Shazam!

266
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,849
Go! Go!

267
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,849
Go, web, go!

268
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,720
Tallyho.

269
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,220
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

270
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,680
Bring me some beer.

271
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:32,440
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

272
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,099
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

273
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,609
You're as stupid as your mother.

274
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,069
Where's she going?
Where you going?

275
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:45,490
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

276
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,990
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

277
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,329
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

278
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,039
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

279
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:59,630
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

280
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,549
I guess you can always hear us.

281
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,009
Everybody shouts.

282
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,599
Your aunt and uncle don't.

283
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,309
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

284
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,940
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

285
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,819
You really freaked us out.

286
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,279
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

287
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:24,529
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

288
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:30,829
So where are you going
after you graduate?

289
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,880
I wanna move into the city.

290
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,589
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

291
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,589
Work my way through college.

292
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:48,930
What about you?

293
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,099
Headed for the city too.

294
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:54,059
Can't wait to get out of here.

295
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,730
I wanna...

296
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,480
What?

297
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,569
No, come on. Try me.

298
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,990
I wanna...

299
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,450
...act...

300
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,119
...on-stage.

301
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,539
Really?

302
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:17,079
Oh, that's perfect.

303
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,920
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

304
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,089
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,720
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

306
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,430
Peter, that was first grade.

307
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,430
Well...

308
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,470
...even so.

309
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,390
Sometimes...

310
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,900
...you know people.

311
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:42,650
You can just see what's coming.

312
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,490
What do you see coming for you?

313
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,740
I don't know.

314
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,750
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

315
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,259
And what for me?

316
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,759
For you?

317
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,930
You're gonna light up Broadway.

318
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,769
You know...

319
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:21,769
...you're taller than you look.

320
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,480
I hunch.

321
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,240
Don't.

322
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,329
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

323
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,700
Come on.

324
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,119
I gotta go.

325
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,130
Bye.

326
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,460
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

327
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:46,630
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

328
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,049
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

329
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,880
Pretty tight, huh?

330
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:55,640
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

331
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,640
Cool car.

332
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,400
What's going on in there?

333
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,240
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

334
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:40,079
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

335
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:42,450
Okay. Thanks.

336
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,610
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrased to tell me what it is.

337
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,449
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

338
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,289
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.

339
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,250
I'm going to the downtown library,
I'll see you later.

340
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,829
- Wait. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.

341
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,250
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.

342
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:46,769
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Now wait a minute, we need to talk.

343
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,320
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

344
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,440
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

345
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,659
Because we haven't talked at all for so long,
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are any more.

346
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,829
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

347
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,119
- You start fights at school.
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

348
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:11,289
- Well you sure as hell finished it.
- What was I supposed to do, run away?

349
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,510
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

350
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,219
But, Pete look, you're changing. I know,
I went through exactly the same thing at your age.

351
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,429
No. Not exactly.

352
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,519
Peter... these are the years
when a man changes...

353
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:29,690
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

354
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:32,940
Just be careful who you change into.

355
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,989
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

356
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:42,239
But just because you can
beat him up...

357
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,949
...doesn't give you the right to.

358
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:50,869
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

359
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,460
Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some
kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay?

360
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,050
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.

361
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,559
I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to
preach. And I know I'm not your father--

362
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,559
Then stop pretending to be!

363
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,900
Right.

364
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
I'll pick you up here at 1 0.

365
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:49,559
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

366
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,059
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

367
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:51,730
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

368
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,900
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

369
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,659
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

370
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

371
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,710
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

372
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,469
For $3000...

373
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,260
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

374
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:30,139
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

375
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,809
Who?

376
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,940
I know who.

377
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,940
The Flying Dutchman!

378
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,739
Next.

379
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,869
There's no featherweight
division here smallfry. Next.

380
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,869
No, no. Sign me up.

381
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,710
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

382
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:58,210
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain while participating in said event

383
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,420
and you are indeed participating of your own free will?
- Yes.

384
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,630
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

385
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,469
Told you! Told you!

386
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,469
Winner!

387
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,889
Next victim!

388
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,650
Are you ready for more?

389
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,360
Bone Saw is ready!

390
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,449
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

391
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:35,369
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

392
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,000
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

393
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,880
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

394
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,840
The Human Spider? That's it.
That's the best you got?

395
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:49,139
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

396
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,809
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

397
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:57,230
...the terrifying, the deadly...

398
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,690
...the amazing Spiderman!

399
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,690
- My Name's the Human Spider.
- I don't care, get out there.

400
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,909
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

401
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:13,949
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

402
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,250
I hope you brought your mommy.

403
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:20,670
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

404
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,340
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

405
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
Oh, my God!

406
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,719
Oh, my legs!

407
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,510
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

408
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,679
Kill! Kill! Kill!

409
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,440
Cage! Cage! Cage!

410
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,820
Cage!

411
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,619
Hello? Guys?

412
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,630
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

413
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:08,630
Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

414
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,300
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

415
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:14,300
Hey, freak show!

416
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:17,139
You're going nowhere.

417
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:19,690
I got you for three minutes.

418
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:22,150
Three minutes of playtime.

419
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:32,239
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

420
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:36,489
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

421
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,710
Finish him off!

422
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,429
Smash him!

423
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,349
- Hit him!
- Harder!

424
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:05,690
Kick his spider ass!

425
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,860
Hit him!

426
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,079
One, two, three!

427
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,090
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

428
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,340
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spiderman!

429
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,400
Now get out of here.

430
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:55,860
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

431
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,449
Well, check it again, webhead.

432
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,500
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

433
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:06,079
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

434
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,630
I need that money.

435
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,170
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

436
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:22,599
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

437
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:25,769
Hurry up!

438
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,190
Hey! He stole the gate!

439
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Stop that guy!

440
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,159
Stop him! He's got my money!

441
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:40,619
Thanks.

442
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:44,250
What the hell's the matter with you,
you let him go!

443
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,670
Cut him off and call the cops!

444
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:50,880
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he's going to get away with my money.

445
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,420
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

446
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,239
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

447
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:18,360
Old dude, man.

448
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,739
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

449
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:25,750
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

450
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,340
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

451
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,670
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

452
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,469
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

453
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,139
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

454
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,719
Uncle Ben?

455
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,139
Uncle Ben.

456
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,230
Uncle Ben?

457
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,360
Peter.

458
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,030
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

459
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,869
Peter.

460
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:30,889
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

461
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:35,820
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

462
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:14,849
Get a unit to the rear!

463
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:19,440
I got the back!

464
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,699
Who's there?

465
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,110
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!

466
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,780
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

467
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,449
Answer me!

468
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,119
Stop that guy!

469
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:21,289
Thanks.

470
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,300
See you.

471
00:48:53,949 --> 00:48:57,449
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

472
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:42,619
Oh, no. My God.

473
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,210
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

474
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,519
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

475
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:03,190
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.

476
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:08,769
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

477
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,030
- He's clear! Go!
- I assume you're confident about this test.

478
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,489
Absolutely, Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

479
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,989
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

480
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,079
Nothing would please me more
than to put Norman Osborn out of business.

481
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:28,460
Preflight complete. Mark.

482
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,219
We are picking up an
unidentified object closing fast.

483
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,469
What the hell is that?

484
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,139
Can you see anything?

485
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,969
Oh, my God!

486
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,110
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

487
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,489
Peter!

488
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,239
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

489
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:03,909
Pete. Good news. My Father got the place in
New York so we're all set this Friday.

490
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,619
- Oh that's great!
- You made it.

491
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:11,710
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

492
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,300
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

493
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,300
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

494
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,010
Yeah.

495
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:26,349
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

496
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,769
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

497
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,519
Commencement:

498
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:35,820
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

499
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,329
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

500
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,079
You know what? Whatever.

501
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,079
Your loss.

502
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,329
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

503
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,340
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

504
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,480
Can I fix you something?

505
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,150
No, thanks.

506
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,110
I missed him a lot today.

507
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:03,199
I know.

508
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,789
I miss him too.

509
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,869
But he was there.

510
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,260
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

511
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:24,469
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

512
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:28,309
You loved him...

513
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:32,230
...and he loved you.

514
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:36,769
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

515
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,400
How you were meant for great things.

516
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,280
You won't disappoint him.

517
00:54:16,769 --> 00:54:20,989
With great power
comes great responsibility.

518
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,360
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.

519
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:35,619
Hurry up!

520
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:51,769
This is not a man. My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.

521
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:55,139
They think he's human.
They think he's a man. Could be a woman.

522
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,980
Bobby. Get a load of this!

523
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,409
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and
he climbs up the ropes like a spider web.

524
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:13,829
I see the web and it's a signature,
and I know Spiderman was here.

525
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:16,619
The guy protects us, you know
protects the people.

526
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,539
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wakadoo.

527
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,750
He stinks and I don't like him.

528
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,050
Don't move, lady!

529
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,889
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

530
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:37,230
Those tights and that tight little...

531
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:40,730
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

532
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,690
But we should all just give him
One big hug

533
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:49,489
Look out
Here comes the Spiderman

534
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,909
"Who is Spiderman?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

535
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,880
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

536
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:03,500
Mr. Jameson your wife is on line one
she needs to know if--

537
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,590
- Mr. Jameson there's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem, shut up.

538
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,469
- Well?
- He's news.

539
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,179
- These are really important clients they can't wait.
- They're about to.

540
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,349
- He pulled six people off that subway car.
- Sure from a wreck he probably caused.

541
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:19,690
Something goes wrong and this creepy-crawler is there.
Look at that, he's fleeing the scene.  What's that tell you?

542
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,820
He's not fleeing, he's probably going to
save somebody else. He's a hero!

543
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,780
Then why's he wear a mask, hmm?
What's he got to hide?

544
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,989
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille in the dining room.

545
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,619
- Whichever's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson it's like this,

546
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:36,619
We double-booked page six. See so both
Macy's and Conway's have three-quarters of the same page.

547
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,960
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

548
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,329
Every copy.

549
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,710
Tomorrow morning. Spiderman. Page one with a decent
picture this time. Move Conway to page seven.

550
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,800
- That's a problem.
- Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off.
No make it 5 percent.

551
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,630
- That can't be done.
- Get outta here!

552
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,679
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.

553
00:56:55,809 --> 00:56:57,980
Aw, what is he, shy?

554
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:02,150
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong
we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.

555
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:05,730
Put an ad on the front page.
"Cash money for a picture of Spiderman"

556
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,360
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

557
00:57:21,789 --> 00:57:23,250
Buzz off.

558
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,920
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

559
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,510
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm begging for a job. How about you?

560
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:37,719
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?

561
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:38,929
Yeah.

562
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:43,019
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

563
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,360
That's great MJ.

564
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,150
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Hey counter girl!

565
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,940
Your drawer was short six dollars!

566
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,739
Next time that happens,
I'm gonna take it outta your cheque!

567
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:57,619
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

568
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,119
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

569
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,420
It better not happen no more, hear me?.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

570
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,090
Some dream, huh?

571
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:16,599
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

572
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,559
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

573
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:24,559
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

574
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,559
Oh, yeah. Right.

575
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,900
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

576
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:34,489
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

577
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,159
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

578
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,579
No, I guess not.

579
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:49,170
Thanks, Pete.

580
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,510
We should catch up sometime.

581
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:59,260
Let's get some lunch some evening.

582
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:05,019
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

583
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,940
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

584
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:09,360
I won't.

585
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,280
I won't tell Harry.

586
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:27,039
Timing's perfect. Hey.

587
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:30,539
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

588
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:35,380
Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.

589
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,429
Spent half of it on the phone.

590
00:59:38,969 --> 00:59:43,719
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

591
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,849
Are you all right?

592
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:51,730
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

593
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,989
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

594
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,699
You were late again?

595
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,280
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

596
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:03,699
Around.

597
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:05,579
Peter Parker.

598
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,420
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

599
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:11,670
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

600
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,710
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad!

601
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,170
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

602
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,309
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

603
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:26,349
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

604
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,849
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem.  I'll make a few calls.

605
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,320
I couldn't accept it. I'd like to earn
what I get. I can find my own work.

606
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,150
I respect that.

607
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,989
You want to make it on your own steam.

608
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:41,989
That's great.

609
01:00:42,829 --> 01:00:45,199
What other skills do you have Parker?

610
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:47,539
I was thinking of something in photography.

611
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,750
Hello.

612
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,960
Let's go! Move it!

613
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,800
Watch the street!

614
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,610
Cheese!

615
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:25,829
They're crap.

616
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:29,000
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

617
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:32,369
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.

618
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:34,340
Take them somewhere else then.

619
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:38,840
- Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.
- Tell her we'll just put a rug there.

620
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,179
Sit down. Give me that.

621
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:45,300
I'll give you 300.
That's a standard freelance fee.

622
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:47,809
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?

623
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:51,309
"Spiderman, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."

624
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,110
- Menace? He was protecting that--
- Tell you what, Atticus you take the pictures

625
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,480
I'll make up the headlines, ok? all right?
That ok with you.

626
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,650
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

627
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,610
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

628
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,869
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

629
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,699
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

630
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:13,210
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown,
maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.

631
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:16,380
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

632
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,250
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Best I can do. Get outta here.

633
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,800
Bring me more photos.

634
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

635
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,260
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

636
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:31,480
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.

637
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,389
I'm Peter Parker.

638
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:38,070
I'm a photographer.

639
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,400
Yes. I can see that.

640
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:50,949
As of today...

641
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:55,119
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

642
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:59,800
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

643
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,800
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

644
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,139
...costs are down, revenues are up...

645
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,219
...and our stock
has never been higher.

646
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:13,809
Wonderful news, Norman. Woderful.
In fact, it's the reason for selling the company.

647
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:15,889
What?

648
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:21,230
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.

649
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,239
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

650
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,570
Why wasn't I told?

651
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:29,829
The last thing they want is a power struggle
with entrenched management.

652
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,409
The deal is off if you come with it.

653
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:36,000
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

654
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,170
You can't do this to me.

655
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,630
I started this company.

656
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,090
You know how much I sacrificed?!

657
01:03:50,889 --> 01:03:56,389
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

658
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:00,940
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

659
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,610
I'm sorry.

660
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,739
You're out, Norman.

661
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:17,119
Am I?

662
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,590
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.

663
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:24,090
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.

664
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:27,090
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

665
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:07,800
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

666
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,510
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

667
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,219
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

668
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,139
I think you're beautiful.

669
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:36,199
MJ would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.

670
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,550
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

671
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:54,800
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.

672
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:09,320
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

673
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:15,489
What is that?

674
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,579
That's our glider!

675
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,420
What the hell was that?

676
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,239
Code three! Code three!

677
01:07:15,219 --> 01:07:17,429
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

678
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:26,849
Harry! Help me! Harry!

679
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,570
Out, am I?

680
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,329
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

681
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:46,210
Hello, my dear.

682
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,039
It's Spiderman!

683
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,510
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

684
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,349
Somebody help him!

685
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:10,610
No!

686
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,150
Mommy!

687
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:17,109
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.

688
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:20,199
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

689
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:27,250
Impressive.

690
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:54,979
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

691
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,390
Hold on!

692
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:24,050
Watch out!

693
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:36,979
We'll meet again, Spiderman!

694
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:40,029
Hold on Mary Jane!

695
01:10:22,449 --> 01:10:25,159
Well, beats taking the subway.

696
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,619
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

697
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:29,909
Wait.

698
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:31,329
Who are you?

699
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,079
- You know who I am.
- I do?

700
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,920
Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.

701
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,520
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

702
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,359
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm going to come over.

703
01:10:57,979 --> 01:10:59,689
No, I'm gonna come...

704
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:03,449
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

705
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:06,619
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

706
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:09,079
...I want to buy you something.

707
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,579
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

708
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:17,289
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

709
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,510
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

710
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,430
Don't let the bedbugs...

711
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,140
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

712
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:38,479
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

713
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,479
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

714
01:11:42,609 --> 01:11:45,699
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

715
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,279
You're right.

716
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:50,699
I didn't.

717
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:57,119
I'm gonna get some rest.

718
01:11:58,329 --> 01:12:00,630
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

719
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,460
What was that thing?

720
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:05,380
I don't know.

721
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,180
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

722
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:27,569
Somebody there?

723
01:12:27,529 --> 01:12:28,359
Somebody.

724
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,029
Somebody.

725
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:32,909
Who said that?

726
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:36,909
Don't play the innocent with me.

727
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:42,039
You've known all along.

728
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,420
Where are you?

729
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:51,640
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

730
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:00,350
I'm right here.

731
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,109
I don't understand.

732
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:08,279
Did you think it was coincidence?

733
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:12,069
So many good things,
all happening for you.

734
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:15,909
All for you. Norman.

735
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:19,869
What do you want?

736
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,460
To say what you won't.

737
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,300
To do what you can't.

738
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:30,050
To remove those in your way.

739
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,970
The board members.

740
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,640
You killed them.

741
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:40,350
We killed them.

742
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,729
We?

743
01:13:41,899 --> 01:13:43,479
Remember?

744
01:13:43,609 --> 01:13:46,319
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

745
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:49,989
The performance enhancers.

746
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:55,449
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

747
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:59,460
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

748
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:02,500
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

749
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:05,170
And it's only the beginning.

750
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:11,010
There's only one who can stop us.

751
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,180
Or imagine if he joined us.

752
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:23,189
Spiderman. And the Green Goblin.

753
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:26,689
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

754
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:29,859
- These weirdo's all gotta have a name now.
- Mr. Jameson Spiderman...

755
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:31,699
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

756
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:36,659
Call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin,
I want a quarter every time somebody says it.

757
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:39,159
How about "Green Meanie"?

758
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:42,210
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was
trying to save it. That's slander.

759
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:44,710
It is not. I resent that.

760
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,710
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

761
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,550
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.

762
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,760
I trust my barber.

763
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,090
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!

764
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:59,060
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

765
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,689
Jameson, you slime.

766
01:15:09,859 --> 01:15:13,199
Who's the photographer who takes the
pictures of Spiderman?

767
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:16,319
- I don't know who he is.  His stuff comes in the mail.
- Liar!

768
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:19,489
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

769
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:22,579
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

770
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,039
Set him down, tough guy.

771
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:29,880
- Speak of the devil.
- Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.

772
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:32,670
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?.

773
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,340
Sleep...

774
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:53,819
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

775
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:58,409
No, you're not dead yet.

776
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:00,779
Just paralyzed...

777
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:02,909
...temporarily.

778
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:07,000
You're an amazing creature,
Spiderman.

779
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,880
You and I are not so different.

780
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:13,920
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

781
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:17,010
Well, to each his own.

782
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:20,140
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

783
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,430
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

784
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,899
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

785
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:32,689
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

786
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:37,399
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

787
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:38,659
Why bother?

788
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:43,579
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

789
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:47,000
There are eight million people
in this city.

790
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:51,500
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

791
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:55,670
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

792
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,260
You, me...

793
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,760
...we're exceptional.

794
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,680
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

795
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:08,560
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

796
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:12,310
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

797
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:15,279
What we could create.

798
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:17,859
Or we could destroy.

799
01:17:17,989 --> 01:17:21,989
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

800
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:27,079
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

801
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:31,960
Think about it, hero.

802
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:49,270
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

803
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:01,069
It's me again.

804
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:02,869
How was your audition?

805
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:06,079
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

806
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:08,199
...told my aunt, told me.

807
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:10,000
So you just came by?

808
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,829
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

809
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,590
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

810
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,340
So how'd it go?

811
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:25,100
They said I needed acting lessons.

812
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:29,020
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

813
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:34,520
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

814
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,939
I'd like a cheeseburger.

815
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:41,859
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

816
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,699
Come with us.

817
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,619
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

818
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:51,039
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

819
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,039
It's not?

820
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:56,130
Why so interested?

821
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,300
I'm not.

822
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,920
You're not?

823
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:04,300
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

824
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:06,350
Why would you be?

825
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,560
I, that's a...

826
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,270
I don't know.

827
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:17,310
Sorry you won't come with us.

828
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:21,739
I'd better run, tiger.

829
01:19:30,409 --> 01:19:32,449
Hey, check it out, man.

830
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:34,289
Come on, man.

831
01:19:37,789 --> 01:19:41,090
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

832
01:19:58,939 --> 01:20:00,439
Get off me!

833
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,229
Wait!

834
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,439
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

835
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:46,989
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

836
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:49,069
I was in the neighborhood.

837
01:20:50,909 --> 01:20:53,579
You are amazing.

838
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,250
Some people don't think so.

839
01:20:58,289 --> 01:21:01,340
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

840
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:05,300
Do I get to say thank you this time?

841
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,680
Wait.

842
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:18,789
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there!

843
01:22:18,909 --> 01:22:21,079
- Let me go!
- I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.

844
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,750
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

845
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,300
Look! Up there!

846
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,720
Save my baby, please!

847
01:22:58,409 --> 01:22:59,579
No!

848
01:23:07,289 --> 01:23:11,340
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

849
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:15,300
God bless you, Spiderman.
Bless you.

850
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,260
Don't let him get away!

851
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:20,720
Hold it right there! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

852
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:24,229
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

853
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:27,020
I'm going.

854
01:23:28,649 --> 01:23:31,739
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back chief.

855
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:33,279
Go! Go!

856
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,909
Where are you?

857
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,539
Where are you?

858
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,300
I'm gonna get you out of here!

859
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,390
It's okay.

860
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:09,020
You're pathetically predictable.

861
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,109
Like a moth to the flame.

862
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:14,449
What about my generous proposal?

863
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:18,319
Are you in or are you out?

864
01:24:18,489 --> 01:24:24,460
- It's you who's out Gobby. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

865
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:26,369
Oh, great.

866
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,829
No one says no to me!

867
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:18,590
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

868
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,350
He's here.

869
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,640
Are you ready?

870
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:29,140
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

871
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:32,439
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

872
01:25:32,609 --> 01:25:36,069
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

873
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:39,029
Who is this lovely young lady?

874
01:25:39,149 --> 01:25:43,489
I'd like you to meet my father Norman Osborn.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

875
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:46,369
How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

876
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:50,289
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

877
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,840
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

878
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:02,180
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

879
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,680
Peter?

880
01:26:14,689 --> 01:26:16,439
Is that you?

881
01:26:21,859 --> 01:26:26,079
How strange. There's nobody here.

882
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:37,000
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

883
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:12,250
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

884
01:27:12,369 --> 01:27:14,170
Sorry I'm late.
It's a jungle out there.

885
01:27:14,289 --> 01:27:18,250
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

886
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:21,550
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

887
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,300
...and we can say grace.

888
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,600
Here we go.

889
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,899
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

890
01:27:41,649 --> 01:27:43,989
Will you do the honors?

891
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:58,920
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

892
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:07,090
Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

893
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,800
Well, let me see.

894
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,510
Oh, my goodness.

895
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,180
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

896
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:16,479
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

897
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:21,979
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment
and we are going to do things properly.

898
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:26,029
How did you say that happened?

899
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:28,159
Bike messenger.

900
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:30,329
Knocked me down.

901
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:39,380
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
- Why?

902
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,670
Something has come to my attention.

903
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,130
Are you all right?

904
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,840
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

905
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:51,850
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

906
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,060
Dad, what are you doing?

907
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,229
I plan this whole thing so you can meet MJ
and now you've got to leave?

908
01:28:58,189 --> 01:28:59,689
I've got to go.

909
01:28:59,979 --> 01:29:04,149
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

910
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:08,319
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing
around because she likes your personality?

911
01:29:08,529 --> 01:29:11,579
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

912
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:17,159
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after
your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

913
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:18,619
You're wrong about her Dad.

914
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:22,380
A word to the not so wise about your little girlfriend,

915
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,420
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

916
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:39,350
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

917
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,520
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

918
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:46,609
That creep is my father, all right
If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is

919
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:49,199
so just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand.

920
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:51,029
Harry Osborn!

921
01:29:52,069 --> 01:29:54,159
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

922
01:29:57,079 --> 01:30:00,460
Spiderman is all but invincible.

923
01:30:00,579 --> 01:30:03,750
But Parker, we can destroy him.

924
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,300
I can't.

925
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,470
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

926
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,970
Parker must be educated.

927
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,430
What do I do?

928
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,729
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

929
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:21,939
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

930
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:23,479
Yes?

931
01:30:23,609 --> 01:30:25,569
And then grant his wish.

932
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:27,779
But how?

933
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:32,279
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

934
01:30:32,449 --> 01:30:33,659
Tell me how!

935
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:35,989
The heart, Osborn.

936
01:30:36,199 --> 01:30:39,289
First, we attack his heart.

937
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:44,670
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

938
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,840
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

939
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:51,930
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

940
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,229
Deliver us!

941
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:03,810
Finish it!

942
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:08,029
- Finish it!
- From evil!

943
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:15,909
Two milligrams IV.

944
01:31:17,659 --> 01:31:18,949
Get the BP.

945
01:31:19,329 --> 01:31:22,119
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

946
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:25,130
Yes she's going to be ok.
Look you're going to have to leave right now.

947
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:26,380
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

948
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,630
Those horrible yellow eyes!

949
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:38,010
He knows who I am.

950
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:23,560
I'm sorry.

951
01:32:27,229 --> 01:32:29,729
- Will she be okay?
- She's going to be fine.

952
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:32,569
She's been sleeping all day.

953
01:32:33,529 --> 01:32:36,319
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

954
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:43,409
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

955
01:32:43,539 --> 01:32:47,289
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

956
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,460
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

957
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,090
I haven't called him back.

958
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,880
The fact is...

959
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:00,890
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

960
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:03,270
At least I think I am.

961
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:07,979
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

962
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:11,399
Would I know his name, this guy?

963
01:33:11,569 --> 01:33:14,489
You'll think I'm a stupid little
girl with a crush.

964
01:33:14,609 --> 01:33:16,029
Trust me.

965
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:17,529
It's funny.

966
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:23,489
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

967
01:33:23,619 --> 01:33:27,039
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

968
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:30,210
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

969
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:34,710
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?

970
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,800
No, no, not Spiderman,
not a chance in the world.

971
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:39,640
I know him a little bit.

972
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,720
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

973
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:46,060
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

974
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:47,850
What'd he say?

975
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:49,770
I said...

976
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:55,149
He asked me what I thought about you.

977
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:58,109
And what did you say?

978
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:02,909
I said, "Spiderman."

979
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:08,119
I said, "The great thing about M. J...

980
01:34:08,289 --> 01:34:09,869
...is...

981
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:14,039
...when you look in her eyes...

982
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,800
...and she's looking back in yours...

983
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,800
...everything feels...

984
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:26,850
...not quite normal.

985
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,890
Because you feel...

986
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:32,060
...stronger...

987
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,229
...and weaker at the same time.

988
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,399
You feel excited...

989
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:43,319
...and at the same time...

990
01:34:43,909 --> 01:34:45,579
...terrified.

991
01:34:47,869 --> 01:34:52,210
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

992
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:57,250
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

993
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,840
It's as if you've...

994
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:05,640
...reached the unreachable...

995
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:09,930
...and you weren't ready for it."

996
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:15,149
You said that?

997
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:18,279
Well, something like that.

998
01:36:02,529 --> 01:36:04,069
Dad?

999
01:36:09,369 --> 01:36:11,500
Dad, is that you?

1000
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:19,590
What is it?

1001
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,840
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1002
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,560
She's in love with Peter.

1003
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:32,640
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1004
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:35,939
And how does he feel about her?

1005
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:39,899
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1006
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:46,109
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1007
01:36:48,989 --> 01:36:50,779
I'm so sorry.

1008
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:56,710
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

1009
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:01,670
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1010
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,670
That's no excuse.

1011
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:06,470
I'm proud of you.

1012
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:11,890
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.

1013
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:15,310
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1014
01:37:29,409 --> 01:37:31,239
Wake up, little spider.

1015
01:37:31,369 --> 01:37:32,909
Wake up.

1016
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:35,829
Go home, dear.

1017
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,369
You look awful.

1018
01:37:37,539 --> 01:37:39,880
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1019
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,380
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1020
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,260
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1021
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:51,970
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1022
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,470
A smile. Finally.

1023
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:58,979
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1024
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,439
Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.

1025
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:07,029
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J. 's family moved in next door.

1026
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:11,239
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1027
01:38:11,409 --> 01:38:17,710
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel?"

1028
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:21,460
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1029
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:26,880
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1030
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:30,840
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1031
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:35,640
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1032
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,979
You're so mysterious all the time.

1033
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,979
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1034
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:46,149
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1035
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:49,029
Everybody else knows.

1036
01:38:51,909 --> 01:38:53,239
I'll be right back.

1037
01:38:53,909 --> 01:38:55,239
But...

1038
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:04,590
Come on, pick up.

1039
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:08,050
- Hey M.J.
-Hi. Sing your song at the beep.

1040
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:11,130
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1041
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:14,260
Hello? You there?

1042
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:19,270
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1043
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:20,850
All right, well...

1044
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:22,310
Don't...

1045
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,310
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1046
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:27,020
Hello?

1047
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:33,159
Can Spiderman come out to play?

1048
01:39:33,319 --> 01:39:35,119
Where is she?

1049
01:40:21,329 --> 01:40:23,039
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1050
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:27,880
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

1051
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,210
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

1052
01:40:48,979 --> 01:40:50,770
Goblin, what have you done?

1053
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:37,109
Spiderman!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1054
01:41:37,449 --> 01:41:39,159
Because you never know...

1055
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:44,079
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1056
01:41:45,159 --> 01:41:47,829
Let die the woman you love...

1057
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:57,220
...or suffer the little children.

1058
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:02,100
- Spiderman!
- Save us!

1059
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:04,890
Save us!

1060
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:07,770
Make your choice, Spiderman...

1061
01:42:07,939 --> 01:42:11,359
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1062
01:42:11,479 --> 01:42:13,609
Don't do it, Goblin!

1063
01:42:13,729 --> 01:42:16,689
We are who we choose to be.

1064
01:42:16,899 --> 01:42:19,699
- Now, choose!
- No!

1065
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:49,979
Everybody stay still!

1066
01:42:59,449 --> 01:43:00,779
Ahoy up there!

1067
01:43:00,899 --> 01:43:03,909
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1068
01:43:11,369 --> 01:43:15,539
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1069
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,210
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1070
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:25,350
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1071
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,100
Trust me.

1072
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,439
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1073
01:43:36,729 --> 01:43:38,819
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1074
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:40,689
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1075
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,770
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1076
01:44:21,609 --> 01:44:24,859
It's time to die.

1077
01:44:31,829 --> 01:44:35,710
Come on up here dumb gu
I got a little something for ya.

1078
01:44:35,829 --> 01:44:39,289
Leave Spiderman alone.
You gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?

1079
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,470
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1080
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:47,180
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1081
01:44:59,649 --> 01:45:01,479
Spiderman, watch out!

1082
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:37,600
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1083
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:41,149
I offered you friendship...

1084
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:43,189
...and you spat in my face.

1085
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:37,960
You've spun your last web, Spiderman.

1086
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:41,460
Had you not been so selfish, your little
girlfriend's death

1087
01:46:41,579 --> 01:46:43,289
...would have been quick and painless.

1088
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,880
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1089
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:52,010
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1090
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,640
M.J. and I...

1091
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:02,770
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1092
01:47:56,529 --> 01:47:58,119
Peter, stop!

1093
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,750
Stop! It's me.

1094
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:11,220
Mr. Osborn.

1095
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,930
Peter, thank God for you.

1096
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:15,470
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1097
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:18,680
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1098
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:20,600
Don't let him take me again.

1099
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,810
I beg you. Protect me.

1100
01:48:22,939 --> 01:48:26,560
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1101
01:48:26,689 --> 01:48:28,229
But not you.

1102
01:48:28,859 --> 01:48:32,859
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1103
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:35,159
I would never hurt you.

1104
01:48:35,319 --> 01:48:37,279
I knew from the beginning...

1105
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:40,409
...if anything ever happened to me...

1106
01:48:40,539 --> 01:48:42,710
...it was you I could count on.

1107
01:48:42,829 --> 01:48:46,250
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1108
01:48:46,789 --> 01:48:48,670
Thank God for you.

1109
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:51,090
Give me your hand.

1110
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:55,680
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1111
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:59,890
I've been like a father to you.

1112
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:03,100
Be a son to me now.

1113
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:06,770
I have a father.

1114
01:49:07,479 --> 01:49:10,020
His name was Ben Parker.

1115
01:49:11,859 --> 01:49:13,359
Godspeed, Spiderman.

1116
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,800
Peter.

1117
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:37,970
Don't tell Harry.

1118
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:11,380
What have you done?

1119
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,130
What have you done?!

1120
01:50:41,239 --> 01:50:43,329
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1121
01:50:44,199 --> 01:50:47,369
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1122
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:52,840
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1123
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:56,710
One day Spiderman will pay.

1124
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:01,720
I swear on my father's grave,
Spiderman will pay.

1125
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,560
Thank God for you, Peter.

1126
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:11,729
You're the only family I have.

1127
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:38,550
No matter what I do...

1128
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:41,840
... no matter how hard I try...

1129
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:46,260
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1130
01:51:56,939 --> 01:51:59,319
You must miss him so much.

1131
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:03,319
It's been so hard without him.

1132
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:09,119
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1133
01:52:10,869 --> 01:52:12,710
When I was up there...

1134
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:16,250
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1135
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,720
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1136
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:26,220
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1137
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:30,100
It was you, Pete.

1138
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,850
I kept thinking:

1139
01:52:33,229 --> 01:52:36,060
"I hope I make it through this...

1140
01:52:37,479 --> 01:52:41,899
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1141
01:52:43,239 --> 01:52:44,779
Really?

1142
01:52:45,109 --> 01:52:50,949
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1143
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,159
...who makes me feel...

1144
01:52:54,579 --> 01:52:58,340
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1145
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,130
That I'm just...

1146
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,300
...me.

1147
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,300
And that's okay.

1148
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,970
The truth is...

1149
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,890
...I love you.

1150
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:18,939
I love you so much, Peter.

1151
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:44,420
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1152
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:46,510
I can't...

1153
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:50,180
You can't what?

1154
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:52,770
Tell you...

1155
01:53:54,430 --> 01:53:58,810
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1156
01:53:59,859 --> 01:54:03,819
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1157
01:54:04,689 --> 01:54:06,699
I want you to know...

1158
01:54:07,069 --> 01:54:09,779
...that I will always be there
for you.

1159
01:54:09,949 --> 01:54:13,949
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1160
01:54:14,909 --> 01:54:16,960
I promise you that.

1161
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:22,539
I will always be your friend.

1162
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:27,340
Only a friend...

1163
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:29,760
...Peter Parker?

1164
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:34,770
That's all I have to give.

1165
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:03,789
Whatever life holds in store for me...

1166
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:06,340
I will never forget these words,

1167
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:12,090
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "

1168
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,510
This is my gift.

1169
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,810
My curse.

1170
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:19,229
Who am I?

1171
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:20,979
I'm Spiderman.
