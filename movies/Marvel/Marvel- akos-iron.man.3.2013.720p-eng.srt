00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,930
A famous man once said...

3
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,888
"We create our own demons".

4
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:17,006
Who said that? What does that even mean?
Didn't matter.

5
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,263
I said it cause he said it.

6
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:21,971
So now he was famous and basically
getting said by two well-known guys.

7
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:24,326
I don't, uh...

8
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:25,628
I'm gonna start again.

9
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:29,713
Let's track this from the beginning.

10
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,694
Half-hour 'till the ball drops.

11
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:11,908
Tony Stark, great speech man!

12
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:13,325
I gave a speech?

13
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:14,573
- How was it? - Edifying. - Unintelligible.

14
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:17,793
Really? That's my favorite
kind, a winning combo.

15
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,951
- Hey, uh, where are we going?
- Uh, to town on each other,

16
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,700
probably back at your house.
I want to see your research.

17
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,143
Okay, you can see my
research, but that's...

18
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,799
I'm not going to show you my "town".

19
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:28,692
- Mr. Stark, Ho Yinsen.
- Oh, I finally met a man called Ho.

20
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,859
I'd like to introduce you
to our guest, Doctor Wu.

21
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,795
- Oh this guy. - Mr. Stark.

22
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:34,551
Hey.

23
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,039
You're a heart doctor, she's going
to need a cardiologist after I...

24
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,170
- Bye! - Perhaps another time?

25
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,421
It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999.

26
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,765
The old days.

27
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:53,590
I never thought they'd
come back to bite me.

28
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,365
Why would they?

29
00:01:55,194 --> 00:02:00,245
Hey Tony! Aldrich Killian,
I'm a big fan of your work.

30
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,573
- My work? - Who is he? He means me.

31
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,807
Well, of course, but Miss
Hansen my organization...

32
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:07,612
...has been tracking your
research since year two of M.I.T.

33
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,252
Oh wow, he made it. He made the cut.

34
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,957
- What floor you going to, pal?
- Well now, that is an appropriate question.

35
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:17,271
The ground floor, actually, of a
proposal I'm putting together myself.

36
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:21,134
It's a privately-funded think tank
called "Advanced Idea Mechanics".

37
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:25,175
Uh, she'll take both. One to
throw away and one to not call.

38
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:28,889
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or
AIM for short, you get it?

39
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,593
I see that 'cause it's on your T-shirt.

40
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:31,509
Oh!

41
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:34,454
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

42
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,745
Thank you. I'll call you.

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,393
I am titillated by the notion of working with you.
- Yeah?

44
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,350
I'm going to ditch these clowns...

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,516
...I'll see you up on the
roof in five minutes.

46
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:46,372
I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real
quick if you know what I'm talkin' about.

47
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:47,719
I'll see you up there!

48
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:48,812
Damn betcha.

49
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,921
- Come on, I thought that was just a theory.
- Well... it was.

50
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,687
If I'm right, we can access
the area of the brain...

51
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,795
that governs repair and chemically recode it.
- That's incredible.

52
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,712
Essentially, you're hacking into the
genetic operating system of a...

53
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:03,008
- ...living organism. - Exactly.

54
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:08,633
Can you not touch my plant? It's not...
she doesn't like it. She prefers...

55
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,024
She's not like the others.

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,431
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.

57
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,432
Happy, leave her ficus alone.

58
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,768
No, seriously, don't...

59
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:17,221
- And you're starting with plants?
- For now, yeah.

60
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,150
I'm calling it "Extremis".

61
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,330
- Well, it's... - Human application.

62
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,340
Exactly! Exactly!
Dentra-degree vitalization.

63
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:27,787
Disease prevention.

64
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,413
Even limb regrowth.

65
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,489
You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.

66
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,472
- Wow! - In Switzerland.

67
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:37,475
- That's better. - This week.

68
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,288
You almost bought it, didn't you?

69
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:53,158
This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.

70
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,668
Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?

71
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,310
- We're good. - Stay down.

72
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,508
You're right on me...

73
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,628
What the hell was that?

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,424
What was that?

75
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,106
It's a glitch in my work.

76
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,498
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

77
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,038
Oh, it's not Y2K...

78
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,593
Hey, Happy New Year!

79
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:13,449
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

80
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,588
Alright, I'll see you in the
morning, Okay? Good night.

81
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:15,941
- You good?

82
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,449
- Yep. - I'll be right outside.

83
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:17,874
- Okay, cool.

84
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:43,500
So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons.

85
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,048
And I didn't even know it.

86
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,639
Yeah, those were good times.

87
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,790
Then I moved on.

88
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,668
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said "Goodbye" to the party scene.

89
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,048
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

90
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,218
These days I'm a changed man.

91
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,079
I'm different now.

92
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm... well, you know who I am.

93
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:09,468
Sir, please may I request...

94
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:12,288
...just a few hours to calibrate... - Nope!

95
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,129
Micro-repeater implanting
sequence complete!

96
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,954
As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a...

97
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:21,968
...safety briefing for
you to entirely ignore.

98
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,619
Which I will.

99
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:25,038
Alright, let's do this.

100
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:30,009
Dummy. Hi Dummy. How did you
get that cap on your head?

101
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,117
You earned it.

102
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,442
Hey. Hey!

103
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:35,889
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

104
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,230
Blood on my mat, handle it.

105
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,449
Sir, may I remind you that you've
been awake for nearly 72 hours.

106
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,610
Focus up ladies. Good evening...

107
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,420
...and welcome to the birthing suite.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,163
I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival...

109
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,029
...of your bouncing, badass baby brother.

110
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:56,283
Start titan and go white.
Stamp date and time.

111
00:05:57,302 --> 00:06:00,149
Mark 42 autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.

112
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,752
Initialize sequence.

113
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,048
Jarvis, drop my needle.

114
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,108
Crap.

115
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:51,579
Alright, I think we got this.
Send them all.

116
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,139
Probably just a little fast, slow it down.
Slow it down just a... little bit.

117
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,720
Cool it, will you Jarvis?

118
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,237
Come on.

119
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,129
I ain't scared of you.

120
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,899
I'm the best.

121
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:45,389
As always sir, a great
pleasure watching you work.

122
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,088
I guess 72 hours is a long
time between siestas.

123
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:52,158
Didn't think it could get any worse.

124
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,389
Then they had to go and turn on the TV.

125
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,098
That's when 'He' happened.

126
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,228
Some people call me a terrorist.

127
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,269
I consider myself a teacher.

128
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,790
America...

129
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:26,298
Ready for another lesson?

130
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,149
In 1864 in Sand Creek, Colorado....

131
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:34,197
The U.S. military waited until the friendly
Cheyenne Braves had all gone hunting.

132
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:38,448
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind.

133
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:42,078
And claim their land.

134
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:48,169
39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem
Air Base in Kuwait was attacked.

135
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,229
I did that.

136
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:54,969
A quaint military church, filled
with wives and children of course.

137
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:00,649
The soldiers were out on maneuvers.

138
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:05,229
The "Braves" were away.

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,820
President Ellis, you continue to resist
my attempts to educate you, sir.

140
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,240
And now, you've missed me again.

141
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:20,578
You know who I am. You
don't know where I am.

142
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,860
And you'll never see me coming.

143
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:30,568
...and now that we seem to be back, let's recap
some of the frightening developments in this story.

144
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,879
American airways were hijacked.

145
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,399
The nation remains on high alert.

146
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,969
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.

147
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:41,990
Central to my administration's response to this
terrorist event is a newly-minted resource.

148
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,869
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.

149
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,698
The American people will soon
know him as the Iron Patriot.

150
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,739
And how is President Ellis responding?

151
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,190
By taking the guy they call "War
Machine" and giving him a paint job.

152
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,440
The same suit but painted red,
white and blue, look at that.

153
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,339
And they've also renamed him Iron Patriot.

154
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,869
You know, just in case the
paint was too subtle.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,889
It tested well with focus groups, alright?

156
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,658
- I am Iron Patriot. - Listen.

157
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,645
War Machine was a little
too aggressive, alright.

158
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,788
This sends a better message.

159
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:20,318
So what's really going on? With Mandarin.

160
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,849
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

161
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:29,008
It's classified information, Tony.

162
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:32,188
- Okay, there've been nine bombings.
- Nine.

163
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:33,820
The public only knows about three.

164
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,959
But here's the thing...
nobody can ID a device.

165
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:38,429
There's no bomb casings.

166
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,538
You know I can help.

167
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:44,009
Just ask. I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit. I got...

168
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:44,529
Bomb disposal.

169
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:45,970
Catches explosions mid-air.

170
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,770
When's the last time you
got a good night's sleep?

171
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,639
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

172
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,783
People are concerned about you, Tony.

173
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,828
I'm concerned about you.

174
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,006
You gonna come at me like that?

175
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:55,870
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...

176
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,068
...tator.
- Would you mind signing my drawing?

177
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:02,004
If Richard doesn't mind. You
alright with this, Dick?

178
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,130
Fine with me.

179
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:06,370
- What is your name? - Erin.

180
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,399
I loved you in "A Christmas
Story" by the way.

181
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,359
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

182
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:16,327
After New York, aliens, come on.

183
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,739
They need to look strong.

184
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,029
Stopping the Mandarin is a
priority, but it's not...

185
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,838
It's not superhero business.

186
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:23,740
No, it's not. Quite frankly.

187
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,129
It's American business.

188
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:27,254
That's why I said. I... got it.

189
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,649
Are you okay?

190
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:30,830
I broke the crayon.

191
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,459
Are you okay, Mr. Stark?

192
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,597
Take it easy. Tony...

193
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:38,119
How did you get out of the wormhole?

194
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,749
- Tony... - What did you say?

195
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:46,938
Sorry. Have to check on the suit...
make sure... okay.

196
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,709
Check the heart, check the,
check the, is it the brain?

197
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:55,999
No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.

198
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,019
Okay, so I was poisoned?

199
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:03,719
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.

200
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,048
Me?

201
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,208
Come on man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

202
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,658
Sorry, I gotta split.

203
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:19,945
Badge... Badge... Badge.

204
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:23,326
Badge, guys. I put a memo
in the toilet, come on.

205
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,447
Tony has got them in his
basement, they're wearing

206
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,389
party hats, this is an
asset we can put to use.

207
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,629
Uh-huh. So, you're
suggesting that I replace

208
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,913
the entire janitorial staff with robots?

209
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:35,063
What I'm saying is that the
human element of Human

210
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,075
Resources is our biggest
point of vulnerability.

211
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:38,915
We should start phasing it out immediately.

212
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:40,836
- What!? - Excuse me, Bambi.

213
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,200
- Did you just say that? - Security.

214
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,568
Happy, okay, I am thrilled that
you're now the Head of Security.

215
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,312
Okay, it is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

216
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:49,881
- However, - I do appreciate it.

217
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:52,384
- Since you've taken the post,
- You don't have to thank me.

218
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,494
We've had a rise in staff
complaints of 300 percent.

219
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:58,147
- Thank you. - That's not a compliment.

220
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,998
"That's not a compliment"?
It is a compliment!

221
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,832
Clearly somebody is
trying to hide something.

222
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,658
- Excuse me. - Yes?

223
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,821
Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.

224
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:06,509
Did you clear this four o'clock with me?

225
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,962
Happy, we'll talk about this later

226
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,595
But right now I have to go deal
with this very annoying thing.

227
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:11,855
How so?

228
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,028
I used to work with him,
and he used to ask me

229
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,837
out all the time, so it's a little awkward.

230
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,298
I don't like the sound of that.

231
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:25,974
- Pepper. - Killian?

232
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:28,716
You look great... you look really great.

233
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,822
God, you look great.

234
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:35,139
I... I... I can't... What on
Earth have you been doing?

235
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,510
Nothing fancy, just five years in
the hands of physical therapists

236
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,731
And please, call me Aldrich.

237
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,395
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge?

238
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:44,163
Happy, it's okay.

239
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,565
- Yes? - We're good.

240
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,885
- You sure? - Yes.

241
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,667
- Stand down. - I'm going to linger.

242
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,097
- Thank you. - Right here, okay.

243
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,927
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

244
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,913
Hey, guy

245
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,438
Merry Christmas.

246
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:14,407
After years dodging the president's
ban on "Immoral Biotech Research",

247
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:20,267
My think tank now has a little
something in the pipeline.

248
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:25,463
It's an idea we like to call "Extremis".

249
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,037
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

250
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,529
Regard the human brain.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,260
Uh, wait, hold on, hold on, that's,
that's the universe, my bad.

252
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:43,942
But if I do that...

253
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:52,966
That's the brain, strangely
mimetic though, wouldn't you say?

254
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,286
- Wow, that's amazing! - Thanks, it's mine.

255
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,498
- What? - This... you're inside my head.

256
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,145
It's a live feed. Come on
up, I'll prove it to you.

257
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:06,856
Come on.

258
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,039
Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.

259
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:16,176
What is that?

260
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,254
The primary somatosensory cortex.

261
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:23,399
It's the brain's pain center, but this...
is what I wanted to show you.

262
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:29,440
Now, "Extremis" harnesses our
bioelectrical potential.

263
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:32,119
And it goes... here.

264
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,299
This is essentially an empty slot,
and what this tells us is that

265
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:41,091
our mind, our entire DNA in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.

266
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:42,518
Wow.

267
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,378
Hello? Is this forehead of Security?

268
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,298
What? You know, look, I got a real job.
What do you want?

269
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,755
I'm working. I got something going on here.

270
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,352
- What? Harassing interns?
- Let me tell you something,

271
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:01,323
You know what happened when I told
people I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

272
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,947
They would laugh in my face.

273
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,544
I had to leave while I still
had a shred of dignity.

274
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,198
Now I got a real job. I'm watching Pepper.

275
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,345
What's going on? Fill me in.

276
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,836
- For real? - Yeah.

277
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:14,254
Alright, so she's meeting up with
this scientist rich guy, handsome.

278
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,792
I couldn't make his face at first, right?

279
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,730
And you know I'm good with faces.

280
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,048
- Oh yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah, so I run his credentials

281
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:22,006
I make him Aldrich Killian. We
actually met the guy back in.

282
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:24,568
Where were we in '99?
The Science Conference?

283
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,748
Uh, Switzerland.

284
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:27,302
Right, right, exactly.

285
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,506
- Killian, I don't remember that guy.
- Of course you don't remember,

286
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,590
he's not a blonde with a big rack.

287
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,855
At first it was fine, they
were talking business, but now

288
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:35,465
it's like getting weird. He's
showing her his big brain.

289
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,423
- His what? - Big brain, and she likes it.

290
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,644
Here, let me show you. Hold on. See?

291
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:44,618
Look at what? You watching them? Flip
the screen and then we can get started.

292
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,691
I'm not a tech genius like you,
just trust me, get down here.

293
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,240
Flip the screen, then I can
see what they're doing.

294
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,605
I don't know how to flip the screen!

295
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,953
Don't talk to me like that anymore.
You're not my boss.

296
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:57,106
Alright, I don't work for you,
and I don't trust this guy.

297
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,927
He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.

298
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,109
Relax. I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

299
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,796
Tell him to go out for
a drink or something.

300
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,896
You know what? You should take more of
an interest in what's going on here.

301
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,792
This woman is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

302
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,715
- And you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?

303
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,843
Yeah, there's a giant brain,
there's a shifty character...

304
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:12,327
I'm going to follow this guy.
I'm going to run

305
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:14,935
his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.

306
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:16,671
I miss you, Happy.

307
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:19,147
Yeah, I miss you too but
the way it used to be.

308
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:20,290
Now you're off with the "super friends"

309
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,846
I don't know what's going
on with you anymore.

310
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:22,739
The world's gettin' weird.

311
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,993
Hey I hate to cut you off,

312
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,053
- do you have your teaser on you? - Why?

313
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:26,259
I think there's a gal in HR who is trying

314
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,740
to steal some printer ink. You should
probably go over there and zap her.

315
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,798
Yeah, nice.

316
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,086
Imagine if you could hack
into the hard drive of

317
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,159
any living organism and recode its DNA.

318
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,211
It would be incredible.

319
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:43,659
Unfortunately, to my ears it
also sounds highly weaponizable.

320
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,577
As in enhanced soldiers, private
armies, and Tony is not...

321
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:48,790
Tony, Tony.

322
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:52,046
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM.

323
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:56,585
13 years ago and he turned me down.

324
00:17:56,586 --> 00:18:01,569
But something tells me now there is a new
genius on the throne, who doesn't have to

325
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,028
answer to Tony anymore and who
has slightly less of an ego.

326
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:12,740
It's going to be a no, Aldrich...
as much as I'd like to help you.

327
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:20,059
I can't say that I'm not disappointed,
but as my father used to say,

328
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,373
"Failure is the fog through
which we glimpse triumph."

329
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:26,252
It's very deep, and I have
no idea what it means.

330
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:28,449
Well, he was kind of an idiot, my old man.

331
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,732
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

332
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,615
Happy!

333
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,325
The car is ready... if you're ready to go.

334
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:55,865
Yes, I just um, God, I forgot my
other thing so I'm just gonna...

335
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:27,505
I'm sorry I'm late. I was.. What is that?!

336
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,757
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like Mark 15?

337
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:35,517
Yeah, something like that. You
know everybody needs a hobby.

338
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:38,367
Oh, and you have to wear your
hobby in the living room?

339
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,859
Just breaking it in, you know, it's always
a little pinky in the GUI-bagger at first.

340
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,281
Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?

341
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:49,586
Yes, I did. I don't know how I could
have missed that Christmas present.

342
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:51,203
Is it gonna fit through the door?

343
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,419
Well actually, uh, that's a
good question, I got a team of

344
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,525
guys coming tomorrow. They're
gonna blow out that wall.

345
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:58,115
So, uh, tense? Good day?

346
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:00,758
Oh shoulders, a little naughty.
Naughty girl.

347
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:04,682
I don't want to harp on this, but
did you like the custom rabbit?

348
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:06,775
Did I like it?

349
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:08,440
- Nailed it, right? - Wow.

350
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,445
I appreciate the thought very much.

351
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:16,279
So why don't you lift up that
facemask and give me a kiss.

352
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,484
Huh, yup, damnit. No can do.

353
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,990
You want to just kiss it
on the, uh, facial slit?

354
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,383
Why don't I run down to
the garage and see if

355
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,428
I can't find a crowbar to
jimmy that thing open?

356
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,602
A crowbar? Yeah. Oh, except
there's been a radiation leak.

357
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,477
- I'll take my chances. - That's risky.

358
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,515
At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit.

359
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,693
Or a Geiger counter or something like that.

360
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:47,413
- Busted. - This is a new level of lame.

361
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,681
- Sorry.
- You ate without me, already? On date night?

362
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:52,738
- He was just. - You mean you.

363
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,998
Well yeah, I just mean we were just...

364
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,887
just hosting you while I
finished up a little work.

365
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:58,200
Uh Huh..

366
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,826
And yes, I had a quick bite. I
didn't know if you were coming home

367
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,901
Or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

368
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:06,796
What?

369
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:10,737
Aldrich Killian? What are
you checking up on me?

370
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,634
- Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.

371
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:16,365
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on. Come on. Pep...

372
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:20,076
Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.

373
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,540
I'm a piping hot mess.

374
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:27,585
It's been going on for a while...
I haven't said anything.

375
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,958
- Nothing's been the same since New York.
- Oh really?

376
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,890
I didn't notice that, at all.

377
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:40,905
You experience things and then they're
over and you still can't explain them.

378
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,969
Gods, aliens, other dimensions...
I'm just a man in a can.

379
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:49,816
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you've moved in.

380
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,322
Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky.

381
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,240
But honey... I can't sleep.

382
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,143
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know, I tinker.

383
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:04,760
The threat is imminent.

384
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:07,403
And I have to protect the one
thing that I can't live without.

385
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:12,073
That's you. And my suits, they're uh...

386
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:14,550
- Machines. - They're part of me.

387
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:19,711
- A distraction. - Maybe.

388
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:40,410
- I'm gonna take a shower. - Okay.

389
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:47,506
- And you're going to join me. - Better.

390
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:07,473
Tony!

391
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,704
Power down!

392
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:29,182
I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.

393
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,567
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

394
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:42,397
Can we just... just let me... just let me catch
my breath, okay? Don't go, alright? Pepper?

395
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:45,409
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.

396
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:14,865
- Can you regulate? - Yes, I can regulate.

397
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:16,806
- Are you sure about that? - Yes.

398
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:28,209
It's a decent batch.

399
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:31,522
Don't say I never did nothing for you.

400
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:35,500
Thank you. I mean for understanding.

401
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:46,336
I'm sorry, buddy.

402
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:03,000
What're ya doing, buddy?

403
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,920
You out by yourself? A little date night?
Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

404
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:08,390
Yeah, a little movie
called "The Party's Over"

405
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:11,508
Starring you and your junkie
girlfriend, and here's the ticket.

406
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,791
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

407
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:44,990
Savin! Help! Help me!

408
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,970
A true story about fortune cookies.

409
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:16,634
They look Chinese. They sound Chinese.

410
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:21,348
But they're actually an American invention.

411
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:28,911
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies,
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

412
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:35,028
My disciples just destroyed
another cheap American knock-off.

413
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:40,152
The Chinese Theater. Mr. President.

414
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,718
I know this must be getting frustrating.

415
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:47,712
But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.

416
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:54,832
And don't worry, the big one
is coming, your graduation.

417
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:10,821
- Hi. - Oh, uh.

418
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:12,948
- Mind leaving that on? - Sure.

419
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:22,960
Sunday night's PBS, "Downtown Abbey"

420
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:26,763
That's the show. He thinks it's elegant.

421
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:33,214
One more thing, make sure everyone
wears their badges. He's a stickler

422
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,977
for that sort of thing, plus my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

423
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:39,021
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.

424
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:41,113
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction.

425
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,135
His reaction to the latest attack.

426
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,756
Mr. Stark!

427
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:48,794
Our sources are telling us that
this is another Mandarin attack.

428
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,594
Anything else you can tell us?

429
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:55,961
Hey Mr. Stark! When is somebody going
to kill this guy? Just sayin'.

430
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,330
Is that what you want?

431
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:06,549
Here's a little Holiday greeting I've
been wanting to send to the Mandarin.

432
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:09,490
I just didn't know how
to phrase it until now.

433
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,862
My name is Tony Stark and
I'm not afraid of you.

434
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,268
I know that you're a
coward, so I've decided

435
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,180
That you just died, pal.

436
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:21,006
I'm gonna come get the body.

437
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:24,121
There's no politics here, it's
just good old-fashioned revenge.

438
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:26,624
There's no Pentagon. It's just you and me.

439
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:30,672
And on the off-chance you're a
man, here's my home address:

440
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:36,115
10880, Malibu Port, 90265.

441
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:40,276
I'll leave the door unlocked.
That's what you wanted, right?

442
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:44,500
Bill me.

443
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,391
I've compiled a Mandarin
database for you, sir.

444
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:56,060
Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I.
and C.I.A. intercepts.

445
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:59,388
Initiating virtual crime
scene reconstruction.

446
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:04,160
Okay, what do we got here?

447
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:07,210
His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle

448
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,789
Meaning "Advisor to the King".

449
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:11,604
South American insurgency tactics.

450
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:13,998
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

451
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,219
There's lots of pageantry going
on here, lots of theatre.

452
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:19,994
Close.

453
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:23,272
- The heat from the blast was in
excess of 3000 degrees Celsius.

454
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,963
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporized instantly.

455
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:30,179
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile
radius of the Chinese theatre.

456
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,871
- No, sir.

457
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,695
Talk to me, Happy.

458
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,698
When is a bomb not a bomb?

459
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:09,714
- Any military victims?
- Not according to public records, sir.

460
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:13,787
Bring up the thermo genic signatures
again, factor in 3000 degrees.

461
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,397
The oracle cloud has completed analysis.

462
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:21,564
Accessing satellites and plotting the last
12 months of thermo genic occurrences now.

463
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:25,409
Take away everywhere that
there's been a Mandarin attack.

464
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,226
Nope.

465
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:40,912
That. You sure that's not one of his?

466
00:31:40,913 --> 00:31:43,326
It predates any known Mandarin attack.

467
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:46,393
The incident was the use of
a bomb to assist a suicide.

468
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:47,394
Bring it around.

469
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:53,415
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3000 degrees Celsius.

470
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,838
That's two military guys.

471
00:31:58,031 --> 00:31:59,500
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

472
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,616
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

473
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:12,744
Are we still at 'Ding-Dong'? We're
supposed to be on total security lockdown.

474
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,355
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

475
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:20,407
There's only so much I can do, sir, when you
give the world's press your home address.

476
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,221
Right there's fine.

477
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:40,492
You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?

478
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:45,454
You don't remember. Why I am not surprised?

479
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:47,169
Don't take it personally, I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

480
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,625
- Gluten-free waffles, sir. - That's right.

481
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:54,423
Look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here... it's urgent.

482
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,949
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship

483
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,028
- It's... with her. - Tony

484
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,049
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

485
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:13,425
Old botanist pal that I
used to know, barely.

486
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,828
Please don't tell me that there is a 12-year-old
kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

487
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:21,064
- He's 13. No, I need your help.
- What for? Why now?

488
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,510
Because I read the papers, and, frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

489
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:26,096
- I'll be fine. - I'm sorry.

490
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:29,318
With Happy in the hospital, I didn't
know we were expecting guests.

491
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,256
We weren't.

492
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:32,021
- And old girlfriends! - She's not really.

493
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:34,856
No, not really. It was just one night.

494
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:38,256
- Yep. - That's how you did it, isn't it?

495
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:39,243
It was a great night

496
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:40,501
- Well... you know - Yeah.

497
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:42,380
You have saved yourself a world of pain.

498
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:43,253
- What? - Trust me.

499
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,390
We're going out of town.

500
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,257
- Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
- Yep!

501
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,657
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

502
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,252
- Great idea. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,537
That's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

504
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:54,442
Tony, this is how normal
people behave.

505
00:33:54,443 --> 00:33:56,575
I can't protect you out there.
I challenged.

506
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,185
- Is that normal?
- Sadly, that...

507
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:59,519
Yes, this is normal!

508
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,369
- Is very normal
- It's a big bunny, relax about it!

509
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:04,818
- Calm down!
- I got this for you.

510
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:07,148
- I'm aware of that.
- You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

511
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,837
I don't like it!

512
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,679
I asked you three.
- You don't like it?!

513
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,061
We are leaving the house, that's not even up for discussion.
- Guys... do we umm...

514
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:16,396
- What?
- Do we need to worry about that?

515
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:07,588
- I got you.
- I got you first.

516
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,539
Like I said, we can't
stay here.

517
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:20,141
Move! I'm right behind.

518
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:26,523
Get her, I'm going to
find a way around.

519
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:30,329
Stop stopping! Get her.
Get outside! Go!

520
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,221
Oh my God.
Tony!

521
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:10,965
Sir, Miss Potts is clear
of the structure.

522
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,802
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

523
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:47,827
Working on it, sir. This is
a prototype.

524
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,929
That's one.

525
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,606
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

526
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,097
That's two.

527
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,635
Tony!

528
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,065
Sir, take a deep breath.

529
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,454
Flight power restored.

530
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:51,739
Sir. Sir!

531
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:54,829
Alright, kill the
alarm. I got it.

532
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:59,344
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

533
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:39,048
Snow? Where are we,
upstate?

534
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,704
We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hills, Tennessee.

535
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,851
Why?

536
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,914
Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we
doing here, this is

537
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:51,355
thousands of miles away? I've gotta get
Pepper, I've got to...

538
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:52,983
I prepared a flight plan.

539
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:54,490
This was the location.

540
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:56,713
Who asked you? Open
the suit.

541
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:59,449
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

542
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,451
Open Eject.

543
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:07,956
That's brisk!

544
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:17,943
Maybe I'll just cozy back
up for a bit.

545
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:21,128
I actually think I need
to sleep now, sir.

546
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,882
Jarvis.

547
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:25,657
Jarvis?

548
00:41:28,893 --> 00:41:30,163
Don't leave me, buddy.

549
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:55,722
Stark Secure Server: Now transferring
to all known receivers.

550
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:56,893
Pepper, it's me.

551
00:41:57,693 --> 00:42:01,987
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not
a lot of time, so first off.

552
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,496
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

553
00:42:04,498 --> 00:42:06,826
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

554
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:11,304
Also, it's Christmas time. The
rabbit's too big. Done.

555
00:42:11,306 --> 00:42:12,824
Sorry.

556
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:17,349
And I'm sorry in advance because...
I can't come home yet.

557
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:22,427
I need to find this guy. You
gotta stay safe.

558
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:23,887
That's all I know.

559
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:27,155
I just stole a poncho from
a wooden Indian.

560
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:53,286
Let's get you comfy.

561
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:56,744
You happy now?

562
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:09,893
Freeze!

563
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,159
- Don't move.
- You got me.

564
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,786
Nice potato gun.

565
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:20,028
Barrel's a little long.

566
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,922
Between that and the wide gauge, it's
going to diminish your FPS.

567
00:43:27,965 --> 00:43:29,510
And now you're out of ammo.

568
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,527
What's that thing on
your chest?

569
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:36,976
It's a electromagnet. You should know,
you've got a box of them right here.

570
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,753
What does it power?

571
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:48,943
Oh my God!

572
00:43:54,012 --> 00:43:57,619
- Is that Iron Man?
- Technically, I am.

573
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:00,702
Technically, you're dead.

574
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:05,161
- A valid point.
- What happened to him?

575
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:07,907
Life. I built him. I take
care of him.

576
00:44:10,824 --> 00:44:12,909
I'll fix him.

577
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:14,074
- Like a mechanic.
- Yeah.

578
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,000
If I was building Iron Man
and War Machine,

579
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:21,472
- It's Iron Patriot now.
- That's way cooler!

580
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,634
No, it's not.

581
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,108
Anyway, I would have
added in the retro...

582
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,913
- Retro reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

583
00:44:29,914 --> 00:44:31,246
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

584
00:44:31,246 --> 00:44:33,775
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

585
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:36,057
Not a good idea!

586
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:38,130
What are you doing? You're going
to break his finger?

587
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:40,052
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

588
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:41,940
- Sorry.
- Are you?

589
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,608
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

590
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:47,447
So, uh, who's home?

591
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:52,507
Well, my mom already left for the diner and
dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

592
00:44:52,893 --> 00:44:55,804
I guess he won 'cause that
was six years ago.

593
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:00,985
Which happens, dads leave. No need to
be a pussy about it.

594
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:05,514
Here's what I need: a laptop, a
digital watch, a cell phone,

595
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:08,606
The pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

596
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:11,472
a map of town, a big spring,
and a tuna-fish sandwich.

597
00:45:11,472 --> 00:45:15,384
- What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?

598
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:19,175
- Who?
- The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

599
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,773
How'd you know that?

600
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:23,452
I got just the thing.

601
00:45:25,715 --> 00:45:30,583
This is a pińata for a cricket. I'm kidding.
It's a very powerful weapon.

602
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:33,643
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

603
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,335
It discourages bullying.

604
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:38,460
Non-lethal, just to cover
one's ass.

605
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,192
- Deal. Deal? What'd you say?
- Deal.

606
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,494
- What's your name?
- Harley.

607
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:47,894
- And you are...?
- The mechanic...

608
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:51,146
Tony.

609
00:45:53,356 --> 00:45:55,208
You know what keeps going
through my head?

610
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:57,449
Where's my sandwich?

611
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:38,806
Stark Secure Server. Retinal
scan verified.

612
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:40,186
Pepper, it's me.

613
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:42,262
I've got a lot of apologies
to make

614
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:43,998
and not a lot of time,
so first off.

615
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:46,275
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

616
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:49,030
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

617
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:53,628
Why were you at the
house tonight?

618
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,090
What was so important that you
had to speak to Tony?

619
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:02,666
I think that my boss is working
for the Mandarin.

620
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:06,186
So if you still want
to talk about it,

621
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:08,369
I suggest we get ourselves
someplace safe.

622
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:12,873
Your boss works for the
Mandarin you think,

623
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:15,764
but Tony says you're a botanist.

624
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:19,255
That figures. What I actually am is a
biological DNA coder running a team of

625
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:22,791
40 out of a privately-funded think tank,
but sure you can call me a "botanist".

626
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,148
This boss of yours, does
he have a name?

627
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,737
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

628
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:35,590
Well we took the house down sir, but
there's no sign of a body.

629
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,202
- I see.
- No Stark.

630
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:38,476
I have to go.

631
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:41,735
The Master is about to record
and he's a little...

632
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:44,356
Well you know how he gets.

633
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:47,275
Keep your appointment tonight and
call me when it's done.

634
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:55,762
Alright everybody. No talking and
no eye contact,

635
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:57,737
unless you wanna get
shot in the face.

636
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,157
The Master is travelling.

637
00:48:34,842 --> 00:48:36,842
Well then, what are we waiting for?

638
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:41,943
The sandwich was fair, the
spring was a little

639
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:44,094
rusty, the rest of the materials
I'll make do.

640
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,458
By the way, when you said your
sister had a watch, I

641
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,751
was kinda hoping for something
a little more than that.

642
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:53,452
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

643
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:57,639
- When can we talk about New York?
- Maybe never, relax about it.

644
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,206
- What about the Avengers, can you talk about them?
- I don't know. later.

645
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:00,438
Hey kid, give me more space.

646
00:49:05,103 --> 00:49:08,762
What's the official story here?
What happened?

647
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:12,920
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,
used to live roundabouts.

648
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,711
Won a bunch of medals in the army.

649
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:21,003
One day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

650
00:49:21,597 --> 00:49:24,523
Then he blew himself
up right here.

651
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:32,440
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.

652
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,090
- Including Chad Davis?
- Yeah.

653
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:43,920
Makes sense.

654
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:48,195
Think about it. Six dead,
only five shadows.

655
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:53,438
Yeah, but people said these shadows are
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven

656
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:59,442
Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on
account of he didn't get a shadow.

657
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:02,945
- That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?

658
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:04,545
That's what everyone says.

659
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:10,518
You know what this crater
reminds me of?

660
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:12,554
I have no idea. I don't care.

661
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:19,338
That giant wormhole, in
um, in New York.

662
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,681
Does it remind you?

663
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:23,405
That's manipulative. I don't want
to talk about it.

664
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:25,851
Are they coming back?
The aliens?

665
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,413
Maybe, can you stop?

666
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:30,793
Remember when I told you that
I have an anxiety issue?

667
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,862
Does this subject make
you edgy?

668
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:33,385
Yeah, a little bit.

669
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:35,635
Can I just catch my breath
for a second?

670
00:50:35,637 --> 00:50:39,737
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you
need a plastic bag to breathe into?

671
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,309
- Do you have medication?
- Nope.

672
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:42,931
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

673
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:44,969
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

674
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:46,686
Are you going completely
mental?

675
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:48,670
I can stop, do you want
me to stop?

676
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:50,436
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

677
00:50:50,436 --> 00:50:52,373
I swear to God, you're going
to freak me out.

678
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,474
Ah man, you did it, didn't you?

679
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:58,728
- You happy now?
- What did I say?

680
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,043
Hey, wait up!
Wait, wait.

681
00:51:08,103 --> 00:51:09,820
What the hell was that?

682
00:51:13,713 --> 00:51:16,177
Your fault, you spazzed me out.

683
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,746
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

684
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:25,057
The guy who died... relatives? Mom?
Mrs. Davis, where is she?

685
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:28,059
- Where she always is.
- See, now you're being helpful.

686
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:38,867
Sorry. Lady, this uh,

687
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:41,878
Thank you.

688
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,501
Nice haircut, suits you.

689
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,773
- Nice watch.
- Yeah, limited edition.

690
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,661
Oh, I don't doubt it.

691
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,978
Well... have a good evening.

692
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:21,971
Mrs. Davis, mind if
I join you?

693
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,523
- Free country.
- It sure is.

694
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:30,648
Alright,

695
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:36,864
- Where'd you like to start?
- I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

696
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,451
I want to know what you
think happened

697
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,355
I brought your damn file.
You take it and go.

698
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:50,579
Whatever was in here, he
wanted no part of it.

699
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:56,056
Clearly, you were waiting for someone else.
Supposed to meet somebody here?

700
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:58,068
Yeah.

701
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:14,987
Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill
himself. I guarantee

702
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:18,978
you he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.

703
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:23,193
- What? - As a weapon.

704
00:53:26,983 --> 00:53:30,449
You're not the person who called
me after all, are you?

705
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:33,403
Actually, I am.

706
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:40,277
Hey, hey! What's all this about?
The hell's going on here?

707
00:53:40,278 --> 00:53:41,987
It's called an arrest.

708
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:46,099
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

709
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:50,543
- Homeland Security. We good here?
- No, we're not good.

710
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:54,547
- I need a little more information than that.
- Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

711
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:58,849
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the
horn to Nashville and upgrade me?

712
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,911
Alright, you know what, I was hoping
to do this the smart way, but uh,

713
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,192
The fun way's always good.

714
00:54:05,393 --> 00:54:06,594
Deputy, get this woman and...

715
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:23,402
Hey hot wings, you wanna party?
You and me, let's go.

716
00:54:36,436 --> 00:54:38,539
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

717
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:41,300
Watch this.

718
00:55:47,237 --> 00:55:50,079
You walked right into this one. I've dated
hotter chicks than you.

719
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:56,364
That's all you got? Cheap trick
and a cheesy one-liner?

720
00:55:56,364 --> 00:55:58,726
Sweetheart, that could be the name
of my autobiography.

721
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,802
- Let me go!
- Help me! Help me!

722
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:11,487
Hey kid, what would you
like for Christmas?

723
00:57:11,489 --> 00:57:13,188
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

724
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,329
No, no, I think he was trying to say
"I want my goddamn file."

725
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:18,612
It's not your fault kid.

726
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,554
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

727
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:31,778
You like that, West World? That's
the thing about smart guys.

728
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:34,460
We always cover our ass.

729
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:00,514
You're welcome!

730
00:58:01,797 --> 00:58:05,259
- For what? Did I miss something?
- Me saving your life.

731
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:07,860
A, Saved you first
B, Thanks, sort of

732
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,021
And C, If you do someone a solid, don't
be a yurts alright,

733
00:58:11,023 --> 00:58:13,543
just play it cool otherwise you
come off grandiose.

734
00:58:15,244 --> 00:58:16,885
Unlike you?

735
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:21,148
Admit it, you need me.
We're connected.

736
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:23,550
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

737
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,411
keep your trap shut, and
guard the suit.

738
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:28,126
And stay connected to the
telephone because

739
00:58:28,128 --> 00:58:29,431
if I call you better
pick up. Okay?

740
00:58:29,432 --> 00:58:32,134
Can you feel that?
We're done here.

741
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:35,237
Move out of the way or I'm going to
run you over. Bye kid.

742
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:45,907
I'm sorry kid. You
did good.

743
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:49,208
So now you're just going to leave
me here, like my dad?

744
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:54,452
Yeah. Wait, you're guilt-tripping
me, aren't you?

745
00:58:54,452 --> 00:58:56,208
I'm cold.

746
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,291
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

747
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,052
'Cause we're connected.

748
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:07,434
It was worth a shot.

749
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:24,750
You get this, it's affordable,
it's gorgeous, It goes with any decor...

750
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,306
What happened to the picture?

751
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,293
The entire East coast... the
satellites are down.

752
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:41,400
What about backup manual?

753
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:43,157
We have an unauthorized broadcast

754
00:59:43,686 --> 00:59:45,731
Mr. Vice President, I think
you should see this.

755
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,302
Oh my God, not again.

756
00:59:51,503 --> 00:59:53,534
Is the President getting this?

757
01:00:04,054 --> 01:00:05,954
Mr. President.

758
01:00:06,255 --> 01:00:08,056
Only two lessons remain.

759
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:11,538
I intend to finish this before
Christmas morning.

760
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,222
Meet Thomas Richards. Good strong
name, good strong job.

761
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:23,186
Thomas here is an accountant for
the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

762
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:28,510
And I'm sure he's a
really good guy.

763
01:00:31,751 --> 01:00:36,552
I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on
your television, in 30 seconds.

764
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:42,036
The number for this telephone is in your
cell phone. Exciting, isn't it?

765
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:44,398
Imagining how it got there.

766
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:50,822
America, if your president calls me in
the next half-minute, Tom lives.

767
01:00:51,121 --> 01:00:52,081
Go.

768
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:56,119
How did he hack my phone?

769
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,025
We can't allow terrorists
to dictate

770
01:00:58,027 --> 01:00:59,233
I have to make this call.

771
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:00,827
I'd strongly advise
against that.

772
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:02,427
This is the right thing to do.

773
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:32,797
There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis,

774
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:35,005
so run away, hide, kiss your
children goodbye

775
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:37,143
Because nothing, not your army,
not your red,

776
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:39,050
white, and blue attack dog,
can save you.

777
01:01:42,692 --> 01:01:43,891
I'll see you soon.

778
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:49,545
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic
right now.

779
01:01:49,545 --> 01:01:52,217
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

780
01:01:52,217 --> 01:01:55,135
We have a possible point of origin in
Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.

781
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:56,057
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

782
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:28,597
Don't move!

783
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:36,804
Uh, hang on a second.

784
01:02:37,844 --> 01:02:38,556
Hello.

785
01:02:38,556 --> 01:02:43,804
You ever look up and everything starts glowing
from the inside out, a kind of bright orange.

786
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:46,849
- Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
- It's me, pal.

787
01:02:46,851 --> 01:02:50,050
Now last time I went missing, if I remember
correctly, you came looking for me.

788
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:53,168
- What are you doing?
- A little talking, making friends in Pakistan.

789
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,474
What are you doing?

790
01:02:54,476 --> 01:02:57,856
Your re-design, your big re-brand,
that was AIM, right? - Yeah.

791
01:02:58,456 --> 01:03:02,137
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comsat
right now, I need your login.

792
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,317
Same as it's always been,
War Machine 68.

793
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:05,280
And password please?

794
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,867
Well, look, I gotta change it every time
you hack in, Tony.

795
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,902
It's not the 80's, nobody says "hack"
anymore, give me your login.

796
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:15,485
"WARMACHINEROX" with
an X, all caps.

797
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:23,190
- Yeah okay.
- That is so much better than Iron Patriot.

798
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,150
Very nice, very nice...

799
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,474
I have one question for you...

800
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,500
What would you like
for Christmas this year?

801
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:41,224
Well David...

802
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:55,199
One more time, Miss Elk Ridge everybody.

803
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:06,842
That ain't gonna cut it.

804
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:11,684
Excuse me sir, I don't know who...

805
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:17,088
Mom, I need to call you back. Something
magical is happening.

806
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:19,744
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

807
01:04:19,746 --> 01:04:21,730
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

808
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:23,126
I knew you were still alive!

809
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:24,771
Come on in and close the door.

810
01:04:29,815 --> 01:04:31,376
- Wow, can I just say sir?
- Yeah.

811
01:04:32,697 --> 01:04:33,641
I am your biggest fan.

812
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:36,179
First, is this your van or
is anyone else gonna come in?

813
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:37,369
No, no, it's just us.

814
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:38,500
What's your name?

815
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:39,695
- Gary.
- Gary.

816
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,021
Oh wow.

817
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:46,063
Right there's fine. I get a
lot of this, it's okay.

818
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:47,384
Can I just say?

819
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:51,148
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you can tell but I have like

820
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:54,652
Patterned my whole look after you. My
hair's a little,

821
01:04:54,653 --> 01:04:57,311
it's not right because there's
some product in it.

822
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:57,811
Right.

823
01:04:59,231 --> 01:05:01,547
I don't want to make things
awkward for you

824
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:03,755
- No.
- But I do have to show you... boom!

825
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:06,496
Hispanic Scott Baio?

826
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,197
- Oh, I'm sorry, is that me?
- Yeah.

827
01:05:09,597 --> 01:05:12,496
It's... I mean. I had them do it
off a doll that I made,

828
01:05:12,498 --> 01:05:15,722
so it's not like it's off a picture. So
it's a little bit.

829
01:05:15,722 --> 01:05:18,242
Garry, for a moment, listen
to me here.

830
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:20,913
I don't want to clip your
wings here.

831
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:22,606
We're both a little over-excited.

832
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:25,449
I got an issue. I'm chasing bad
guys, trying to grapple

833
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:27,528
with something from some
hard-crypt data files.

834
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,208
I don't have enough juice.

835
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:33,010
I need you to jump on the roof,
recalibrate the ISDNs

836
01:05:33,612 --> 01:05:36,748
- Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.

837
01:05:36,748 --> 01:05:37,559
Alright, it's a mission.

838
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,333
Yeah.

839
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:39,996
Tony needs Gary.

840
01:05:40,496 --> 01:05:41,447
And Gary needs Tony.

841
01:05:41,447 --> 01:05:42,496
Be quiet about it.

842
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:43,797
Go.

843
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:09,313
What would you regard as the defining
moment of your life?

844
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:13,275
Well uh, I think that would be the day I
decided not to let my injury beat me.

845
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:18,559
- Can you please state your name for the camera?
- Ellen Brandt.

846
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:23,242
Okay, so, the injections are
administered periodically.

847
01:06:23,242 --> 01:06:27,724
Addiction will not be tolerated and those who
cannot regulate will be cut from the program.

848
01:06:28,925 --> 01:06:36,010
Once misfits, cripples... you are the next
iteration of human evolution.

849
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:44,222
Hi everybody. Before we start, I promise
you, looking back at your life there will be

850
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:48,335
nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious
risk that you prudently elected to forego.

851
01:06:49,836 --> 01:06:52,059
Today is your glory. Let's begin!

852
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:06,664
We gotta get out of here! Gotta get out of here!
Get 'em out! Get 'em out of here!

853
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:15,632
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

854
01:07:18,072 --> 01:07:20,355
This stuff doesn't always
work, right, pal?

855
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:22,856
It's faulty, but you found a
buyer, didn't ya?

856
01:07:23,398 --> 01:07:25,418
Sold it to the Mandarin.

857
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,282
What happened? Fun fact.

858
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:38,045
Before he built rockets
for the Nazis.

859
01:07:38,405 --> 01:07:46,804
The idealistic Werner von Braun dreamed
of space travel... he stargazed.

860
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:52,373
You know what he said when the
first V2 hit London?

861
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:56,416
The rocket performed perfectly.

862
01:07:58,217 --> 01:08:00,498
It just landed on the wrong planet.

863
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:07,101
See we all begin wide-eyed...
"pure science".

864
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:11,864
Then the ego steps in,
the obsession

865
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:19,667
And when you look up, you're
a long way from shore.

866
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:26,833
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I
mean you gave your research to a think tank.

867
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:30,266
Yeah but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

868
01:08:30,268 --> 01:08:32,237
That's exactly what we used to do.

869
01:08:32,797 --> 01:08:34,359
So don't judge yourself.

870
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,798
Thank you, Pepper.

871
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,242
I really appreciate that.

872
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:49,641
Hi, good evening

873
01:08:49,643 --> 01:08:50,908
- Good evening.
- Come on in.

874
01:08:53,287 --> 01:08:54,449
Maya, run!

875
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,891
Hi Pepper.

876
01:09:00,132 --> 01:09:02,412
So you want to tell me why you were
at Stark's mansion last night?

877
01:09:02,413 --> 01:09:06,055
I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you
and the Master were gonna blow the place up.

878
01:09:06,337 --> 01:09:10,317
Oh I see, so you were trying to save Stark...
when he threatened us

879
01:09:10,318 --> 01:09:11,757
I told you, Killian, we can use him.

880
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:14,864
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper

881
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:18,425
Look if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

882
01:09:18,784 --> 01:09:21,884
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now he has one.

883
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:31,889
This is Support Team Blue-0, sending coordinates
for suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

884
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,465
Copy.

885
01:09:40,797 --> 01:09:41,877
Nobody move!

886
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:49,908
Support Blue-0, unless the Mandarin's
next attack on the U.S.

887
01:09:49,908 --> 01:09:52,963
involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think
you messed up again.

888
01:09:54,484 --> 01:09:59,447
Yes, you're free, if you weren't
before. Yes ma'am.

889
01:09:59,648 --> 01:10:03,409
Iron Patriot on the job, happy to help,
no need to thank me, it's my pleasure.

890
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:14,957
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

891
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:18,899
You want this suit? You gonna have
to pry at my cold dead body out of it.

892
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:20,380
That's the plan, Colonel.

893
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,275
Harley, tell me what is happening,
give me a full report.

894
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:27,984
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy, do you
want me to keep eating it?

895
01:10:28,385 --> 01:10:29,385
How much did you have?

896
01:10:29,386 --> 01:10:30,386
Two or three bowls.

897
01:10:30,386 --> 01:10:32,690
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.

898
01:10:32,692 --> 01:10:34,667
That means you're fine,
give me Jarvis.

899
01:10:35,109 --> 01:10:36,170
Jarvis, how are we?

900
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:38,595
It's totally fine sir. I seem to do quite
well for a stretch and

901
01:10:38,596 --> 01:10:40,877
then at the end of the sentence I
say the wrong cranberry.

902
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:44,519
And sir, you were right. Once I factored
in available AIM downlink

903
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,815
facilities I was able to pinpoint the
Mandarin's broadcast signal.

904
01:10:48,515 --> 01:10:52,618
What're we talkin'? The Far East, Europe, North
Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

905
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:54,239
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

906
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,350
Okay, kid, I'm going to have to walk
you through rebooting Jarvis's

907
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:00,483
speech drive, but not right now.

908
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:01,983
Harley, where is he really?

909
01:11:01,984 --> 01:11:03,863
Just look on the screen and
tell me where it is.

910
01:11:05,426 --> 01:11:06,871
Um... it does say Miami, Florida.

911
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:09,427
Okay, first things first,
I need the armor.

912
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:10,942
Where are we at with it?

913
01:11:10,943 --> 01:11:12,109
Uh, it's not charging.

914
01:11:19,033 --> 01:11:22,819
Actually, sir, it is charging, but
the power source is questionable.

915
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:25,358
It may not succeed in revitalizing
the Mark 42.

916
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:27,648
What's questionable about electricity?

917
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:30,761
Alright, it's my suit and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...

918
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:35,162
- Oh God, not again.
- Tony

919
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:40,345
Are you having another attack? I
didn't even mention New York.

920
01:11:40,346 --> 01:11:44,128
Right, and then you just said it, by name,
while denying having said it.

921
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,309
Okay, um, uh

922
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:49,663
Oh God, what am I gonna do?

923
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:51,813
Just breathe, really just breathe.

924
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:56,536
- You're a mechanic, right?
- Right.

925
01:11:57,735 --> 01:12:01,096
- You said so.
- Yes, I did.

926
01:12:02,057 --> 01:12:04,100
What don't you just build something?

927
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:19,708
Okay, thanks kid.

928
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:07,972
Why is it so hot in here? I told
you to put it at 68.

929
01:14:08,773 --> 01:14:12,574
My fault again... let me tell you something
sweetheart, I am not your personal...

930
01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:17,573
I wouldn't go in there for twenty minutes!

931
01:15:18,993 --> 01:15:22,228
- Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.

932
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:24,430
Ah, Nessie.

933
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:29,302
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

934
01:15:29,304 --> 01:15:31,720
There's some guy over here.

935
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:34,484
They're made by Americans,
based on the Japanese recipes.

936
01:15:34,485 --> 01:15:35,168
- Hey!

937
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,296
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

938
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:40,905
- Don't move.
- I am not moving.

939
01:15:40,907 --> 01:15:43,592
If you want something, take it, although
the guns are all fake

940
01:15:43,594 --> 01:15:46,109
because those wankers wouldn't trust
me with the real ones.

941
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,490
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

942
01:15:49,051 --> 01:15:53,594
Heard enough. You're not him, the Mandarin,
the real guy, where?

943
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:58,917
- Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
- He's here. He's here.

944
01:15:59,136 --> 01:16:01,939
- But he's not here. He's here but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

945
01:16:02,038 --> 01:16:04,426
It's complicated, hey, it's
complicated, alright?

946
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:05,761
- It is?
- It's complicated.

947
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,305
Uncomplicate it. Ladies out, get out
of the bed

948
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:08,641
get in the bathroom.

949
01:16:11,393 --> 01:16:12,002
Sit.

950
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:25,033
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

951
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:26,373
What are you?

952
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:29,560
What're you a decoy? You're
a double, right?

953
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:31,416
What? No. An understudy?
Absolutely not.

954
01:16:32,176 --> 01:16:34,018
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.

955
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:37,871
You got a minute to live, fill it
with words.

956
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:41,863
It's just a role. "The Mandarin", see,
it's not real.

957
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:43,783
Then how did you get here,
Trevor?

958
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:52,090
Um, well, uh, I have a little problem
with, um, substances,

959
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:56,871
and I ended up doing things...
no two ways about it

960
01:16:56,872 --> 01:17:00,153
- In the street that a man shouldn't do.
- Next!

961
01:17:00,154 --> 01:17:05,555
Then, they approached me about the role
and they knew about the drugs.

962
01:17:05,556 --> 01:17:07,172
What'd they say they'd get
you off them?

963
01:17:07,173 --> 01:17:08,198
Said they'd give me more.

964
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,622
They gave me things. They gave
me this palace.

965
01:17:11,622 --> 01:17:14,881
They gave me plastic surgery. They
gave me things.

966
01:17:16,603 --> 01:17:18,002
Did you just nod off?

967
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:23,247
No, and a lovely speedboat! And the
thing was, he needed someone.

968
01:17:23,648 --> 01:17:27,250
To take credit for some
"accidental explosions".

969
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,650
"He"?

970
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:36,493
- Killian?
- Killian.

971
01:17:36,494 --> 01:17:38,817
- He created you?
- He created me.

972
01:17:40,016 --> 01:17:42,217
- Custom-made terror threat
- Yes!

973
01:17:42,898 --> 01:17:47,820
Yes, his think tank thinked it up, the
pathology of the serial killer.

974
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:51,302
The manipulation of Western
iconography.

975
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:55,947
Ready for another lesson?
Blah blah blah.

976
01:17:57,747 --> 01:18:00,707
Of course, it was my performance that
brought the Mandarin to life.

977
01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:06,271
Your performance? Where
people die?

978
01:18:07,231 --> 01:18:09,734
No, no, look around you,
costumes, green screen.

979
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:14,275
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this
stuff, and when I was, movie magic, love.

980
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:17,957
I'm sorry but I got a best friend who's in
a coma and he might not wake up.

981
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:21,440
So you're going to have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.

982
01:18:27,823 --> 01:18:30,626
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

983
01:18:31,327 --> 01:18:33,407
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

984
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:37,649
- No.
- You should have pressed the panic button.

985
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:40,532
Well I panicked, but then
I handled it.

986
01:19:02,953 --> 01:19:04,673
Just like old times, huh?

987
01:19:04,675 --> 01:19:07,355
Oh yeah, with zip-ties.
It's a ball.

988
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:08,899
It wasn't my idea.

989
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,359
Okay, so you took
Killian's card

990
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,309
I took his money.

991
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:15,121
And here you are 13 years
later in a dungeon.

992
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,202
- No.
- Yeah.

993
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:20,323
- No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
- Yeah...

994
01:19:24,206 --> 01:19:28,559
A lot's happened Tony,
and I'm close.

995
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:31,909
Extremis is practically stable.

996
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:32,250
I'm telling you it isn't.

997
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:36,913
I'm on the street, people are going 'bang', they're
painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

998
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:39,795
Then help me fix it.

999
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:44,819
Did I do that?

1000
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,382
- Yes.
- I remember the night, not the morning.

1001
01:19:50,104 --> 01:19:51,283
Is this what you've been
chasing around?

1002
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:52,886
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

1003
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:59,788
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.

1004
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:04,551
Wanted to help people, now
look at you.

1005
01:20:06,153 --> 01:20:08,373
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who...

1006
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,301
still has a soul.

1007
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:23,283
Get me out of here, come on.

1008
01:20:25,123 --> 01:20:30,207
You know what my old man used to say to me?
One of his favorite of many sayings.

1009
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:35,689
"The early bird gets the worm, the second
mouse gets the cheese".

1010
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:38,302
You're not still pissed off about
the Switzerland thing, are you?

1011
01:20:38,304 --> 01:20:39,652
How can I be pissed with you, Tony?

1012
01:20:40,372 --> 01:20:42,542
I'm here to thank you. You gave me the

1013
01:20:42,543 --> 01:20:44,814
greatest gift that anybody's
ever given me.

1014
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:48,587
Desperation. If you think
back to Switzerland,

1015
01:20:48,587 --> 01:20:51,338
you said you'd meet me on
the rooftop, right?

1016
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:57,453
Well for the first 20 minutes, I actually
thought you'd show up.

1017
01:20:57,753 --> 01:20:59,802
For the next hour, I uhh...

1018
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:07,568
Well I considered taking that one step
shortcut to the lobby, if you know what I mean.

1019
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:10,529
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1020
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:14,305
But as I looked out over that city, nobody
knew I was there,

1021
01:21:14,407 --> 01:21:17,033
nobody could see me, no one
was even looking.

1022
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:22,377
I had a thought that would guide
me for years to come.

1023
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:24,618
Anonymity, Tony.

1024
01:21:26,099 --> 01:21:29,283
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra
ever since, right?

1025
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:31,582
You simply rule from behind
the scenes.

1026
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:33,904
Because the second you
give evil a face

1027
01:21:34,064 --> 01:21:37,725
Bin Laden, Gaddafi, The Mandarin

1028
01:21:37,907 --> 01:21:39,048
You hand the people a target.

1029
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,027
You're something else.

1030
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:44,349
You have met him, I assume?

1031
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:45,672
Yeah, Sir Laurence Obliviate.

1032
01:21:45,953 --> 01:21:49,115
I know he's a little over the top sometimes...
it's not entirely my fault.

1033
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:51,278
He has a tend... he's
a stage actor.

1034
01:21:52,077 --> 01:21:54,639
They say his Lear was the toast of
Croydon, wherever that is.

1035
01:21:55,238 --> 01:21:59,640
Anyway, the point is ever since that big
dude with the hammer fell out of the sky.

1036
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:02,323
Subtlety's kinda had its day.

1037
01:22:02,643 --> 01:22:04,203
What's next for you in your world?

1038
01:22:04,204 --> 01:22:09,047
Well, I wanted to repay you for the self
same gift you so graciously imparted to me.

1039
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:21,372
Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not
sure if you can tell.

1040
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:27,676
But at this moment the body is trying to decide
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1041
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:33,298
And if it gives up, I have to say the
detonation is quite spectacular.

1042
01:22:35,181 --> 01:22:37,904
But until that point, it's really
just a lot of pain.

1043
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:42,306
We haven't even talked
salary yet.

1044
01:22:43,106 --> 01:22:45,992
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1045
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:47,229
Let him go.

1046
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:54,153
- Hold on, hold on. Maya
- I said let him go!

1047
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,141
What are you doing?

1048
01:22:56,143 --> 01:22:59,315
1200ccs, a dose half of this
size and I'm dead.

1049
01:22:59,796 --> 01:23:03,439
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1050
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,520
Maya, give me the injector.

1051
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,962
If I die Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1052
01:23:10,963 --> 01:23:12,162
We're not doing this, okay?

1053
01:23:12,163 --> 01:23:14,604
What happens to you? What happens
if you go too hot?

1054
01:23:28,132 --> 01:23:32,536
The good news is, a high level position
has just been vacated.

1055
01:23:40,761 --> 01:23:43,782
- You're a maniac.
- No, I'm a visionary.

1056
01:23:45,743 --> 01:23:50,305
But I do own a maniac, and he takes
the stage tonight.

1057
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:57,671
Once we get the Iron Patriot installed, it'll
take me 9 to 10 minutes for a take down.

1058
01:23:58,911 --> 01:24:01,631
That's great. The last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.

1059
01:24:07,716 --> 01:24:09,358
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1060
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:15,079
Hello Colonel.

1061
01:24:15,081 --> 01:24:16,721
Step aside.

1062
01:24:24,846 --> 01:24:27,609
We'll get you out of there,
don't worry.

1063
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,689
You'll damage the armor.

1064
01:24:30,168 --> 01:24:33,971
Yes, I will, but you can
fix it, right?

1065
01:24:34,851 --> 01:24:38,094
I'm going to take the suit up to base
camp, and I want Potts with me.

1066
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:40,815
She's still in Phase 2.

1067
01:24:41,595 --> 01:24:44,118
You're not going deaf, are ya?

1068
01:24:59,587 --> 01:25:01,667
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1069
01:25:02,189 --> 01:25:04,429
Hey, uh, ponytail express.

1070
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:07,911
What is the mileage count between Tennessee
and Miami? - 832 miles.

1071
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:09,273
Very nice.

1072
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,555
I'm good like that.

1073
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:14,354
- Can you uh, stop that?
- Break it, you bought it.

1074
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:16,880
I think I bought it.

1075
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:20,311
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away, that
belongs to my friend's sister,

1076
01:25:20,313 --> 01:25:23,561
and that's why I'm gonna
kill you first.

1077
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,162
- What're ya gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1078
01:25:25,561 --> 01:25:29,083
- You're zip-tied to a bed.
- This.

1079
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:34,006
That.

1080
01:25:38,328 --> 01:25:39,770
Are you comin' out?

1081
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:46,734
Do not open, do not open, don't open, don't
open, don't-Alright, let's go.

1082
01:25:54,018 --> 01:25:56,740
You breathe fire? Okay.

1083
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:03,344
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1084
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:09,307
This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand.

1085
01:26:09,309 --> 01:26:12,509
And the world's most feared
terrorist in the other.

1086
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,470
I'll own the War on Terror.

1087
01:26:16,952 --> 01:26:21,836
Creates supply and demand for you
and your brothers and sisters.

1088
01:26:24,997 --> 01:26:30,199
Trust me, you're gonna' in a puddle of
blood on the ground in 5, 4, 3, Come on!, 2

1089
01:26:32,761 --> 01:26:33,712
How did we get this shooot?

1090
01:26:33,712 --> 01:26:36,592
Alright, I'm going to give you a chance to
escape, put down your weapons.

1091
01:26:37,564 --> 01:26:41,826
And tie yourselves into those chairs
and I'll let you live. In 5, 4, bang.

1092
01:26:43,606 --> 01:26:46,060
You should be gone by now, you
should have already been gone.

1093
01:26:46,061 --> 01:26:47,170
I'm just beyond terrified.

1094
01:26:47,171 --> 01:26:48,649
Here it comes.

1095
01:26:49,051 --> 01:26:50,653
3, 4

1096
01:26:50,654 --> 01:26:52,653
- Shut up.
- 5...4...3...2...1.

1097
01:26:53,452 --> 01:26:54,653
I told you.

1098
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:08,662
Where's the rest?

1099
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:09,938
Honestly, I hate working here...
they are so weird.

1100
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:16,862
Better late than never.

1101
01:28:22,868 --> 01:28:24,628
Not this time. Not the face.

1102
01:28:26,487 --> 01:28:28,783
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello,
by the way.

1103
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:29,578
Oh, hello sir.

1104
01:28:35,703 --> 01:28:38,015
All personnel, Stark is loose and
somewhere in the compound.

1105
01:28:38,016 --> 01:28:40,096
Repeat: Stark is loose and somewhere
in the compound.

1106
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:43,841
Ah, crap.

1107
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:58,828
- Tony.
- Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1108
01:28:58,828 --> 01:29:00,109
No, you got yours?

1109
01:29:00,109 --> 01:29:03,412
Uh, um, kind of. Main house
as fast as you can.

1110
01:29:03,412 --> 01:29:04,693
Somebody I'd like you to meet.

1111
01:29:10,145 --> 01:29:12,166
You, you. Move!
Get out!

1112
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:14,139
The room is secure. I have eyes
on the Mandarin.

1113
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:16,649
What's this? I had winner's.

1114
01:29:25,047 --> 01:29:26,255
What've you come as?

1115
01:29:26,256 --> 01:29:28,490
Make a move and I'll break
your face.

1116
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:33,453
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1117
01:29:34,134 --> 01:29:35,354
This is the Mandarin?

1118
01:29:35,355 --> 01:29:37,215
I know, it's, it's embarrassing.

1119
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:39,176
Hi, I'm Trevor,
Trevor Slattery.

1120
01:29:39,177 --> 01:29:43,113
I know I'm shorter in person, I'm a bit
small, everyone says that but, uh, hey

1121
01:29:43,113 --> 01:29:46,659
if you're here to arrest me, there are
some people who I'd like to roll on.

1122
01:29:46,661 --> 01:29:47,841
Here's how it works,
Meryl Streep.

1123
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,921
You tell him where Pepper
is and he'll stop doing it.

1124
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:53,623
Doing what? Oh, I get it! Ow!
That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1125
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:57,546
I do not know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1126
01:29:57,547 --> 01:29:59,708
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1127
01:30:00,068 --> 01:30:03,654
What? No. But I do know what's happening
off the coast.

1128
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:07,431
Something to do with uh... a big boat.
I can take you there.

1129
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:11,069
Oh! Olé, Olé, Olé, Olé...

1130
01:30:11,595 --> 01:30:14,117
Tony, I swear to God, I'm going
to blow his face off.

1131
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:17,637
Oh this next bit may include the
Vice President as well.

1132
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,435
- Is that important?
- Somewhat.

1133
01:30:20,435 --> 01:30:21,721
Yeah, a little bit.

1134
01:30:24,907 --> 01:30:26,612
- So?
- Uh, what are we gonna do.

1135
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:30,430
We don't have any transport.

1136
01:30:31,452 --> 01:30:34,854
Hey, Ringo, didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1137
01:30:37,275 --> 01:30:39,725
If he's right about the location, we're
20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1138
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:42,246
But we also have to figure out this
Vice President thing, right?

1139
01:30:42,421 --> 01:30:45,261
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1140
01:30:47,182 --> 01:30:49,703
- Hello.
- Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1141
01:30:50,385 --> 01:30:51,773
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

1142
01:30:51,774 --> 01:30:54,014
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign,

1143
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:56,226
and we've got to get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1144
01:30:56,228 --> 01:31:00,911
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast ham
surrounded by the agency's finest.

1145
01:31:00,912 --> 01:31:04,011
And the President is safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1146
01:31:04,112 --> 01:31:05,573
I think we're good here.

1147
01:31:05,574 --> 01:31:07,514
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1148
01:31:07,654 --> 01:31:09,632
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a trojan horse.

1149
01:31:09,634 --> 01:31:10,496
They're gonna take out

1150
01:31:10,497 --> 01:31:13,158
the President somehow. We have to
immediately alert that plane.

1151
01:31:13,358 --> 01:31:15,859
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security
lock it down. If need be,

1152
01:31:15,859 --> 01:31:19,139
they can have F22s in the air in 30 seconds.
Thank you, Colonel.

1153
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,033
Rhodes and Stark out.

1154
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,260
Everything okay, sir?

1155
01:31:24,761 --> 01:31:26,284
Couldn't be better.

1156
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:35,631
I love you, baby.

1157
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:58,082
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see
you could make it, son.

1158
01:31:58,185 --> 01:31:59,265
I feel safer already.

1159
01:32:04,868 --> 01:32:06,149
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save

1160
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:08,149
the President or Pepper.
We can't do both.

1161
01:32:08,369 --> 01:32:10,051
Sir, I have an update
from Malibu.

1162
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:12,256
The cranes have finally
arrived and the

1163
01:32:12,257 --> 01:32:14,354
cellar doors are being
cleared as we speak.

1164
01:32:14,913 --> 01:32:16,335
And what about the suit
I'm wearing?

1165
01:32:16,336 --> 01:32:18,036
The armor is now at 92%.

1166
01:32:19,095 --> 01:32:20,416
That's gonna have to do.

1167
01:32:30,082 --> 01:32:31,811
Oh, here he comes, here he comes,
get a quick picture.

1168
01:32:31,813 --> 01:32:32,313
Sure.

1169
01:32:50,173 --> 01:32:52,096
Is everything all right,
Colonel?

1170
01:33:22,912 --> 01:33:25,475
It is an honor,
Mr. President.

1171
01:33:25,954 --> 01:33:28,296
If you're gonna do it, do it.

1172
01:33:28,497 --> 01:33:29,890
Woh. Cool your boots, Sir.

1173
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,887
That's not how the
Mandarin works.

1174
01:33:31,889 --> 01:33:34,489
Sir. Air Force One's
been compromised.

1175
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,404
Internal shots, temperature
spikes.

1176
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:37,567
Get me eyes on it now.

1177
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:39,212
Image coming through now, Sir.

1178
01:33:41,895 --> 01:33:44,235
Is that Rhodes?

1179
01:34:12,552 --> 01:34:15,552
The President.
Now.

1180
01:34:16,034 --> 01:34:17,515
He's not here.

1181
01:34:21,038 --> 01:34:23,002
Try the jet stream.

1182
01:34:24,704 --> 01:34:26,801
Speaking of which, go fish!

1183
01:34:49,154 --> 01:34:51,595
Walk away from that, you
son of a bitch.

1184
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:06,904
- How many in the air?
- Thirteen, sir.

1185
01:35:08,365 --> 01:35:10,166
- How many can I carry
- Four, sir.

1186
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:23,435
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's
your name? Heather..

1187
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:33,974
Listen to me, see that guy?

1188
01:35:33,975 --> 01:35:35,393
I'm gonna swing by him

1189
01:35:35,394 --> 01:35:36,682
and you're just gonna grab him.

1190
01:35:36,684 --> 01:35:37,903
You got it?

1191
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:41,856
I will electrify your arm,

1192
01:35:41,858 --> 01:35:43,626
you won't be able to open
your hand.

1193
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:46,252
You can do this, Heather.

1194
01:35:55,073 --> 01:35:57,814
Easy, see? Eleven
more to go.

1195
01:36:00,676 --> 01:36:02,572
Remember that game called
Barrel of Monkeys?

1196
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:03,878
That's what we're going to do.

1197
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,751
18,000 feet.

1198
01:36:05,351 --> 01:36:07,320
Come on, people! Everybody, grab
your monkey!

1199
01:36:12,002 --> 01:36:15,284
- Nice!
- 10,000 feet.

1200
01:36:18,527 --> 01:36:20,488
- 6,000 feet.
- Come on, people.

1201
01:36:21,328 --> 01:36:22,970
Come on, come on, come on

1202
01:36:26,813 --> 01:36:30,175
- Yeah!
- 1000 feet.

1203
01:36:31,694 --> 01:36:34,439
400 feet. 200 feet,
sir.

1204
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,318
It's a tricky monkey,
let's get him.

1205
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:38,418
Hello.

1206
01:37:00,912 --> 01:37:02,640
Nice work guys.
Excellent.

1207
01:37:02,641 --> 01:37:05,033
Good team effort all around.
Go us.

1208
01:37:05,675 --> 01:37:08,395
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,
we still gotta get Pepp...

1209
01:37:16,201 --> 01:37:18,722
That came out of nowhere.

1210
01:37:19,563 --> 01:37:20,479
Gimme some good news man.

1211
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,042
- I think they all made it.
- Thank God.

1212
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:24,043
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1213
01:37:24,445 --> 01:37:25,962
You couldn't save the President
with the suit,

1214
01:37:25,963 --> 01:37:27,564
how are you gonna save Pepper
without it?

1215
01:37:28,127 --> 01:37:30,059
Uh, say Jarvis, is it
that time?

1216
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,170
The "house party"
protocol, sir?

1217
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:33,270
Correct.

1218
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:06,046
Hi.

1219
01:38:12,451 --> 01:38:16,953
You think he's gonna help you...
he won't.

1220
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:24,512
Having you here is not just
to motivate Tony Stark,

1221
01:38:24,814 --> 01:38:27,880
it's actually more embarrassing
than that.

1222
01:38:28,578 --> 01:38:33,381
- You're here as my, um
- Trophy.

1223
01:38:45,349 --> 01:38:47,469
Good evening, sir.

1224
01:38:51,472 --> 01:38:53,394
Welcome aboard,
Mr. President.

1225
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:05,444
You ever heard of an elephant
graveyard?

1226
01:39:05,444 --> 01:39:09,722
Well, two years ago, the elephant in
the room was this scow.

1227
01:39:12,474 --> 01:39:13,474
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1228
01:39:13,734 --> 01:39:17,194
Of course you remember when she spilled 100
million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

1229
01:39:17,195 --> 01:39:19,757
Thanks to you, not one fat
cat saw a day in court.

1230
01:39:20,337 --> 01:39:21,658
What do you want from me?

1231
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:24,640
Uh, nothing, sir.

1232
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,764
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1233
01:39:28,332 --> 01:39:32,895
You see, I've moved on. I've found myself
a new political patron, and

1234
01:39:33,114 --> 01:39:35,595
At this time tomorrow, he'll
have your job.

1235
01:39:37,296 --> 01:39:38,997
String him up.

1236
01:39:57,569 --> 01:39:58,829
Come on.

1237
01:40:03,292 --> 01:40:05,054
You're not gonna freak out
on me, right?

1238
01:40:05,055 --> 01:40:05,613
I hope not.

1239
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:33,250
Oh my God.

1240
01:40:34,731 --> 01:40:37,099
He's strung up over the oil tank, they're
gonna light him up, man.

1241
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,153
Viking funeral.

1242
01:40:38,613 --> 01:40:41,375
- Public execution.
- Yeah, death by oil.

1243
01:40:47,657 --> 01:40:50,738
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.

1244
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,087
Okay, that's good.

1245
01:40:53,088 --> 01:40:55,962
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1246
01:40:58,046 --> 01:40:59,131
Is your gun up?

1247
01:40:59,556 --> 01:41:01,051
Yup, what do I do?

1248
01:41:01,051 --> 01:41:03,780
Stay on my six, cover high, and don't
shoot me in the back.

1249
01:41:03,782 --> 01:41:05,154
Six, high, back. Alright.

1250
01:41:15,313 --> 01:41:16,416
You see that? Nailed it.

1251
01:41:16,417 --> 01:41:18,115
Yeah, you really killed
the glass.

1252
01:41:18,117 --> 01:41:19,234
I was aiming for the bulb?

1253
01:41:19,234 --> 01:41:20,796
You can't hit a bulb from
this distance.

1254
01:41:25,399 --> 01:41:27,725
I'm out. Gimme, gimme, you got
an extra magazine?

1255
01:41:27,725 --> 01:41:29,000
They're not universal, Tony.

1256
01:41:29,322 --> 01:41:30,631
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Gimme another one.

1257
01:41:31,493 --> 01:41:33,085
I don't have one that
fits that gun.

1258
01:41:33,265 --> 01:41:33,787
You've got like five of them.

1259
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:36,029
Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spot. Ready?

1260
01:41:36,947 --> 01:41:38,192
What'd you see?

1261
01:41:38,193 --> 01:41:40,908
Too fast, nothing.
Here we go.

1262
01:41:45,252 --> 01:41:47,212
Three guys, one girl,
all armed.

1263
01:41:57,167 --> 01:41:58,862
God, I'd kill for some
armor right now.

1264
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,769
- You're right, we need backup.
- Yeah, much.

1265
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:04,069
You know what?

1266
01:42:07,533 --> 01:42:09,094
- Is that?
- Yep.

1267
01:42:10,576 --> 01:42:11,694
- Are those?
- Yeah.

1268
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:30,466
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1269
01:42:35,628 --> 01:42:38,011
Jarvis, target Extremis heat
signatures.

1270
01:42:38,012 --> 01:42:39,800
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1271
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,273
Yes, sir.

1272
01:42:45,835 --> 01:42:48,917
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1273
01:42:50,478 --> 01:42:51,279
Take 'em to church.

1274
01:42:58,203 --> 01:42:59,203
Gentleman.

1275
01:43:08,199 --> 01:43:08,949
Here it comes.

1276
01:43:12,891 --> 01:43:14,912
Jarvis, get Igor to steady
this thing.

1277
01:43:27,179 --> 01:43:29,328
This is how you've been managing
your downtime, huh?

1278
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:30,381
Everybody needs a hobby.

1279
01:43:36,744 --> 01:43:38,786
Heartbreaker? Help Red Snapper
out, will ya?

1280
01:44:07,043 --> 01:44:07,595
Nice timing.

1281
01:44:07,596 --> 01:44:09,804
Oh yeah, that's awesome. Give me
a suit, okay?

1282
01:44:11,966 --> 01:44:13,766
Oh, I'm sorry. They're
only coded to me.

1283
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:14,953
What's that mean?

1284
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:15,927
I got you covered.

1285
01:44:19,649 --> 01:44:22,851
- Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
- Very funny.

1286
01:44:40,662 --> 01:44:42,944
- Sir, I've located Miss Potts.
- About time.

1287
01:44:55,751 --> 01:44:58,673
Stop, put it down, put it
down, put it down.

1288
01:45:01,314 --> 01:45:03,595
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1289
01:45:06,197 --> 01:45:07,065
You're such a jerk.

1290
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:08,679
Yup, we'll talk about
it over dinner.

1291
01:45:10,519 --> 01:45:13,240
Come on, a little more, baby.

1292
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:30,532
Is this guy bothering you?

1293
01:45:32,091 --> 01:45:34,814
Don't get up!

1294
01:45:37,815 --> 01:45:39,777
Is it hot in there?

1295
01:45:41,137 --> 01:45:42,818
Stuck? Feel a little stuck?

1296
01:45:43,819 --> 01:45:47,100
Like a little turtle, cooking in
his little turtle suit?

1297
01:45:47,701 --> 01:45:49,301
Tony

1298
01:45:49,302 --> 01:45:50,944
She's watching.

1299
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:53,666
I think you should close
your eyes.

1300
01:45:53,667 --> 01:45:54,666
Close your eyes.

1301
01:45:55,265 --> 01:45:58,228
Close your eyes. You don't
want to see this.

1302
01:46:05,672 --> 01:46:07,193
Yeah, you take a minute.

1303
01:46:40,252 --> 01:46:41,934
Jarvis, give me a suit
right now!

1304
01:46:52,899 --> 01:46:54,500
Aw, come on!

1305
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,863
Mr. President! Just hold on,
alright? I'm coming.

1306
01:47:00,144 --> 01:47:02,385
Just hold on.
Hold on.

1307
01:47:24,198 --> 01:47:25,658
Buh-bye.

1308
01:47:37,364 --> 01:47:39,127
Brace yourself!

1309
01:47:49,613 --> 01:47:53,295
You look damn good, Mr. President, but
I'm gonna need that suit back.

1310
01:48:06,382 --> 01:48:08,463
The President is secure, Tony.
I'm clearing the area.

1311
01:48:08,465 --> 01:48:09,479
Nice work.

1312
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,824
- Ready sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1313
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:25,032
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you.
Just look at me.

1314
01:48:26,913 --> 01:48:29,511
Honey, I can't reach any further, and
you can't stay there, alright?

1315
01:48:29,512 --> 01:48:30,635
You gotta let go.

1316
01:48:30,636 --> 01:48:33,439
You gotta let go. I'll catch
you, I promise.

1317
01:49:03,935 --> 01:49:07,819
What a shame, I would
have caught her.

1318
01:49:38,128 --> 01:49:39,229
Eject.

1319
01:50:24,904 --> 01:50:27,345
Well here we are, on the roof.

1320
01:50:37,711 --> 01:50:39,511
- Mark 42 inbound.
- Well I'll be damned.

1321
01:50:40,311 --> 01:50:41,872
The prodigal son returns.

1322
01:50:58,042 --> 01:50:59,203
Whatever.

1323
01:51:00,203 --> 01:51:02,083
You really didn't deserve
her, Tony.

1324
01:51:03,327 --> 01:51:07,087
It's a pity. I was so close to having
her... perfect.

1325
01:51:09,949 --> 01:51:12,176
Okay, okay, wait, wait, slow down,
slow down.

1326
01:51:12,476 --> 01:51:14,412
You're right. I don't
deserve her.

1327
01:51:15,693 --> 01:51:17,213
But here's where you're wrong.

1328
01:51:17,934 --> 01:51:20,296
She was already perfect.

1329
01:51:26,859 --> 01:51:31,280
Jarvis, do me a favor and
blow Mark 42.

1330
01:51:31,404 --> 01:51:35,318
No...!!

1331
01:52:46,746 --> 01:52:48,706
No more false faces.

1332
01:52:49,287 --> 01:52:51,686
You said you wanted
the Mandarin.

1333
01:52:52,287 --> 01:52:54,390
You're looking right at him.

1334
01:52:55,391 --> 01:52:58,829
It was always me, Tony, right
from the start.

1335
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:00,573
I am the Mandarin!

1336
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,761
I got nothing.

1337
01:53:19,604 --> 01:53:22,766
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1338
01:53:31,332 --> 01:53:33,372
What? Oh what, are
you mad at me?

1339
01:53:58,747 --> 01:54:00,009
Honey.

1340
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:05,931
Oh my God.

1341
01:54:07,332 --> 01:54:09,814
That was really violent.

1342
01:54:10,574 --> 01:54:13,109
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were

1343
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:15,518
I was dead. Why? Because I
fell two hundred feet?

1344
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:22,222
- Who's the hot mess now?
- Still debatable.

1345
01:54:23,283 --> 01:54:24,452
Probably tipping your way
a little bit.

1346
01:54:24,453 --> 01:54:25,932
Why don't you dress like
this at home?

1347
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:28,125
Hmm? Sports bra, the
whole deal.

1348
01:54:28,466 --> 01:54:31,667
You know I think I understand why you
don't want to give up the suits.

1349
01:54:32,248 --> 01:54:34,208
What am I gonna complain
about now?

1350
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:39,051
Well, it's me. I'll think
of something.

1351
01:54:40,653 --> 01:54:43,694
- Don't touch me. No, I'm gonna burn you!
- No, no.

1352
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:46,435
You're not hot.

1353
01:54:47,456 --> 01:54:49,137
Am I gonna be okay?

1354
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:52,300
No, you're in a relationship with me,
everything will never be okay.

1355
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,140
But I think I can figure
this out, yeah.

1356
01:54:55,141 --> 01:54:59,625
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was
drunk. I think I can get you better.

1357
01:55:00,783 --> 01:55:02,385
That's what I do.
I fix things.

1358
01:55:03,626 --> 01:55:05,827
And all your distractions?

1359
01:55:06,228 --> 01:55:08,469
Uh, I'm gonna shave them
down a little bit.

1360
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:12,015
- Jarvis, hey.
- All wrapped up here, sir.

1361
01:55:12,016 --> 01:55:14,471
Will there be anything else?

1362
01:55:14,472 --> 01:55:15,472
You know what to do.

1363
01:55:16,172 --> 01:55:18,954
The "clean slate" protocol,
sir?

1364
01:55:18,956 --> 01:55:22,256
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1365
01:55:58,898 --> 01:56:01,000
Okay so far?
You like it?

1366
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:04,582
It'll do.

1367
01:56:12,546 --> 01:56:17,469
And so, as Christmas morning began, my
journey had reached its end.

1368
01:56:21,872 --> 01:56:26,154
You start with something pure,
something exciting.

1369
01:56:26,835 --> 01:56:29,595
Then come the mistakes.

1370
01:56:30,356 --> 01:56:32,278
The compromises.

1371
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,922
"We create our own demons".

1372
01:56:46,487 --> 01:56:48,487
It's great to see you.

1373
01:56:50,199 --> 01:56:52,600
As promised, I get Pepper sorted down

1374
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:54,394
Took some tinkering...

1375
01:56:54,412 --> 01:56:57,112
...but then I talked to myself,
why stop there.

1376
01:57:02,037 --> 01:57:04,739
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous.

1377
01:57:05,238 --> 01:57:08,640
But I'll bet none of those idiots ever had
to live with a chest full of shrapnel.

1378
01:57:09,002 --> 01:57:11,904
And now... neither will I.

1379
01:57:12,922 --> 01:57:16,685
Let me tell you, that was the best
sleep I'd had in years.

1380
01:57:37,708 --> 01:57:41,470
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No!

1381
01:58:59,238 --> 01:59:02,760
So if I were to wrap this up tight
with a bow or whatever.

1382
01:59:02,917 --> 01:59:09,342
I guess I'd say my armor was never
a distraction or a hobby.

1383
01:59:09,863 --> 01:59:11,783
It was a cocoon.

1384
01:59:12,805 --> 01:59:17,806
And now, I'm a changed man.

1385
01:59:26,854 --> 01:59:29,033
You can take away my house,

1386
01:59:29,434 --> 01:59:30,873
All my tricks and toys.

1387
01:59:31,454 --> 01:59:33,658
One thing you can't take away...

1388
01:59:36,819 --> 01:59:38,921
I am Iron Man.

1389
02:09:05,113 --> 02:09:07,416
You know, and thank you, by
the way, for listening.

1390
02:09:07,417 --> 02:09:10,404
There's just something about getting
it off my chest and putting

1391
02:09:10,405 --> 02:09:13,118
it out there in the atmosphere
instead of holding this in.

1392
02:09:13,448 --> 02:09:16,350
I mean, this is what gets people
sick, you know?

1393
02:09:16,551 --> 02:09:19,453
Wow, I had no idea you were
such a good listener.

1394
02:09:19,552 --> 02:09:23,162
To be able to share all of my intimate
thoughts and my experiences

1395
02:09:23,163 --> 02:09:26,457
with someone, it just cuts the weight
of it in half, you know.

1396
02:09:26,457 --> 02:09:27,811
It's like a snake swallowing
its own tail.

1397
02:09:27,913 --> 02:09:29,073
Everything comes full circle.

1398
02:09:29,358 --> 02:09:32,260
And... and the fact that you've been
able to help me process...

1399
02:09:34,832 --> 02:09:36,231
- So, uh...?
- You with me?

1400
02:09:36,233 --> 02:09:38,434
I was, yeah. Mm-hmm. We were...
uh, we were at, uh...

1401
02:09:38,435 --> 02:09:39,833
You actively napping?

1402
02:09:39,835 --> 02:09:42,235
I...I was... I... I...
I drifted.

1403
02:09:42,536 --> 02:09:43,837
Where did I lose you?

1404
02:09:45,637 --> 02:09:47,939
Elevator in Switzerland.

1405
02:09:48,739 --> 02:09:50,039
So you heard none of it?

1406
02:09:50,541 --> 02:09:53,762
I'm sorry, I'm not that
kind of doctor.

1407
02:09:53,764 --> 02:09:56,444
I'm not a therapist, it's not
my training.

1408
02:09:56,444 --> 02:09:57,845
- So?
- I don't have the...

1409
02:09:57,944 --> 02:10:00,546
- What? The time?
- Temperament.

1410
02:10:00,646 --> 02:10:02,681
You know what? Now that I
think about it,

1411
02:10:02,682 --> 02:10:06,250
Oh God my original wound.
1983, alright?

1412
02:10:06,251 --> 02:10:06,949
Yes.

1413
02:10:06,951 --> 02:10:09,652
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny?
That was weird.

1414
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,086
