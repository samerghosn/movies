1
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,960
Is it ready?

2
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:03,019
Hey! That's a great punch.

3
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,317
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:17,086
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,514
Wait.

6
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:38,413
Okay.

7
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:46,550
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,807
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,617
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,627
Watch out!

11
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:51,862
Okay!

12
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:19,287
That's not right.

13
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,399
Oh, you.

14
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,746
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,926
Damn it!

16
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,655
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,037
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:49,129
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.

19
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:53,667
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.

20
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,001
Wow.

21
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:02,121
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:05,833
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:09,725
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,918
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:36,052
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:45,374
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,351
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,217
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:59,695
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:12,485
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,486
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,905
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:19,616
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:21,764
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:25,664
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,000
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,672
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:36,591
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,761
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:43,120
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,197
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,466
Camera.

43
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,226
Here we go.

44
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,412
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,296
Take him!

46
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,931
Target's on the move.

47
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,688
Where is he?

48
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,851
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,116
- Let's go!
Go!

50
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,034
Move, move!

51
00:17:58,086 --> 00:18:00,232
Go, go, go!

52
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,146
Go! Go!

53
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,824
Clear everyone out!

54
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,240
Do not lose him!

55
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:57,326
Oh! No!

56
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,234
Get around behind him!

57
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,404
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,296
Oh, no.

59
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,505
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,369
Where is he?
- Target acquired.

61
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,388
Gringo!

62
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,900
Let's go.

63
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,707
No!

64
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:55,052
Please! No!

65
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:58,536
Not the computer!

66
00:21:58,537 --> 00:22:00,517
Gimme that! No!

67
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:22,240
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:27,115
Oh, no.

69
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,041
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:52,102
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,707
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.

72
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:29,919
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,817
Do it now!

74
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:41,513
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:43,827
Move!
Get out of the way!

76
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:45,487
No!

77
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:20,612
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:30,489
Get him!

79
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,326
Shoot!

80
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:50,302
Leave me alone.

81
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,790
No! No!

82
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,336
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:20,184
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:29,653
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:35,105
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:38,650
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:43,217
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,642
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:57,145
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,546
He didn't lose us.

91
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:03,424
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:05,844
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:09,201
Something big hit us!

94
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:14,490
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

95
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:20,162
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:22,672
Well, it's gone.

97
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:26,240
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,451
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:31,799
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,760
It

101
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,586
was Banner.

102
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:45,106
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:49,359
You've done a good job.

104
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:55,038
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,601
Wait.

106
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:04,519
Please.

107
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:13,159
Where am I?

108
00:29:48,174 --> 00:29:51,343
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:52,552
I've seen good men go down

110
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:56,015
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:58,349
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:29:58,352 --> 00:29:59,809
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,530
But this?

114
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:05,775
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:08,736
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:11,864
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:15,785
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:18,383
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:23,183
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:24,930
Sir.

121
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:17,277
Tienes más stretchy?

122
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:21,319
Yeah. Perfecto.

123
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:54,384
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:58,240
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:03,851
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.

126
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:08,564
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:11,233
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:13,548
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:17,089
Yes.

130
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:20,176
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:24,497
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:27,291
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:30,019
We were tryin' to make you better.

134
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:38,344
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:41,013
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:44,308
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:49,021
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:52,330
And something went very wrong.

139
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:56,673
Or it went very right.

140
00:32:56,989 --> 00:33:01,159
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,203
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:06,413
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:08,500
You were trying other things.

144
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,893
One serum we developed

145
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,047
was very promising.

146
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:17,191
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:20,405
He is not one of us.

148
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:27,832
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.

149
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:31,772
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:33,107
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:35,652
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:39,990
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,285
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:46,558
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:51,432
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:14,324
Take care, kids.

157
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:26,657
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:28,449
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:31,704
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:34,978
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:40,378
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,143
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:36:44,425 --> 00:36:48,887
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,826
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,313
Good. That's good.

166
00:36:57,313 --> 00:37:02,233
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:06,623
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:10,675
There is one other thing.

169
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:16,512
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,599
Coming through.

171
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:26,146
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,135
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:33,117
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,657
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:48,668
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,336
All right.

177
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,186
Okay.

178
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,668
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,599
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:12,382
Oh, kids.

181
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:14,719
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,846
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,574
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:28,409
Stan?

185
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:33,737
And he... I go, " So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,864
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil. "

187
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:38,451
And he goes, "Not where you been at. "

188
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:42,673
I thought, "Oh, my God. " I just felt so awful.

189
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,666
Bruce?

190
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:21,298
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:37,344
Betty...

192
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:40,949
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:45,945
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:29,954
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:41,324
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:44,052
Please. Come with me.

197
00:42:44,954 --> 00:42:46,721
Please.

198
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:18,382
It's our data.

199
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,344
I got in there before they carted it all away.

200
00:43:24,077 --> 00:43:28,262
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:34,836
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:37,255
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

203
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:38,840
You have to be sure.

204
00:43:38,842 --> 00:43:43,971
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:43:43,972 --> 00:43:49,016
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:52,353
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:55,034
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:48,295
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:53,347
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:58,378
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,882
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:05,737
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:10,599
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,309
I need to take a bus.

215
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,536
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

216
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,617
Okay.

217
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:24,956
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:29,217
I...

219
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,719
What?

220
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,750
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:38,264
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,838
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:25,590
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:27,677
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:31,864
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,405
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

227
00:46:37,813 --> 00:46:40,648
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:46:40,648 --> 00:46:44,943
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.

229
00:46:44,945 --> 00:46:47,755
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:36,134
Is everything okay?

231
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:39,478
I think so.

232
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,190
Come here.

233
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:52,905
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:47:53,597 --> 00:47:56,157
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:48:00,436 --> 00:48:02,021
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:04,335
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:14,617
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:16,119
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,452
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:19,469
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:32,342
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:34,407
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:37,858
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:56,672
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,304
Sir.

246
00:49:00,414 --> 00:49:02,559
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:51,422
I got him!

248
00:49:51,423 --> 00:49:55,028
Stop! Stop!

249
00:49:56,344 --> 00:49:58,242
I know you're in there!

250
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,702
General, please!

251
00:50:03,686 --> 00:50:05,239
Sir?

252
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:06,954
Dad!

253
00:50:13,905 --> 00:50:18,115
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:20,034
There he is!

255
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:22,329
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.

256
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:25,010
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:32,275
He's locked in.

258
00:50:37,762 --> 00:50:39,824
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:41,567
Fire!

260
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,842
Get her back here!

261
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,373
Now she'll see.

262
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:01,355
Alpha team?

263
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:04,447
Let him have all of it.

264
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:12,204
Come on, light him up!

265
00:52:14,943 --> 00:52:18,797
Where are the fifty cals?
Move your asses!

266
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:08,172
Oh, my God!

267
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,844
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:53:13,043 --> 00:53:14,679
Sir?

269
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:17,139
Cover me.

270
00:53:34,731 --> 00:53:36,746
Remember me?

271
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,108
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:04,483
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:11,701
Move!

274
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:26,032
Hold your position!

275
00:54:26,032 --> 00:54:27,882
Do it now!

276
00:54:53,226 --> 00:54:54,851
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:54:54,853 --> 00:54:56,353
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:57,480
You're killing him!

279
00:54:57,481 --> 00:54:59,898
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,831
Bruce!

281
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,916
Bruce! Bruce!

282
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,327
Where's the gunship?

283
00:55:59,012 --> 00:56:00,304
Is that it?

284
00:56:00,304 --> 00:56:02,181
Blonsky, pull back now.

285
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:03,985
Pull back!

286
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:08,918
Is that all you got?

287
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:18,619
- Fall back!
Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

288
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:20,518
Find cover!

289
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:25,724
Betty!

290
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,706
Fire, goddamn it!

291
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,706
Bruce?

292
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,101
Stop firing!

293
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,083
No!

294
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:05,780
You did the right thing, calling us.

295
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:10,396
I need to know where they're going.

296
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:12,648
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

297
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,452
From who?

298
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:17,530
He protected her. You almost killed her.

299
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,369
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

300
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:24,164
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

301
00:58:24,164 --> 00:58:27,418
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

302
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,021
And you are.

303
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,561
I don't know where he's going.

304
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,697
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

305
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:41,536
And I can't help either one of them.

306
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,532
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

307
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:51,429
Now I know!

308
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,679
Where does she meet these guys?

309
00:59:47,693 --> 00:59:49,378
Bruce?

310
00:59:59,085 --> 01:00:00,768
Bruce.

311
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:23,126
It's okay. It's okay.

312
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:39,032
Come here. Come this way.

313
01:00:41,724 --> 01:00:43,871
Watch your head.

314
01:00:58,456 --> 01:01:00,092
Okay.

315
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:12,072
We're okay.

316
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,378
It's okay.

317
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:21,922
It's just the rain.

318
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:32,960
Will he ever walk again?

319
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,630
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

320
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:40,512
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

321
01:01:40,512 --> 01:01:44,237
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

322
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:47,945
Here.

323
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,664
Okay.

324
01:03:30,827 --> 01:03:32,547
Bruce?

325
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:35,306
Oh, hi.

326
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:37,012
Are you okay?

327
01:03:37,128 --> 01:03:38,461
Yeah.

328
01:03:38,463 --> 01:03:40,797
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

329
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:43,894
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

330
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,139
You ate it?

331
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:50,478
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

332
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:52,079
Wow.

333
01:03:53,065 --> 01:03:57,487
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

334
01:03:57,487 --> 01:04:00,157
First thing's first.

335
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:02,304
Oh, you're kidding me.

336
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,686
What?

337
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,679
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

338
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:18,224
I'll take my chances.

339
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:20,809
Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash

340
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:24,690
between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary

341
01:04:24,692 --> 01:04:27,735
on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.

342
01:04:27,737 --> 01:04:31,074
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.

343
01:04:31,074 --> 01:04:32,617
It was so big.

344
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:35,579
- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.

345
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:38,710
McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,

346
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,503
captured this on his cell phone.

347
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:42,297
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"

348
01:04:42,298 --> 01:04:47,318
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

349
01:04:54,315 --> 01:04:57,360
Not too short back there.

350
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,338
I have done this before, you know.

351
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:18,387
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

352
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:20,820
With clippers, usually.

353
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:17,967
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

354
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:19,427
We can't do this.

355
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:22,027
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

356
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,159
No.

357
01:06:24,811 --> 01:06:26,579
I can't.

358
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,125
I can't get too excited.

359
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,922
Not even a little excited?

360
01:06:39,081 --> 01:06:40,978
It's okay.

361
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,525
Sir, it's Blonsky.

362
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:52,951
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

363
01:06:53,224 --> 01:06:55,407
Ask him yourself.

364
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,291
Sir?

365
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:24,489
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

366
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:32,708
How do you feel?

367
01:07:34,155 --> 01:07:37,085
Pissed off and ready for round three.

368
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,088
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

369
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:50,398
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

370
01:07:50,844 --> 01:07:54,056
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

371
01:07:54,056 --> 01:07:57,059
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

372
01:07:57,061 --> 01:07:58,311
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

373
01:07:58,311 --> 01:08:02,025
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

374
01:08:02,025 --> 01:08:04,445
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

375
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:06,655
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

376
01:08:06,657 --> 01:08:11,094
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

377
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:16,586
Well, we could sell this.

378
01:08:16,587 --> 01:08:20,644
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

379
01:08:22,345 --> 01:08:25,572
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

380
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,725
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

381
01:08:27,726 --> 01:08:30,061
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

382
01:08:30,063 --> 01:08:32,399
and local PD have been placed on alert.

383
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,152
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

384
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:37,197
They're not gonna just pop up.

385
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,326
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

386
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:42,578
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

387
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:44,414
If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.

388
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,667
He's not trying to escape this time.

389
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,252
He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.

390
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:50,756
We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.

391
01:08:50,757 --> 01:08:53,092
You all have copies of the correspondence.

392
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:55,220
The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue

393
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:57,867
have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.

394
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:00,581
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

395
01:09:01,314 --> 01:09:03,606
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

396
01:09:03,608 --> 01:09:06,537
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

397
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,555
Hey.

398
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:53,601
Smile.

399
01:10:03,521 --> 01:10:05,703
What is it like?

400
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:10,385
When it happens, what do you experience?

401
01:10:10,614 --> 01:10:13,283
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

402
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:15,884
Those induced hallucinations?

403
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:20,060
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

404
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,384
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

405
01:10:25,385 --> 01:10:30,725
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

406
01:10:30,725 --> 01:10:33,979
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

407
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:38,085
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

408
01:10:39,988 --> 01:10:44,675
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

409
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:46,412
Maybe your mind is in there,

410
01:10:46,412 --> 01:10:49,123
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

411
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:52,934
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

412
01:11:05,648 --> 01:11:07,189
Are you ready?

413
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:09,457
Let's even the playing field a little.

414
01:11:12,364 --> 01:11:14,167
Gentlemen.

415
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:21,810
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

416
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:35,951
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

417
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:53,063
All right. Come.

418
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:11,207
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

419
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:13,570
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

420
01:12:13,572 --> 01:12:16,115
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

421
01:12:16,117 --> 01:12:18,869
Right. Let's get a cab.

422
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:23,605
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

423
01:12:28,007 --> 01:12:29,676
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

424
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:32,889
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

425
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,452
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

426
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,983
Are you out of your mind?

427
01:12:40,984 --> 01:12:42,402
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

428
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:44,632
You don't like a good ride?

429
01:12:45,948 --> 01:12:47,716
Asshole!

430
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:52,916
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

431
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:57,546
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

432
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,100
Okay.

433
01:13:06,143 --> 01:13:08,185
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

434
01:13:08,186 --> 01:13:11,247
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

435
01:13:11,649 --> 01:13:13,734
Oh! Dr Ross!

436
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:17,176
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

437
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:21,140
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

438
01:13:22,457 --> 01:13:24,354
Mr Green?

439
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:29,840
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

440
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:31,676
And if you were, what would it look like?

441
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:36,432
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

442
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:38,143
Nothing could have surprised me more

443
01:13:38,144 --> 01:13:41,105
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

444
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:43,859
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

445
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:45,612
Even if everything goes perfectly,

446
01:13:45,613 --> 01:13:49,966
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

447
01:13:50,453 --> 01:13:52,453
is that going to be a lasting cure

448
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:56,310
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

449
01:13:58,087 --> 01:14:00,069
I don't know.

450
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:05,530
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

451
01:14:05,972 --> 01:14:10,936
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

452
01:14:10,938 --> 01:14:16,005
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

453
01:14:17,197 --> 01:14:19,407
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

454
01:14:19,408 --> 01:14:23,037
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

455
01:14:23,037 --> 01:14:26,015
this will be very dangerous for you.

456
01:14:27,293 --> 01:14:31,422
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

457
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:36,194
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

458
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:32,900
How you feeling, man?

459
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:36,233
Like a monster.

460
01:15:55,621 --> 01:15:57,886
Okay. On the table.

461
01:15:58,123 --> 01:16:04,021
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

462
01:16:04,757 --> 01:16:08,234
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

463
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:16,869
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

464
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:22,625
Okay...

465
01:16:22,698 --> 01:16:24,680
You, you, you.

466
01:16:25,786 --> 01:16:29,761
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

467
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,935
We have begun.

468
01:16:35,256 --> 01:16:38,386
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

469
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:42,932
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

470
01:16:42,934 --> 01:16:44,618
Just relax.

471
01:16:44,854 --> 01:16:48,710
Okay. We are comprehensive.

472
01:16:51,404 --> 01:16:53,385
Here you go.

473
01:17:02,877 --> 01:17:05,393
All right. We set to pop?

474
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:10,064
I'd take your hands off him.

475
01:17:29,372 --> 01:17:31,934
Oh, my God!

476
01:17:45,519 --> 01:17:48,079
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

477
01:17:58,368 --> 01:18:01,037
- Now. Okay, now!
Wait.

478
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:04,135
Now, do it! Do it!

479
01:18:11,136 --> 01:18:13,721
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

480
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:18,742
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

481
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:24,210
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

482
01:18:24,904 --> 01:18:27,835
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

483
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,226
Bruce.

484
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:50,125
Oh, my God.

485
01:19:00,994 --> 01:19:04,519
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

486
01:19:08,046 --> 01:19:09,730
Bruce?

487
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,951
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

488
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,403
You did it.

489
01:19:26,404 --> 01:19:29,157
He's fine. This is fantastic.

490
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:31,007
It's over.

491
01:19:31,411 --> 01:19:32,828
Hi.

492
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:34,466
Hi.

493
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:48,349
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

494
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,018
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

495
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:52,479
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

496
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,359
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

497
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,195
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

498
01:19:58,197 --> 01:20:01,533
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

499
01:20:01,534 --> 01:20:04,412
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

500
01:20:04,413 --> 01:20:07,207
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,

501
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,211
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

502
01:20:09,212 --> 01:20:11,631
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

503
01:20:11,631 --> 01:20:13,507
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

504
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:15,219
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

505
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,720
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

506
01:20:16,721 --> 01:20:19,782
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

507
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,576
What test subjects?

508
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:24,324
Come with me.

509
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:45,358
What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

510
01:20:45,677 --> 01:20:47,179
We started on rats and mice,

511
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,015
but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.

512
01:20:50,016 --> 01:20:53,228
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

513
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:57,501
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

514
01:20:57,819 --> 01:21:01,907
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

515
01:21:01,908 --> 01:21:05,244
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

516
01:21:05,246 --> 01:21:09,041
This is potentially Olympian!

517
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:12,628
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

518
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:14,756
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

519
01:21:14,757 --> 01:21:18,400
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

520
01:21:32,073 --> 01:21:34,199
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

521
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:36,203
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

522
01:21:36,203 --> 01:21:37,662
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

523
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:40,000
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

524
01:21:40,001 --> 01:21:41,627
We could get the Nobel for this!

525
01:21:41,627 --> 01:21:43,921
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

526
01:21:43,922 --> 01:21:47,065
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

527
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:48,802
At your discretion, shooter.

528
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:50,346
three of us!
This is Promethean fire!

529
01:21:50,347 --> 01:21:51,472
It's just...

530
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:53,240
No shot.

531
01:21:56,064 --> 01:21:58,377
Blonsky's going in.

532
01:22:00,069 --> 01:22:03,462
Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!

533
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:06,702
We have the antidote now.

534
01:22:06,703 --> 01:22:10,060
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

535
01:22:16,425 --> 01:22:18,635
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

536
01:22:18,636 --> 01:22:20,762
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

537
01:22:20,764 --> 01:22:22,849
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

538
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:25,162
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

539
01:22:32,445 --> 01:22:34,462
Bruce! Bruce!

540
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:37,426
Get out.

541
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:43,439
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

542
01:22:47,132 --> 01:22:49,314
Show him to me.

543
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:52,105
Blonsky!

544
01:23:00,067 --> 01:23:01,667
Miss!

545
01:23:02,653 --> 01:23:04,551
Take this.

546
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:12,761
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

547
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:19,692
Betty.

548
01:23:21,136 --> 01:23:24,222
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

549
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:25,641
He's a fugitive.

550
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:27,685
You made him a fugitive

551
01:23:27,686 --> 01:23:31,708
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

552
01:23:31,984 --> 01:23:35,341
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

553
01:23:37,074 --> 01:23:41,096
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

554
01:23:45,502 --> 01:23:46,795
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

555
01:23:46,796 --> 01:23:51,635
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

556
01:23:51,636 --> 01:23:55,055
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

557
01:23:55,056 --> 01:23:59,020
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

558
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:01,452
So Banner's the only...

559
01:24:04,737 --> 01:24:09,672
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

560
01:24:11,578 --> 01:24:16,752
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

561
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,979
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

562
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:23,403
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

563
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:30,958
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

564
01:24:31,773 --> 01:24:35,913
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

565
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:37,832
I have.

566
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,345
And it's beautiful.

567
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,118
Godlike.

568
01:24:42,121 --> 01:24:44,350
Well, I want that.

569
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:48,599
I need that. Make me that.

570
01:24:48,962 --> 01:24:52,050
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

571
01:24:52,051 --> 01:24:54,149
The mix could be

572
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:56,326
an abomination.

573
01:24:59,476 --> 01:25:02,835
I didn't say I was unwilling.

574
01:25:02,856 --> 01:25:07,127
I just need informed consent.

575
01:25:09,114 --> 01:25:11,429
And you've given it.

576
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:56,386
This is what I was trying to explain.

577
01:25:56,386 --> 01:26:01,393
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

578
01:26:01,394 --> 01:26:03,561
But clearly it worked.

579
01:26:03,563 --> 01:26:07,275
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

580
01:26:07,277 --> 01:26:12,198
but if you'll just get back on the table,

581
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:15,212
I can fix this.

582
01:26:29,597 --> 01:26:31,828
Shoot it!
Hey!

583
01:26:32,101 --> 01:26:33,703
No!

584
01:26:42,783 --> 01:26:44,909
Delta 4 to Leader.

585
01:26:44,911 --> 01:26:46,744
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

586
01:26:46,746 --> 01:26:49,974
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

587
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:55,148
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

588
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,701
It's over there!

589
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,230
Drop them!

590
01:27:07,231 --> 01:27:09,996
What is that thing?
Shoot it!

591
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:22,836
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

592
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,253
Delta 4 to Leader!
Go, go, go, go, go!

593
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:26,686
Something big
just went off down here!

594
01:27:26,716 --> 01:27:28,926
General, you should hear this!

595
01:27:28,927 --> 01:27:32,368
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

596
01:27:34,435 --> 01:27:36,604
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

597
01:27:36,604 --> 01:27:38,774
You get it together. What is your position?

598
01:27:38,774 --> 01:27:41,985
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

599
01:27:41,987 --> 01:27:44,051
Turn us around.

600
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:53,793
We're going back. Why are we going back?

601
01:27:53,795 --> 01:27:55,837
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

602
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:57,641
Yes, sir!

603
01:27:59,135 --> 01:28:01,386
What the hell was that?

604
01:28:01,389 --> 01:28:03,534
Go, go, go!

605
01:28:26,588 --> 01:28:28,355
No!

606
01:28:44,113 --> 01:28:45,697
One of yours?

607
01:28:45,698 --> 01:28:49,305
Oh, my God. What have you done?

608
01:28:51,122 --> 01:28:53,470
Fire at him, fire at him!

609
01:28:57,296 --> 01:28:59,798
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

610
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,567
Come on!

611
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:06,240
Sweet.

612
01:29:08,645 --> 01:29:10,365
Booyah!

613
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,729
Get out of there, soldier!

614
01:29:32,552 --> 01:29:34,698
Stacy!

615
01:30:04,845 --> 01:30:07,278
Give me a real fight!

616
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:16,543
Sir?

617
01:30:18,698 --> 01:30:20,335
Sir?

618
01:30:21,368 --> 01:30:24,891
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

619
01:30:27,752 --> 01:30:31,547
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

620
01:30:31,548 --> 01:30:33,257
What are you saying?

621
01:30:33,259 --> 01:30:34,635
You think you can control it?

622
01:30:34,636 --> 01:30:37,847
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

623
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:39,829
And what if you can't?

624
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:43,104
We made this thing.

625
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,956
All of us.

626
01:30:45,442 --> 01:30:47,162
Please.

627
01:30:51,617 --> 01:30:54,631
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

628
01:30:55,706 --> 01:30:57,556
Open the back door.

629
01:31:02,798 --> 01:31:07,762
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

630
01:31:07,764 --> 01:31:11,988
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

631
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:16,774
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

632
01:31:16,775 --> 01:31:19,042
Betty, I've got to try.

633
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:22,548
I'm sorry.

634
01:31:44,689 --> 01:31:46,871
Oh, shooot!

635
01:31:50,363 --> 01:31:53,720
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

636
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,202
There. Betty!

637
01:32:31,752 --> 01:32:33,815
Hulk!

638
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:40,323
Yeah!

639
01:33:24,072 --> 01:33:25,838
Come on!

640
01:33:57,576 --> 01:34:00,055
Is that all you've got?

641
01:34:13,264 --> 01:34:16,140
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

642
01:34:16,141 --> 01:34:17,476
Which one?

643
01:34:17,478 --> 01:34:19,895
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

644
01:34:19,898 --> 01:34:22,247
Cut the other one in half!

645
01:34:24,404 --> 01:34:26,087
Ross!

646
01:34:50,354 --> 01:34:52,621
Keep it on him!

647
01:35:20,311 --> 01:35:23,836
Look, I got to put it down!
Hang on!

648
01:36:30,573 --> 01:36:32,210
Dad?

649
01:36:34,328 --> 01:36:37,341
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

650
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:46,988
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

651
01:37:34,326 --> 01:37:41,516
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

652
01:38:31,735 --> 01:38:33,917
Look out!

653
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:06,005
General?

654
01:39:11,747 --> 01:39:14,844
Any last words?

655
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:21,069
Hulk smash!

656
01:40:08,115 --> 01:40:10,216
Stop!

657
01:41:30,476 --> 01:41:32,327
It's okay.

658
01:41:41,949 --> 01:41:44,131
Betty.

659
01:44:11,693 --> 01:44:13,543
Reload.

660
01:44:20,579 --> 01:44:22,300
Reload.

661
01:44:37,811 --> 01:44:41,064
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

662
01:44:41,065 --> 01:44:42,900
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

663
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:47,407
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

664
01:44:47,408 --> 01:44:50,494
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

665
01:44:50,496 --> 01:44:53,306
- Stark.
- General.

666
01:44:55,127 --> 01:44:58,140
You always wear such nice suits.

667
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:00,439
Touché.

668
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:04,639
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

669
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,655
You should listen.

670
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:12,399
What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

671
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:14,500
Who's "we"?
