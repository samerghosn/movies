2
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,782
Dr. cruler:
<i> Intruder alert!</i>
<i> Intruder alert!

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,283
<i> Attention all hydra</i>
<i> defense units!

4
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,919
<i> Proceed to the</i>
<i> South platform.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,254
<i> Lethal force</i>
<i> is authorized.

6
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,024
<i> I repeat.</i>
<i> Lethal force is authorized.

7
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:27,693
(Grunts)

8
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,260
(Laser firing)

9
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,963
Red skull:
<i> Captain America.

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,268
<i> Super soldier.

11
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,771
(Grunts)

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:46,378
<i> One of the greatest leaders,</i>
<i> combatants and tacticians

13
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,447
<i> who ever lived.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,719
The only thing I hate
more than hydra soldiers
are hydra robots.

15
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:56,354
(Groans)

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,957
(Grunts)

17
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,326
<i> He was once a normal man.

18
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,903
Did we get him?
Where is he?

19
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,039
(Groans)

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,539
Fire!

21
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:18,343
<i> A weakling,</i>
<i> who took the experimental</i>
<i> super soldier serum.

22
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,646
<i> That man</i>
<i> became unstoppable.

23
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,417
<i> Coupled with his</i>
<i> unbreakable shield.

24
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,319
(All groan)

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,823
<i> Trained in dozens</i>
<i> of fighting styles.

26
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,893
<i> He is the pinnacle</i>
<i> of human potential.

27
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:39,730
<i> One of the toughest</i>
<i> warriors of the modern age.

28
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,334
<i> An allied hero</i>
<i> in world war ii,

29
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,604
<i> he'd battled the forces</i>
<i> of hydra with some success,

30
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,173
<i> until he fought</i>
<i> his superior.

31
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,578
<i> With the fate of the globe</i>
<i> hanging in the balance,

32
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,347
<i> their battle ended</i>
<i> in a draw.

33
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,950
Captain America: Hey!
(Grunts)

34
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,588
<i> When their plane</i>
<i> went down in the ice,</i>
<i> they were frozen.

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,625
<i> Revived only recently.

36
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,326
Well?

37
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,596
His skills
are extraordinary.

38
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,265
Difficult to copy,
but not impossible.

39
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,568
So says the taskmaster.

40
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,903
Don't worry,
red skull.

41
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:23,609
My photographic
reflexes can mimic
anyone, even him.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,877
Mimicking him and
defeating him

43
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,447
are two very different things.

44
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,883
I believe a test
is in order.

45
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,617
(Weapons firing)

46
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,700
That was a test?

47
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,336
Well done, taskmaster.

48
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,206
But captain America
is more than skill.

49
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,677
It is his focus, will,
and mind that make
him who he is.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,782
Sounds like somebody's
got a little man-crush
there, red...

51
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,282
(Chocking)

52
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:09,555
The captain and I are
two sides of the same coin.

53
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,623
Do not underestimate him,

54
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,693
or me.

55
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,597
You've seen my skill.

56
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,264
You know what I can do.

57
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:24,703
Emulating captain America
isn't enough
for my final goal.

58
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,573
I need the
super soldier himself.

59
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,574
Taskmaster:
Leave it to me.

60
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,641
Red skull:
That's not all.

61
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:35,180
Another avenger
possesses something
I require.

62
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,382
Iron man.

63
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,685
Stark?
Tony stark?

64
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,853
What do you want
with that rich fame ball?

65
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,289
I don't want the man.

66
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,658
I want his weapons.

67
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,429
I've been preparing
for iron man as well.

68
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,963
I know all
his weaknesses.

69
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:56,300
I am not convinced
you can take on
two avengers alone.

70
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,403
So I've prepared
reinforcements.

71
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,175
All: (Chanting)
Hail hydra!
Hail the red skull!

72
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,409
Hail hydra!
Hail the red skull!

73
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:11,415
Soon you will see
what sets me apart
from captain America,

74
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:14,385
when I rule this world!

75
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,951
Iron man:
You sure about this, cap?

76
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,689
I mean, I've got
the world's most
highly advanced

77
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,223
repulsor-powered armor
and you've got...

78
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,528
No offense, a glorified
trash can lid.

79
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,362
Look, I don't wanna
hurt you.

80
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,230
Did you say trash can lid?

81
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,766
(Grunts)

82
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:37,069
Ah!

83
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,204
Wait a second,
I didn't say go!

84
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,840
In combat, you can't
always be the one
who says go!

85
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,110
That's your problem,
stark, you never strategize.

86
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,345
You just wing it.
(Firing)

87
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,846
It's called thinking
on your feet.

88
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,348
Or in my case,
boot jets.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,519
I adapt to the
unexpected by being
unpredictable.

90
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,923
You, on the other hand,

91
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,093
are super predictable.

92
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:06,764
You used that same move
on the wrecking crew
last week.

93
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,766
(Grunts)

94
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,870
Whoa!

95
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,273
Ouch!

96
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,309
Worked both times,
didn't it?

97
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,112
Yeah, but do you
got anything new?
(Laser firing)

98
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,283
I'm pretty sure you
haven't seen this one.

99
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,386
Pretty sure I have.

100
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,653
(Grunts)

101
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,654
Well, then stop it!

102
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,024
Okay, you got me.

103
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,196
But if I had really
cut loose, you'd be
toast by now.

104
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,096
Well, then don't
hold back.

105
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:43,067
Your suit's a great weapon,
stark, but trust me,
it can be a crutch.

106
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,271
A crutch? This time,
I won't hold back.

107
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,406
And to make it
interesting, how about
a little bet?

108
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,877
When I win, you have
to wear my armor
for a month.

109
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,980
And don't worry,
I got one in your colors.

110
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,581
Well, I don't need
a stuffy sardine can,
but okay.

111
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,187
However, when I win,
you go to boot camp
training with me.

112
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,754
And I hope you like
push-ups, Tony.

113
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,855
I see a lot of 'em
in your future.

114
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:10,896
I usually hire someone
to do push-ups for me, but
you know what, you're on!

115
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,463
All right, Jarvis.

116
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,497
Let's turn old red, white
and blue

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,834
into plain old black and blue.

118
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,701
Jarvis: <i> If you say so.

119
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,939
Captain America:
You wanna say go
this time, stark?

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,141
Iron man: Very funny.
On your mark,
get-set-go!

121
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,343
(Laser firing)
(Grunts)

122
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,382
Nice one. Block this!

123
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,784
You're making it easy!

124
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,786
(Shield clanks)

125
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,954
So are you!

126
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,488
Oh, really?

127
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,627
Give up?

128
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,163
Jarvis: <i> Captain America</i>
<i> has damaged several</i>
<i> quantum dot nanocircuits.

129
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,567
<i> Power is down by 15%.

130
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,768
No sweat.

131
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,369
Watch this.

132
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,004
(Shield clanking)

133
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,841
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

134
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,509
All armor,
no skill.

135
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:02,880
Don't need your skill
when my weapons
can do this!

136
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,449
(Explosion)

137
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,990
Captain America:
You need to use your
most important weapon,

138
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,324
your brain, more often.

139
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,492
Hey bucko, you're
talking to the guy

140
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:20,665
who can divide quintic
polynomials in his head
while trimming his nose hairs!

141
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,000
(Grunts)

142
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:22,834
Ah!

143
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,838
So keep your left up
and guard those
pretty nose hairs.

144
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,538
You've made your point.

145
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,975
So, now I'm gonna
make mine and win this!

146
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,543
(Grunts)

147
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,960
(Clanks)

148
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,331
Captain America: Fine.
We'll call it a draw.

149
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,765
Iron man: For now.

150
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,903
Just another little
tweak and...

151
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,206
Jarvis: <i> Repulsors are</i>
<i> at 100%, sir.

152
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,807
How's the repair going
on your fancy suit?

153
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,277
It's just
minor adjustments.

154
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,346
I'm ready any time!
My armor can go all day.

155
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,849
The best shouldn't have to.

156
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,918
That was the
whole point, huh?

157
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,988
You didn't want to spar.
You wanted to train me.

158
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,856
You're my friend, Tony.

159
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,225
And I want
to keep you alive.

160
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,159
Having repulsor-powered
armor is one thing.

161
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:26,431
Being an undisciplined
wild man in battle will
get you killed.

162
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,933
Believe me,
I've seen it before.

163
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,701
I get it.
And thanks, Steve.

164
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,005
But my ability to fly
by the seat of my
pants is who I am.

165
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,207
There'd be no iron man
without it.

166
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,875
(Explosion)

167
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,610
Whoa! What?
Jarvis: <i> Sir.

168
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,647
(Alarm ringing)
We're under attack!

169
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,648
Jarvis, a little help here?

170
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,452
Jarvis: <i> Intruders, sir.</i>
<i> They have infiltrated</i>
<i> our defense grid.

171
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:49,687
Who are they?

172
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,191
<i> Jarvis system</i>
<i> shutting down.

173
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,393
(Explosion)
Huh?

174
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,730
Captain America:
What are they after?

175
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,067
They're headed
for my weapons vault!

176
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,634
Let's move!

177
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,169
Right behind, ya!

178
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,371
Iron man: Try to keep up.

179
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,410
How'd you get
ahead of me?
Quiet.

180
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,914
Hydra trooper:
Prep these weapons
for transport immediately!

181
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,282
Hydra.

182
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,384
Okay, here's what
we'll do. Wait!

183
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:21,885
Hey!

184
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:27,325
Do you have any idea
how much I hate it when
people touch my stuff?

185
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,628
(Weapons firing)
Blast him!

186
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,865
The nerve of these guys!

187
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,500
(All groan)

188
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,636
How's that for an entrance?

189
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,870
(Weapons firing)

190
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,437
I had an idea.

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,674
We could have
taken them all out
in 10 seconds flat!

192
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,911
Did you not see them
ransacking my toy chest?

193
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,812
(Captain America grunts)

194
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,085
Behind you!

195
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,754
Got it!

196
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,722
These guys are
no problem, cap!

197
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,927
Captain America:
Unless they get
a hold of a giant gun!

198
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:03,794
Die, heroes!

199
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,797
Iron man:
I'll handle it.

200
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,067
Eventually.

201
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,437
(Weapons firing)

202
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,283
(All groan)

203
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,586
(Grunts)

204
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,423
(Grunts)

205
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:36,860
Hurry, Dr. cruler.
Haste makes waste.

206
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,230
I'm hacking as fast
as I can, Dr. fump.

207
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,100
Almost. Got it.

208
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:43,768
There!

209
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,937
We've breached
the magnetic seal,
we're in.

210
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,239
Help me with
the transport case!

211
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,341
Oh, no.
Not in there!

212
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,677
Cap!

213
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,149
Thanks.

214
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,187
They're in the vault.
We gotta stop 'em!

215
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,754
(Weapons firing)

216
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,727
Dr. fump: There it is.

217
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,361
The stark repulsor Cannon.

218
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,832
Powered by
its very own arc reactor.

219
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,138
Still a prototype,

220
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,341
but incredibly valuable.

221
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,446
(Beeping)

222
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,615
<i> Report.</i>
<i> What is your status?

223
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,451
We've got
the repulsor Cannon.

224
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,119
Where are you, sir?

225
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,755
You were supposed
to be helping against
iron man and captain America.

226
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,389
Give me that!

227
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,359
Our hydra troopers
are facing two avengers!

228
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,092
We need your help!

229
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,230
<i> I gave you the tools</i>
<i> to aid in your escape.

230
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,097
<i> Now, return to base!

231
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,466
I don't think I like him.

232
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,201
(Both grunt)

233
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:56,374
Wait. Was this part
of the plan?

234
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,209
(Both scream)

235
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:06,683
(Chuckles)

236
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:12,256
Those hydra fools
don't even realize
they're simply a diversion

237
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,591
for a bigger prize.

238
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,197
(Grunts)

239
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,734
(Weapons firing)

240
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,140
So how about
that bet?

241
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,912
By my count I took down
one more than you did.

242
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:34,611
(Clanks)

243
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,047
And by my count
we're even.

244
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,048
And we've got a lot
of cleaning up to do.

245
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,253
Iron man: We'll get 'em
to the brig after we've
accounted for all my weapons,

246
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,956
including the ones
in the vault.

247
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,959
Oh, no.

248
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,293
No!

249
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,129
I should've known.

250
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:53,398
What is it?

251
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,835
The stark repulsor Cannon,
my latest invention,

252
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,402
it's gone!

253
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,471
That Cannon is
just as powerful as
my hand-repulsors.

254
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,005
Which means?

255
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,777
Hydra's in possession of
one of my deadliest weapons.

256
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,144
I'm going after it.

257
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,647
Let's not be hasty, Tony.
We need a plan.

258
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,816
Iron man:
I don't have time
for a plan!

259
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:16,221
And I don't have
flying boots to
chase after you with.

260
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,456
Uh...

261
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,158
Wake up.

262
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,025
I want answers.

263
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,696
Where are you taking
that repulsor Cannon?

264
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,465
Where?
Forget it, hero.

265
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll never talk.

266
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,402
Hail hydra.
Hail the red...

267
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,171
(Screaming)

268
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,240
(All screaming)

269
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,677
What?

270
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,446
What's going on?

271
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,081
Where am I?

272
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,481
Who am I?

273
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,482
Oh, good grief.

274
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,784
What is this place?
I'm freaking out, man!

275
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,621
Iron man, come in.
Iron man!

276
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,825
Let's get out of here.
Com's jammed. Great.

277
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,229
Let's hope there's
a way off this tub.

278
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,139
I don't think stark
will mind if I borrow one
of his expensive jets.

279
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,344
That one doesn't
belong to stark.

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,855
You've got some
of hawkeye's skill,
but you're not him.

281
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,756
Hawkeye doesn't miss.

282
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,226
If I wanted to hit you,
I would have.

283
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,230
I've studied all of
the avengers' skills.

284
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,899
Especially yours, captain.

285
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,500
Taskmaster.

286
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,970
I've read your file.
I know all about
your talents.

287
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,673
Let's see you
imitate this!

288
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,311
Okay, you're a little
better than I expected.

289
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,312
(Both grunting)

290
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:49,746
Give it up, captain.

291
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,150
I possess the techniques
of the greatest
fighters in the world.

292
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,552
(Groans)

293
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,788
Like iron fist!

294
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,561
My improv catch you
off guard, taskmaster?

295
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,062
Oh, great.
Now I sound like stark!

296
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,831
Hold still, avenger!

297
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,466
(Grunts)

298
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,171
So predictable.

299
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,172
Oh, yeah?

300
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,740
(Grunts)

301
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,980
Okay, nice.

302
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,350
Kenpo, tae Kwon do
and jujitsu.

303
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,085
My turn!

304
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,658
How'd you like my judo?

305
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,192
I don't!

306
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:42,834
It's him!
It's iron man!
Do something!

307
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,036
Ugh.
Take the controls!

308
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,572
Eat this!

309
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,980
Iron man: Now this is
the part where I escort
you to the ground.

310
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,548
(Weapon firing)

311
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,785
You hydra goon!

312
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,620
That's my weapon!

313
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,759
And I'm coming
to take it back!

314
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,526
Note to self.

315
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,630
Next time I create
a weapon that can
penetrate my force field,

316
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,098
upgrade my force field!

317
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:19,403
Ah! Even through
my armor, this hurts.

318
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,040
(Grunts)

319
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,786
Hydra has big
plans for you, hero,

320
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,155
but to me, you're just
a paycheck.

321
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,291
Well, it's not gonna
be easy money.

322
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,926
(Groans)

323
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,229
Taskmaster: Not bad.

324
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,903
Wait a sec,
the weight's off!

325
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,506
What did you...
(Screaming)

326
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:03,713
I'm faster than
you think, captain.

327
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,316
Not only do I know
your fighting style,

328
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,752
I know exactly when
you're going
to throw your shield.

329
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,923
And that you
always catch it.

330
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,595
Iron man: Come on.
Don't poop out on me now.

331
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,031
Whoa!

332
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,101
(Iron man groans)

333
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,768
(Clanking)

334
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,003
At least today
can't get any worse.

335
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:29,039
Iron man:
Cap, you there?

336
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,041
Hydra got away with...

337
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,109
Cap?

338
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,144
He's offline.

339
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,811
Jarvis, are you
back on or what?

340
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,646
Jarvis:
<i> Back online, sir!

341
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,950
Get me a trace
on cap, asap.

342
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,684
Jarvis: <i> No GPS location, sir.

343
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,920
<i> All of captain Roger's</i>
<i> com devices are offline,

344
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,057
<i> and his bio-signs</i>
<i> are not present</i>
<i> on the ship.

345
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,358
Iron man:
Well, then where is he?
You check the hangar?

346
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,759
<i> None of your aircraft</i>
<i> are missing.

347
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,330
So if cap didn't leave,
that means he was taken.

348
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,534
The question is, where?

349
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,342
Easy, troops.

350
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,044
Don't want to harm
our prize.

351
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:07,711
He's worth a lot to me.

352
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,815
Take him to the
neurotransducer room
for processing.

353
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,519
Keep a guard on
him at all times.
Both: Yes, sir!

354
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,854
Make that five guards.

355
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:23,693
Oh, today is turning out
to be an excellent day indeed.

356
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:26,297
Now for my own prize.

357
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,933
Iron man's stealth suit.

358
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,635
Ah!

359
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:37,008
I've studied all of
hydra's manuals on
the iron man armor.

360
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,109
With this suit and my skills,

361
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,779
I won't have to work for jerks
like the skull anymore.

362
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,550
Yeah, once I get rid
of old red and crusty,

363
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,318
I'll take over hydra

364
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,288
and rule this weak world.

365
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,955
(Screaming)

366
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,092
Booby trapped.

367
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,295
I should've known.

368
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:58,563
Ah.

369
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,096
(Alarm sounding)

370
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,200
Automated voice:
<i> Perimeter breach,</i>
<i> incoming vessel.

371
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,202
Ah, speak of the devil.

372
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:27,391
Taskmaster.

373
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,527
Where is he?

374
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,096
Taskmaster:
That's right, red skull.

375
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,932
I did what you've
dreamed of all of these years.

376
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,636
I give you
captain America.

377
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,270
(Groans)

378
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,173
Red skull:
Impressive, taskmaster.

379
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,709
You've executed
your mission

380
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:49,346
and brought me
all I need to create
a new army.

381
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,915
(Panting)

382
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:53,750
New army?

383
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,552
What, you two skull heads

384
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,787
can't take over
the world alone?

385
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:02,460
Our soldiers will be superior
to any this world has known.

386
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,962
And you are vital
to their creation.

387
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,431
I've finally synthesized

388
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:13,436
and even improved
upon the super soldier
serum that created you.

389
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,208
Your blood is the last
ingredient I needed.

390
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,076
I could've got his blood.
Plenty of it.

391
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,612
Bringing him
here was a mistake.

392
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,180
You just got lucky,
taskmaster.

393
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,215
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

394
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:28,318
My mimicry power
is unmatched.

395
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,153
True.

396
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,654
That is why
we have utilized

397
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:36,326
your unique ability in the
functioning of our new device.

398
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:36,693
What?

399
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,930
You made a machine
that can copy people's
skills like I do?

400
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,932
Red skull:
The neurotransducer
will replicate

401
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,103
not only
the captain's skills,

402
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,073
but his tactics
and combat strategies,

403
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:52,977
and then be programed
into my new army.

404
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,545
(Grunts)

405
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,048
Save your strength.
(Clanks)

406
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,884
The restraints
are solid adamantium.

407
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,186
Even the hulk
could not break them.

408
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,690
I'd take that bet any day.

409
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,294
Captain, in the name
of hydra,

410
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,663
I thank you for
your contribution.

411
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,801
(Screaming)

412
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,016
(Thunder rumbling)

413
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,250
Iron man:
Gotta be here somewhere.

414
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,354
Come on, come on.

415
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,222
Where's that
security footage?

416
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,027
Yes!

417
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,961
Taskmaster?

418
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,663
What was that
creep doing here?

419
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,897
Jarvis:
<i> Damage report, sir.

420
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,836
<i> Minimal damage to the hull,</i>
<i> loss of power 22%.

421
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,635
<i> Inventory report.

422
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,941
<i> The prototype</i>
<i> repulsor Cannon</i>
<i> is missing, and...

423
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,075
<i> Oh, dear.

424
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,242
Oh, dear, what?

425
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:04,714
<i> Your iron man mark vi</i>
<i> stealth armor seems</i>
<i> to be missing as well.

426
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,983
Seems to be?
What else can go wrong?

427
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,786
<i> I'll try to find</i>
<i> something, sir.

428
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,554
I'm not in the mood, Jarvis.

429
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,957
<i> My apologies, sir.

430
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,460
Hmm.
Cap sure went
down easy.

431
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,695
Let's take
a closer look.

432
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:22,866
You've gotta
be kidding me.

433
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,902
He was faking it
the whole time?

434
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,804
Of all the
reckless plans!

435
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,640
<i> Perhaps captain Rogers</i>
<i> has adopted your quote,

436
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,009
<i> "fly by the seat</i>
<i> of your pants," methods, sir?

437
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,680
Well, cap obviously
is giving me the heads-up
to come after him,

438
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,681
and that's what
I'm gonna do.

439
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,651
<i> The captain's homing</i>
<i> beacon was destroyed.

440
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,384
<i> How will you find him?

441
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,054
Actually I was gonna
ask for your help
on that one, Jarvis.

442
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,723
Did taskmaster leave
anything behind?

443
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,959
<i> Scanning now, sir.

444
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,662
<i> I've located something.

445
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,998
<i> This a small amount</i>
<i> of mud left in the hangar

446
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,101
<i> that is not from you</i>
<i> or captain Rogers.

447
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,636
Run a full spectrum analysis.

448
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:00,770
<i> Test complete.

449
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,942
<i> The composition is made up</i>
<i> of minerals and rare Clay</i>
<i> found in the baltic highlands.

450
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,979
Well, that narrows
it down a little.

451
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,580
Cross-reference
with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list

452
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,849
of taskmaster's
suspected hideouts.

453
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,018
<i> Right away, sir.

454
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,586
(Scanning)

455
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,655
<i> I have one suspected location.

456
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,791
<i> An abandoned military bunker</i>
<i> in Southern Estonia.

457
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,295
That's it.
Hold the fort, Jarvis.

458
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,829
<i> Very good, sir.

459
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,800
(Groaning)

460
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,913
Impressive.

461
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,884
A lesser man would
have been obliterated.

462
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,919
(Beeping)
Great leader, we did it!

463
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:52,756
We have successfully
recorded captain America's
fighting skills.

464
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,759
They are incredibly
clean and organized.

465
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,828
This man is truly
a remarkable specimen.

466
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,032
The captain's skills
are ready for your use.

467
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:07,238
Excellent.

468
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,606
Your service will
be greatly rewarded.

469
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,409
You could've just paid
to copy my skills.

470
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,913
I'm a better fighter
than that patriot any day.

471
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,047
Doubtful.

472
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,316
You are a mercenary,

473
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:23,354
sorely lacking what
captain America possesses.

474
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,525
Courage, resolve and
dedication to an ideal.

475
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:31,394
Qualities perfect
for my new army.

476
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,230
So what happens
to him now?

477
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:37,166
Now I employ the second
function of this device.

478
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,069
Not only can it
copy brainwaves,

479
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:44,407
it can write them,
like data onto a hard drive.

480
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,709
(Machine sounding)

481
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,413
Initiating hydra
indoctrination sequence.

482
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,249
Your world is about
to change, soldier.

483
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,087
Soon you will know
nothing but absolute
obedience to hydra.

484
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,458
And you will answer
only to me!

485
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,160
I wish you had lips, skully,

486
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,762
so you could kiss my
star-spangled...

487
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,463
(Screaming)

488
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:14,672
No!

489
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,040
No! No!

490
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,178
Hydra troopers:
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!

491
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,381
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!

492
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,116
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!

493
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,153
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!

494
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,324
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!

495
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:36,826
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!

496
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,695
(Chanting continues)

497
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,883
(Red skull laughing)

498
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,326
(Groans)

499
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,765
(Straining)
Get out of my head!

500
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,900
(Groaning)

501
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:21,505
Resistance is useless.

502
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:26,175
Great leader, your volunteers
have been prepared
for the serum.

503
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:30,213
And here I wanted to watch
captain America's will

504
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,983
bend like a weed
beneath my boot.

505
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:34,852
No matter.

506
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:40,089
Taskmaster, stay here
and make sure the captain's
conversion is complete.

507
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:44,127
Do not turn your
back on him for a second.

508
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,963
Whatever you wish.

509
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,965
And his shield.

510
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,467
(Grunts)

511
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,869
Very well, great leader.

512
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:57,173
I would curb that sharp tongue
of yours, taskmaster.

513
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,742
Lest it cuts your throat.

514
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,748
Hmm.

515
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:07,284
(Captain America groans)

516
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,957
Jarvis: <i> Atmospheric</i>
<i> re-entry complete.

517
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,126
<i> I recommend</i>

<i> Sir? You can slow down</i>

519
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,767
Shouldn't have flown off

520
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,104
<i> Captain Rogers clearly</i>
<i> allowed himself</i>
<i> to be captured.

521
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,273
He was reckless.
That's not how
cap does things.

522
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,942
He got himself
in trouble. I know it.

523
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,913
<i> Sir, we are approaching</i>
<i> the target coordinates</i>
<i> at an unsafe speed.

524
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,884
Knock, knock.

525
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,987
Automated voice:
<i> Intruder alert!

Tall, broad-shouldered,

528
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,361
dressed like a flag.

529
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,329
(Weapons firing)

530
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,698
Destroy him!

531
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,701
You know, you try
and be a nice guy...

532
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,104
(All groan)

533
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:06,276
I'll tell you what,
you fellas take your
10-minute coffee break.

534
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,345
I'll go find
my friend.

535
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:09,980
I don't get taskmaster.

536
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:14,151
I mean, he's an accomplished
bad guy, he could build
a lair anywhere.

537
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,920
Why some dingy
cold war bunker?

538
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,422
Jarvis:
<i> Location is everything.

539
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,791
<i> I scan life forms</i>
<i> five meters ahead.

540
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,530
Iron man:
I don't think that's cap.

541
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:28,632
Ready?
Ready.

542
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,901
Open fire!
(Weapons firing)

543
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,704
Well, you gotta admire
their persistence.

544
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,142
Activate the
sonic disruptors.

545
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,810
Jarvis:
<i> Charging now, sir.

546
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:45,249
(All groan)

547
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,988
Sheesh, can we just get
to the boss fight already?

548
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,429
Figures cap'd end up
in the gym.

549
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:05,234
I don't think I wanna work out
on this thing though.

550
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,304
We gotta find him, Jarvis.

551
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:13,009
Iron man:
Cap! You in here?

552
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:15,179
Nice pool.

553
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,547
Or should I say hot tub.

554
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:22,051
Jarvis: <i> This is an extremely</i>
<i> concentrated form</i>
<i> of hydrochloric acid.

555
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:22,618
<i> Lethal.

556
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,821
I wasn't planning
on taking a dip.

557
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,023
Captain America: Stark!
Huh?

558
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:35,365
Whoa, hey cap!
Same team here!

559
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:40,737
Death to all who
oppose hydra!

560
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,105
Oh, great.

561
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,112
Aw, no, cap.
What've they done
to you?

562
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,747
They showed me the truth.

563
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:55,384
The strength that will be
our new world order!

564
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:57,587
Whoa!

565
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,426
Jarvis: <i> Biometric scans</i>
<i> indicate the captain's</i>
<i> brain waves

566
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:08,432
<i> have been radically altered</i>
<i> to those of a completely</i>
<i> different person.

567
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,467
Different person? Who?

568
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,336
<i> Greetings, stark.

569
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,304
Oh, him.

570
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:14,938
Terrific.

571
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,808
<i> Allow me introduce you</i>
<i> to my latest agent.

572
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,980
Sure, he's wearing less
festive colors, but I think
we've met.

573
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:24,548
<i> No.

574
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,986
<i> This captain America</i>
<i> shares my vision</i>
<i> of the future!

575
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:33,589
Yeah, speaking of vision,
this is strictly pay per view,

576
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,358
so get lost!

577
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:36,460
(Grunts)

578
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,962
For hydra!
For the red skull!

579
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:44,667
Cap, I thought we decided
you were gonna be like me.

580
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,234
This ain't me.

581
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,471
Everything always has
to be about you, stark.

582
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,208
You're selfish and conceited.

583
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,345
Okay. That's it!

584
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,249
I don't know what
the skull did to you, buddy,

585
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,183
but you gotta
snap out of it!

586
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,920
(Chuckles)

587
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,354
Ah!

588
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:07,490
Now stop shooting!
Don't make me hurt you.

589
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,026
(Weapon firing)

590
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,928
Don't make me laugh.

591
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:19,435
Okay.
This is your last chance!

592
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,805
I warned you!

593
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,906
Now it gets real!

594
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,878
(Grunts)

595
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,614
Wait. What is that?

596
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:32,348
Ah!

597
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,720
Laugh that off, stark.

598
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,387
Jarvis: <i> Sir, the armor's</i>
<i> been compromised.

599
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,090
<i> We've lost power</i>
<i> to the thrusters.

600
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,792
Really, Jarvis?

601
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:43,359
I hadn't noticed.

602
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:47,830
Remind me to remove
stating the obvious
from your programing.

603
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,201
Now how do we get
this stupid thing off?

604
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:52,970
Ah!

605
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:56,573
Can't reach it...

606
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,912
Automated voice:
<i> Stark armor</i>
<i> security codes, accessed.

607
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:02,813
Bingo.

608
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:07,384
Now you will learn
why hydra shall
reign supreme!

609
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,987
Gotcha!

610
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,055
Ah!

611
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:17,994
(Groans)

612
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,534
Nice one, stark,
but you're too late.

613
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,268
How's he doing, Jarvis?

614
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,836
Jarvis:
<i> His brainwaves</i>
<i> are normalizing.

615
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,874
<i> My scans indicate</i>
<i> captain Rogers is stuck</i>
<i> in a rem-like dream state.

616
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,742
Time to wake up, buddy.

617
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,378
(Groans)

618
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:39,449
Sorry about that, cap.
You okay?

619
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:39,816
Uh...

620
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,586
I just had the worst
nightmare a soldier
could have.

621
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:44,354
Where am I?

622
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,022
Well, you're back
where you belong.

623
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,791
Hydra hijacked
your brain.

624
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,460
Hydra?

625
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:53,063
You really had me
worried there.

626
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,097
Here, lemme give
ya a hand.

627
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,967
(Grunts)
Ah!

628
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:02,172
Automated voice:
<i> Stark encryption decoded.</i>
Verify.

629
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,539
<i> Verification complete.

630
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,009
I have you now, iron man.

631
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,512
I thought I fixed you!

632
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:10,146
(Grunts)

633
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,983
You did. Don't you know
a spontaneous plan
when you see one?

634
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,619
I guess this means
I have to lose?

635
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,487
Just make it look good.

636
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:22,192
You are no match
for hydra, fool!

637
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:25,228
Says you, traitor!

638
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:26,929
Ah!

639
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,699
Jarvis:
<i> Sir, system reboot</i>
<i> has begun!

640
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,168
Great news.

641
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:40,710
(Screams) Oh, it hurts!

642
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:46,682
Skull's programing
must be strong for you
to finish your own friend.

643
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:50,753
By the red skull's command,
take me to our great leader.

644
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,356
Yeah, well, he's not
gonna be the boss forever.

645
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,427
What do you think about
the skull bowing down to us?

646
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,865
Old red and gruesome
would keep you a slave,
I'll make you a partner.

647
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:09,338
Join me and we'll
turn hydra into a twin-headed
dragon and rule it all!

648
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,340
To a new hydra?

649
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,376
To a new hydra!

650
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:17,012
So when do we
take out the skull?

651
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,748
We leave
for Antarctica soon.

652
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,318
Antarctica, eh?

653
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
That's all I needed to hear.

654
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,721
(Grunts)

655
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:25,489
Ha!

656
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,990
Hmph, so you broke
skull's programing.

657
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,793
He brainwashed
the wrong guy.

658
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,728
You're the one
who wants to be him.

659
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,063
Red skull is nothing to me.

660
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,099
Let's see him do this!

661
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,639
You gonna hold
your breath forever?

662
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:51,280
I didn't want to interrupt
your terrific acting.

663
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,650
How about you make it easy
on yourself and give up?

664
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,286
I've studied you both!

665
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,052
I know how you fight!

666
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,090
Yeah, but I'm guessing
you don't know how
we fight together.

667
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:02,291
You know,
I don't think he does.

668
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,193
This is gonna be fun.

669
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,164
(Grunts)

670
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,335
Really?

671
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,172
You let yourself get
captured and turned
into a psycho?

672
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,474
It seemed like
a good idea at the time.

673
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,342
Isn't that what you
always say?

674
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,746
Oh, I get it. You used
my spontaneous style...
(Groans)

675
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,780
...to sneak in and get
brainwashed so you

676
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,884
could find out
where the red skull is.

677
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:29,351
Stay!

678
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,719
So, I win the bet!

679
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:35,257
No, it was all part of
"the plan," so I won the bet.

680
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,358
Let's just say we're even.

681
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,862
By the way,
what's hydra up to?

682
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,730
You don't wanna know.

683
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,766
You sure we shouldn't bring
him along, just in case?

684
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,804
He's too dangerous.
We'll have S.H.I.E.L.D.
come and get him.

685
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,876
Just in case.

686
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,445
Don't go anywhere
now, copycat.

687
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,559
Iron man:
So, you're not gonna change?

688
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,563
This outfit tricked
taskmaster, it might work
on the skull, too.

689
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,266
Stop stealing
my crazy idea schtick!

690
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,199
Jarvis:
<i> Sir, I've got something.

00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:29,713
Scanning for the suit of armor
that taskmaster stole from me.

694
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,313
Wow, he really played you.

695
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,215
Were you planning
on telling me?
What?

696
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,418
I mean, I meant
to let him steal it.

697
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,753
Yeah, so we could
trace him.

698
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,054
Right.

699
00:37:39,155 --> 00:37:42,858
All right, fine! Let's just
go bust some skulls.

700
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,972

703
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,349
I think a name change
is in order.

704
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:10,387
I kinda like
the iron master.

705
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,222
(Chuckles) Catchy.

706
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,400
So, not a word
about my flying?

707
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,068
Your flying is the least
of my worries.

708
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,605
Oh, what?
You don't like my plan?

709
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,807
It's just a little too "me".

710
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,775
Come on,
it's well thought out.

711
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,077
And it's the last thing
red skull would expect.

712
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,547
I figured the wild man
in you would love it.

713
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:41,483
This is the quietest
you've ever been.

714
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,885
What're you up
to back there?

715
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:43,552
I'm not saying,

716
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,989
just in case skull still has
some control over your brain.

717
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,958
You really think
I'd turn on you?

718
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,427
Probably not,
but I like surprises,

719
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,463
so I'm working on
a back-up plan just in case
yours doesn't work.

720
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,365
Wow, strategy
from iron man?

721
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,735
What I can say,
you're rubbing off on me.

722
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,704
Maybe I'll earn
a merit badge.

723
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,449
Got an incoming transmission,
better get outta sight.

724
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:13,882
Right.

725
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:18,153
Automated voice:
<i> Approaching vessel,</i>
<i> identify.

726
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,590
This is taskmaster's ship,
vessel 6769.

727
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:25,061
Captain hydra
requesting permission to land.

728
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,831
<i> 6769, maintain your course.

729
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:32,168
Red skull: <i> Captain,</i>
<i> what have you to say?

730
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:33,635
Hail hydra!

731
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,572
<i> Ah. Good.

732
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,407
<i> Where is the taskmaster?

733
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,744
He tried to convince me
to betray you, sir.

734
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,378
He failed.

735
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,181
<i> His turning</i>
<i> on me was inevitable,

736
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,416
<i> but I did not</i>
<i> expect it so soon.

737
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,420
I took the liberty
of destroying the traitor.

738
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,655
<i> You'll make</i>
<i> a worthy replacement.

739
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:56,960
<i> Perhaps even my</i>
<i> second in command.

740
00:39:58,027 --> 00:39:58,862
Iron man: Nice.

741
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,231
Hydra has a great
benefit package, man.

742
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,365
Medical, dental,
free mind control.

743
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,302
And you're already
wearing one of their
snazzy matching outfits.

744
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,639
Hey, how about
you work on that
backup plan?

745
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:17,112
Hydra tech: (Over pa)
<i> Hydra troopers,</i>
<i> mobilize to 031.

746
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,315
<i> All flight crews report</i>
<i> to mission briefing.

747
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,918
(Loud whirring)

748
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:27,257
I don't like this.
They're prepping for
a large scale attack.

749
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:31,795
Well, then it's
a good thing we showed
up for the party.

750
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:35,632
I can pretend to be a bad guy.
What are you gonna do?

751
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,333
I've got something
up my sleeve.

752
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,670
I pretty much invented
stealth tech so...

753
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,373
That's surprising,
considering how much
you like to be seen.

754
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,175
Captain America
cracking jokes.

755
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:50,679
I like it! Now you just have
to work on being funny.

756
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:55,851
Sir. We're to
escort you to
the great leader.

757
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,686
Carry on.

758
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,268
Hey, we've
got an intruder!

759
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,436
Actually, you've got two.

760
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,239
(Grunting)

761
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,309
(Chuckling) I knew
you couldn't stay
out of sight long.

762
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:23,445
No, no, it's just you
being a hydra goon
is creeping me out.

763
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:27,784
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a long shower when we're
done with this mission.

764
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,393
Of course, there's a giant
hydra rocket down here.

765
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,396
Why can't these guys
just rob jewelry stores?

766
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:44,099
That doesn't
look any better.

767
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,235
What is it anyway?

768
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:51,673
Captain America:
It's red skull's new army,
compliments of my blood.

769
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,710
(Loud whirring)

770
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,614
(Grunting)

771
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,715
(Loud shriek)

772
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,818
'Cause the world needs more
captain America mutations,

773
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,088
freaks and weirdos?
Seriously, hydra.

774
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,333
Iron man: Did you notice
how I didn't just run
out there this time?

775
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,704
Captain America:
Yes, and I was
surprised.

776
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,940
Iron man: You were supposed
to say, "impressed".

777
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,507
So, what are they
doing down here?

778
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,411
I don't know,
but that
looks familiar.

779
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:30,980
Isn't that
one of yours?

780
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:35,818
Iron man: They're
mass producing my
repulsor Cannon!

781
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,119
I'm gonna sue 'em.

782
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,456
Right after I beat 'em
into next Sunday.

783
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,494
That's not the only
thing they've ripped off.

784
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,164
(Loud thud)

785
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,402
(Hissing)

786
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:03,445
Iron man: Is that
a copy of your shield?

787
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,213
It's huge.

788
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,827
All right, so what's
our big strategy?

789
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,829
We destroy everything.

790
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,664
Now you're talking.

791
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:24,132
(Grunts)

792
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,373
(Grunting)

793
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,242
This design is ingenious.

794
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,878
These weapons will make
hydra unstoppable.

795
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,983
You know, the wattage
settings on these arc
capacitors are all wrong.

796
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,418
(Gasps)

797
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,786
Sound the alarm! (Grunts)

798
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:48,123
No, don't.

799
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,826
(Alarm buzzing)
Argh!

800
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,927
Stark! What the heck
are you doing?

801
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,630
What? I'm blowing stuff up!

802
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,867
(Grunts)

803
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,768
Sorry, slowpoke.

804
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,318
(Grunting)

805
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,672
(Loud explosion)

806
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:43,813
Come on, guys. You're
making this too easy!

807
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:48,617
(Beeping)

808
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,853
Know what happens
when you pirate my tech?

809
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:53,623
This.

810
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,858
(Loud explosions)

811
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,994
(Indistinct shouting)

812
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:05,501
You know, I'm kind
of liking this whole
strategy thing.

813
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:06,601
Time for phase two.

814
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,338
Let's take a peek
at what's behind that.

815
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,643
Incoming!

816
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,719
(Grunting)

817
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,489
(Weapons firing)

818
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:39,869
I'm disappointed your
programing failed, captain.

819
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:43,239
You made an excellent
hydra agent.

820
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:48,143
Sorry, there's
no future in it.

821
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,349
(Groaning)

822
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,351
Iron man: Or in you, skull.

823
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,052
(Sighs)

824
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,858
You will beg me
to spare you,

825
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,494
when I control
the world.

826
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:07,630
Taskmaster:
Is that so, red skull?

827
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:18,141
Well, look who put some
iron in their diet.

828
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:21,010
Got to admit, the new
paint job is cool.

829
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,177
Excellent, taskmaster.

830
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,313
Now that you've
acquired stark's
ultimate weapon,

831
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,617
you will put
it to my use.

832
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:30,585
I'm done taking
orders from you, skull.

833
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:34,791
The iron master is
taking control of hydra!

834
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,360
Fool, you work for me!

835
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,295
I love it when the
bad guys bicker.

836
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,797
Captain America:
Makes our job easier.

837
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,867
Consider this
a hostile takeover.

838
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,505
What? (Straining)

839
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,240
Can't be. Ugh...

840
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,844
I'm unable
attack you. Why?

841
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,914
Because you are
my slave.

842
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:00,849
Now bow!

843
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,119
(Groaning)

844
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:10,492
You thought taking
iron man's stealth armor
was your idea?

845
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:11,661
No.

846
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:15,097
I programed
you to steal it.

847
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,532
The memory
was erased,

848
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:20,769
but you also spent time
in my neurotransducer

849
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,672
and were conditioned
to think as I do.

850
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,677
Your recent ambition
to take over hydra?

851
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,878
It came from me!

852
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,849
You are no more
than a hired gun

853
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,918
and you will obey
my every command.

854
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:37,987
(Groans)

855
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:42,625
Hey, skull, you're kind
of a control freak,
you know that?

856
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:44,693
For your
first directive,

857
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,599
destroy iron man
and captain America!

858
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,869
(Grunting)

859
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,242
No more
playing army, skull.

860
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:02,844
You have yet
to see my army.

861
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:07,416
Or should I say
"our" army?

862
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,585
(Loud footsteps approaching)

863
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,661
So, do we do this
your way or my way?

864
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,931
Not sure it's
gonna matter.

865
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,101
Crush them!

866
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,173
Only chance is
to keep moving!

867
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,876
Clear a path,
I'll cover you!

868
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:38,014
(Loud explosion)
Oh!

869
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:40,483
(Groaning)

870
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:53,362
Come on.

871
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:56,632
I'm okay.
Let's run for it!

872
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:00,902
What are you gawking
at, idiots? Finish them!

873
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:04,706
(Loud explosion)

874
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,744
How many of these
things are there?

875
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,146
Got to get past 'em.
Come on!

876
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,561
Let's see you block this.

877
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,230
(Growling)

878
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:37,505
Oh, no.

879
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,110
This way!

880
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:46,014
You know, I really could
use some boot jets.

881
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,050
(Panting)

882
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,456
Bad enough these
things are strong!

883
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,557
But they
can fight, too!

884
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,226
Worse than that,

885
00:49:58,394 --> 00:49:59,961
they fight smart.

886
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,931
(Grunting)

887
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,567
(Gasps)

888
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:08,903
You don't recognize
their style?

889
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,507
Besides being armed
with your Cannon,

890
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:16,612
my ubermen have
been enhanced with
my super soldier serum

891
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:20,916
and programed
with the captain's
superior combat skills.

892
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:25,788
All of his years of training
are going to pay off

893
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:27,222
for hydra!

894
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,291
Come on, Tony,
I think it's
time to go.

895
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,960
Whoa!

896
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:39,300
Huh?

897
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,702
Okay. My turn, cap.

898
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,639
I'll clear us a path
out of here!

899
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,175
(Loud explosion)

900
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:54,215
(Grunts)

901
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,952
(Grunting)

902
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,556
(Groaning)

903
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:04,059
In a way, it will be
captain America's army

904
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,327
that will sweep
across the globe,

905
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:12,134
led by my
unquestioningly loyal
field commander,

906
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,335
the iron master!

907
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:17,840
How are you
coming with that plan?

908
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,409
Plan? Oh, it's
incoming now.

909
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,278
And it's more
like a bomb.
Bomb?

910
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,146
(Low rumbling)

911
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,882
(All gasps)

912
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,487
(Screaming)

913
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,423
A gamma bomb.

914
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,025
Somebody call
for back-up?

915
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,927
Late for the
party, big guy.

916
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:43,231
No, you're
just in time.
Hulk. Smash.

917
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,800
(Roaring)

918
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:52,775
(Weapons firing)

919
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:55,643
(Growling)

920
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,481
Captain America:
Got to admit, nice plan.

921
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,686
I hadn't counted
on the monster.

922
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:06,288
Delay them as
long as you can.

923
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,358
I will initiate
the final phase.

924
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,559
By your command.

925
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,663
I'm going after red skull.

926
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:18,199
I got a score
to settle, too!

927
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,411
What am I supposed to do?

928
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:30,512
You're doing it!

929
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,648
Hoping you'd say that!

930
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:34,516
Now where's...

931
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,318
Found him!

932
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,324
(Glass cracking)

933
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,293
(Hulk roaring)

934
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,197
First you rip off
cap, now me?

935
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,666
There's not an original
bone in your body.

936
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,704
There's no such thing as
an original idea, stark.

937
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,909
Iron man: So let's go
with the classics.

938
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,548
Jarvis! Initiate
the remote!

939
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,349
Shut down his armor!

940
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:11,920
Jarvis: <i> Taskmaster has</i>
<i> installed a hydra encryption</i>
<i> device to prevent such action.

941
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,088
<i> It will take</i>
<i> minutes to override.

942
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,523
(Loud buzzing)

943
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,358
We don't have minutes.

944
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:25,900
Computer:
<i> Rocket fueling is complete.

945
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,971
Initiate the
launch sequence.

946
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,472
<i> Pre-launch protocol</i>
<i> has begun.

947
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,208
(Rapid beeping)

948
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:41,382
Captain America:
Hydra cap reporting for duty.

949
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:44,152
You can't win, skull!

950
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,889
Oh, I've learned how
to beat you, captain.

951
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,259
Don't play
by the rules.

952
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:55,931
And yet you keep losing!

953
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,967
Red skull: Not this time!

954
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:04,672
And through my
defeats, I've learned
something else from you,

955
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,710
always have
a final plan.

956
00:54:08,043 --> 00:54:14,083
The rocket is filled
with the super soldier serum
I used on my troops,

957
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:17,418
complete with
your blood sample.

958
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:20,255
Millions will soon
be transformed

959
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,692
into ultra-powered
soldiers under my control.

960
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,561
The planet will
be reshaped

961
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,431
into the image of hydra.

962
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,568
(Grunting)

963
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,206
Get off of me!

964
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,409
Give me that!

965
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,777
(Snarling)

966
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,052
How do you like it?

967
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,554
(Groaning)

968
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,157
Okay! I'm offended.

969
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,228
You wanna fight?
I'm right here.

970
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,695
Come out, taskmaster.

971
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,697
Show me
what you got.

972
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,431
Taskmaster: Over here.

973
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,634
(Loud explosion)
(Iron man grunts)

974
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,436
I know all
your tricks, stark.

975
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,806
You're looking at
the new iron man!

976
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,742
Jarvis, get me
into that suit!

977
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,010
Jarvis: <i> Your decryption</i>
<i> hacks are working,

978
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,313
<i> but very slowly, sir.

979
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,880
Keep trying.
In the meantime,

980
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,382
maybe I can hack taskmaster!

981
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,652
(Energy pulsating)
(Groaning)

982
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,123
That...
That won't stop me!

983
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:28,891
Wasn't meant to.

984
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,760
I freed you from
the skull's programing.

985
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,563
You don't have to
serve him anymore.

986
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:35,831
Really?

987
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,132
Appreciate it, stark!

988
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,302
Hey, you owe me!

989
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,007
I'll show you
what I owe you!

990
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:46,809
Jarvis! It's now or never!

991
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:51,612
Jarvis: <i> Sir, I was able</i>
<i> to access and deactivate</i>
<i> his armor's energy shields.

992
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,650
That's all I need!
Charge up the hull.

993
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,751
Let's give him a shock!

994
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,153
(Screaming)

995
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:04,626
I can't move!

996
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:05,960
What have you done?

997
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,795
Ha! Taught you a lesson.

998
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,965
Your fist is no
match for my brain.

999
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:14,335
(Groans)

1000
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,237
So much for
the iron copycat.

1001
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,375
Jarvis, pinpoint
cap for me.

1002
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,914
Hydra is making hulk mad!

1003
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,684
Hydra won't like hulk mad!

1004
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:37,860
Hulk smash!

1005
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,096
Why, you...

1006
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,965
Come here, ugly!

1007
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,804
(Roaring)

1008
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,047
(Beeping)

1009
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,103
Your plan
ends now, skull.

1010
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,041
Does it, captain?

1011
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,985
I have decided
it is better you are
not with hydra, captain.

1012
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:40,088
Your compassion
is a weakness.

1013
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:43,724
Tell it to my shield!

1014
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:48,697
Ha! The great
captain America
has missed.

1015
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,797
It was bound
to happen.

1016
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,402
Without your
precious shield,
you're finished.

1017
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,304
I guess you're right.

1018
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,806
Computer:
<i> Launch sequence</i>
<i> will commence in...

1019
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:03,411
<i> 30, 29, 28,</i>
<i> 27, 26, 25...

1020
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:04,413
Red skull:
You've lost your mind!

1021
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:11,119
My rocket will spread
hydra's destiny all over
your beloved homeland.

1022
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,222
Captain America: If your
rocket makes it that far.

1023
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,592
Computer:
<i> 14, 13, 12...

1024
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,059
Guess I didn't
miss after all.

1025
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,128
Once in a while, you
got to do what you said,

1026
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,431
"not play by the rules."

1027
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:26,534
Computer:
<i> Five, four, three, two...

1028
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,938
<i> One, ignition.</i>
(Loud explosion)

1029
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:36,711
Captain!

1030
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:14,516
Captain America:
Stark! Where are you?

1031
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,818
We have to get
out of here, now!

1032
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,186
Stark, do you read? Over!

1033
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:28,963
Hulk? This is cap.
Can you hear me?

1034
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,518
(Grunting)

1035
00:59:52,387 --> 00:59:55,056
Stark! Where are you?

1036
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,894
Hello!
Ah, you're
early this time.

1037
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,164
All according
to my plan.

1038
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,731
After you.

1039
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,719
Hulk, get out, now!

1040
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,025
Working on it.

1041
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,449
Hulk tired
of hydra.

1042
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:00,688
Hulk smash!

1043
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,666
Oh, come on!

1044
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:19,206
(Beeping)

1045
01:01:25,947 --> 01:01:28,617
Iron man: That was
closer than usual.

1046
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,085
I hope hulk made
it out of there.

1047
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,353
See if you
can reach him.

1048
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,722
Big green,
do you copy?

1049
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,824
Jarvis: <i> Hulk's com</i>
<i> is unresponsive, sir.

1050
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:40,695
<i> Also, the arc reactor</i>
<i> suffered critical</i>
<i> damage in the escape

1051
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,532
<i> and will be</i>
<i> shutting down now.

1052
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:45,400
Are you kidding me?

1053
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:48,070
Uh, stark?

1054
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:49,036
What's happening?

1055
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,574
Iron man: Experiencing some
technical difficulties.

1056
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,309
So, this isn't
part of the ride?

1057
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,545
Apparently, it is today.

1058
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,813
You gonna do
something about this?

1059
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,882
Jarvis! Reroute power
from the emergency reserve.

1060
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,251
Jarvis: <i> As I informed</i>
<i> you earlier, sir,

1061
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:06,722
<i> the reserve was</i>
<i> damaged in your battle</i>
<i> with captain America.

1062
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,925
Iron man:
Don't tell me that!
Options! I need options!

1063
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:12,159
<i> Dreadfully sorry, sir,</i>
<i> there are none.

1064
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,461
Captain America:
So are you fixing this?

1065
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:17,733
Iron man: As luck would
have it, not this time!

1066
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:18,500
Stark!
This is gonna hurt!

1067
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,670
Yeah, well, you're
the one who's always
supposed to be prepared!

1068
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:25,507
Pull a parachute
out of your
shield or something!

1069
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,309
Stark!

1070
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:31,246
(Hulk shouting)

1071
01:02:36,952 --> 01:02:40,822
Oh, so that's
what that feels like.

1072
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:41,255
Yeah.

1073
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,059
That's two
you owe me.

1074
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,327
(Loud explosion)

1075
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,630
Iron man: So much for
hydra's big scheme.

1076
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:55,070
See? Not all plans
work out, cap.

1077
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:57,672
Mine did.
(Sighs)

1078
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,476
(Red skull grunting)

1079
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,152
Perimeter secure, sir.

1080
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,822
You failed, skull.

1081
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,226
Your need to control
captain America doomed us.

1082
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,597
It was your treachery
that doomed us.

1083
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,668
And for that you
will be eliminated.

1084
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,737
Oh!

1085
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,711
Oh, stark, you're
a piece of work.

1086
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:41,715
(Grunts)

1087
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,652
Huh?
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent:
<i> Attention, hydra!

1088
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,420
<i> This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

1089
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:49,291
<i> Drop your weapons,</i>
<i> or you will be fired upon!

1090
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,393
(Taskmaster laughing)

1091
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:05,206
Come on out, cap.

1092
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,010
For better or worse.
I do like the colors.

1093
01:04:12,547 --> 01:04:15,182
And the boot jets,
of course.

1094
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,085
Both: Ready? Avengers attack!

1095
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,588
(Screaming)

1096
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,695
I'm going in.

1097
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:29,364
Roger that, cap.
I'm on your wing.

1098
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,833
Whoa...

1099
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,934
Iron man: I'll get him.

1100
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:37,873
(Grunts)

1101
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,641
Wow. You both missed me.

1102
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:41,710
I don't see how.

1103
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,512
You're so big,
green and ugly.

1104
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,451
Hulk: Wow! You really
can't hit me.

1105
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,353
Come on, stark.

1106
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:53,688
Iron patriot, incoming.

1107
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,463
Now you're
getting it, cap.

1108
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:06,201
That tickles. Stop it.

1109
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,974
Yeah, you two are lame.

1110
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:15,175
What's this
about, anyway?

1111
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,778
I bet cap if he
fought more like me,

1112
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,880
spontaneous
and unpredictable,
he'd do better.

1113
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:24,686
And I bet Tony if he was
little more tactical and
strategic in mind like me,

1114
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,688
he'd do better.

1115
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,063
Oh, no.

1116
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:37,932
Cap, those are
heat seekers!

1117
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,867
And they've locked onto me.

1118
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,103
Captain America:
Sorry, Tony. I was just
winging it, like you do.

1119
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,505
Iron man:
Don't worry, I got this.

1120
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,173
Just need some
room to maneuver.

1121
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,710
Captain America:
You're running out of
room to maneuver.

1122
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,579
Then it's time for
some strategy.

1123
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,284
Hmm...

1124
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,422
Captain America:
They're closing in!

1125
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,389
I see!

1126
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,590
Captain America:
There's one on your six!

1127
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,293
Got it!

1128
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,896
Captain America:
Only one left, I'll get it!

1129
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:09,697
Iron man: Wait, no!
(Grunts)

1130
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,900
(Both screaming)

1131
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:14,168
(Hulk laughing)

1132
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,971
(Both groaning)

1133
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,106
So, you both lost?

1134
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:19,907
We both won!
We both won!

1135
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,210
You're both good
at what you do.

1136
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,911
Why don't you just
stick to that?

1137
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:28,750
You know, he's right.
You're pretty good at
all that plotty planny stuff.

1138
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,253
And you're fairly decent
at shooting from the hip.

1139
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,596
We never talked
about what I'm good at.

1140
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:43,364
Smashing.

1141
01:06:44,632 --> 01:06:46,201
Now, let's go eat.

1142
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:50,739
I could go for some
raw menu macrobiotic
organic tofu.

1143
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,940
I have no idea
what you just said.

1144
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:55,043
I'm a meat
and potatoes
kind of guy.

1145
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:59,114
Hulk saved you
and hulk wants pie.

1146
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:07,288
Yeah, okay.
I could go for pie.

1147
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,056
Pie it is.
