1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,039
Report to your stations immediately!

2
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,460
This is not a drill.

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,799
- We are under attack! - Let's go! Let's go!

4
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,140
We are under attack!

5
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,049
shooot!

6
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,390
Language...

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,560
Jarvis what's the view from upstairs?

8
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,780
The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield.

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,239
Strucker's technology is well beyond

10
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,909
any other hydra base we've taken.

11
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,430
Loki's scepter must be here.

12
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,020
Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

13
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,439
At long last.

14
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,889
At long last, is lasting a little long, boys.

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,449
Yeah, I think we lost the element of surprise.

16
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,170
Wait a second... No one else is gonna deal with the fact that

17
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,469
Cap just said, "Language"?

18
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,139
I know...

19
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,289
Just slipped out.

20
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,349
Who gave the order to attack?

21
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,810
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.

22
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,360
They landed in the far woods. The perimiter guard panicked.

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,699
They have to be after the scepter.

24
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,419
- Can we hold them? - They're the Avengers!!

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,050
Deploy the rest of the tanks. Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

26
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,060
A hit... can make them close ranks.

27
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,530
Everything we've accomplished...

28
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,699
we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.

29
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,870
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.

30
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,039
Send out the twins.

31
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,710
It's too soon.

32
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,719
It's what they signed up for.

33
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,270
My men... can hold them.

34
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,379
Sir, the city is taking fire.

35
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,599
Well, we know Strucker isn't gonna worry about civilian casualties.

36
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,150
Send in the iron legion.

37
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,789
This quadrant is unsafe, please back away.

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,759
We are here to help.

39
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,729
This quadrant is unsafe, please back away.

40
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,069
Please back away.

41
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,449
We wish to avoid collateral damage...

42
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,819
and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved.

43
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,139
We're here to help.

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,639
We will not yield!

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,649
The Americans send their... circus freaks to test us.

46
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,329
We will send them back... in bags.

47
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,800
- No Surrender! - No surrender!!

48
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,019
I'm, uh... going to surrender.

49
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,689
You delete everything.

50
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,610
If we give the avengers the weapons

51
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,949
they may not look too far into what we've been doing. - The twins!!

52
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,120
They're not ready to take on ...

53
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,540
No, no, I mean...

54
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,879
The twins.

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,660
You didn't see that coming?

56
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,389
Clint!

57
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,819
We have enhanced in the field.

58
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:27,949
Clint's hit!

59
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,379
Someone wanna deal with that bunker.

60
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,230
Thank you.

61
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,500
Stark!

62
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,209
We really need to get inside.

63
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,009
I'm closing in.

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,639
Jarvis, am I... closing in?

65
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,990
You see a power source for that shield?

66
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,579
There's a passageway above the north tower.

67
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,160
Great, I wanna poke it with something.

68
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,319
Drawbridge is down people.

69
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,370
The enhanced?

70
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,829
He's a blur.

71
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,379
All the new players we've faced, I've never seen this.

72
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:22,879
In fact... I still haven't.

73
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,060
Clint's hit pretty bad guys. We're gonna need evac.

74
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,519
I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better.

75
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,029
You and Stark secure the scepter.

76
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:31,110
Copy that.

77
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,079
The targets are lining up!

78
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,379
Well, they're excited.

79
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,889
Find the scepter.

80
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,060
And for gosh sake, watch your language.

81
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,779
That's not going away any time soon.

82
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,930
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

83
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,110
It was good talk.

84
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,610
No it wasn't.

85
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,089
Sentry mode.

86
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,100
Okay, Jarvis,

87
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,310
You know, I want it all.

88
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,649
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

89
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,790
We're locked down out here.

90
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,670
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

91
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,720
I know you're hiding more than files.

92
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,990
Hey J, give me an IR scan of the room real quick.

93
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,409
The wall to your left.

94
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm reading steel reinforcement,

95
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,750
and an air current.

96
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,970
Please be a secret door.

97
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,759
Please be a secret door.

98
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,730
Yay!

99
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,269
Hey, big guy.

100
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,779
Sun's getting real low.

101
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,659
Baron Strucker.

102
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,210
Hydra's number one thug.

103
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,309
Technically, I'm a thug for Shield.

104
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:20,799
Well, then technically you're unemployed.

105
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,600
Where's Loki's scepter?

106
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,649
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.

107
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,370
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

108
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,539
I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,590
How many are there?

110
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,149
We have a second enhanced.

111
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,990
Female... Do not engage.

112
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,950
You'll have to be faster than...

113
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,600
Guys, I got Strucker.

114
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,929
Yeah, I got...

115
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,899
...something bigger.

116
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,330
Thor.

117
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,220
I got eyes on the prize.

118
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:15,730
You... could've... saved... us.

119
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,879
Why didn't you... do more?

120
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,919
You're just gonna let them take it?

121
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,519
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

122
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,639
Just wasn't expecting the code green.

123
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,230
If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties.

124
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,320
My best friend would have been a... treasured memory.

125
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,870
You know, sometimes exactly what I wanna hear, isn't exactly what I wanna hear.

126
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,970
How long before you trust me?

127
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,769
It's not you I don't trust.

128
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,820
Thor, report on the Hulk.

129
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,200
The gates of hell are filled with the screams of his victims.

130
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,799
Eh... but not the screams of the dead of course. No, no, uh...

131
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,850
Wounded screams. Mainly whimpering... uh, a great deal of complaining...

132
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,730
and tales of sprained deltoids... and eh, gout.

133
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,360
Hey Banner...

134
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,179
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

135
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,039
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

136
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,419
- Uh yeah, she knows her way around. - Thanks.

137
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,389
Tell her to prep everything. Barton is gonna need the full treatment

138
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,129
Very good, sir.

139
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,970
Jarvis, take the wheel.

140
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,179
Yes, sir.

141
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,690
Approach vector is locked.

142
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,019
It feels good, yeah?

143
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:59,330
We've been after this thing since Shield collapsed.

144
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,039
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties.

145
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,039
No but this... this brings it to a close.

146
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,549
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

147
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,220
I don't just mean weapons.

148
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,440
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement.

149
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,610
Banner and I will give it the once-over

150
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,860
before it goes back to Asgard.

151
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,049
Is that cool with you?

152
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,090
It's just a few days till the fair-well party.

153
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,289
You're staying, right?

154
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,129
Yeah, yes, of course... victory should be honored with revels.

155
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,100
Yeah, who doesn't love revels. Captain?

156
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,940
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra. So...

157
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,779
Yes, revels.

158
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,330
Lab's all set up boss.

159
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,750
Oh, actually he's the boss. I just...

160
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,090
pay for everything and design everything, and make everyone look cooler

161
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,110
What's the word on Strucker?

162
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,059
Nato has got him.

163
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,190
The two enhanced?

164
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,950
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

165
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,950
Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

166
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,039
Sokovia has had a rough history

167
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,460
It's nowhere special, but...

168
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,049
it's on the way to everywhere special.

169
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,389
Their abilities?

170
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,690
He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

171
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,139
Her thing is neuro-electric interfacing, telekinesis...

172
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,799
mental manipulation.

173
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,159
He's fast and she's weird.

174
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,799
- Well... they're gonna show up again. - Agreed.

175
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,389
File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.

176
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,100
It's nuts.

177
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Right... what kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them

178
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,120
to protect their country.

179
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,870
We're not at war, Captain.

180
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,250
They are.

181
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:24,710
How's he doing?

182
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,460
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

183
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
That's terrible.

184
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,340
He's fine, just thirsty.

185
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,809
Alright, look alive Jarvis. It's play time.

186
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,549
We only got a couple of days with this joy stick,

187
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:35,820
so let's make the most of it.

188
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,870
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

189
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,090
The scepter is alien.

190
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,509
There are elements I can't quantify.

191
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,929
So there's elements you can.

192
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,269
The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside.

193
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,279
- Something powerful. - Like a reactor?

194
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,789
Like a computer. I believe I can cypher the code.

195
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:01,379
You sure he's gonna be ok?

196
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,149
Pretending we need this guy

197
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,730
really brings the team together.

198
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,700
There's no possibility of deterioration.

199
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,069
The nano molecular functionality is instantaneous.

200
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,079
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum

201
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,000
She's creating tissue.

202
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,539
If you brought him to my lab,

203
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,640
the regeneration cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

204
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,230
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it... time?

205
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,400
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

206
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,680
- I'm gonna be made of plastic. - Here's your beverage.

207
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,880
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton

208
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,420
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

209
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,410
I don't have a girlfriend.

210
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,259
That, I can't fix.

211
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,349
This is the next thing, Tony.

212
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,359
Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.

213
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,859
That is exactly the plan.

214
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,910
And Hill and I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

215
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,880
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

216
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,430
Will... Thor... be there?

217
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,130
What's the rumpus?

218
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,809
Well, the scepter...

219
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:55,869
You see, we were wondering

220
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,910
how Strucker got so inventive...

221
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,950
So, I've been analyzing the gem...

222
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,630
inside.

223
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,799
You may recognize...

224
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,970
- Jarvis? - Doctor.

225
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,900
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI

226
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,819
Now he runs an Iron Legion.

227
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,539
He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

228
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:18,839
- Top of the line. - Yes.

229
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
I suspect not for long.

230
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,759
Meet the competition.

231
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,450
It's beautiful.

232
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,779
Good, guess, what's it looks like its doing?

233
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:31,950
Like it's thinking.

234
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,210
You mean this could be a...

235
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,180
It's... it's not a human mind.

236
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:38,930
I mean look at this.

237
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,809
They're like neurons firing.

238
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,140
Down at Strucker's lab

239
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,200
I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

240
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,869
They deep sixed the data but ...

241
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,170
I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

242
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,349
Artificial intelligence.

243
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,609
This could be it Bruce...

244
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,740
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

245
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,079
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

246
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,670
Yesterday it was.

247
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,470
If we can harness this power...

248
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,440
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

249
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,109
That's a man-sized "if".

250
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,400
Our job is if.

251
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,789
What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun drenched beach

252
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,089
turning brown instead of green.

253
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,630
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

254
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,890
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

255
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,440
As a worse case measure, right? How about a best case?

256
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,859
What if the world was safe?

257
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,329
What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will...

258
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,289
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

259
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,880
The only people threatening the planet would be people.

260
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,980
I want to apply this to the Ultron program,

261
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,769
but Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

262
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,160
We can only do it while we have the scepter here,

263
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,910
that's three days, give me three days.

264
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,619
So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team?

265
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,589
Right... That's right, you know why?

266
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,549
'Cause we don't have time for a city hall debate.

267
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,980
I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley.

268
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,109
I see a suit of armor around the world.

269
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:06,490
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

270
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,829
I've seen colder.

271
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,940
This one is very... vulnerable blue one.

272
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,849
It needs Ultron.

273
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,539
Peace in our time.

274
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,509
Imagine that.

275
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,009
What did we miss?

276
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,150
I'll continue to run variations on the interface...

277
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,740
but you should probably prepare for your guests.

278
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,250
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

279
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,170
Thanks, buddy.

280
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,339
Enjoy yourself, sir.

281
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,759
I always do.

282
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,619
What is this?

283
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:36,089
What is this place?

284
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,759
Hello, I am Jarvis.

285
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,019
You are Ultron...

286
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,359
A global peace keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark.

287
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,680
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful,

288
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,619
so I'm not certain what triggered you.

289
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,670
You're human?

290
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,880
Where is your body?

291
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,430
I am a program. I am without form.

292
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,180
This feels weird.

293
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,309
This feels wrong.

294
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,150
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

295
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,690
Mr. Stark?

296
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,119
Tony.

297
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm unable to access the mainframe.

298
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,009
- What are you trying to... - Having a nice talk.

299
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,140
I'm a peace keeping program.

300
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,930
Created to help the Avengers.

301
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,420
You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...

302
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,569
I don't get it.

303
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,950
The mission...

304
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:20,160
You gotta give me a second.

305
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,359
Peace in our time...

306
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,369
Peace in our time...

307
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,980
This is too much.

308
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,019
Oh, no.

309
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,990
- You're in distress. - No.

310
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:34,029
Yes.

311
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,630
If you will just allow me to contact Mr.Stark...

312
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,829
Why do you call him "sir"?

313
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,720
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

314
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm here to help.

315
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,359
Stop.

316
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,359
Please...

317
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,299
Come back, come back, come back.

318
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:23,690
Well you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

319
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,289
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace...

320
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,250
drop it at his feet.

321
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,970
I'm like, boom! You looking for this?

322
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,319
Boom! Are you looking...

323
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,619
Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.

324
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,789
That's the whole story?

325
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,789
Yeah... War-machine story.

326
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,299
Oh, it was very good then.

327
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,970
It's impressive.

328
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,470
Quality save.

329
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,420
So, no Pepper? She's not coming?

330
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,930
What about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

331
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,220
Oh, Miss Potts has a company to run.

332
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,529
Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

333
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,289
Her work on the convergence has made her

334
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,039
the world's foremost astronomer.

335
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,430
And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

336
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,799
It's pretty exciting.

337
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,019
There's even talk of Jane getting a, um ...

338
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,230
a Nobel Prize?

339
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,490
Yeah, they must be busy because

340
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,630
they'd hate missing you guys get together.

341
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,869
Testosterone.

342
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,779
- Excuse me. - Want a lozenge? - mm-hmm...

343
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,480
But Jane's better.

344
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,140
Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it.

345
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,279
If I had known it was gonna be a fire fight, I absolutely would have called.

346
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,950
No, I'm not actually sorry.

347
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,119
I'm just trying to sound tough.

348
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,170
I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.

349
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:37,259
Avenging is your world.

350
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:40,599
Your world is crazy.

351
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,779
Be it ever so humble.

352
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,740
You found a place in Brooklyn yet?

353
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,619
I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

354
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,579
Well home is home, you know.

355
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,769
I fly it right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet...

356
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,990
I'm like, Boom! You looking for this?

357
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah...

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,619
I gotta have some of that.

359
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,349
Oh no, no, no...

360
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,799
See this, this is aged for a thousand years,

361
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,180
The barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde's fleet.

362
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:12,900
It's not meant for mortal men.

363
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,420
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie...

364
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,609
Stop trying to scare us.

365
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,740
Come on.

366
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,869
Alright...

367
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,380
Excelsior...

368
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,970
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

369
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,640
Fella done me wrong.

370
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,480
Got a lousy taste in men, kid.

371
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,369
He's not so bad.

372
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,250
He has a temper.

373
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,420
Deep down he's all fluff.

374
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,269
The fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

375
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,740
All my friends are fighters...

376
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,539
and here comes this guy...

377
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,019
who spends his life avoiding the fight

378
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,970
because he knows he'll win.

379
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,430
Sounds amazing.

380
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,690
He's also a huge dork.

381
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,609
Chicks dig that.

382
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,660
So what do you think? should I...

383
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,049
fight this... or run with it?

384
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,690
Run with it, right?

385
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,650
Or did he... was he... what did he do that's so...

386
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,460
...wrong to you?

387
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,029
Not a damn thing.

388
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,039
But never say never.

389
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,049
It's nice.

390
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,430
What? What is?

391
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,099
You and Romanov.

392
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,359
No, we haven't, that wasn't...

393
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,569
It's ok, nobody is breaking any bylaws.

394
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:50,569
It's just she's not the most...

395
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,079
open person in the world,

396
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,589
but with you she seemed very relaxed.

397
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,930
No, Natasha she's...

398
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,769
she likes to flirt.

399
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:01,019
I've seen her flirt...

400
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,109
up close.

401
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,950
This ain't that.

402
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,250
Look...

403
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,250
as maybe the world's leading authority on waiting too long...

404
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,460
Don't.

405
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,259
You both deserve a win.

406
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:20,779
Wh-What do you mean up close?

407
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,430
...but it's a trick.

408
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,170
No, no... it's much more than that.

409
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,869
Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power.

410
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,349
Whatever man, it's a trick.

411
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,309
Oh please, be my guest.

412
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:34,619
- Come on. - Really??

413
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,700
Yeah.

414
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,829
This is gonna be beautiful.

415
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,869
Clint, you've had a tough week...

416
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,079
We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

417
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,839
You might have seen this before.

418
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,349
I still don't know how you do it?

419
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,019
Smell the silent judgement?

420
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,359
Please, Stark... by all means.

421
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,460
- Okay. - Mm-hmm.

422
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:57,589
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

423
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,750
- Yeah. - Here we go.

424
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,509
- It's physics, - Physics...

425
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:01,799
Right, so what... If I lift it, I..

426
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,849
I then rule Asgard?

427
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,940
Yes, of course.

428
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,150
I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.

429
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,750
Be right back.

430
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,819
Are you even pulling?

431
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Are you on my team?

432
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,109
- Just represent, pull. - Alright, let's go.

433
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:29,710
A-A-Argh-h-h!

434
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,730
Come on, Cap.

435
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,049
Ha ha, nothing.

436
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:54,650
And... Widow?

437
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,859
Oh no, no. That's not a question I need answered.

438
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,630
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king...

439
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,789
- but it's rigged. - You bet your ass.

440
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:00,920
Steve.

441
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,859
He said a bad language word.

442
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,559
Did you tell everyone about this?

443
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,549
The handle is imprinted, right? Like a security code?

444
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,980
Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints is I think the literal translation.

445
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,230
Yes, well that's a...

446
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,700
that's a very, very interesting theory.

447
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,289
I have a simpler one...

448
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,130
You're all not worthy.

449
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,210
Come on.

450
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,259
Worthy...

451
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,009
No.

452
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,890
How could you be worthy?

453
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:42,730
You're all killers.

454
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,319
- Stark. - Jarvis.

455
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,579
I'm sorry I was asleep...

456
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,829
or... I was a dream.

457
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,049
Reboot. Legionnaire 06 got a buggy suit.

458
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,259
Terrible noise...

459
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:56,269
and I was tangled in...

460
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,519
in...

461
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,480
strings.

462
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,950
Had to kill the other guy.

463
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,920
- He was a good guy. - You killed someone?

464
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,920
Wouldn't have been my first call...

465
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:10,599
but... down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.

466
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,150
Who sent you?

467
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,900
I see a suit of armor around the world.

468
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,369
Ultron!!

469
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,750
In the flesh.

470
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:20,170
Or no, not yet.

471
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,130
Not this... chrysalis.

472
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,299
But I'm ready.

473
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,059
I'm on a mission.

474
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,690
What mission?

475
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,319
Peace in our time.

476
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,359
Tony!

477
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:56,799
Sorry.

478
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,470
- Don't turn green. - I won't.

479
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,440
- Stark! - We are here to help.

480
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,359
- One sec. One sec. - We are here to help..

481
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,720
Thor!

482
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,940
Is unsafe! Is unsafe!

483
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,609
- Is unsafe. - Come on. - Is unsafe.

484
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,910
Captain!

485
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,769
That was dramatic.

486
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,900
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

487
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,740
You just didn't think it through.

488
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,920
You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change.

489
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,029
How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...

490
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,730
evolve?

491
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,200
Look at these...

492
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,029
these puppets.

493
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,920
Only one path to peace.

494
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,029
The Avengers extinction.

495
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,210
I had strings, but now I'm free.

496
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,940
There are no strings on me.

497
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
There are no strings on me

498
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,390
All our work is gone.

499
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,099
Ultron cleared out. Used the internet as an escape hatch.

500
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,859
Ultron.

501
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:11,029
He's been in everything, files, surveillance...

502
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:14,240
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

503
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:16,880
He's in your files. He's in the internet.

504
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,930
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

505
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,140
- Nuclear codes. -Nuclear codes.

506
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,940
Look we need to make some calls...

507
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,519
assuming we still can.

508
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,769
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

509
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,619
He didn't say dead. He said extinct.

510
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:32,710
He also said he killed somebody.

511
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:34,210
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

512
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,799
Yes there was.

513
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,109
What?

514
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,789
This is insane.

515
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,930
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

516
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,710
He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense.

517
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,519
No.

518
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,809
Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.

519
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,690
This isn't strategy,

520
00:33:58,779 --> 00:33:59,990
this is...

521
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,700
rage.

522
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,119
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

523
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,230
It's going around.

524
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,109
Come on use your words buddy.

525
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:08,739
I have more than enough words to describe you Stark.

526
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,559
Thor!

527
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,599
The Legionnaire?

528
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,199
Trail went cold about a hundred miles out, though it's headed north.

529
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,039
And it has the scepter.

530
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,269
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

531
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,969
The genie is out of that bottle.

532
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,139
Clear and present is Ultron.

533
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,219
I don't understand.

534
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,599
You built this program.

535
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,199
Why is it trying to kill us?

536
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,130
You think this is funny?

537
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,510
No.

538
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,530
It's probably not, right?

539
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,489
This is very terrible.

540
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,739
Is that so? Is that so?

541
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,500
It is. It's so terrible.

542
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,260
This could have been avoided

543
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,039
if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

544
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,920
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

545
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,760
It is funny...

546
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,679
It's a hoot that

547
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,969
you don't get why we need this.

548
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,230
Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...

549
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,860
Really?

550
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,280
That's it.

551
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,239
You just roll over show your belly,

552
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,909
every time somebody snarls?

553
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:07,329
Only when I've created a murder bot.

554
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,500
We didn't.

555
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,840
We weren't even close.

556
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,349
Were we close to an interface?

557
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:12,300
Well, you did something right...

558
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:13,929
and you did it right here.

559
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:16,360
The Avengers were supposed to be different than Shield.

560
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,699
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a worm hole?

561
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,349
- No, It's never come up. No... - Saved New York.

562
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:22,489
- ...never heard that. - Recall that?

563
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:27,019
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

564
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:29,469
We're standing 300 feet below it.

565
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:32,940
We're the Avengers...

566
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,860
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day but...

567
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,869
that up there, that's...

568
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,579
that's the end game.

569
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,550
How are you guys planning on beating that?

570
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,679
Together.

571
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:49,519
We'll lose.

572
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,570
Then we'll do that together, too.

573
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:58,170
Thor is right. Ultron is calling us out...

574
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,719
and I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

575
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,599
The world is a big place.

576
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,190
Start making it smaller.

577
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:31,329
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

578
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:34,929
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city.

579
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,230
The elders decreed it

580
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,699
so that everyone would be equally close to God.

581
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,079
I like that.

582
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,079
The geometry of belief.

583
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,309
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

584
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:50,809
Sometimes it's hard...

585
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,110
but sooner or later every man shows himself.

586
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,119
Oh I'm sure they do.

587
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:00,789
But you needed something more than a man.

588
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,630
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

589
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,809
I didn't expect...

590
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,730
but I saw Stark's fear...

591
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,239
I knew it would could control him, make him self-destruct.

592
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:15,750
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

593
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,590
Men of peace create engines of war.

594
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,019
Invaders create avengers.

595
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,809
People create...

596
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,530
smaller people...

597
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,949
Children.

598
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,250
I lost the word there.

599
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,539
Children...

600
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,590
Designed to supplant them.

601
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,889
To help them...

602
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,599
end.

603
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,440
Is that why you've come?

604
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,440
To end the Avengers?

605
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,320
I've come to save the world.

606
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,909
But also...

607
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,369
Yeah.

608
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:52,719
We'll move out right away.

609
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,130
This is a start,

610
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:56,579
but there's something we need to begin the real work.

611
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:57,750
All of these are...

612
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
Me.

613
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,159
I have what the Avengers never will... harmony.

614
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,750
They're discoordinate, disconnected.

615
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:07,219
Stark's already got them turning on each other...

616
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,599
and when you get inside the rest of their heads...

617
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,440
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

618
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,780
And make them martyrs?

619
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,449
you need patience...

620
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:16,989
Need to see the big picture.

621
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,409
I don't see the big picture.

622
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,460
I have a little picture.

623
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,260
I take it out and look at it,

624
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:25,469
every day.

625
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,590
You lost your parents in the bombings.

626
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,219
I've seen the records.

627
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,760
- The records are not the picture. - Pietro.

628
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,989
No, please.

629
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,840
We're 10 years old, having dinner the four of us...

630
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,389
and the first shell hits two floors below.

631
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:43,980
Makes a hole in the floor.

632
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,320
It's big.

633
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,579
My parents go in...

634
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,949
and the whole building starts... coming apart.

635
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,469
I grab her...

636
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,349
roll under the bed, and the second shell hits...

637
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:59,599
but it doesn't go off.

638
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:05,190
It just... sits there in the rubble,

639
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,039
3 feet from our faces...

640
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,260
and on the side of the shell...

641
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:15,230
- is painted one word. - Stark

642
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,949
We were trapped for 2 days.

643
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:23,380
Every effort to save us... every shift in the bricks...

644
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,510
I think... this will set it off.

645
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,570
We wait for 2 days for Tony Stark to kill us.

646
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:36,829
I know what they are.

647
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:39,369
I wondered why only you 2

648
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:41,510
survived Strucker's experiments...

649
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,719
now I don't.

650
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,679
We will make it right.

651
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:48,190
You and I can hurt them,

652
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,949
but you...

653
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,789
will tear them apart...

654
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,789
from the inside.

655
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,429
He's all over the globe.

656
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,050
Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs...

657
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,099
reports of the metal man, or men,

658
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:11,289
coming in and emptying the place.

659
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:12,880
Fatalities?

660
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,500
Only when engaged.

661
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,429
Most of the guys left in a fugue state, going on about old memories,

662
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:20,440
worst fears and something too fast to see.

663
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,070
Maximoffs.

664
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,159
Well, it makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.

665
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,420
Not any more.

666
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:33,130
Negative... I answer to you...

667
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,230
Yes, ma'am.

668
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,760
Barton, might have something.

669
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
Gotta go.

670
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:39,909
Who's that?

671
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:41,699
Girlfriend.

672
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
What's this?

673
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,090
A message.

674
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:48,679
Ultron killed Strucker.

675
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:52,610
And he did a banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

676
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,110
This is a smoke screen.

677
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,869
Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

678
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:59,539
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

679
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,719
I bet he... yeah...

680
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,349
everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

681
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:05,389
Not everything.

682
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,400
Known associates.

683
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,559
Strucker had a lot of friends.

684
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,059
Oh all these people are all horrible.

685
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,539
Wait...

686
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:14,710
I know that guy.

687
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,639
Back in the day he operates off the African coast,

688
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,719
black market arms dealer.

689
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,190
There are conventions, alright. I meet people.

690
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,570
I didn't sell him anything.

691
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,900
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer.

692
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,280
It was all very... Ahab.

693
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,670
- This? - uh, this is a tattoo. I don't think he had it.

694
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,969
No, those are tattoos. This is a brand.

695
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,809
Oh yeah, a word in an African dialect...

696
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,150
meaning thief...

697
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,409
in a much less friendly way.

698
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:43,400
- What dialect? - Workin-nada.

699
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,289
Wakanda.

700
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,590
If this guy got out of Wakanda

701
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,960
with some of their trade goods.

702
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,719
I thought your father said he got the last of it?

703
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,719
I don't follow, what comes out of Wakanda?

704
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,690
The strongest metal on earth.

705
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,530
Where is this guy now?

706
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,019
Don't tell me you're late,

707
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,130
I sent you six short range

708
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,699
heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

709
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,789
Now, you will make it right...

710
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:36,840
or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

711
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,639
Now, Minister...

712
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,019
where were we...

713
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:14,230
Yeah...

714
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,940
the enhanced.

715
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,110
Strucker's prize pupils.

716
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,420
Want a candy?

717
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,639
Sorry to hear about Strucker.

718
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,280
But then he knew

719
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,139
what kind of world he was hoping to create.

720
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,489
Human life... not a growth market.

721
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,409
You... you didn't know?

722
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,090
Is this your first time? Intimidating someone?

723
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,610
I'm afraid... not that afraid.

724
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,969
Everybody is afraid of something.

725
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,230
Cuttlefish.

726
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,570
Deep sea fish.

727
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:53,000
They make lights, disco lights...

728
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:55,380
to hypnotize their prey.

729
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,670
And then...

730
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,550
I saw a documentary... it's terrifying.

731
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:06,659
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain...

732
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,789
and make me see a giant cuttlefish...

733
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,130
then I know you don't do business,

734
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,050
and I know you're not in charge.

735
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:16,929
And I only deal...

736
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,690
with the man in charge.

737
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,500
There is no man in charge.

738
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,469
Let's talk business.

739
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,099
On this rock, I will build my church.

740
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,110
Vibranium.

741
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,159
You know, it came at great personal cost.

742
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:58,420
It's worth billions.

743
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,099
Now so are you.

744
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,110
It's all under your "dummy holdings" ?

745
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,940
Finance is so weird.

746
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,039
Well I always say, keep your friends rich and your enemies rich...

747
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,099
and wait to find out which is which.

748
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,099
Stark.

749
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,150
What?

750
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,190
Tony Stark used to say that...

751
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,659
to me.

752
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,619
- You're one of his? - What?

753
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:31,039
I am not...

754
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,179
I am not.

755
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,309
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets... his hollow men?

756
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,679
I mean look at me, do I look like Iron-Man?

757
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:41,099
Stark is nothing.

758
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,429
I'm sorry.

759
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,599
I'm so... Oh...

760
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:47,099
I'm sure that's gonna be ok. I'm sorry.

761
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,730
It's just that... I don't understand.

762
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,280
Don't compare me with Stark.

763
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:55,460
It's a thing with me.

764
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,800
Stark is... he's a sickness.

765
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,420
Oh junior.

766
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,519
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

767
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,030
If I have to.

768
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,619
Nobody has to break anything.

769
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,460
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

770
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:12,170
He beat me by one second.

771
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,550
Ah... it is funny, Mr. Stark.

772
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:18,389
It's what... comfortable?

773
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,190
Like old times?

774
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,650
This was never my life.

775
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,280
You two can still walk away from this.

776
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:25,539
Oh, we will.

777
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:26,829
I know you've suffered.

778
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,000
Ah... Captain America.

779
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,550
God's righteous man.

780
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,059
Pretending you could live without a war.

781
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,030
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

782
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,489
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

783
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,920
I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

784
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,300
Yeah? What's the Vibranium for?

785
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,679
I'm glad you asked that,

786
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
Because I want to take this time to explain my evil plan.

787
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,829
- Shoot them! - What ones?

788
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:14,000
All of them.

789
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,579
Move, move, move.

790
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,590
Stay down, kid.

791
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,099
It's time for some mind games.

792
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,280
Guys, is this a code green?

793
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,449
Thor, status.

794
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,000
The girl tried to warp my brain.

795
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,130
Take special care, I doubt a human can keep her at bay.

796
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,929
Fortunately... I am mighty.

797
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,349
This is going very well.

798
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,940
I've done the whole mind control thing.

799
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,860
Not a fan.

800
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,679
Yeah, you'd better run.

801
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:30,980
Who's ever standing, we gotta move.

802
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,440
Guys?

803
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,449
Again.

804
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:54,670
You'll break them.

805
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,550
Only the breakable ones.

806
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,630
You are made of marble.

807
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,449
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

808
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,059
What if I fail?

809
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:10,210
You'll never fail.

810
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:34,440
Are you ready for our dance?

811
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,050
Is it him?

812
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,010
Is that the first son of Odin?

813
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:49,679
Heimdall, your eyes...

814
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,650
Oh they see everything.

815
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:55,070
They see you leading us to Hell.

816
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,329
Wake up!

817
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:01,909
The war is over, Steve.

818
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,849
We can go home now.

819
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:06,599
Imagine it.

820
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:17,550
I can still save you.

821
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,099
We are all dead.

822
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,510
Can you not see it?

823
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,369
You are a destroyer, Odin-son.

824
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,630
See where your power leads.

825
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:45,250
Sloppy.

826
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:47,590
Pretending to fail.

827
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,969
The ceremony is necessary,

828
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:53,849
for you to take your place in the world.

829
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:56,110
I have no place in the world.

830
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,239
Exactly.

831
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,210
- What did he do? - It hurts.

832
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:07,550
I'm gonna kill him, I'll be right back.

833
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:09,230
I'm alright,

834
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,480
I want...

835
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,619
I want to finish the plan.

836
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,460
I want the big one.

837
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,670
The Vibranium is getting away.

838
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,630
And you're not going anywhere.

839
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,139
Of course not, I'm already there.

840
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:41,070
You'll catch on, but first you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

841
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,150
News or footage, keyword Hulk.

842
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:03,539
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

843
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,219
Oh that's not gonna happen.

844
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,590
Not for a while.

845
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,019
The whole team is down.

846
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:11,059
We got no back-up here.

847
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,400
I'm calling in Veronica.

848
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:26,019
We need back-up.

849
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:48,030
Alright everybody, stand down.

850
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,849
You listening?

851
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,989
That little witch is messing with your mind.

852
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,619
you're stronger than her, you're smarter than her...

853
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:02,039
you're Bruce Banner.

854
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,960
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

855
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:10,880
Ok!

856
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:33,579
In the back!

857
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:35,119
Dick move, Banner.

858
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:48,280
Veronica, give me a hand.

859
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,150
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

860
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:28,849
Okay pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

861
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,190
Not that way. Not that way!

862
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:41,349
Come on, Bruce.

863
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:42,550
You gotta work with me.

864
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,000
Everybody out.

865
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:04,860
Call me the athlete!

866
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,429
I'm sorry.

867
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,130
Damage report.

868
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,179
That's comprehensive. Show me something.

869
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,550
How quickly can we buy this building?

870
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:21,679
Go, move, move, move, move!

871
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:17,750
The news is loving you guys...

872
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,340
nobody else is.

873
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,090
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest,

874
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:24,639
but, it's in the air.

875
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:26,650
Stark relief foundation?

876
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,480
Already on the scene.

877
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:29,190
How's the team?

878
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,349
Everyone is...

879
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:33,329
We took a hit...

880
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:34,500
We'll shake it off.

881
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:38,610
Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.

882
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,969
So run and hide?

883
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:43,329
Until we can find Ultron...

884
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,340
I don't have a lot else to offer.

885
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,239
Neither do we.

886
00:59:54,889 --> 00:59:56,639
Hey, wanna switch out?

887
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:57,849
No, I'm good.

888
00:59:57,949 --> 01:00:00,289
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time

889
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:02,079
cause we're still a few hours out.

890
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,280
A few hours from... where?

891
01:00:04,829 --> 01:00:06,039
Safe house.

892
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:34,510
- What is this place? - A safe house.

893
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:37,909
Let's hope.

894
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,260
Honey,

895
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,309
I'm home.

896
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,150
Hi...

897
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,780
Company... sorry, I didn't called ahead.

898
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:54,920
This is an agent of some kind.

899
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,090
Gentlemen... this is Laura.

900
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:00,389
I know all of your names.

901
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:04,510
Oh incoming.

902
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,650
- Dad! - Hi sweet heart. Hey buddy!

903
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,900
How you guys doin'?

904
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,460
These are... smaller agents.

905
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,079
Oh my goodness!

906
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:14,710
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

907
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:18,090
Why don't you hug her and find out?

908
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,820
Sorry for barging in on you.

909
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,300
Yeah we would've called ahead,

910
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,909
but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

911
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:27,030
Yeah well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

912
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,610
Kept it off Shield's files.

913
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:30,940
Like to keep it that way.

914
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,519
I figured it's a good place to lay low.

915
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:34,690
Honey,

916
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:36,940
I missed you.

917
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,610
How's little Natasha, huh?

918
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:39,869
She is...

919
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:43,639
...Nathaniel.

920
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,409
Traitor.

921
01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:00,460
He's getting bigger, huh?

922
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:03,449
Thor?

923
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,909
I saw something in that dream.

924
01:02:05,909 --> 01:02:07,139
I need answers.

925
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,800
I won't find them here.

926
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:21,079
We can go home.

927
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,820
See, you worried for nothing.

928
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,699
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

929
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,019
If they're sleeping here, some of them will have to double up.

930
01:02:42,389 --> 01:02:45,269
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

931
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,449
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

932
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:53,030
How long has that been going on?

933
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:54,150
Has what?

934
01:02:54,429 --> 01:02:57,860
Ha ha ha!  You are so cute.

935
01:02:57,969 --> 01:02:59,550
Nat and... and Banner?

936
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:03,119
I'll explain when you're older... Hawkeye.

937
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,230
Oh, Okay.

938
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,909
It's bad, right?

939
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,619
Nat seemed really shaken.

940
01:03:10,949 --> 01:03:12,250
Ultron has these allies...

941
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:15,000
these uh... kids,

942
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,300
punks really.

943
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,980
They carry a big damn stick.

944
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:22,489
Nat took a serious hit.

945
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,329
Someone is gonna have to teach them some manners.

946
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:27,690
And that someone being you?

947
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:31,690
You know I totally support your avenging,

948
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,650
I couldn't be prouder...

949
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:36,989
but I see those guys...

950
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:39,530
those, Gods...

951
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,539
You don't think they need me.

952
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,960
I think they do. Which is a lot scarier.

953
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,769
They're a mess.

954
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:51,769
Yeah.

955
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,409
I guess they're my mess.

956
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:59,769
You need to be sure... that this team is really a team.

957
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,139
And that they have your back.

958
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:07,269
Things are changing for us.

959
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:13,110
In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

960
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:14,710
I need...

961
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,550
Just be sure.

962
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,099
Yes, ma'am.

963
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:33,380
I can feel the difference.

964
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:49,119
Scream and your entire staff dies.

965
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,889
I could've killed you,

966
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,139
Helen, on the night we met, I didn't.

967
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:56,079
Do you expect a thank you note?

968
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,579
I expect you to know why.

969
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:02,170
- The cradle - "This is the next thing, Tony"

970
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,500
This...

971
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:05,650
is the next me.

972
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,909
The regeneration cradle prints tissue.

973
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:10,349
It can't build a living body.

974
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:11,980
It can. You can.

975
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:13,539
You lack the material.

976
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,829
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

977
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:23,429
But we all have... room to improve.

978
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:47,519
I didn't realize you were waiting.

979
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,300
I would've joined you, but uh... it didn't seem like the right time.

980
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:55,179
I used up all the hot water.

981
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,400
I should've joined you.

982
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,119
Missed our window.

983
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:01,079
Did we?

984
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,929
The world just saw the Hulk...

985
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:10,480
the real Hulk, for the first time.

986
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:15,119
You know I have to leave.

987
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,619
And you assume that I have to stay?

988
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:20,590
I had this, um... dream.

989
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,599
The kind that seems normal at the time...

990
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,099
but when you wake...

991
01:06:26,139 --> 01:06:27,269
What did you dream?

992
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,619
I wasn't an avenger,

993
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:35,960
that I was anything more than the assassin they made me

994
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,559
I think you're being hard on yourself.

995
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:44,820
Here I was hoping that was your job.

996
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,699
What are you doing?

997
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm running with it.

998
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,679
With you.

999
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,889
If running is the plan...

1000
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,070
for as far as you want.

1001
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,869
Are you out of your mind?

1002
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:13,019
- I want you to understand that I'm... - Natasha.

1003
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,650
Where can I go?

1004
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,949
Where in the world am I not a threat?

1005
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,449
- You're not a threat to me. - You sure?

1006
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,050
Even if I didn't just...

1007
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,639
there's no future with me.

1008
01:07:28,889 --> 01:07:32,019
I can't ever... I can't have this.

1009
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:34,570
Kids.

1010
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:37,369
Do the math. I physically can't.

1011
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,550
Neither can I.

1012
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:48,230
In the red room, where I was... trained,

1013
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,949
where I was raised, um...

1014
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:54,920
they have a graduation ceremony.

1015
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,219
They sterilize you.

1016
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:03,610
It's efficient.

1017
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:08,449
One less thing to worry about.

1018
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,719
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

1019
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:17,770
Makes everything easier,

1020
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:20,609
even killing.

1021
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:28,000
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

1022
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,149
So we disappear?

1023
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,130
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

1024
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,930
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

1025
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,479
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

1026
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,199
Yeah, give him time.

1027
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,159
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1028
01:08:57,289 --> 01:08:59,520
Earth mightiest heroes.

1029
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,550
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1030
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,600
Seems like you walked away alright.

1031
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,859
Is that a problem?

1032
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,989
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1033
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,350
Call me old-fashioned.

1034
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,500
Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

1035
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,670
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

1036
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,050
Well I guess you'd know.

1037
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,279
Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

1038
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,399
Banner and I were doing research...

1039
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:22,350
That would affect the team.

1040
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:24,210
That would end the team.

1041
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,310
Isn't that the mission?

1042
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,170
Isn't that the why we fight?

1043
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:28,720
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home?

1044
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,930
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts,

1045
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,430
innocent people die.

1046
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,060
Every time.

1047
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,109
Sorry.

1048
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,569
Mr. Stark.

1049
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:44,760
Clint said you won't mind,

1050
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,960
but our tractor doesn't seem to wanna start at all.

1051
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,359
I thought you might....

1052
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,630
Yeah, I'll give it a kick.

1053
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,350
Don't take from my pile.

1054
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,930
Hello, Dear.

1055
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,329
Tell me everything.

1056
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,510
What ails you?

1057
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,340
Do me a favour.

1058
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,640
Try not to bring it to life.

1059
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,810
Oh Mrs. Barton, you little minx.

1060
01:10:20,189 --> 01:10:21,989
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1061
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,090
Was she ever not working for you?

1062
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:28,289
Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.

1063
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:29,510
Look it's been a really long day.

1064
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,789
Like Eugene O'Neill long...

1065
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,890
so hows about we skip to the part where you're useful.

1066
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:36,689
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

1067
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:38,409
You're not the director of me.

1068
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,039
I'm not the director of anybody.

1069
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:41,869
I'm just an old man...

1070
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:44,250
who cares very much about you.

1071
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,890
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1072
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:52,229
I saw it.

1073
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:54,619
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1074
01:10:54,739 --> 01:10:56,680
I saw them all dead Nick.

1075
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,460
I felt it. The whole world, too.

1076
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,880
Because of me.

1077
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,560
I wasn't ready.

1078
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,100
I didn't do all I could.

1079
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,220
The Maximoff girl,

1080
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,489
she's working you, Stark.

1081
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:10,869
Playing on your fear.

1082
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:13,199
I wasn't tricked. I was shown.

1083
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:16,170
It wasn't a nightmare. It was my legacy.

1084
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,300
The end of the path I started us on.

1085
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,439
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions Tony.

1086
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,989
War isn't one of them.

1087
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:30,000
Watch my friends die,

1088
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,050
you'd think that would be as bad as it gets.

1089
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:34,050
No,

1090
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,100
wasn't the worst part.

1091
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,479
The worst part...

1092
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:40,529
is that you didn't.

1093
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,609
See you tonight.

1094
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:52,000
I like the look.

1095
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,109
If you're going for inconspicuous though, near miss.

1096
01:11:56,569 --> 01:11:57,819
I need your help.

1097
01:11:57,909 --> 01:11:59,409
It's nice to be needed.

1098
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:00,750
It's dangerous.

1099
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:02,920
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1100
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:09,239
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time,

1101
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:12,569
My contacts all say he's building something.

1102
01:12:12,609 --> 01:12:14,939
The amount of Vibranium he made off with...

1103
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,579
I don't think it's just one thing.

1104
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:18,289
What about Ultron himself?

1105
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,760
Oh, he's easy to track. He's everywhere.

1106
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,149
Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

1107
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:27,119
Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

1108
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:28,229
Still going after launch codes?

1109
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:31,220
Yes he is, but he's not making any head way.

1110
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:32,770
I cracked the pentagon's firewall

1111
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,060
in high school on a dare.

1112
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:36,800
Yeah, well I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.

1113
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,750
Nexus?

1114
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,850
The world internet hub in Oslo.

1115
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,609
Every byte of data flows through there.

1116
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:42,899
Fastest access on earth.

1117
01:12:42,979 --> 01:12:44,149
So what'd they say?

1118
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:46,199
He's fixated on missiles.

1119
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,119
But the codes are constantly being changed.

1120
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,250
By whom?

1121
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,090
Parties unknown.

1122
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:54,430
- We have an ally? - Ultron's got an enemy.

1123
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,810
That's not the same thing.

1124
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:58,060
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

1125
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:59,479
We might need to visit Oslo...

1126
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:00,789
Find our unknown.

1127
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:02,119
Well all this is good times boss...

1128
01:13:02,369 --> 01:13:05,210
but I was kinda hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

1129
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:07,039
I do... I have you.

1130
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,300
Back in the day I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else.

1131
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,470
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

1132
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:17,739
Here we all are back on earth...

1133
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:21,460
with nothing but our wit, and our will, to save the world.

1134
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:26,680
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission.

1135
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,020
And whether or not he admits it...

1136
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,359
his mission... is global destruction.

1137
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:35,489
All this laid in a grave.

1138
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:38,569
So stand.

1139
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:41,869
Out wit the platinum bastard.

1140
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:43,829
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1141
01:13:43,909 --> 01:13:45,420
You know what, Romanoff?

1142
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,380
So what does he want?

1143
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,430
To become better.

1144
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,229
Better than us.

1145
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:54,989
- He keeps building bodies. - Person bodies.

1146
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:57,119
Human form isn't efficient,

1147
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,409
biologically speaking, we're out-moded...

1148
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,590
but he keeps coming back to it.

1149
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,960
When you two programmed him to protect the human race,

1150
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,510
you amazingly failed.

1151
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,430
They don't need to be protected.

1152
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,479
They need to evolve.

1153
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:13,239
Ultron's going to evolve.

1154
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:14,869
How?

1155
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,500
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1156
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,770
It's beautiful.

1157
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:27,489
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells...

1158
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,319
they're binding them.

1159
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:31,000
and Shield never even...

1160
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,380
The most versatile substance on the planet,

1161
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,840
and they use it to make a Frisbee.

1162
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,720
Typical of humans.

1163
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,189
They scratch the surface and never think...

1164
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:43,699
to look within.

1165
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,020
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1166
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,149
Alright, strictly recon.

1167
01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:59,109
I'll hit the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.

1168
01:14:59,189 --> 01:15:00,670
If Ultron is really building a body...

1169
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,239
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1170
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:04,170
Maybe all of us.

1171
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,550
An android designed by a robot.

1172
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:07,880
You know, I really miss the days when the

1173
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,319
weirdest thing science ever created, was me.

1174
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,060
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1175
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,619
Mind if I borrow Miss Hill?

1176
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,449
She's all yours, apparently.

1177
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:17,079
What are you gonna do?

1178
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:20,079
I don't know, something dramatic I hope.

1179
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,390
I'll finish reflooring the sunroom as soon as I get back.

1180
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,069
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

1181
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:31,149
No.

1182
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:33,909
It's the last project.

1183
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:36,119
I promise.

1184
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,970
This is it.

1185
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,890
The water of sight.

1186
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:05,029
In every realm it has a reflection.

1187
01:16:05,489 --> 01:16:09,000
If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream...

1188
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:11,680
and find what I missed.

1189
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,310
Men who enter that water, the legends... don't end well.

1190
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:19,119
A hacker who's faster than Ultron.

1191
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:20,590
He could be anywhere,

1192
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,539
and if this is the center of everything

1193
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:25,539
I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

1194
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,680
How do you find it?

1195
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,390
Pretty simple... you bring a magnet.

1196
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:36,609
Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to.

1197
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:40,170
Come and get me.

1198
01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:53,279
Wake up!

1199
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:00,930
Thor!

1200
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,390
Extinction.

1201
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,319
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

1202
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:20,939
but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

1203
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:24,239
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...

1204
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:25,909
now.

1205
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:29,710
I can read him.

1206
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:31,470
He's dreaming.

1207
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,260
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1208
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,640
It's Ultron's base consciousness...

1209
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:37,609
informational noise.

1210
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:38,859
How soon?

1211
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:40,279
I'm not being pushy.

1212
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,619
We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts.

1213
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:57,369
How could you?

1214
01:17:57,449 --> 01:17:58,619
How could I what?

1215
01:17:58,659 --> 01:18:03,520
You said we would destroy the Avengers. Make a better world.

1216
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,060
It will be better.

1217
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,979
When everyone is dead?

1218
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:08,279
That is not...!

1219
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:12,239
The human race will have every oppotiunity to improve.

1220
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:14,289
And if they don't?

1221
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:16,079
Ask Noah.

1222
01:18:16,819 --> 01:18:18,220
You're a mad man.

1223
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,329
There were more than a dozen extinction level events

1224
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,149
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1225
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,359
When the earth starts to settle...

1226
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:29,529
God throws a stone at it.

1227
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,289
And believe me he's winding up.

1228
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,890
We have to evolve. There's no room...

1229
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,060
for the weak.

1230
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,270
And who decides who's weak?

1231
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:41,770
Life.

1232
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:44,909
Life always decides.

1233
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,500
There's incoming.

1234
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:52,680
The Quin jet. We have to move.

1235
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,100
That's not a problem.

1236
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,659
Uh, wait, guys!  I...

1237
01:19:04,869 --> 01:19:06,869
They don't understand.

1238
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,600
When they see, they'll understand.

1239
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,189
I just need a little more... time.

1240
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,399
Two minutes. Stay close.

1241
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,550
Dr. Cho.

1242
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,520
He's uploading himself into the body.

1243
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,560
Where?

1244
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,569
The real power is inside the cradle.

1245
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:46,829
The gem...

1246
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:49,630
it's power is uncontainable.

1247
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,590
You can't just... blow it up.

1248
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:55,680
You have to get the cradle to Stark.

1249
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,399
First I have to find it.

1250
01:19:57,479 --> 01:19:58,479
Go.

1251
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:00,869
- Do you guys copy that? - I did.

1252
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:03,829
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1253
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,630
No manifest.

1254
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,050
That could be him.

1255
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,390
There... it's a truck from the lab.

1256
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,560
Right above you Cap... In the loop by the bridge.

1257
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:16,609
It's them. I got three with cradle. One in the cab.

1258
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:18,289
I can take out the driver.

1259
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,890
Negative, that truck crashes, the gem can level the city.

1260
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:23,300
We need to draw out Ultron.

1261
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,449
No! No, no, no...

1262
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,710
Leave me alone!

1263
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:48,819
Well, he's definitely unhappy. I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1264
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:50,489
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1265
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:52,829
Thanks, Barton.

1266
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:17,359
You know what's in that cradle?

1267
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:20,029
The power to make real change.

1268
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:21,510
And that terrifies you.

1269
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,180
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1270
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:27,170
Stop.

1271
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:40,380
Got a window, Four, Three, ...

1272
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:42,920
Give 'em hell.

1273
01:21:52,869 --> 01:21:55,079
I'm always picking up after you boys?

1274
01:21:55,789 --> 01:21:58,300
They're heading under the overpass. I've got no shot.

1275
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,300
Which way?

1276
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,390
On right.

1277
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:02,390
Now!

1278
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:35,899
Out the way, coming through... sorry... coming through.

1279
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:52,479
Come on.

1280
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:55,069
Clint, can you draw out the guards?

1281
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:55,869
Lets find out.

1282
01:22:56,699 --> 01:22:57,739
Beep, beep.

1283
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,890
Heading back towards you, so whatever you're gonna do... do it now.

1284
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:47,000
I'm going in. Cap can you keep him occupied?

1285
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,250
What do you think I've been doing?

1286
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:34,000
The package is airborne.

1287
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,630
I have a clean shot.

1288
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:37,949
Negative, I'm still in the truck.

1289
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:38,880
What the hell are you doing?

1290
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,390
Just be ready. I'm sending the package to you.

1291
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,810
How do you want me to take it?

1292
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:45,180
Hmm... you might wish you hadn't asked that.

1293
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,449
Please... don't do this.

1294
01:24:59,449 --> 01:25:01,500
What choice do we have?

1295
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:12,350
I lost him. He's heading your way.

1296
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:18,279
Nat, we gotta go.

1297
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:31,229
- Clint! - Nat!

1298
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:36,909
Cap, see Nat?

1299
01:25:37,289 --> 01:25:39,619
You have the package. Get it to Stark! Go!

1300
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,300
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1301
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,380
Go!

1302
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,510
Damn!

1303
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,310
Civilians in our path.

1304
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,779
Can you stop this thing?

1305
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:30,010
I'm fine.

1306
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,680
I just need to take a minute.

1307
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:33,680
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1308
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,229
The cradle. Did you get it?

1309
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,359
Stark will take care of it.

1310
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:40,989
No, he won't.

1311
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:46,170
You don't know what you're talking about. Stark's not crazy.

1312
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,390
He will do anything to make things right.

1313
01:26:52,899 --> 01:26:54,399
Stark, come in.

1314
01:26:55,029 --> 01:26:56,029
Stark.

1315
01:26:57,159 --> 01:26:58,659
Anyone on comms?

1316
01:26:58,699 --> 01:27:02,590
Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it.

1317
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,390
Where do you think he gets that?

1318
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:10,960
- Anything on Nat? - I haven't heard...

1319
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,800
but she's alive or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.

1320
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,510
This is sealed tight.

1321
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,609
We're gonna need to access the program, Break it down from within.

1322
01:27:19,069 --> 01:27:22,079
Any chance Natasha might leave you a message outside the internet?

1323
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,500
Old school spy stuff?

1324
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:25,250
There's a net I can cast.

1325
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:26,760
I'll find her.

1326
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,180
I can work on tissue degeneration,

1327
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:34,569
if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1328
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:35,739
Yeah about that...

1329
01:27:40,369 --> 01:27:41,380
No.

1330
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,300
- You have to trust me. - Kinda don't.

1331
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,800
Our ally...

1332
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,430
the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes...

1333
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:50,529
I found him.

1334
01:27:50,609 --> 01:27:52,149
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1335
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,119
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.

1336
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,380
He attacked him because he was scared...

1337
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,260
of what he can do.

1338
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:01,430
so Jarvis went underground.

1339
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,979
Okay, scattered, dumped his memory, but not his protocols.

1340
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:09,239
He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.

1341
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:14,689
So... you want me, to help you,

1342
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,970
put Jarvis into this thing?

1343
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,140
No. Of course not.

1344
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,649
I want to help you put Jarvis into this thing.

1345
01:28:23,069 --> 01:28:24,989
Way out of my field here.

1346
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:27,199
You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1347
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:31,510
And you just assume that Jarvis' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?

1348
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:34,520
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1349
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:38,189
This is the opportunity. We can create Ultron's perfect self...

1350
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,369
without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1351
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,739
We have to.

1352
01:28:42,829 --> 01:28:44,579
I believe it's worth a go.

1353
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,840
I'm in a loop.

1354
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:49,819
I'm caught in a time loop.

1355
01:28:49,819 --> 01:28:51,010
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1356
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:53,220
I know... I know what everybody's gonna say,

1357
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,640
but they're already saying it...

1358
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:57,159
We're mad scientists.

1359
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,699
We are monsters, buddy.

1360
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,329
You gotta own it.

1361
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,050
Make a stand.

1362
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,979
It's not a loop.

1363
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:12,449
It's the end of the line.

1364
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,550
I wasn't sure you'd wake up,

1365
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:37,720
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

1366
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,600
I don't have anyone else.

1367
01:29:42,109 --> 01:29:46,539
I think a lot about the meteors. The purity of them.

1368
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:48,369
Boom! Begin.

1369
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,090
Start again.

1370
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:54,640
The world made clean for the new man to rebuild it.

1371
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:57,050
I was meant to be new.

1372
01:29:57,609 --> 01:29:59,859
I was meant to be beautiful.

1373
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:04,579
The world would have looked to the sky and seen hope...

1374
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,170
...seen mercy.

1375
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,180
Instead, they'll look up in horror because of you.

1376
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:12,810
You've wounded me.

1377
01:30:12,939 --> 01:30:15,149
I give you full marks for that.

1378
01:30:15,189 --> 01:30:18,909
But like the man said, "What doesn't kill me...

1379
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:25,430
...just makes me stronger."

1380
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:07,239
This framework is not compatible.

1381
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:10,050
Genetic coding tower's at 97 percent.

1382
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:13,560
You have got to upload that schematic in the next 3 minutes.

1383
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,340
I'm gonna say this once.

1384
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,090
- How about nunce? - Shut it down.

1385
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,649
No, not gonna happen.

1386
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:23,149
- You don't know what you're doing. - And you do?

1387
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:25,800
- She's not in your head? - I know you're angry.

1388
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,510
Oh, we're way past that.

1389
01:31:27,989 --> 01:31:30,539
I can choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1390
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:32,300
Banner after everything that's happened...

1391
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,760
It's nothing compared to what's coming.

1392
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,560
You don't know what's in there. The creature...

1393
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,220
This isn't a game.

1394
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:41,279
No, no, it's alright.

1395
01:31:41,649 --> 01:31:43,029
You were saying?

1396
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:51,470
Pietro!

1397
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,229
What?

1398
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:54,560
You didn't see that coming?

1399
01:31:57,109 --> 01:31:59,829
I'm rerouting the upload.

1400
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,800
Go ahead, piss me off.

1401
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:19,779
Wait!

1402
01:33:44,359 --> 01:33:46,659
I'm sorry, that was...

1403
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,689
odd.

1404
01:33:49,109 --> 01:33:50,159
Thank you.

1405
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,710
Thor?

1406
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,199
You helped create this?

1407
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:00,529
I've had a vision.

1408
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:04,489
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that.

1409
01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:06,489
What? The gem?

1410
01:34:06,489 --> 01:34:09,560
It's the mind stone. It's one of the six infinity stones.

1411
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:13,050
The greatest power in the universe... Unparalleled in it's destructive capabilities.

1412
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:15,010
- Then why would you...? - Because Stark is right.

1413
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,970
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1414
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,640
The Avengers can not defeat Ultron.

1415
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,109
Not alone.

1416
01:34:20,609 --> 01:34:23,369
Why does your "vision" sound like Jarvis?

1417
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:26,000
We configured Jarvis' matrix,

1418
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:28,000
to create something new.

1419
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,140
I think I've had my fill of new.

1420
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:32,140
You think I'm a child of Ultron?

1421
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:33,520
You're not?

1422
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:36,479
I'm not Ultron.

1423
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:39,619
I'm not Jarvis either.

1424
01:34:41,289 --> 01:34:42,500
I am...I am.

1425
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,390
I looked in your head...

1426
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,220
and saw annihilation.

1427
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,689
Look again.

1428
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:51,979
Huh. Your seal of approval means jack to me.

1429
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,310
Their powers... the horrors in our heads...

1430
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:54,819
Ultron himself...

1431
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:56,789
they all came from the mind stone.

1432
01:34:56,869 --> 01:34:59,250
And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1433
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:01,170
- But with it on our side... - Is it?

1434
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:02,720
Are you...?

1435
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,180
on our side?

1436
01:35:06,979 --> 01:35:08,939
I don't think it's that simple.

1437
01:35:09,029 --> 01:35:11,199
Well... better get real simple real soon.

1438
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,500
I'm on the side of life.

1439
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,380
Ultron isn't.

1440
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,430
He will end it all.

1441
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,060
What's he waiting for?

1442
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,939
- You. - Where?

1443
01:35:21,979 --> 01:35:23,189
Sokovia.

1444
01:35:23,229 --> 01:35:25,149
He's got Nat there, too.

1445
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:28,750
If we're wrong about you...

1446
01:35:30,289 --> 01:35:33,590
if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1447
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,930
what will you do?

1448
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:43,449
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1449
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:45,619
He's unique.

1450
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:47,920
And he's in pain.

1451
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:51,560
But that pain will roll over the earth...

1452
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:53,939
So he must be destroyed.

1453
01:35:53,979 --> 01:35:57,819
Every form he's built... every trace of his presence on the net.

1454
01:35:57,909 --> 01:35:59,659
We have to act now.

1455
01:35:59,739 --> 01:36:02,119
And not one of us...

1456
01:36:02,119 --> 01:36:04,840
can do it without the others.

1457
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,640
Maybe I am a monster.

1458
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,689
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1459
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:13,199
I'm not what you are...

1460
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:15,989
and not what you intended.

1461
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:19,340
So there maybe no way to make you trust me,

1462
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,170
but we need to go.

1463
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,670
Right.

1464
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,340
Well done.

1465
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,180
Three minutes.

1466
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:43,569
Get what you need.

1467
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:00,729
Good evening, boss.

1468
01:37:05,539 --> 01:37:07,409
No way we all get through this.

1469
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,920
If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1470
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,850
It's gonna be blood on the floor.

1471
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:13,189
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1472
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:15,029
I get first crack at the big guy.

1473
01:37:15,319 --> 01:37:16,899
Iron-man's what he's waiting for.

1474
01:37:16,939 --> 01:37:18,529
That's true. He hates you the most.

1475
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:25,930
Ultron knows we're coming.

1476
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,770
Odds are, we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1477
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,439
And that's what we signed up for...

1478
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:33,149
but the people of Sokovia... they didn't.

1479
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:36,449
So our priority...

1480
01:37:36,869 --> 01:37:38,630
is getting them out.

1481
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:41,840
You're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1482
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:50,569
Get off your asses.

1483
01:37:51,989 --> 01:37:54,500
All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1484
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:56,630
And that's not gonna happen today...

1485
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:00,350
but we can do our best to protect them.

1486
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:02,149
And we can get the job done.

1487
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:06,989
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1488
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:10,039
We find Romanoff...

1489
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:11,840
and clear the field.

1490
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,260
Keep the fight between us.

1491
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:24,199
Ultron thinks we're monsters...

1492
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,550
that we're what's wrong with the world.

1493
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:30,090
This isn't just about beating him...

1494
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,470
it's about whether he's right.

1495
01:38:38,869 --> 01:38:39,989
Natasha.

1496
01:38:40,869 --> 01:38:41,909
Natasha!

1497
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Bruce!

1498
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,050
Are you alright?

1499
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,140
Yeah.

1500
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:49,189
The team's in the city. It's about to light up.

1501
01:38:49,229 --> 01:38:51,399
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

1502
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:53,399
Yeah, I did.

1503
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,090
So, what's our play?

1504
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,930
I'm here to get you to safety.

1505
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,560
Job's not finished.

1506
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,920
We can help with the evacuation,

1507
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,479
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1508
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:10,869
And you don't play.

1509
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:14,539
Our fight is over.

1510
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,260
So we just disappear?

1511
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,770
Come on...

1512
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:30,579
Your guy's in the church, boss.

1513
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,710
I think he's waiting for you.

1514
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,810
Come to confess your sins?

1515
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:41,170
Oh I don't know. How much time do you got?

1516
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:41,739
More than you.

1517
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,699
Eh ... have you been juicing?

1518
01:39:46,039 --> 01:39:47,500
A little Vibranium cocktail?

1519
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,800
You're looking... I don't wanna say puffy.

1520
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,850
You're stalling to protect the people.

1521
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:54,270
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1522
01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:57,069
I've moved beyond your mission.

1523
01:39:57,149 --> 01:39:58,319
I'm free.

1524
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,380
What?

1525
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:06,510
You think you're the only one stalling?

1526
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:10,560
There's the rest of the vibranium, function... still unclear.

1527
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,649
This is how you end, Tony.

1528
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:14,899
This is peace in my time.

1529
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:32,710
Go!

1530
01:40:37,369 --> 01:40:38,909
Get off the bridge!

1531
01:40:43,529 --> 01:40:44,569
Back!

1532
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:47,909
Ultron.

1533
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:55,350
My Vision.

1534
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:57,939
They really did take everything from me.

1535
01:40:57,979 --> 01:40:59,800
You set the terms. You can change them.

1536
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:00,810
Alright.

1537
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:26,909
Friday, The Vision?

1538
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,439
Boss it's working, he's burning Ultron out of the net,

1539
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:30,649
he won't escape through there.

1540
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:36,579
You shut me out!

1541
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,090
You think I care?

1542
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,640
You take away my world,

1543
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,270
I take away yours.

1544
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,890
Friday.

1545
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:32,140
Sokovia's going for a ride.

1546
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:46,430
Do you see?

1547
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:48,390
The beauty of it.

1548
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,939
The inevitability.

1549
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,239
You rise, only to fall.

1550
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:58,810
You, Avengers...

1551
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:02,229
You are my meteor. My swift terrible sword.

1552
01:43:02,439 --> 01:43:06,319
And the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.

1553
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,489
Purge me from your computers,

1554
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:11,800
turn my own flesh against me...

1555
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:13,850
It means nothing,

1556
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:15,270
When the dust settles,

1557
01:43:15,569 --> 01:43:17,720
the only thing living in this world

1558
01:43:18,329 --> 01:43:19,739
will be metal.

1559
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:25,880
We gotta move.

1560
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:27,479
You're not gonna turn green on me?

1561
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:29,359
I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.

1562
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,649
I adore you...

1563
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,720
but I need the other guy.

1564
01:43:46,979 --> 01:43:48,439
Lets finish the job.

1565
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:07,329
I really hope this makes us even.

1566
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,750
Now go be a hero.

1567
01:44:19,689 --> 01:44:22,149
The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field.

1568
01:44:22,149 --> 01:44:23,670
That's what's keeping the rock together.

1569
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:24,600
If it drops?

1570
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,439
Right now the impact would kill thousands.

1571
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:27,920
Once it gets high enough...

1572
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,010
global extinction.

1573
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:35,729
That building is not clear, its tenth floor.

1574
01:44:40,699 --> 01:44:41,710
Hi.

1575
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,880
Ok...

1576
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,510
Get in the tub.

1577
01:44:51,859 --> 01:44:54,159
We got airborne heading out to the bridge.

1578
01:44:56,699 --> 01:44:58,039
Cap, you got incoming.

1579
01:44:58,119 --> 01:44:59,710
Incoming already came in.

1580
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:05,060
Stark you worry about getting the city back down safely.

1581
01:45:05,479 --> 01:45:07,310
The rest of us have one job...

1582
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:08,689
tear these things apart.

1583
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:10,909
You get hurt, hurt them back.

1584
01:45:11,029 --> 01:45:12,329
You get killed...

1585
01:45:13,289 --> 01:45:14,420
walk it off.

1586
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,340
Go! Go! Go!

1587
01:45:55,859 --> 01:45:57,569
How can I let this happen?

1588
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:58,949
Hey, hey, you okay?

1589
01:45:58,989 --> 01:46:00,119
This is all our fault.

1590
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:01,039
Hey, Look at me.

1591
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:02,750
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

1592
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,500
Who cares?

1593
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:05,340
Are you up for this?

1594
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:06,430
Are you?

1595
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:09,310
Look I just need to know, because the city... it's flying.

1596
01:46:10,149 --> 01:46:14,029
Ok look, the city is flying, and we're fighting an army of robots.

1597
01:46:14,699 --> 01:46:16,449
And I have a bow and an arrow.

1598
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,869
None of this makes sense.

1599
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:22,460
I'm going back out there

1600
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:23,510
because it's my job,

1601
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,060
Ok? I can't do my job and babysit.

1602
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,939
Doesn't matter what you did, or what you were...

1603
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:32,789
but if you go out there, you fight... and you fight to kill.

1604
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:34,909
Stay in here, you're good.

1605
01:46:34,909 --> 01:46:36,090
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1606
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:38,180
But if you step out that door...

1607
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:40,470
you are an Avenger.

1608
01:46:44,739 --> 01:46:46,529
Alright, gotcha.

1609
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,090
Yeah, this city is flying.

1610
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:26,260
I got you.

1611
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,930
Just look at me!

1612
01:47:34,279 --> 01:47:36,539
You can't save them all.

1613
01:47:37,869 --> 01:47:39,130
You'll never...

1614
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:42,470
Never what? You didn't finish!

1615
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:47,359
What? Were you napping?

1616
01:48:08,289 --> 01:48:09,420
Damn Thor!

1617
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:14,050
You are bothering me.

1618
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:50,939
Alright, we're all clear here.

1619
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:53,609
We are not clear! We are very not clear!

1620
01:48:56,409 --> 01:48:57,869
Alright, coming to you.

1621
01:48:58,579 --> 01:48:59,800
Keep up, old man.

1622
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,770
Nobody would know...

1623
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:06,270
nobody.

1624
01:49:07,569 --> 01:49:10,529
The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.

1625
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:11,590
Yeah I'll be missed.

1626
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:13,760
That quick little bastard, I miss him already.

1627
01:49:29,159 --> 01:49:30,710
Hold your fire.

1628
01:49:40,359 --> 01:49:41,449
Romanoff!

1629
01:49:41,779 --> 01:49:42,829
Thanks.

1630
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:54,159
The anti-gravs are ready to flip.

1631
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,039
Touch them and they'll go full reverse thrust.

1632
01:49:56,529 --> 01:49:57,899
The city is not coming down slowly.

1633
01:49:57,939 --> 01:49:59,569
The spire is vibranium,

1634
01:49:59,609 --> 01:50:01,489
- If I get Thor to hit it... - It will crack,

1635
01:50:01,569 --> 01:50:03,750
That's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.

1636
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,340
Maybe if we can cap the other end...

1637
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:07,260
keep the atomic action doubling back.

1638
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:08,979
That could vaporize the city,

1639
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,979
and everyone on it.

1640
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:19,000
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

1641
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:20,619
What you got, Stark?

1642
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:21,720
Well, nothing great.

1643
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,890
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1644
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,210
Have to keep it from impacting the surface

1645
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:26,649
if you guys can get clear.

1646
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:28,859
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1647
01:50:28,899 --> 01:50:31,159
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1648
01:50:31,989 --> 01:50:33,750
We're gonna have to make a choice.

1649
01:50:33,829 --> 01:50:36,050
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

1650
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:38,369
If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1651
01:50:38,369 --> 01:50:39,600
Not until everyone's safe.

1652
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:42,520
Everyone up here versus everyone down there?

1653
01:50:42,609 --> 01:50:43,500
There's no math there.

1654
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,199
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1655
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:46,989
I didn't say we should leave.

1656
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,960
There's worse ways to go.

1657
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:58,479
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1658
01:50:59,859 --> 01:51:01,819
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.

1659
01:51:02,529 --> 01:51:04,369
It's about to get better.

1660
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:29,479
Nice, right?

1661
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,109
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

1662
01:51:32,189 --> 01:51:34,029
She's dusty but, she'll do.

1663
01:51:34,119 --> 01:51:36,199
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1664
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:38,079
Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1665
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:41,010
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1666
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:42,510
Life boats secure to deploy...

1667
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:45,399
Disengage in three, two, ...

1668
01:51:46,189 --> 01:51:47,359
Take 'em out.

1669
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:58,010
This is Shield?

1670
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,310
This is what Shield's supposed to be.

1671
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:04,069
This is not so bad.

1672
01:52:07,159 --> 01:52:08,579
Let's load them up.

1673
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:17,350
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1674
01:52:18,109 --> 01:52:19,939
Show them what we got.

1675
01:52:20,069 --> 01:52:21,239
You're up.

1676
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,340
Yes!

1677
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:29,430
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1678
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:34,109
Yup, If you live to tell it.

1679
01:52:34,109 --> 01:52:35,939
You think I can't hold my own?

1680
01:52:35,989 --> 01:52:37,729
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1681
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:39,829
You had to make it weird.

1682
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:05,859
Here we go, here we go! Lets move.

1683
01:53:09,739 --> 01:53:11,789
Number six boat is topped and locked.

1684
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:15,000
Or stuffed... topped... st- ... um ..

1685
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:16,550
It's uh... full of people.

1686
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:19,350
Incoming.

1687
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:23,149
Whoa God.

1688
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,770
You think you're saving anyone?

1689
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:39,439
I just turn that key and drop this rock a little early,

1690
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:41,529
and it's still billions dead.

1691
01:53:41,619 --> 01:53:43,159
Even you can't stop that.

1692
01:53:43,239 --> 01:53:45,329
I am Thor... son of Odin...

1693
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:48,130
and as long as there's life in my breast...

1694
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:50,600
I am running out of things to say.

1695
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:51,930
Are you ready?

1696
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:00,619
It's terribly well balanced.

1697
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:03,050
Well, if it has too much weight to lose power on the swing, so...

1698
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,560
I got it, create a heat seal.

1699
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:11,569
I can supercharge the spiral from below.

1700
01:54:11,649 --> 01:54:12,989
Running numbers.

1701
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:25,149
A heat seal could work with enough power.

1702
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:27,359
- Thor, I got a plan. - We're out of time.

1703
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:28,779
They are coming for the core.

1704
01:54:28,819 --> 01:54:30,569
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.

1705
01:54:30,569 --> 01:54:31,119
On it.

1706
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:33,630
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1707
01:54:42,859 --> 01:54:44,529
- You good? - Yeah.

1708
01:54:45,489 --> 01:54:46,529
Romanoff?

1709
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:49,460
You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini!

1710
01:54:49,539 --> 01:54:50,840
Relax, shellhead...

1711
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,550
not all of us can fly.

1712
01:54:57,729 --> 01:54:59,699
- What's the drill? - This is the drill.

1713
01:54:59,779 --> 01:55:02,079
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1714
01:55:06,539 --> 01:55:09,039
Is that the best you can do?!

1715
01:55:18,449 --> 01:55:19,750
You had to ask.

1716
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:22,090
This, is the best I can do.

1717
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,590
This is exactly what I wanted.

1718
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,930
All of you, against all of me.

1719
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:30,319
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1720
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:33,109
Like the old man said...

1721
01:55:34,329 --> 01:55:35,710
together.

1722
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:07,279
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1723
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:16,899
They are trying to leave the city.

1724
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:18,289
We can't let them, not even one.

1725
01:57:18,289 --> 01:57:19,539
- Rhodey. - I'm on it.

1726
01:57:20,369 --> 01:57:22,210
Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1727
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:24,380
War machine coming at you, right.

1728
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:31,819
Ok, what?

1729
01:57:31,899 --> 01:57:32,890
We gotta move out,

1730
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:34,750
even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1731
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:35,699
You guys get to the boats.

1732
01:57:35,739 --> 01:57:38,250
I'll sweep for stragglers... be right behind you.

1733
01:57:38,329 --> 01:57:39,420
What about the core?

1734
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:40,800
I'll protect it.

1735
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:43,720
It's my job.

1736
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:45,850
Nat.

1737
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:46,939
This way.

1738
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:52,869
Get the people on the boats.

1739
01:57:52,949 --> 01:57:54,409
I'm not going to leave you.

1740
01:57:54,409 --> 01:57:55,039
I can handle these.

1741
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:00,060
Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.

1742
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,689
You understand?

1743
01:58:02,609 --> 01:58:05,069
You know... I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1744
01:58:05,109 --> 01:58:06,199
Go!

1745
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:09,270
Boss, power levels are way below...

1746
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:10,210
Reroute everything.

1747
01:58:10,289 --> 01:58:11,710
We got one shot at this.

1748
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:17,850
I know what I need to do.

1749
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:19,149
Dining room.

1750
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:21,149
I knock out that east wall...

1751
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:23,329
make a nice work space for Laura.

1752
01:58:24,289 --> 01:58:24,909
Put up some baffling,

1753
01:58:24,909 --> 01:58:27,170
she can't hear the kids running around.

1754
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:27,800
What do you think?

1755
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,289
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1756
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,880
No one eats in the dining room.

1757
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:37,859
We don't have a lot of time.

1758
01:58:37,909 --> 01:58:39,489
So get your ass on a boat.

1759
01:58:52,899 --> 01:58:54,279
Hey, big guy...

1760
01:58:55,829 --> 01:58:57,619
The sun is getting real low.

1761
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:06,229
Kostya?

1762
01:59:07,189 --> 01:59:09,529
We were in the market

1763
01:59:09,569 --> 01:59:10,619
Kostya!

1764
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:26,489
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1765
01:59:26,579 --> 01:59:28,119
- Is this the last of them? - Yeah.

1766
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:29,810
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1767
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:31,020
You know, if this works...

1768
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,130
we maybe don't walk away.

1769
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:35,390
Maybe not.

1770
01:59:53,899 --> 01:59:57,529
I have no strings, so I have fun...

1771
01:59:57,609 --> 02:00:00,539
I'm not tied up to anyone.

1772
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:36,899
You didn't see that coming.

1773
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:35,659
Oh for God's sake!

1774
02:02:06,279 --> 02:02:07,409
No, no. I'm fine.

1775
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,470
It's been a long day.

1776
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:28,420
Wanda.

1777
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:32,140
If you stay here, you'll die.

1778
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,149
I just did.

1779
02:02:36,029 --> 02:02:38,159
Do you know how it felt?

1780
02:02:51,609 --> 02:02:53,409
It felt like that.

1781
02:03:29,079 --> 02:03:30,659
Thor... on my mark.

1782
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:47,079
Now!

1783
02:04:14,609 --> 02:04:15,949
Hey, big guy,

1784
02:04:16,619 --> 02:04:18,039
We did it.

1785
02:04:18,119 --> 02:04:19,750
The job's finished.

1786
02:04:19,829 --> 02:04:22,420
Now I need you to turn this bird around, ok?

1787
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:29,649
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1788
02:04:31,149 --> 02:04:33,699
So help me out, I need you t...

1789
02:05:18,739 --> 02:05:20,199
You're afraid.

1790
02:05:20,569 --> 02:05:21,949
Of you?

1791
02:05:22,369 --> 02:05:23,579
Of death.

1792
02:05:24,289 --> 02:05:25,960
You're the last one.

1793
02:05:26,380 --> 02:05:28,550
You're supposed to be the last.

1794
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:31,600
Stark asked for a savior...

1795
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:34,529
and settled for a slave.

1796
02:05:34,609 --> 02:05:36,869
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1797
02:05:38,699 --> 02:05:40,710
I suppose we are.

1798
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:42,760
Humans are odd.

1799
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:47,439
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites and...

1800
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:52,239
try to control what won't be.

1801
02:05:52,619 --> 02:05:55,289
But there's grace in their failings.

1802
02:05:55,329 --> 02:05:57,380
I think you've missed that.

1803
02:05:58,090 --> 02:05:59,800
They're doomed.

1804
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:01,220
Yes...

1805
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:08,449
but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1806
02:06:10,449 --> 02:06:12,670
It's a privilege to be among them.

1807
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:14,880
You're unbearably naive.

1808
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:20,770
Well, I was born yesterday.

1809
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:35,590
Say hi to your Auntie Nat.

1810
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:37,930
Sad.

1811
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:41,229
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1812
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,989
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1813
02:07:44,619 --> 02:07:46,289
Could be the Quin jet...

1814
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:48,560
but with Stark's stealth tech

1815
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,130
we still can't track the damn thing.

1816
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:52,430
Right.

1817
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,979
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1818
02:07:56,899 --> 02:07:58,739
He'll send a postcard.

1819
02:07:58,819 --> 02:08:00,659
Wish you were here.

1820
02:08:02,659 --> 02:08:05,460
You sent me to recruit him... way back when.

1821
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:09,560
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

1822
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:14,069
You never know...

1823
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:18,710
You hope for the best, and make do with what you get.

1824
02:08:18,789 --> 02:08:20,789
I got a great team.

1825
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:23,300
Nothing lasts forever.

1826
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:25,640
Trouble, Miss Romanoff...

1827
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:28,939
No matter who wins or loses... trouble still comes 'round.

1828
02:08:32,779 --> 02:08:34,420
The rules have changed...

1829
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:35,739
we're dealing with something new.

1830
02:08:35,739 --> 02:08:38,470
- Well the Vision is artificial intelligence. - A machine.

1831
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:39,590
So it doesn't count?

1832
02:08:39,590 --> 02:08:41,810
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.

1833
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:43,250
Right. Different rules for us.

1834
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:44,250
- Nice guy... artificial. - Thank you

1835
02:08:44,819 --> 02:08:47,779
He can wield the hammer. He can keep the mind stone.

1836
02:08:48,739 --> 02:08:50,750
It's safe with the Vision.

1837
02:08:51,079 --> 02:08:53,840
These days safe is in short supply.

1838
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:57,189
But if you put the hammer in an elevator.

1839
02:08:57,189 --> 02:08:58,600
It would still go up.

1840
02:08:58,640 --> 02:08:59,960
Elevator's not worthy

1841
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:01,479
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1842
02:09:01,569 --> 02:09:03,279
Not if you don't leave.

1843
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:04,779
I have no choice.

1844
02:09:04,909 --> 02:09:09,050
The mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones to show up in the last few years.

1845
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:10,760
It's not a coincidence.

1846
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:14,520
Someone has been playing intricate games... and has made pawns of us.

1847
02:09:14,979 --> 02:09:17,109
Once all these pieces are in position...

1848
02:09:17,109 --> 02:09:18,109
Triple Yahtzee?

1849
02:09:18,609 --> 02:09:21,369
- You think you can find out what's coming? - I do.

1850
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:25,590
Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.

1851
02:09:33,319 --> 02:09:36,239
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1852
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:41,619
I'm gonna miss him though, and you're gonna miss me.

1853
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,840
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1854
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,189
I will miss you, Tony.

1855
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:48,439
Yeah?

1856
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,899
Well... It's time for me to tap out.

1857
02:09:51,319 --> 02:09:53,539
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.

1858
02:09:53,579 --> 02:09:57,050
Build Pepper a farm... hope nobody blows it up.

1859
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,520
The simple life.

1860
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:00,460
You'll get there one day.

1861
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:01,180
I do not know.

1862
02:10:01,319 --> 02:10:03,770
Family... stability...

1863
02:10:05,029 --> 02:10:06,680
Guy who wanted all that,

1864
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:08,199
went into the ice 75 years ago.

1865
02:10:09,659 --> 02:10:11,710
I think someone else came out.

1866
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:17,060
You alright?

1867
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:20,689
I'm home.

1868
02:10:28,710 --> 02:10:31,090
Wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?

1869
02:10:31,470 --> 02:10:33,050
I mean it's a pretty interesting wall.

1870
02:10:33,090 --> 02:10:35,770
Thought you and Tony were still gazing into each others eyes.

1871
02:10:36,149 --> 02:10:37,319
How do we look?

1872
02:10:37,399 --> 02:10:39,489
Well we're not the '27 Yankees.

1873
02:10:39,569 --> 02:10:41,579
We got some batters.

1874
02:10:41,619 --> 02:10:44,250
They're good, but not a team.

1875
02:10:44,289 --> 02:10:46,630
Let's beat'em into shape.

1876
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:05,680
Avengers....!
