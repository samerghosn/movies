1
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,992
Are you the guys from Washington?

2
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,909
You get many other visitors out here?

3
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,579
How long you been on-site?

4
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,037
Since this morning.

5
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,790
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

6
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,376
How come nobody spotted it before?

7
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,170
It's really not that surprising.

8
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,757
This landscape's changing all the time.

9
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,716
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

10
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,885
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

11
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,304
I don't think so.

12
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,472
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

13
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,183
How long before
we can start craning it out?

14
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,186
I don't think you quite understand.

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,229
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

16
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,736
Base, we're in.

17
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,161
What is this?

18
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,593
Careful.

19
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,783
Lieutenant!

20
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,204
What is it?

21
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,872
My God.

22
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,625
Base, get me a line to the Colonel.

23
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,794
It's 3:00 a.m., sir.

24
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,465
I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.

25
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,149
They've come for it!

26
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,859
They have before.

27
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,861
Not like this.

28
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,030
Let them come.

29
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,698
They'll never find it.

30
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,413
Open it!

31
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,875
Quickly, before he...

32
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,723
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

33
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,978
You should be commended.

34
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,105
Help him up.

35
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:22,028
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

36
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,531
And, in this way, we are much alike.

37
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,074
I am nothing like you.

38
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,742
No, of course, but

39
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,374
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

40
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,709
What you seek is just a legend.

41
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,379
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

42
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:03,571
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

43
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,286
It is not something one buries.

44
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:16,082
But I think it is close, yes?

45
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,127
I cannot help you.

46
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,839
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

47
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:28,220
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

48
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,307
I have no need for them to die.

49
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,072
Yggdrasil.

50
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,326
Tree of the world.

51
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,329
Guardian of wisdom.

52
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,250
And fate, also.

53
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,869
And the FÃ¼hrerdigs for trinkets
in the desert.

54
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,292
You have never seen this, have you?

55
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,379
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

56
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,048
Exactly.

57
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,553
Give the order to open fire.

58
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,930
Fool!

59
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,850
You cannot control the power you hold.

60
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,018
You will burn!

61
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,855
I already have.

62
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,244
O'Connell, Michael.

63
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,122
Kaminsky, Henry.

64
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,456
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

65
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,418
Rogers, Steven.

66
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,254
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

67
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:27,923
Nope.

68
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,385
Rogers.

69
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,227
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

70
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:45,231
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...

71
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,067
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

72
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,278
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

73
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,869
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

74
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,538
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

75
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,039
Is there anything you can do?

76
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,832
I'm doing it.

77
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,543
I'm saving your life.

78
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,049
War continues to ravage Europe.

79
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,052
But help is on the way.

80
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:19,475
Every able-bodied young man is
lining up to serve his country.

81
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,063
Even little Timmy is doing his part

82
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,149
collecting scrap metal.

83
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,399
Nice work, Timmy!

84
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,777
Who cares?

85
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,528
Play the movie already!

86
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,322
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

87
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,783
Meanwhile, overseas,

88
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,952
our brave boys are showing
the Axis powers that the price

89
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,788
of freedom is never too high.

90
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,206
Let's go! Get on with it!

91
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,875
Hey, just start the cartoon!

92
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,126
Hey, you wanna shut up?

93
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,673
Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,

94
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,131
no matter the size.

95
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,360
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

96
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,861
I can do this all day.

97
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,493
Hey!

98
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,077
Pick on someone your own size.

99
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,298
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

100
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,633
I had him on the ropes.

101
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,884
How many times is this?

102
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,221
You're from Paramus now?

103
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,225
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

104
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,809
And seriously, Jersey?

105
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,062
You get your orders?

106
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,734
The 107th.

107
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,485
Sergeant James Barnes,

108
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,988
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

109
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,993
I should be going.

110
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,581
Come on, man.

111
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,250
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.

112
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,918
Why? Where are we going?

113
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,337
The future.

114
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,219
I don't see what the problem is.

115
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,929
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

116
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,515
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

117
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,893
Well, I'd settle for just one.

118
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,312
Good thing I took care of that.

119
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,022
Hey, Bucky!

120
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,442
What'd you tell her about me?

121
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,486
Only the good stuff.

122
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,740
Welcome to
the Modern Marvels Pavilion

123
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,494
and the World of Tomorrow.

124
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:47,789
A greater world. A better world.

125
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,629
Oh, my God! It's starting!

126
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,466
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Howard Stark!

127
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,729
I love you, Howard!

128
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,899
Ladies and gentlemen,

129
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,822
what if I told you that in just
a few short years, your automobile

130
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,990
won't even have to
touch the ground at all?

131
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,120
Yes. Thanks, Mandy.

132
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,539
With Stark Gravitic
Reversion Technology

133
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,833
you'll be able to do just that.

134
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,427
Holy cow.

135
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,899
I did say a few years, didn't I?

136
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:07,827
Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

137
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,422
Come on, soldier.

138
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,471
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

139
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,054
We're taking the girls dancing.

140
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,224
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

141
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,145
You're really going to do this again?

142
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,772
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

143
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,566
As who, Steve from Ohio?

144
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,027
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

145
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:41,986
Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.

146
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,489
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

147
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,532
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

148
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,493
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

149
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,495
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

150
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,205
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

151
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,915
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

152
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,001
I got no right to do any less than them.

153
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,754
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

154
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,341
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

155
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,096
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

156
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,100
Yes, we are.

157
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,192
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

158
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,317
How can I?

159
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,611
You're taking all the stupid with you.

160
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,951
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

161
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,452
Be careful.

162
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,332
Don't win the war till I get there!

163
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,383
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

164
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,153
Wait here.

165
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,615
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

166
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,844
Thank you.

167
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,764
So,

168
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,936
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

169
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,605
Excuse me?

170
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,566
Dr Abraham Erskine.

171
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,360
I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

172
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,820
Steve Rogers.

173
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,868
Where are you from?

174
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,456
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

175
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,875
Before that, Germany.

176
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,793
- This troubles you?
- No.

177
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,922
Where are you from, Mr Rogers?

178
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,966
Is it New Haven?

179
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,469
Or Paramus?

180
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,721
Five exams in five different cities.

181
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,847
That might not be the right file.

182
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,807
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

183
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,061
It's the five tries.

184
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,231
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

185
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,235
Is this a test?

186
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,905
Yes.

187
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,661
I don't want to kill anyone.

188
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,538
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

189
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,500
Well, there are already

190
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,586
so many big men fighting this war.

191
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,629
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

192
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,466
I can offer you a chance.

193
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,720
Only a chance.

194
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,596
- I'll take it.
- Good.

195
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,601
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

196
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,937
Brooklyn.

197
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,608
Congratulations, soldier.

198
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,884
Are you ready, Dr Zola?

199
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,973
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

200
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,602
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

201
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,271
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

202
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:49,483
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

203
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,153
With this artefact

204
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,154
I am certain of nothing.

205
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,824
I fear it may not work at all.

206
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,153
Twenty percent.

207
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,699
Forty.

208
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,744
Sixty.

209
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,458
Stabilizing at 70%.

210
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,297
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

211
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,400
What was that?

212
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:16,112
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

213
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,365
Your designs do not disappoint.

214
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,787
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

215
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,789
The exchange is stable.

216
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,834
Amazing!

217
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,502
The energy we have just collected

218
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,588
could power my designs.
All my designs.

219
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,552
This will change the war.

220
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,012
Dr Zola,

221
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,351
this will change the world.

222
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,730
Ready, exercise!

223
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,606
Recruits, attention!

224
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,151
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

225
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,113
I supervise all operations
for this division.

226
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,365
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

227
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,576
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

228
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,786
What's your name, soldier?

229
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,872
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

230
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,707
Step forward, Hodge.

231
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,835
Put your right foot forward.

232
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,628
We gonna wrassle?

233
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,799
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

234
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:22,971
Agent Carter!

235
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,681
Colonel Phillips.

236
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,767
I can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. That's good!

237
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,728
Get your ass up out of that dirt

238
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,564
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

239
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,148
Yes, sir!

240
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,778
General Patton has said

241
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,950
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

242
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,621
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

243
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,169
And because they are
going to get better.

244
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,253
Much better.

245
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,842
The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort

246
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,970
made up of
the best minds in the free world.

247
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,557
Our goal is
to create the best army in history.

248
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,018
But every army starts with one man.

249
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,228
Rogers! Get off of there!

250
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,439
At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.

251
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:18,652
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

252
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,285
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

253
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:32,039
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

254
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,500
Pick up the pace, ladies!

255
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,630
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

256
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,758
Come on! Faster! Faster!

257
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,551
Move! Move!

258
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,887
Squad, halt!

259
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,766
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

260
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,894
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

261
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,730
Move, move!

262
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,482
Come on! Get up there!

263
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:01,443
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

264
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,113
Get up there, Hodge!

265
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,740
Come on! Get up there!

266
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,868
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

267
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,833
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

268
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,210
Let's go! Get back into formation!

269
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,923
Rogers! I said fall in!

270
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,773
Thank you, sir.

271
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,785
Faster, ladies! Come on.

272
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,371
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

273
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:55,832
Move it!

274
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:58,042
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

275
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,046
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

276
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,465
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

277
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,967
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

278
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,760
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

279
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:08,886
I never thought you'd pick him.

280
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,180
Up.

281
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,018
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

282
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,604
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

283
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:19,897
He's making me cry.

284
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,567
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

285
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,278
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

286
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,488
All the grovelling I had to do

287
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,739
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

288
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,075
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

289
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,411
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

290
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,413
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

291
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,955
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

292
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,959
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

293
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,090
You win wars with guts.

294
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,384
Grenade!

295
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,224
Get away!

296
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,143
Get back!

297
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,984
It was a dummy grenade.

298
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,071
All clear. Back in formation.

299
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,451
Is this a test?

300
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,372
He's still skinny.

301
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,548
- May I?
- Yeah.

302
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:32,220
Can't sleep?

303
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,681
I got the jitters, I guess.

304
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,557
Me, too.

305
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:39,853
Can I ask you a question?

306
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,354
Just one?

307
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,982
Why me?

308
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,822
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

309
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,994
This is from Augsburg. My city.

310
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,707
So many people forget

311
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,292
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

312
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,422
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

313
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,424
They felt weak. They felt small.

314
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,259
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

315
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,387
and the big show and the flags.

316
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,684
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

317
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,103
And he says, "You."

318
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,814
He says, "You will make us strong."

319
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,233
Well, I am not interested.

320
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,988
So he sends the head of Hydra,

321
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,449
his research division.

322
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,367
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

323
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,038
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

324
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,455
And he is ambitious.

325
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:47,170
He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.

326
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,923
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

327
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,799
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

328
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,304
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

329
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,932
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

330
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,266
left here by the gods,

331
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,185
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

332
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:08,816
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

333
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:14,404
Schmidt must become
that superior man.

334
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,203
Did it make him stronger?

335
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,663
Yes.

336
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,000
But there were other effects.

337
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,631
The serum was not ready.

338
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,843
But more important, the man.

339
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,055
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

340
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:42,267
so good becomes great.

341
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,102
Bad becomes worse.

342
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,025
This is why you were chosen.

343
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,654
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

344
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,699
may lose respect for that power,

345
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,993
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

346
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,371
And knows

347
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,205
compassion.

348
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,128
Thanks. I think.

349
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:19,971
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

350
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,268
That you will stay who you are.

351
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,771
Not a perfect soldier,

352
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,148
but

353
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:33,608
a good man.

354
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,282
To the little guys.

355
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,328
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

356
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,580
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

357
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,709
All right. We'll drink it after.

358
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,378
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

359
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,772
Is there something in particular
you need?

360
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,448
I understand you found him.

361
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,909
See for yourself.

362
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,547
You disapprove.

363
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,259
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

364
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,135
I can't imagine he will succeed.

365
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,348
Again.

366
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:50,728
His serum is the Allies' only defence
against this power we now possess.

367
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,481
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

368
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,319
Shall I give the order?

369
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,323
It has been given.

370
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,826
Good.

371
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:09,454
Dr Zola!

372
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,044
What do you think?

373
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:23,845
A masterpiece.

374
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,856
I know this neighbourhood.

375
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,733
I got beat up in that alley.

376
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,403
And that parking lot.

377
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,615
And behind that diner.

378
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,536
Did you have something against
running away?

379
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,665
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

380
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,835
You stand up, you push back.

381
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,252
They can't say no forever, right?

382
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,548
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

383
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,801
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

384
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,261
if you were a beautiful dame.

385
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,888
Or a... A woman.

386
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,390
An agent. Not a dame.

387
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,349
You are beautiful, but...

388
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,353
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

389
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,897
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

390
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,903
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

391
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,570
You must have danced.

392
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:26,365
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

393
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,410
And the past few years, it just

394
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,413
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

395
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:33,955
For what?

396
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,917
The right partner.

397
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,933
This way.

398
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,605
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

399
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,622
Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?

400
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,958
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

401
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,142
Good morning.

402
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,019
Please, not now.

403
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:24,983
Are you ready?

404
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,615
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

405
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,954
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

406
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,624
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

407
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,625
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

408
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,836
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

409
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,130
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

410
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:47,632
This is...

411
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,383
Fred Clemson, State Department.

412
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,968
If this project of yours comes through,

413
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,679
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

414
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,557
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

415
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,614
Comfortable?

416
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,866
It's a little big.

417
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,746
You save me any of that schnapps?

418
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,625
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

419
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,335
Next time.

420
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,505
Mr Stark, how are your levels?

421
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,839
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

422
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,925
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

423
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,221
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

424
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,222
Agent Carter?

425
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,599
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

426
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,309
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

427
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,532
Do you hear me? Is this on?

428
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,617
Ladies and gentlemen,

429
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,788
today we take not another step
towards annihilation,

430
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,457
but the first step

431
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,835
on the path to peace.

432
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,215
We begin with a series
of microinjections into

433
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:15,135
the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion

434
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,304
will cause immediate cellular change.

435
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,809
And then, to stimulate growth,

436
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,438
the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.

437
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,280
That wasn't so bad.

438
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,239
That was penicillin.

439
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,079
Serum infusion beginning in

440
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,496
five,

441
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:45,541
four,

442
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,001
three,

443
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,920
two,

444
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
one.

445
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,268
Now, Mr Stark.

446
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,670
Steven? Can you hear me?

447
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,215
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

448
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,385
We will proceed.

449
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,898
That's 10%.

450
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,068
Twenty percent.

451
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,610
Thirty.

452
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,322
That's 40%.

453
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,826
Vital signs are normal.

454
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,077
That's 50%.

455
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,869
Sixty.

456
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,831
Seventy.

457
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
Steven!

458
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,965
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

459
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,342
Shut it down!

460
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,177
Kill the reactor, Mr Stark!

461
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,971
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

462
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,389
No!

463
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,391
Don't! I can do this!

464
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,358
Eighty.

465
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,068
Ninety.

466
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,445
That's 100%.

467
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,969
Mr Stark?

468
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,733
Steven. Steven.

469
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:19,820
The son of a bitch did it.

470
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,619
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

471
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,454
I think we did it.

472
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,748
You actually did it.

473
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,336
How do you feel?

474
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,757
Taller.

475
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,094
You look taller.

476
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,014
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

477
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:51,309
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

478
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,940
Congratulations, Doctor.

479
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,733
Thank you, sir.

480
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,454
Stop him!

481
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,061
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

482
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,813
Hey, this guy's been shot!

483
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,076
I had him!

484
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,369
Sorry!

485
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,599
I'm sorry!

486
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,715
No! No! Not my son!

487
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,135
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

488
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,389
Get back!

489
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,891
Let me go!

490
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,353
Let go of my son!

491
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:26,315
Don't hurt him!

492
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,405
Wait, don't! Don't!

493
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,199
No! Don't!

494
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,250
Go get him! I can swim!

495
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,762
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

496
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,847
Cut off one head,

497
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,726
two more shall take its place.

498
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,023
Hail Hydra.

499
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,878
The FÃ¼hrer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

500
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,880
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

501
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,882
You serve at his pleasure.

502
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,844
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

503
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,472
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

504
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,224
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

505
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,726
You think this is about appearances?

506
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:30,231
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

507
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:32,733
And we had learned
through local intelligence

508
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,903
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

509
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,905
The FÃ¼hrerfeels... How does he put it?

510
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,242
"The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!"

511
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,755
Gentlemen,

512
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:00,846
you have come to see
the results of our work.

513
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,431
Let me show you.

514
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,768
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

515
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,771
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

516
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,190
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

517
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,362
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

518
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,990
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

519
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:25,536
Science. But I understand
your confusion.

520
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,789
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

521
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:33,170
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

522
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:36,672
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

523
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,923
all in a matter of hours.

524
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,509
Your enemies?

525
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,262
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

526
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,014
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

527
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,143
Quite simply, gentlemen,

528
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,606
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

529
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,692
Thank you, Schmidt.

530
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:56,777
For what?

531
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,447
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

532
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,947
Berlin is on this map!

533
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,451
So it is.

534
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,121
You will be punished for your insolence!

535
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,791
You will be brought
before the FÃ¼hrer himself!

536
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:22,969
Schmidt...

537
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,851
My apologies, Doctor,

538
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:34,940
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

539
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,317
Hail Hydra.

540
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,110
Hail Hydra!

541
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,422
Think you got enough?

542
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:05,094
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

543
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,347
But without Dr Erskine,
it would take years.

544
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,393
He deserved more than this.

545
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,273
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

546
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:22,070
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

547
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,989
Great. Why don't we start with how

548
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,284
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

549
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,869
What have we got here?

550
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,038
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

551
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,041
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

552
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,960
We're not even close to this technology.

553
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:38,711
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

554
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,713
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

555
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,215
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

556
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,510
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

557
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,222
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

558
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,514
Hydra is practically a cult.

559
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,224
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

560
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,893
So, what are you going to do about it?

561
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:56,228
I spoke to the President this morning.

562
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,733
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

563
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,152
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

564
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,570
You, too, Stark.

565
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,572
We're flying to London tonight.

566
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,992
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

567
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:11,244
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

568
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,913
The serum worked.

569
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,831
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

570
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,043
You are not enough.

571
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,507
With all due respect to the Colonel,

572
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,967
I think we may be missing the point.

573
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:30,639
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

574
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:31,972
Paper.

575
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,643
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

576
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,936
since your picture hit the newsstands.

577
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,565
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

578
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,608
and hide him in a lab.

579
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:47,030
Son, do you want to serve your country

580
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,115
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

581
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,452
Sir, that's all I want.

582
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,456
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

583
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,753
I don't know if I can do this.

584
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:06,507
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

585
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,467
You're an American hero.

586
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,844
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

587
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,556
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

588
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,766
You play ball with us,

589
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:16,809
you'll be leading your own platoon
in no time.

590
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,436
Take the shield.

591
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,813
Go.

592
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:26,820
Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?

593
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,824
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

594
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,617
But there's still a way
all of us can fight.

595
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:37,414
Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?

596
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,416
Series E Defence Bonds.

597
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,210
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

598
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:46,797
Who will campaign door-to-door
for America?

599
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,175
Carry the flag shore to shore
for America?

600
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,346
From Hoboken to Spokane.

601
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:59,476
The star-spangled man with a plan.

602
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,565
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.

603
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,695
We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win.

604
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:11,614
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

605
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:17,202
Who'll hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from Berlin?

606
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,958
Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?

607
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,253
Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America?

608
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:28,632
Who's here to prove that we can?

609
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:34,846
The star-spangled man with a plan.

610
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,599
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

611
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:40,851
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

612
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,146
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy

613
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,521
will help protect someone you love.

614
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,483
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready,

615
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,320
and the Germans will think twice about
trying to get the drop on us.

616
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:59,454
Stalwart and steady and true.

617
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,376
Forceful and ready to defend

618
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,253
the red, white, and blue.

619
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,257
Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?

620
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,637
Far as an eagle will soar.

621
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,349
Who's making Adolf
afraid to step out of his box?

622
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:22,434
He knows what we're fighting for.

623
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,938
Who waked the giant
that napped in America?

624
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,483
We know it's no one
but Captain America.

625
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,193
Hi.

626
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:33,112
Who'll finish what they began?

627
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:40,036
Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan?
The star-spangled man

628
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,956
with a

629
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,501
plan!

630
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:58,346
How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?

631
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,184
Okay.

632
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,148
I need a volunteer.

633
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,483
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

634
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,987
Bring back the girls!

635
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,327
I think they only know the one song, but

636
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:23,538
I'll see what I can do.

637
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,539
You do that, sweetheart.

638
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,668
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

639
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,130
Come on, guys,
we're all on the same team here.

640
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,507
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

641
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,186
Bring back the girls!

642
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,485
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

643
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:04,204
Hello, Steve.

644
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,706
Hi.

645
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,958
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

646
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,295
Officially, I'm not here at all.

647
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,672
That was quite a performance.

648
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,048
Yeah.

649
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,885
I had to improvise a little bit.

650
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,721
The crowds I'm used to
are usually more

651
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,306
twelve.

652
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,309
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

653
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,978
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

654
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,646
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

655
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,317
At least he's got me doing this.

656
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,985
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

657
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,737
And these are your only two options?

658
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,407
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

659
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,744
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

660
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:51,668
What?

661
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,880
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about

662
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:59,759
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

663
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,594
serving my country.

664
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,429
I finally got everything I wanted

665
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,018
and I'm wearing tights.

666
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,112
They look like they've been through hell.

667
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,155
These men more than most.

668
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:29,956
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

669
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,958
and less than 50 returned.

670
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,295
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

671
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,047
The rest were killed or captured.

672
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,842
The 107th?

673
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:41,925
What?

674
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,719
Come on.

675
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,762
Colonel Phillips.

676
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,724
Well, if it isn't
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

677
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,099
What's your plan today?

678
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,393
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

679
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:51,811
You don't get to give me orders, son.

680
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,063
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

681
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:58,150
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

682
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,362
- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.

683
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:11,873
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

684
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,291
But the name does sound familiar.

685
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:15,918
I'm sorry.

686
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,550
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

687
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,177
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

688
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,221
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

689
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,056
They're 30 miles behind the lines

690
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,934
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

691
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,518
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

692
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,313
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

693
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,983
I think I understand just fine.

694
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,152
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

695
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,699
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

696
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,206
Yes, sir. I do.

697
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:03,298
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

698
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,387
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

699
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,889
If that's what it takes.

700
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,099
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

701
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,141
You don't know that.

702
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,228
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

703
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:18,146
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

704
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,273
Steve!

705
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,867
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

706
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,869
Every word.

707
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,581
Then you got to let me go.

708
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:41,003
I can do more than that.

709
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,382
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

710
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,135
Where's my helmet?

711
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,635
Anyone seen Rogers?

712
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,516
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,

713
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,643
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

714
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,811
It's a factory of some kind.

715
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,148
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

716
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,940
Just get me as close as you can.

717
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,693
You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

718
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,777
And you won't?

719
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:07,362
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

720
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,072
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

721
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,159
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

722
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,284
Agent Carter?

723
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,702
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

724
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:17,331
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

725
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,422
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

726
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,134
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

727
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,679
So, are you two... Do you...

728
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,266
...fondue?

729
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,643
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

730
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,146
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

731
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,108
Are you sure this thing works?

732
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:46,485
It's been tested more than you, pal.

733
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,159
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

734
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,956
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

735
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,166
You can't give me orders!

736
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,128
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

737
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:26,775
As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,

738
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,195
even with components of this size.

739
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,197
Increase the output by 60%

740
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,159
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

741
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:40,998
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

742
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,335
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

743
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,672
There are always more workers.

744
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:50,842
Not now!

745
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,025
You know, Fritz,

746
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,362
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

747
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,605
Fellas.

748
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:48,518
Who are you supposed to be?

749
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,148
I'm Captain America.

750
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,858
I beg your pardon?

751
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,072
What, are we taking everybody?

752
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,032
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

753
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:04,952
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

754
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,246
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

755
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,456
All right.

756
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,583
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

757
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,878
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

758
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,670
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

759
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,340
Wait. You know what you're doing?

760
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,260
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

761
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,036
You know how to use that thing?

762
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Okay.

763
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,795
What is happening?

764
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:07,097
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

765
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:10,518
- That one. "ZÃ¼ndung."
- ZÃ¼ndung?

766
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,394
Get this thing going, Dugan!

767
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,853
I didn't know you spoke German.

768
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:17,148
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

769
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,233
Didn't ask for the resume.

770
01:02:30,996 --> 01:02:32,373
- On your left!
- Up top!

771
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,309
No, no! What are you doing?

772
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,355
Our forces are outmatched.

773
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,715
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

774
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:06,342
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

775
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,427
Bucky?

776
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,512
Oh, my God.

777
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,101
- Is that...
- It's me.

778
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,188
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

779
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:20,731
- Come on.
- Steve.

780
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,027
I thought you were dead.

781
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,322
I thought you were smaller.

782
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,289
Come on.

783
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,545
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

784
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,969
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

785
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,721
Is this permanent?

786
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,972
So far.

787
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,670
Captain America!

788
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,547
How exciting!

789
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:31,050
I am a great fan of your films!

790
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:36,724
So, Dr Erskine managed it after all.

791
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:38,891
Not exactly an improvement,

792
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:42,313
but still, impressive.

793
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:46,567
You've got no idea.

794
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:50,737
Haven't I?

795
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:09,422
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

796
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:12,885
you see, I was his greatest success!

797
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,192
You don't have one of those, do you?

798
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,777
You are deluded, Captain.

799
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,114
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

800
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,617
but in reality, you are just afraid

801
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:40,371
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

802
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,875
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

803
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,126
Without fear!

804
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,711
Then how come you're running?

805
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,851
Come on, let's go. Up.

806
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,148
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

807
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,985
What about me?

808
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,030
Where will I sit?

809
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:17,365
Not a scratch, Doctor.

810
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,992
Not a scratch.

811
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:54,235
Let's go. One at a time.

812
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,893
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

813
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,351
No! Not without you!

814
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,604
Hell.

815
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:54,128
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that.

816
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:59,009
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

817
01:08:59,092 --> 01:09:01,261
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

818
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:05,349
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers

819
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,351
killed in action. Period.

820
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,106
The last surveillance flight is back.

821
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,529
No sign of activity.

822
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,073
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

823
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:25,868
I can't touch Stark.

824
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,788
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

825
01:09:28,872 --> 01:09:30,373
You are neither one.

826
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,960
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

827
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,711
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

828
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,631
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

829
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,507
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

830
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:43,177
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

831
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,262
'cause you had a crush.

832
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,722
It wasn't that. I had faith.

833
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:51,811
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

834
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:55,649
What the hell's going on out there?

835
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,359
Look who it is!

836
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:09,640
Some of these men
need medical attention.

837
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,641
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

838
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,353
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

839
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,396
That won't be necessary.

840
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:22,527
Yes, sir.

841
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,529
Faith, huh?

842
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,537
You're late.

843
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,086
Couldn't call my ride.

844
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,838
Hey!

845
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,757
Let's hear it for Captain America!

846
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:05,069
I am honoured
to present this medal for valour

847
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,823
to my personal friend, Captain America!

848
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,078
Captain America!

849
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,664
Captain, that's your cue!

850
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,253
I thought he'd be taller.

851
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,560
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

852
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,813
And the sixth one was

853
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:45,318
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

854
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,988
I just got a quick look.

855
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,658
Well, nobody's perfect.

856
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:57,329
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

857
01:12:57,789 --> 01:12:59,623
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

858
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,252
all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.

859
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,003
Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6.

860
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,756
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

861
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,882
What about us?

862
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,761
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

863
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,845
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

864
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,557
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

865
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:19,019
We're already putting together
the best men.

866
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:22,189
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

867
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,899
So, let's get this straight.

868
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,027
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

869
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:29,988
Pretty much.

870
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:32,407
Sounds rather fun, actually.

871
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,077
I'm in.

872
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,048
We're in.

873
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,261
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

874
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:54,345
What's that?

875
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,556
Open a tab.

876
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,895
Well, that was easy.

877
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,689
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

878
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,904
See? I told you.

879
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,533
They're all idiots.

880
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,408
How about you?

881
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,247
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

882
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,664
Hell, no.

883
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:26,252
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

884
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,088
I'm following him.

885
01:14:32,592 --> 01:14:34,010
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

886
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,389
You know what?

887
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,725
It's kind of growing on me.

888
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:53,279
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

889
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:56,992
Ma'am.

890
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:00,036
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

891
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,453
Sounds good.

892
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:08,878
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

893
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,296
You don't like music?

894
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,756
I do, actually.

895
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:17,052
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

896
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:18,721
Then what are we waiting for?

897
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,224
The right partner.

898
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,643
0800, Captain.

899
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,146
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

900
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,064
I'm invisible.

901
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,652
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

902
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,323
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

903
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,659
Emission signature is unusual.

904
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,162
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

905
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,000
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

906
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:50,002
Seems harmless enough.

907
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,256
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

908
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,100
Write that down.

909
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,729
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr Stark.

910
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,940
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

911
01:16:15,695 --> 01:16:18,530
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

912
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,122
I read about what you did.

913
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,292
Oh, the... Yeah.

914
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:31,627
Well, that's, you know.

915
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,672
Just doing what needed to be done.

916
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:37,841
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

917
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,141
Really, it's not a big deal.

918
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,186
Tell that to their wives.

919
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,149
I don't think they were all married.

920
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,902
You're a hero.

921
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,488
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

922
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:01,908
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

923
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,037
And seeing as they're not here...

924
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,713
Captain!

925
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,466
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

926
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,051
Agent Carter, wait.

927
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,470
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

928
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,180
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

929
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:27,891
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

930
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:31,854
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

931
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,189
Well, what about you and Stark?

932
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,774
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

933
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:43,033
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

934
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,618
Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.

935
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:49,497
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

936
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,623
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

937
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:54,085
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

938
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,837
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

939
01:17:56,921 --> 01:17:59,798
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

940
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:01,760
Carbon polymer.

941
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,804
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

942
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:08,390
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

943
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:11,478
I hear you're kind of attached.

944
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:12,979
It's handier than you might think.

945
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:15,230
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

946
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:16,940
This one's fun.

947
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,319
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

948
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,988
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

949
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:24,239
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

950
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,952
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

951
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:31,413
It's completely vibration absorbent.

952
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:34,958
How come it's not standard issue?

953
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,377
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

954
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,171
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

955
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,465
You quite finished, Mr Stark?

956
01:18:40,548 --> 01:18:42,384
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

957
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,426
What do you think?

958
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,271
Yes, I think it works.

959
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:07,699
I had some ideas about the uniform.

960
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:08,993
Whatever you want, pal.

961
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:16,496
You are failing!

962
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:20,667
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

963
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,710
yet we are continually delayed

964
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,462
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

965
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,548
This is hardly my area of expertise.

966
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:31,344
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

967
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:35,931
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

968
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:37,684
Sir!

969
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,020
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

970
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,399
We fought to the last man.

971
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,654
Evidently not.

972
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,086
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

973
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,837
Yeah, and I threw up?

974
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:09,591
This isn't payback, is it?

975
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,426
Now why would I do that?

976
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,261
We were right. Dr Zola's on the train.

977
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:17,931
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

978
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,934
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

979
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,402
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

980
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,738
We only got about a 10-second window.

981
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,407
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

982
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:35,992
Mind the gap.

983
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,993
Better get moving, bugs!

984
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,939
Stop him! Fire again!

985
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,118
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

986
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:44,828
Get down!

987
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:48,373
Fire again!

988
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,667
Kill him! Now!

989
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:58,926
Bucky!

990
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,474
Hang on!

991
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,185
Grab my hand!

992
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,085
Sit down.

993
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,844
- What is this?
- Steak.

994
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:24,929
What is in it?

995
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,347
Cow.

996
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:33,436
Doctor, do you realise how difficult it is

997
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,356
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

998
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:39,193
I don't eat meat.

999
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,237
Why not?

1000
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,029
It disagrees with me.

1001
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:46,033
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1002
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:52,122
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1003
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:57,043
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1004
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,881
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1005
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,467
You want to live.

1006
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,971
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1007
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,181
I bought you dinner.

1008
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:18,481
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1009
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,819
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1010
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,114
"Dr Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1011
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:30,202
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1012
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:34,497
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1013
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,583
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1014
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:40,253
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1015
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:42,672
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1016
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:48,136
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1017
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:51,181
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1018
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,601
It's you or Schmidt.

1019
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:57,270
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1020
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,984
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1021
01:28:04,695 --> 01:28:07,489
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1022
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:09,783
You do realise that's nuts, don't you?

1023
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:10,868
What?

1024
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:14,121
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1025
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,373
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1026
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,376
What's his target?

1027
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,003
His target

1028
01:28:23,547 --> 01:28:24,631
is everywhere.

1029
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:47,070
Tomorrow,

1030
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:51,158
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1031
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:54,412
borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.

1032
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:59,457
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1033
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:05,088
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1034
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:11,929
If they cut off one head,

1035
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,265
two more shall take its place.

1036
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,934
Hail Hydra.

1037
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,185
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1038
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,521
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1039
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,287
Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.

1040
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,622
Please wait for the all-clear.

1041
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:43,961
Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.

1042
01:29:44,628 --> 01:29:47,756
Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.

1043
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,725
Dr Erskine said that

1044
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,560
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1045
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,729
it would affect my cells.

1046
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:07,568
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1047
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,319
Which means

1048
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,239
I can't get drunk.

1049
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,327
Did you know that?

1050
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:20,997
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1051
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:25,377
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1052
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:32,342
It wasn't your fault.

1053
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,179
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1054
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:37,640
Then you know that's not true.

1055
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,516
You did everything you could.

1056
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:45,021
Did you believe in your friend?

1057
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,606
Did you respect him?

1058
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,152
Then stop blaming yourself.

1059
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,863
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1060
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:54,698
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1061
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,868
I'm going after Schmidt.

1062
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:03,832
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1063
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,377
You won't be alone.

1064
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,175
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1065
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,219
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1066
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:16,886
starting with the USA.

1067
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:20,099
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1068
01:31:20,182 --> 01:31:21,934
He gets across the Atlantic,

1069
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,435
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1070
01:31:28,899 --> 01:31:30,484
How much time we got?

1071
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,862
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1072
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,948
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1073
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:40,243
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1074
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,663
So what are we supposed to do?

1075
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:46,332
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1076
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,293
Why not?

1077
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:55,592
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1078
01:34:01,176 --> 01:34:05,305
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1079
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,515
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1080
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:13,063
But there are limits

1081
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,733
to what even you can do, Captain.

1082
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:19,444
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1083
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:20,988
He told me you were insane.

1084
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,661
He resented my genius

1085
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:31,332
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1086
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,042
But he gave you everything.

1087
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,712
So,

1088
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:41,091
what made you so special?

1089
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:45,429
Nothing.

1090
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,140
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1091
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,235
I can do this all day.

1092
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,363
Of course you can, of course.

1093
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:06,783
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1094
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:13,832
So am I.

1095
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,971
Rogers! You might need this!

1096
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,390
Thanks!

1097
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:44,154
We're in! Assault team, go!

1098
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:45,655
Move out!

1099
01:35:46,573 --> 01:35:48,324
Move!

1100
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,291
Keep your spacing!

1101
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:38,041
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1102
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,252
Let's go find two more!

1103
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:08,947
You're late.

1104
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:13,952
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1105
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:29,653
Get in!

1106
01:38:58,307 --> 01:38:59,640
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1107
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,398
Go get him.

1108
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,027
I'm not kissing you!

1109
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:52,666
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

1110
01:44:01,484 --> 01:44:04,112
You could have the power of the gods!

1111
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:09,451
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1112
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:12,494
I have seen the future, Captain!

1113
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:16,498
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

1114
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:31,389
What have you done?

1115
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:33,350
No!

1116
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:43,712
Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?

1117
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:45,130
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1118
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:46,631
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1119
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,257
Peggy, Schmidt's dead!

1120
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,467
What about the plane?

1121
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:53,805
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1122
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,640
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1123
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,060
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1124
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,895
But I can try and force it down.

1125
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,981
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1126
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:05,065
There's not enough time.

1127
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,777
This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.

1128
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:14,158
I got to put her in the water.

1129
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,328
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1130
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:18,747
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1131
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,291
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1132
01:46:26,796 --> 01:46:28,006
Peggy,

1133
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,091
this is my choice.

1134
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:56,493
Peggy?

1135
01:46:57,328 --> 01:46:58,661
I'm here.

1136
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:04,333
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1137
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,676
All right.

1138
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,056
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1139
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:21,850
You got it.

1140
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:27,731
8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?

1141
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:32,194
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.

1142
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:41,371
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1143
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,373
We'll have the band
play something slow.

1144
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,046
I'd hate to step on your...

1145
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,649
Steve?

1146
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:02,952
To the Captain.

1147
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:16,131
Sir?

1148
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,228
Take us to the next grid point.

1149
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:30,563
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1150
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:33,899
And the energy signature stops here.

1151
01:49:34,984 --> 01:49:36,735
Just keep looking.

1152
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:48,432
Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.

1153
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,894
So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.

1154
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:55,148
And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,

1155
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:58,109
this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.

1156
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:02,738
Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.

1157
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:06,743
The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.

1158
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,912
But the Dodgers have three men on.

1159
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,252
Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.

1160
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:20,506
Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favour?

1161
01:51:20,923 --> 01:51:23,091
Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.

1162
01:51:23,426 --> 01:51:26,511
Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.

1163
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:29,765
Three runs will score.

1164
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,603
Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.

1165
01:51:34,604 --> 01:51:36,939
Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.

1166
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:39,359
Good morning.

1167
01:51:41,362 --> 01:51:43,112
Or should I say afternoon?

1168
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:45,280
Where am I?

1169
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,076
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1170
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,456
The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!

1171
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,625
Everyone is on their feet.

1172
01:51:55,958 --> 01:51:59,295
What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.

1173
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,630
Where am I really?

1174
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:03,966
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1175
01:52:04,717 --> 01:52:06,051
The game.

1176
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,137
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1177
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,144
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1178
01:52:15,645 --> 01:52:16,645
Where am I?

1179
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:19,314
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1180
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:28,615
Captain Rogers, wait!

1181
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:32,161
All agents, code 13!

1182
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:35,497
I repeat. All agents, code 13!

1183
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:57,686
At ease, soldier!

1184
01:53:06,195 --> 01:53:09,157
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1185
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:13,453
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1186
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:14,953
Break what?

1187
01:53:17,373 --> 01:53:19,041
You've been asleep, Cap.

1188
01:53:19,501 --> 01:53:21,543
For almost 70 years.

1189
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:37,393
You gonna be okay?

1190
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:39,561
Yeah.

1191
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:41,229
Yeah, I just...

1192
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,027
I had a date.

1193
02:03:07,796 --> 02:03:09,465
Trouble sleeping?

1194
02:03:12,301 --> 02:03:13,635
You're here with a mission, sir?

1195
02:03:14,595 --> 02:03:15,636
I am.

1196
02:03:16,305 --> 02:03:18,140
Trying to get me back in the world?

1197
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:20,641
Trying to save it.

1198
02:03:29,652 --> 02:03:31,487
You think you're the only hero
in the world?

1199
02:03:45,667 --> 02:03:46,835
Gentlemen?

1200
02:03:47,628 --> 02:03:48,712
You're up.

1201
02:03:54,676 --> 02:03:55,676
Got a mean swing.
