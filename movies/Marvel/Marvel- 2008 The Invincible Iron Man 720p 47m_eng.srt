1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,408
<i>Well, it was a funny thing.
I think I gave myself a dare.</i>

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,524
It was the height of the Cold War.

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,841
The readers, the young readers,

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,249
if there was one thing they hated,
it was war, it was the military.

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,410
<i>Or as Eisenhower called it,
"the military-industrial complex."</i>

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,883
<i>So I got a hero who represented
that to the hundredth degree.</i>

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,722
<i>He was a weapons manufacturer,
he was providing weapons for the Army,</i>

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,003
<i>he was rich, he was an industrialist.</i>

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,007
<i>But, he was a good-looking guy
and he was courageous.</i>

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,081
<i>He went over to Vietnam by himself
to test out one of the weapons</i>

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,006
and then something happened
and that's how he became Iron Man,

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,682
but I thought it would be fun to take

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,122
the kind of character
that nobody would like,

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,328
none of our readers would like,

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,444
and shove him down their throat
and make them like him.

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,447
And because of the fact
that Tony Stark was such a great guy...

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,081
See, I kind of had
Howard Hughes in mind

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,764
when I was thinking of Tony.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,168
Without being crazy,
he was Howard Hughes.

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,486
And he became very popular.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,925
I'll tell you a funny thing about Tony,

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,642
<i>who, as you know, had a...
His heart had been injured</i>

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,003
<i>and he was always afraid
that any moment he could keel over.</i>

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,323
<i>I loved the concept of a guy
in the armoured suit</i>

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,761
<i>and with all the things he could do.</i>

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,128
<i>And I loved the idea we came up with,</i>

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,084
<i>that Iron Man was really</i>

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,848
<i>somebody who was
Tony Stark's bodyguard.</i>

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,285
<i>'Cause he had to justify,</i>

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,045
<i>"What's this guy doing
always hanging around?"</i>

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,804
<i>And I thought that was kind of clever.</i>

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,969
<i>So there was Tony Stark,
there was Iron Man occasionally,</i>

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,327
<i>and, "Oh, he's Tony's bodyguard.
That's okay."</i>

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,768
<i>I love the name Pepper Potts
and Happy Hogan.</i>

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,444
<i>There's this rich man,</i>

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,929
<i>he has this beautiful assistant
or secretary and she's in love with him.</i>

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,763
Now, if I were really an original writer,
I would have had her hate him.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,001
But, what the heck.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,323
<i>Of all the comic books
we published at Marvel,</i>

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,527
<i>we got more fan mail for</i> Iron <i>Man
from women, from females,</i>

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>than any other title.</i>

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,921
<i>For some reason,
females really loved Iron Man</i>

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,048
<i>and I figured out it was because,</i>

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>first of all he was handsome,
secondly, he was rich,</i>

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,482
<i>and thirdly, I think a girl
would want to mother him</i>

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,650
<i>and say, "That's all right. You'll be okay.
Don't worry about your heart.</i>

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,006
<i>"I'll look after you.</i>

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,084
<i>"And hey, if you die,
I inherit all your money."</i>

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,487
<i>No, I only added that. I didn't mean that.</i>

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,801
<i>But I think there was
something about Tony</i>

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,566
that aroused the maternal instinct
in women or something.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,968
But, whatever the reason,
and I never got over that,

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,721
we got more fan mail
for Iron Man from girls.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,962
We didn't get much fan mail from girls,

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,724
but whenever we did, it was usually...

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,451
The letter was usually
addressed to Iron Man.

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,211
<i>The beauty part for me
about</i> Iron <i>Man has always been,</i>

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,807
here you have this character,
who on the outside is invulnerable,

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,646
I mean, just can't be touched,
but inside is a wounded figure.

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,162
<i>Stan made it very much
an in-your-face wound,</i>

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,001
<i>you know, his heart was broken,
you know, literally broken.</i>

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,690
<i>But there's a metaphor going on there</i>

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,889
<i>and that's, I think, what made
that character interesting.</i>

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,691
<i>It was very easy for me
to deal with the armour,</i>

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,444
<i>'cause I didn't have to draw it.</i>

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,245
<i>I felt sorry for the artist,
I'd make up anything.</i>

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,681
<i>"Add this to the armour,
do that to the armour, do that..."</i>

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,804
Then I'd go do something else
and the poor guy had to work on it.

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,885
And I was never satisfied
with Iron Man's armour.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,325
If you look through all the issues
of Iron Man, you will see...

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,842
I must have had his armour changed
a thousand times.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,768
I loved Iron Man. it wasn't
too much to ask of me, drawing him,

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,565
because there was hardly a face there.

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,008
There's just... Not even a nose,

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,170
just a slight hint of a nose
and a mouth and eyes.

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,891
<i>We never even saw
the pupils of the eyes.</i>

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,004
<i>And I loved it
because it was a challenge</i>

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,169
<i>to get to show emotion on his face</i>

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,847
<i>'cause he's wearing a metal helmet.</i>

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,568
<i>The suit is all metal,
so I would bend the...</i>

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,807
<i>The rules a little bit</i>

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,846
<i>by showing, if he was
smiling at something,</i>

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,844
<i>just to tweak the mouth up,</i>

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,568
just enough to convey the message
to the readers that he's smiling.

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,803
Or anger, and then I would
do this, you know,

86
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,565
and then you would see
these lines in here.

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,530
And that would tell them
that he was angry.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,290
The first cover was in pencil

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,483
about the size of a comic book cover.

90
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,082
<i>And it sold right</i> away.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,931
<i>And so I figured,
since it's the first cover,</i>

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,729
<i>and was so popular.</i>

93
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,005
They even made up prints of it,
the company.

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,920
I decided to recreate it myself.

95
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,688
And so I did.
And that's how that came into being.

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,362
That's of course much bigger
than the cover and more interesting.

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,490
In the sense that it's big, it's in colour,
and that's how I did it.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,921
<i>I just copied everything
that I had in front of me,</i>

99
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,611
<i>all the detail, all the little back figures</i>

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,162
<i>and the lettering,
I did the best I could with it.</i>

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,524
<i>And it turned out good.
Well, it's dynamic.</i>

102
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,561
Really dynamic and it moves.

103
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,726
That figure moves and he takes up
a good deal of the cover.

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,282
And of course, the lettering is big,
it's like a burst.

105
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,410
He's coming out of a...
Out of an explosion of some sort,

106
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,922
<i>and these little figures
are just trimmings</i>

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,202
<i>that you can hardly see
unless you get up close.</i>

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,046
<i>It was a joy doing because it was
a smooth thing to do.</i>

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,522
As a kid, I really liked that character,

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,685
precisely because I could imagine
myself in that suit.

111
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,407
<i>It was fun.</i>

112
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,161
<i>When I came onto the</i> Iron <i>Man book,
it had been kind of...</i>

113
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,564
<i>I wouldn't say floundering,
but it had sort of lost its way</i>

114
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,967
<i>for a few years, up to that point.</i>

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,602
It had been a kind of a step-child
for the Marvel Universe.

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,884
But it always still maintained
a certain cachet.

117
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,647
<i>It was also very heavily
influenced by pop culture.</i>

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,849
<i>And, you know,
there was a lot of characters</i>

119
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,524
<i>going around saying they were "heavy."</i>

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,365
<i>"That's heavy, man. Heavy.
Can you dig it?"</i>

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,804
<i>These days it would be, "Whassup?"
You know...</i>

122
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,208
<i>Here's a guy
who's basically a warmonger.</i>

123
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,080
<i>A merchant of death.</i>

124
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,001
<i>Now, when the character was created,
that was not inherently a bad thing,</i>

125
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,526
<i>you know, we're talking about
in the early '60s,</i>

126
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,847
<i>before Vietnam became a disaster,</i>

127
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,766
<i>the idea of, you know,
an arms merchant</i>

128
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,123
<i>was not, by itself, a bad thing.</i>

129
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,321
<i>But, as time goes on and the war
begins to become, you know, an issue,</i>

130
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,161
<i>and something that we
as writers cannot ignore,</i>

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,690
here you have this character
who represents the worst aspects of,

132
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,167
you know,
the military-industrial complex.

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,401
<i>Now, what are you gonna do with that?</i>

134
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,171
<i>You know, you can</i> do...

135
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,810
<i>You can take it in
many different directions,</i>

136
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,721
<i>but one direction
that you might wanna take it,</i>

137
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,250
<i>if you're trying to make a hero,</i>

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,962
<i>is to give him an inner conflict
over the fact that he has this</i>

139
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,401
<i>place in the world.</i>

140
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,483
<i>Well, there are only a handful
of villains that stand out,</i>

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,364
<i>you know, in the Iron Man's
rogue gallery.</i>

142
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,169
<i>- Crimson Dynamo.
- Crimson Dynamo</i>

143
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,562
<i>and the Mandarin,
you know, being, like, the main two.</i>

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,809
<i>And both of them, sort of iconic
Cold War figures,</i>

145
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,089
<i>you know, the Red Star,
I think was another one.</i>

146
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,282
<i>Black Widow, you know, was
I think introduced in “on Man.</i>

147
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,284
So there was this kind of Cold War

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,970
demonology going on, you know,
all the foreigners were bad

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,969
and all the Americans were good.

150
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,646
Well, of all of them I think
that Mandarin, you know,

151
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,368
spoke to me the most, because
he was sort of like the anti-Stark.

152
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,242
Tony is... As the richest person
in the Marvel Universe,

153
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,488
you can almost imagine him
sort of like the linchpin,

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,171
<i>you know, that draws everybody
else together. It was his mansion</i>

155
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,886
<i>where the Avengers did the...</i>

156
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,485
<i>Started the Avengers.</i>

157
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,131
<i>I mean, he's the guy
who started the Avengers, in effect,</i>

158
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,931
<i>by providing them a place to stay,
you know, "Here you are."</i>

159
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,321
<i>The Avengers,</i>

160
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,131
<i>very early on, or reasonably early on,</i>

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,441
particularly when it came to
Cap and Thor,

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,770
these guys learned who was
behind the masks or helmets

163
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,402
<i>and that kind of gave Tony
a circle of peers.</i>

164
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,960
<i>A circle of people that he could
relate to on his own level.</i>

165
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,647
<i>Not necessarily
intellectually or scientifically.</i>

166
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,406
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D.,
I always felt that S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

167
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,563
<i>was a Tony Stark creation
in some sense.</i>

168
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,082
That he's the guy who put it together,
you know, or made it possible.

169
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
He certainly must have
designed the Helicarrier,

170
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,091
and probably sold it to them, you know?

171
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,007
I mean, Stark Industries was the
primary supplier of weapon technology

172
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,282
<i>to the American government,
you know, for many years.</i>

173
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,801
Tony's involvement in S.H.l.E.L.D.
goes right back to the beginning.

174
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,281
You read the very first Nick Fury story,

175
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,641
Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.l.E.L.D. <i>story,</i>
and Tony's there.

176
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,967
<i>Tony's already part of S.H.l.E.L.D.,</i>

177
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,601
<i>he's designed all of their tech and stuff
and all their advanced weapons,</i>

178
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,160
<i>and all through the really early
issues of S.H.l.E.L.D.,</i>

179
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>he kept coming back into the strip,
just as Tony Stark, inventor.</i>

180
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,090
<i>Every once in a while they'd drop
maybe a little allusion to Iron Man,</i>

181
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,685
<i>but if you weren't reading</i> Iron <i>Man</i>

182
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,162
he was <i>just</i> a guy
in Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.l.E.L.D.

183
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,322
George Tuska is one of
the unsung heroes.

184
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,611
<i>Because his work was cartoony,
in a sense,</i>

185
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,642
<i>at a time when realistic art
was in demand in comics,</i>

186
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,366
<i>people didn't take his work as seriously
as they probably ought to.</i>

187
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,403
<i>He could break a story down</i>

188
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,610
<i>as well as any of the best
comic book storytellers.</i>

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,610
<i>And he also drew a very dynamic
Iron Man, you know.</i>

190
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,567
<i>There was a weight and a solidity to his
version of Iron Man that I really liked.</i>

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,006
<i>It was the first monthly title
that I ever did</i>

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,688
<i>and that happened in, I think '77.</i>

193
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,282
<i>I think somebody just
up and left the company.</i>

194
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,082
I was nervous and it was because
my father was working up at the office

195
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,685
and it was a monthly title,

196
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,609
and I hadn't considered
ever doing Iron Man

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,081
when I was up as a young artist.

198
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,241
<i>Thought about Spider-Man
and that type of character, Daredevil.</i>

199
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,249
<i>Never thought about doing Iron Man</i>

200
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,283
<i>and it was a different type
of a character to me,</i>

201
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,847
because I always had
that problem with the logistics,

202
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,129
the armour,
"Oh, my God. It's flexible armour."

203
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,924
<i>I had this close-minded...</i>

204
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,646
<i>"That's impossible. There's gotta be
hinges somewhere, joints."</i>

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,006
<i>It didn't make sense. And</i> I...

206
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,885
<i>You know, you suspend belief
for the character,</i>

207
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,090
<i>and then I began to really enjoy it.</i>

208
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,767
<i>And then it blossomed into
more than what it was</i>

209
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,241
<i>because it became
a melodrama as well as a great visual.</i>

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,091
<i>And then, of course, he had his
personal problems, the demons,</i>

211
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,091
<i>and it became more than the simplistic</i>

212
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,044
<i>armour to save the heart
type of character.</i>

213
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,567
Okay. This is the very first
complete comic I ever did

214
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,321
and I've been told,
over the last 30 years,

215
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,890
that it is the number one book
to line birdcages with.

216
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,927
Because of this great spot right here,

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,526
right below the little perch, right there.

218
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,284
Getting the first one done was probably

219
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,768
as good a feeling as I ever had
in anything, because you...

220
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,571
It's like climbing your first mountain.
You know, hitting your first home run.

221
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,246
<i>I was very young,
just right out of high school, basically.</i>

222
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,968
Probably the youngest guy
in the history of Marvel at the time.

223
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,129
I mean, there have been younger guys
since then. I think I was 19.

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,403
<i>So getting your foot in the door
as a young guy was almost impossible.</i>

225
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,524
I mean, Barry Smith had to like,
break down a ton of barriers.

226
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,722
<i>He's Barry freaking Smith, you know,</i>

227
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,481
<i>one of the greatest artists in the history
of comics, in my opinion,</i>

228
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,802
<i>but even for him it wasn't easy,
and that's where I met David Michelinie.</i>

229
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,251
<i>Dave was always open immediately</i>

230
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,204
<i>for me to be involved
in helping create the stories.</i>

231
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>He appreciated what I had to offer,
even though I was just the lowly inker,</i>

232
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,250
<i>and I started talking to him
about Iron Man, you know, which was...</i>

233
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,448
<i>From the time I was a kid,</i>

234
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,363
<i>this was the character
that I wanted to do.</i>

235
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,881
I have always been a science buff.

236
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,566
So with Iron Man,
it was kind of that way.

237
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,366
I always said that, "if you can
believe the suit works,

238
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,448
"everything else will work."

239
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,769
<i>All you gotta do is make
the suit look believable.</i>

240
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,882
<i>Make it look like it functions.</i>

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,561
<i>And that was really my idea going in,
was make the suit look functional.</i>

242
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,971
<i>Looking at Iron Man and saying,</i>

243
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,203
<i>"Okay, parts of him are organic,
parts of him are not."</i>

244
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,487
<i>So I just started inking him that way.</i>

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,250
<i>In terms of approaching</i> Iron Man,

246
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,051
<i>it was always just
making it believable to me.</i>

247
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,360
<i>I mean, people talk about</i>

248
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,687
<i>that whole Doctor Doom story,
the first Camelot thing.</i>

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,685
<i>I had always argued that Doctor Doom
should have been the Iron Man villain.</i>

250
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,810
<i>Not the Fantastic...
I know he belongs to the Fantastic Four,</i>

251
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,129
<i>but if there ever was a character
who was the antithesis of Tony Stark,</i>

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,406
<i>it was Doctor Doom.</i>

253
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,569
<i>They were the same guy
on two sides of the coin.</i>

254
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,521
<i>I mean, both monarchs,
both highly, highly educated,</i>

255
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,247
<i>you know, both very sophisticated guys.</i>

256
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,250
<i>Never were there two characters
meant to fight each other</i>

257
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,842
<i>in the history of comic books than
Doctor Doom and Iron Man, you know?</i>

258
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,083
<i>And the fact that they maintained
a mutual respect for each other,</i>

259
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,367
<i>even though they hated
what the other person stood for.</i>

260
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,280
<i>What makes Tony Stark different than
everyone else in the Marvel Universe?</i>

261
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,126
<i>And it's the world that he lives in,
that he operates in.</i>

262
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,205
<i>The corporate structure,
the world of high finance,</i>

263
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,922
<i>the world of industrial exploration.</i>

264
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,407
<i>I mean, the fact that he was a scientist
who made money off what he did.</i>

265
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,208
<i>And that's really all we tried
to do with that</i>

266
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,884
<i>was we put characters around Tony.</i>

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,123
<i>Each one of them served a purpose,
served a different side of Tony.</i>

268
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,208
We'll drop in Jim Rhodes, he's the pilot.

269
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,607
And then we'll start
delving into his back story

270
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,485
<i>and he was the guy
that Tony met when he was,</i>

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,530
<i>you know, in Southeast Asia
having just become Iron Man</i>

272
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,965
<i>who helped him get back to the States.</i>

273
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,806
You know, Rhodey was that confidant,
the guy that he could trust with his life.

274
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,242
<i>You know, the guy that had his back
all the time, you know,</i>

275
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,400
<i>and Beth was obviously the person
who took care of him emotionally.</i>

276
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,005
<i>Here's Tony Stark's day.</i>

277
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,289
<i>He comes in, Mrs Arbogast
hands him a piece of paper,</i>

278
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,443
<i>he signs it, a factory
goes up in New Jersey.</i>

279
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,289
<i>She comes in, hands him
a piece of paper, he signs it,</i>

280
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,488
<i>a satellite gets built.</i>

281
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,006
<i>Another piece of paper, signs it,
they close a factory in Guatemala.</i>

282
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,726
<i>You know, 10,000 people out of jobs.</i>

283
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,162
<i>He designs something,</i>

284
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,329
<i>he goes to his drawing board,
designs something,</i>

285
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,722
<i>it's sent down to the technical crew,
whatever, to the technicians,</i>

286
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,643
<i>they build it,
they do all that kind of stuff,</i>

287
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,728
<i>sales and manufacturing go to it,</i>

288
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,888
<i>he never sees the damn thing
until it's in orbit.</i>

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,411
<i>Who could really live that way?</i>

290
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,211
<i>It's a different set of problems,
a different track, a different...</i>

291
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,964
<i>Things like that.</i>

292
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,570
<i>That was one of the things
that I thought about with Iron Man.</i>

293
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,047
<i>This is the only character
I think you could really do that with,</i>

294
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,851
<i>where you'd start thinking about</i>

295
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,170
<i>alterations in the design
to fit specific needs and tasks.</i>

296
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,926
<i>I believe the stealth armour was the
first, but, you know, we had...</i>

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,844
<i>Dave and I had already discussed
several different options,</i>

298
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,564
<i>the space armour
and the undersea armour</i>

299
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,721
<i>and so forth and so on.</i>

300
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,445
<i>I'm gonna quote Dave Michelinie here,</i>

301
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,526
<i>that it was never our intention
to do anything relevant.</i>

302
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,929
<i>We were paid to, basically, do
the next episode of</i> Iron <i>Man.</i>

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,643
<i>Just that particular issue,
alcoholism was the bad guy.</i>

304
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,009
<i>Instead of Doctor Doom or
somebody like that, it was the bottle.</i>

305
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,043
<i>That was our villain of the month.</i>

306
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,650
<i>And that's really the way we treated it.</i>

307
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,570
<i>We built everything up to that,
but the point of it is, it was never...</i>

308
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,324
<i>We never attempted to be relevant.</i>

309
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,410
<i>It just... In the corporate world,
what gets to guys?</i>

310
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
<i>What causes the downfall?</i>

311
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,208
<i>Usually, it's greed, or
it's sex and drugs. Right?</i>

312
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,480
<i>Well, we couldn't do the sex part.</i>

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,321
<i>Right?</i>

314
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,129
<i>Alcohol wasn't talked
about all that much,</i>

315
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,005
<i>really, to be honest with you,
especially with kids,</i>

316
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,600
<i>you know, in that particular era.</i>

317
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,691
<i>But, you know, we treated it
as we intended to, as the bad guy.</i>

318
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,450
When we set out doing
that Extremis story

319
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,887
we weren't even certain that it would
be a permanent thing

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,925
<i>because on one level, it seems like
it flies in the face of the concept.</i>

321
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,726
<i>I have certainly heard from
some real hard-core</i> Iron <i>Man fans</i>

322
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,601
<i>of days gone by that,
no, this isn't Iron Man,</i>

323
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,007
<i>because Iron Man's whole point is
he's got a suit of armour,</i>

324
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,044
<i>he shouldn't have powers
built into himself.</i>

325
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,686
<i>But I think, you know,
two things that had gone forward is,</i>

326
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,885
<i>one, Warren Ellis is
a fantastically talented writer,</i>

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,322
<i>and two, Warren is Tony Stark.</i>

328
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,770
<i>Warren is so far ahead of the curve
in terms of reading up on the science,</i>

329
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,169
he's so fascinated by the technology
and the way it's gonna change a society

330
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,409
and the way it's gonna impact
on us individually, that he just...

331
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,488
He just got down to the core of it.

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,244
<i>Tony Stark as sort</i> of...

333
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,251
<i>I think the term that Warren was sort of
tossing around at the time was,</i>

334
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,089
<i>he's sort of like
the test pilot of the future.</i>

335
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,682
<i>He's there, he's the first guy there,
and he's gonna go out</i>

336
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,202
<i>and investigate all the possibilities
and see what all this stuff does</i>

337
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,248
<i>and how it affects him
and how it could affect the world</i>

338
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,770
<i>and thus in doing so, sort of,
beta-tested for everybody else.</i>

339
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,489
<i>Beyond that, it was beautifully,
digitally painted or painted by Adi,</i>

340
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,689
<i>so it had a really sophisticated,
sleek, modern look.</i>

341
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,809
<i>It was pretty successful
and it got people interested again</i>

342
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,445
<i>and the characters
started to pop a little bit</i>

343
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,166
<i>and then consequently
we went on and did</i> Civil <i>War</i>

344
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,245
<i>and did all the stuff
that came after that and right now...</i>

345
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,445
<i>You know, the movie notwithstanding,
Iron Man is really</i>

346
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,325
<i>poised in a position within the Marvel
line and within the Marvel Universe,</i>

347
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,920
<i>where he's like the most important
character there is.</i>

348
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,566
<i>He's the hub around
which everything circles,</i>

349
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,729
<i>and it all kind of stems,
stepping-stone wise,</i>

350
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,446
<i>from the work that Warren and Adi did.</i>

351
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,242
So what happened was Joe Quesada,
the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics,

352
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,129
got talking to me in email
one evening about Iron Man,

353
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,883
which was a character they were
putting new creative teams on

354
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,688
once every year or two
and it was never quite working for Joe.

355
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,768
<i>This is a character who is
a test pilot for the future,</i>

356
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,688
<i>as his own redemption,</i>

357
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,730
<i>which is really the thrust behind
the Extremis graphic novel.</i>

358
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,531
<i>And Joe responded to that take
and said, "Well, off you go, then."</i>

359
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,241
He was an arms dealer.
There's no two ways around it.

360
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,805
<i>While that is what built his fortune,</i>

361
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,400
<i>therefore allowing him
to be a technologist,</i>

362
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,923
<i>he wasn't actually being that
at the genesis of the character.</i>

363
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,566
<i>He was just a man who made bombs.</i>

364
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,691
<i>And he's running away from that.</i>

365
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,041
<i>The only way he can look himself
in the mirror,</i>

366
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,885
<i>as far as I'm concerned,
is to be Iron Man,</i>

367
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,407
<i>is to be that figure of futurism.</i>

368
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,808
<i>After I agreed to take a shot
at Iron Man for Joe</i>

369
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,526
<i>and develop a new take,</i>

370
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,285
<i>the next thing was finding the artist.</i>

371
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,286
<i>And Joe, being Joe, already had
an artist in mind, it was Adi Granov.</i>

372
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,440
<i>A comics artist has a lot of
very strange jobs.</i>

373
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,650
<i>They're certainly the director,
to a large extent.</i>

374
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,047
<i>Cinematography is something
that's often shared</i>

375
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,281
<i>between the writer and the artist.</i>

376
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,530
<i>I created a character
called John Pillinger</i>

377
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,281
<i>who is a television journalist,
very much based on John Pilger</i>

378
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,723
<i>because in all those years
of publication,</i>

379
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,243
<i>from what I could find,</i>

380
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,886
<i>Tony Stark had very rarely been
brought up to account by the real world.</i>

381
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,004
<i>So I wanted someone there to lay it out,
both for him and the audience.</i>

382
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,605
<i>"You're an arms dealer,
that doesn't mean</i>

383
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,569
<i>"you just made a couple of bombs."</i>

384
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,967
<i>John Pillinger is there</i>

385
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,523
<i>to remind him</i>

386
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,524
<i>that somewhere in the world right now,</i>

387
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,524
<i>someone is dying because of
something he's made, and</i> he...

388
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,206
<i>They're never gonna
let him run away from it.</i>

389
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,927
<i>I really wanted to try
and ground the character.</i>

390
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,562
<i>It's less a superhero graphic novel
than it is a science fiction novel,</i>

391
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,645
<i>and that, to me, required Tony Stark
to be a real person.</i>

392
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,124
<i>He shouldn't be someone
who can just put on a costume</i>

393
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,244
<i>and fly above his concerns,
or the concerns of the world.</i>

394
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,324
<i>He's a man who</i>

395
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,611
<i>made a moral compromise in his youth.</i>

396
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,361
<i>It was simply easier and faster</i>

397
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,322
<i>to build a fortune by selling arms</i>

398
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,491
<i>than it was to do it
pretty much any other way.</i>

399
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,764
<i>When I wrote Extremis,
I moved the timeline on.</i>

400
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,047
<i>And I have Stark being
struck by shrapnel,</i>

401
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,567
<i>not in Vietnam but in a desert location
that could very well be Afghanistan.</i>

402
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,925
<i>In</i> Iron Man: <i>Extremis,
Tony Stark is probably not yet 30,</i>

403
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,210
<i>and he's a man passionately interested
in bringing on the future,</i>

404
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,210
<i>but he doesn't really know
what that is yet.</i>

405
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,402
<i>He's very scattered in the book.</i>

406
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,171
<i>He's working on 12 things at once,</i>

407
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,931
<i>hoping that one of them will be
the golden key</i>

408
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,888
<i>to unlocking a future
that he can live with.</i>

409
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,322
<i>That's why there are so many of us
interested in futurism.</i>

410
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,647
<i>We don't know
which path is gonna break.</i>

411
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,563
<i>We don't know which one
is going to turn out to be</i>

412
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,841
<i>the way through the woods.</i>

413
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,208
<i>The character Sal in the book</i>

414
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,763
<i>was</i> a <i>mentor to Tony and</i> Maya.

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,568
<i>The thing about Sal in the book</i>

416
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,326
<i>that makes him stand apart
from both Tony and Maya</i>

417
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,771
<i>is that he doesn't have the passion.</i>

418
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,526
<i>I think he never really had the passion,</i>

419
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,362
<i>I think that's what he admired most
in Tony and</i> Maya.

420
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,891
<i>It wasn't a huge wrench for him to just
say, "The hell with it!" to everyone.</i>

421
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,963
<i>He didn't have the passion
and need for redemption that Tony has.</i>

422
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,531
I think the germ of the Extremis process
that I created for the graphic novel

423
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,729
was reading somewhere
a long time ago

424
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,691
<i>that the human brain retains a template</i>

425
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,406
<i>of what the body should look like,</i>

426
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,003
<i>and it refers to that
when repairing wounds.</i>

427
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,881
<i>And it simply struck me that
if that could be hacked,</i>

428
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,606
<i>then you could make the body do
all kinds of interesting things.</i>

429
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,726
<i>To, some years later, a suit that he
could fold up and carry in a briefcase.</i>

430
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,843
<i>To, as you see at the start of
the graphic novel,</i>

431
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,804
<i>something that has to be
shipped in a crate,</i>

432
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,360
<i>or hangs on chains in his garage.</i>

433
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,770
<i>Very much going back to
the tank model,</i>

434
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,484
<i>which made little sense</i>

435
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,088
<i>in terms of the standard process
of technological development,</i>

436
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,450
<i>which is to make things smaller
and more effective at the same time.</i>

437
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,004
<i>So, attacking it from that aspect,</i>

438
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,567
<i>and constantly keeping the title
of the thing in mind,</i>

439
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,006
<i>it seemed to me to only make sense,</i>

440
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,250
if he was wearing the Iron Man suit,
if you like, at all times,

441
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,408
that he became an iron man.

442
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,008
That a large amount of the suit itself

443
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,606
was stored inside his body,

444
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,646
<i>using what you presume is some kind of
nanotechnological process.</i>

445
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,684
<i>So it actually fulfils physical functions</i>

446
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,728
<i>as well as laying their own potential
inside his body.</i>

447
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,771
<i>So, yeah, the Iron Man suit
is mostly contained inside his bones.</i>

448
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,844
<i>With Extremis it was my job
to reboot the character,</i>

449
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,167
<i>to reinvent the character</i>

450
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,483
<i>and present new situations
and conflicts for him,</i>

451
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,011
<i>Which I think the book did.</i>

452
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,325
<i>I think probably the favourite part
in Extremis for me</i>

453
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,004
is in the second issue, when
Mallen walks into the FBI building

454
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,162
<i>and I think that's where I really
hit my stride as a storyteller.</i>

455
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,126
<i>I think that's when I started feeling
comfortable with</i>

456
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,443
<i>just telling or choreographing scenes</i>

457
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,962
<i>and I think the action in it
came out quite good.</i>

458
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,688
<i>The way I approached the design
of the suit, in Extremis particularly, is</i>

459
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,806
<i>I kind of tried to add realism to my art,</i>

460
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,168
<i>so it looks like
something could actually,</i>

461
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,842
<i>you know, with suspension of disbelief,
actually function.</i>

462
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,288
<i>Before our book, the suit was actually
always in a briefcase.</i>

463
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,204
<i>But then we thought,
when we did Extremis,</i>

464
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,326
<i>how can you fit this giant suit
into a briefcase?</i>

465
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,731
<i>It just makes no sense.</i>

466
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,089
<i>So it was outside of a briefcase,
it was actually in a giant crate</i>

467
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,044
<i>that would be shipped
wherever he needed it,</i>

468
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,162
<i>but then when he actually
injects himself,</i>

469
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,608
<i>then he uses this new suit
which is much smaller.</i>

470
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,841
<i>Then I started thinking
about memory metals,</i>

471
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,127
<i>so it can be folded.</i>

472
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,280
<i>This is the kind of stuff
that I really think about.</i>

473
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,122
So, memory metals

474
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,370
so you could fold the suit
and fit it in a suitcase

475
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,125
<i>and then because he had
some kind of power, magnetic powers,</i>

476
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,967
<i>he could actually manoeuvre the suit
around him to actually fit onto him.</i>

477
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,926
Well, basically, first time
Warren Ellis and I met, it was...

478
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,250
I think I was working on whichever issue
came before that,

479
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,084
<i>I think it was issue number three.</i>

480
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,048
<i>And I was telling him how much I like
the original grey Iron Man armour,</i>

481
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,681
<i>'cause it's just a clunky tank
type of a thing,</i>

482
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,041
<i>and a few weeks later I get the script
and he's written that scene into it</i>

483
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,322
<i>because, and this is what he said,</i>

484
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,281
<i>that he wrote it because
I liked that suit so much.</i>

485
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,007
<i>I am an illustrator before anything else,</i>

486
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,122
<i>and I try to come up with
striking images, at least in my opinion,</i>

487
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,883
<i>and I try to compose images
that will tell a story in a certain way.</i>

488
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,365
<i>And when it comes to doing
sequential art, to comic book pages,</i>

489
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,488
<i>I try to serve the story</i>

490
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,641
before creating beautiful images.

491
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,402
But I try to create beautiful images
at the same time, if that makes sense.

492
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,562
Iron Man in <i>Civil</i> War,

493
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,087
and ultimately <i>Civil</i> War is a story about
Captain America and Iron Man,

494
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,282
<i>and to a lesser degree
about Spider-Man</i>

495
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,682
<i>as sort of the third, lower point
on that triangle,</i>

496
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,650
<i>and it was that from the very beginning</i>

497
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,324
<i>as the story started to crystallise</i>

498
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,490
<i>and the basic themes
of freedom versus security</i>

499
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,800
<i>kind of played themselves out.</i>

500
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,244
Those two characters, because they're
so central to the mythos of Marvel

501
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,203
and they're both so central
to the Avengers

502
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,321
and the superhuman community.

503
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,004
<i>This is a character who'll do
whatever needs to be done</i>

504
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,411
<i>and take the weight on himself,</i>

505
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,445
that seemed to be a pretty interesting
place to put him in, in <i>Civil</i> War,

506
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,404
and to some degree a surprising place,

507
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,121
because again, the knee-jerk is
Cap'll be the guy that toes the line

508
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,208
<i>and Iron Man will not.</i>

509
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,170
<i>As the story played out
and as we figured it out,</i>

510
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,248
<i>we got to the end where ultimately</i>

511
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,767
<i>it's gotta be the pro-registration side
that comes out on top.</i>

512
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,564
<i>And somewhere along the line there,</i>

513
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,365
<i>one of us had the notion of,
"Okay, where's that gonna leave us?"</i>

514
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,205
<i>"Let's put Tony
in charge of S.H.l.E.L.D."</i>

515
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,926
<i>That puts him
in another interesting place.</i>

516
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,321
<i>It's like running a company,
but completely different,</i>

517
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,091
because it's
a worldwide peacekeeping force,

518
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,645
it's more military-oriented,

519
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,128
but a lot of the same skills
that he brings to running a company

520
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,480
on an economic level

521
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,251
can be played out
against this larger-scale thing.

522
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,688
<i>Tony became more and more
the centre point, even beyond Cw“ War,</i>

523
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,091
<i>all the stuff we were doing after that,</i>

524
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,049
<i>because he was the guy in charge,</i>

525
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,202
<i>he was the man with the plan
or the guy with the vision,</i>

526
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,769
<i>and the guy that across the course
of doing these things,</i>

527
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,922
<i>putting these plans into place</i>

528
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,844
<i>and running into conﬂict with guys
that were his friends,</i>

529
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,362
<i>did things that he knew were tough.</i>

530
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,205
<i>Tony Stark is
a very difficult character to write,</i>

531
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,202
because he's a lot smarter than any
writer who's ever going to tackle him.

532
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,244
<i>None of us can claim to know
how to create anything technical,</i>

533
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,006
<i>you know, we're totally faking it.</i>

534
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,524
<i>He's also
a much more sophisticated character.</i>

535
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,331
<i>His lifestyle, his background.</i>

536
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,404
<i>I don't know any comic book writers
that are trust-fund babies,</i>

537
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,320
<i>that really know that side of society.</i>

538
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,330
<i>I mean, it's all gotta
come out of our heads.</i>

539
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,362
<i>He's a tough character to write
in that sense.</i>

540
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,450
<i>But it's also a lot of fun.</i>

541
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,801
<i>The Inevitable came out of the relaunch
that Warren Ellis and Adi Granov did,</i>

542
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,968
<i>which was a great relaunch, but they
weren't using any of his villains,</i>

543
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,008
<i>they weren't using
any of his rogues gallery,</i>

544
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,090
and Iron Man has
a great rogues gallery.

545
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,207
And those villains specifically,

546
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,250
if I could've jammed more villains
into that story, I would have,

547
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,886
but three seemed to be the limit.

548
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,242
But I loved those characters.

549
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,722
Iron Man has a very specific
kind of rogues gallery.

550
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,411
<i>They're also technologically based.</i>

551
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,966
<i>Whether it's the Living Laser, from...</i>

552
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,321
<i>Or the Ghost, with his stealth suit,</i>

553
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,368
<i>or Spymaster, who's sort of</i>

554
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,126
<i>the industrial espionage side
of an</i> Iron <i>Man story</i>

555
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,282
<i>that's also very interesting to me.</i>

556
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,610
<i>So I wanted to bring back those
characters for a modern audience.</i>

557
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,521
<i>The way I tell these stories, whenever
I'm doing a, sort of, historical tale,</i>

558
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,486
<i>is, I always, in my mind,
set them in the present.</i>

559
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,723
<i>Write them as though
they're happening right now.</i>

560
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,650
<i>There's a rule of thumb
with comic books.</i>

561
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,888
<i>It doesn't matter when it came out,</i>

562
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,248
<i>whenever you're reading it,
it's happening right now.</i>

563
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,170
<i>That's why comics are written
in the present tense.</i>

564
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,766
<i>Narrative captions are written
in the present tense,</i>

565
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,606
<i>because when you're reading a comic,
the idea is it's happening right now.</i>

566
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,247
<i>So my feeling was</i>

567
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,967
<i>the Mandarin is
Iron Man's quintessential enemy.</i>

568
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,965
<i>His opposite number.</i>

569
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,845
<i>Magic versus mechanical.</i>

570
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,049
<i>Technology versus mysticism.</i>

571
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,805
<i>It's a great opposite number pairing.</i>

572
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,243
<i>But their first encounters</i>

573
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,361
didn't have a lot of mythic power.

574
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,001
They were one in a series of stories
that were being told at the time.

575
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,971
I don't think anyone knew that
the Mandarin would grow into

576
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,850
Iron Man's quintessential foe.

577
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,480
<i>Eric Canete, I've known him for years,</i>

578
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,204
<i>we worked together in comics</i>

579
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,409
a <i>couple of times
when he was first breaking in,</i>

580
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,486
<i>and always loved his work,
but it was so technically precise</i>

581
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,961
<i>and it was kind of
a Jeff Darrow thing going on.</i>

582
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,204
<i>I just thought, "Man, you know,
this guy is made to draw</i> Iron Man."

583
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,562
<i>What I didn't expect,
what he did inject with the work,</i>

584
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,770
<i>is this life, this movement,
that comes from his years in animation.</i>

585
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,686
At the moment, Dan and Charlie Knauf
are writing Iron Man.

586
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,883
Dan was the creator of Carnivale,
the television series,

587
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,890
<i>and does a lot of writing there,
and Charlie is his son,</i>

588
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,721
a <i>young and up-and-coming
screenwriter and comic book writer.</i>

589
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,243
<i>They sort of picked up the baton
from where Warren had left it</i>

590
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,450
<i>and have carried it forward, doing all of
the</i> Civil <i>War connectivity stuff and all</i>

591
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,168
<i>of the</i> Iron Man: Director of S.H.l.E.L.D.
arc, and all of <i>this</i> sort of thing.

592
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,245
<i>The Knaufs really brought in
a very real-world espionage</i>

593
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,249
kind of flavour to Iron Man,
which I think was really fantastic,

594
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,442
and a real-world sort of tech...

595
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,246
You can definitely feel the weight of
the world on Tony Stark

596
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,482
<i>and on the Marvel Universe
within their stories,</i>

597
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,250
<i>so they've just done a great job of it.</i>

598
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,163
<i>They really are writing it
like a TV show.</i>

599
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,010
When I was doing Carnivale, I turned on
some of my staff to graphic novels.

600
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,491
I said, "I want you to read these

601
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,325
"to sort of get a sense of
the type of storytelling."

602
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,928
<i>And after Carnivale ran its course,
we got</i> a <i>call from...</i>

603
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,121
Actually it was a friend of mine
who said,

604
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,009
"Hey, I was talking to a guy,
he's at Marvel,

605
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,731
"they really want you
to do a comic book."

606
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,889
And I talked to them and they said,

607
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,480
"Yeah, you know,
we'd love for you to do it."

608
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,281
<i>it was funny because he...
They offer him this thing</i>

609
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,445
and he calls me up, and I know this
because he calls me up on April 1st,

610
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,364
and, you know, I've been reading
comic books since I was a kid.

611
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,881
And he calls me up on April 1st,
he goes, "Hey, Charlie,

612
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,964
"are you interested in doing
a comic book with me for Marvel?"

613
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,289
And I go, you know,
"Shut the F up, man! This is a joke.

614
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,085
"Why are you
messing with me like this?"

615
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,647
He goes, "No, no..." I know,
this would be typical him, right?

616
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,047
And he goes, "No, no, I am serious,"

617
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,802
and, you know, after I
changed my pants, I called him back

618
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,680
and we sat down and we discussed,
and what was the criteria you said?

619
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,728
"No... I wanna do a character..."

620
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,889
No, no, no, they said, "Do you want
to do one of our characters?"

621
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,566
And I said, "Well, you know,
I'd really like to do

622
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,241
"one of your characters that's not...
That's underperforming.

623
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,011
"I'd really like you to find me a character
that's underperforming,

624
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,487
"and I'd like one that's
a little bit morally ambivalent."

625
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,127
And... "Well, how about...
Which one would you..."

626
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,850
I said, "Well,
my first choice would be Iron Man."

627
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,849
<i>I thought, "Well,
they won't give me Iron Man."</i>

628
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,241
<i>Then they called back, said,
"Yeah, we'd love you to do Iron Man."</i>

629
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,288
<i>And I said, "Well, okay,
if I'm gonna do it,</i>

630
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,051
<i>"I have to do it with my son,</i>

631
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,363
<i>"because I'm so out of touch
with superhero books</i>

632
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,130
"and he knows the idiom inside out."

633
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,723
And I also knew that I had my plate full
with television and film projects.

634
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,848
I knew Charlie was talented.

635
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,804
It was a little bit of a leap,
it was a little scary.

636
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,611
I knew I had the craft to help him
with his scene work

637
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,041
and I knew he knew the ins and outs

638
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,322
and what you can and can't do
with a comic book.

639
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,647
- So he does all the first drafts.
- Yeah.

640
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,845
So he carries the... You know,
he does the heavy lifting,

641
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,163
which is looking at a blank page
and then...

642
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,805
- We break story together.
- Yeah.

643
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,082
We'll break story,
then he'll do the first draft,

644
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,925
then I'll sit down
and we'll sit at the typewriter

645
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,570
and work together.

646
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,449
And when I'm making changes,
he's learning bits and pieces of craft

647
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,609
that I more or less
had to learn by myself.

648
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,886
It was sort of nerve-wracking,

649
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,480
because l thought
"What if he has no talent?"

650
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,524
- Yeah.
- What if he can't do it?

651
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,847
And then how do I deal with that?

652
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,770
And I certainly didn't want to be
sitting there and carrying him.

653
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,090
Now, I had the advantage of having
worked with my father at one time,

654
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,884
in a very different business,

655
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,681
but I understood
the psychological aspects of it.

656
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,001
So I'd tread that minefield before,

657
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,887
so I knew...
I know where there's warning signs.

658
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,801
But, no, he was able to
pick it up right away.

659
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,160
You can't teach talent.

660
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,810
That's the only thing you can't teach.

661
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,048
<i>When we came in,
we just wanted to write a kick-ass book.</i>

662
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,801
<i>We wanted to write a book that works.</i>

663
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,804
<i>But I think when we came in with...
It would be the height of hubris.</i>

664
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,724
<i>I mean, look, Warren Ellis is a master.</i>

665
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,967
<i>I'm not gonna follow Warren Ellis</i> in...

666
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,927
<i>I mean, it's like everything he gave us
in Extremis was</i> a <i>gift.</i>

667
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,451
<i>Execute Program, you could see
the curve as we were moving through it.</i>

668
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,645
<i>Like, the earlier issues, when we got
to the later issues, we were going...</i>

669
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,000
<i>You know?</i>

670
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,770
<i>They said, "Just finish your story,</i>

671
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,730
<i>"you're going to be well into</i> Civil <i>War
by the time you finish."</i>

672
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,366
<i>So we kept track of
what was going on with</i> Civil <i>War,</i>

673
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,081
<i>and we really saw Tony
as being Lincolnesque.</i>

674
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,405
<i>We were... When we looked at
registration as an issue, if it was real,</i>

675
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,681
<i>absolutely!</i>

676
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,730
<i>And really, again, I think the idea is</i>

677
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,127
<i>that we saw him as
almost Abraham Lincoln.</i>

678
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:35,242
<i>That he's behind a cause
that's costing lives, that's unpopular,</i>

679
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,607
<i>that's costing friendships,</i>

680
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,691
<i>but he sticks to his guns.</i>

681
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,122
From what I understand
from talking to artists,

682
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,246
it's difficult to have expressions
with a lot of these superheroes,

683
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,051
<i>especially with iron Man,
he's got this big iron mask on.</i>

684
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,610
<i>Yeah, we always go,
"Go in close to the eye slit."</i>

685
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,048
<i>Yeah, what we really like
about both Patrick and Rob</i>

686
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,726
<i>is that their expressions are so good.</i>

687
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,448
Granted, with Iron Man
we have to get in close,

688
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,010
like he said, get in
close to the iron slit.

689
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,407
<i>Rob had this great scene
in one of our issues</i>

690
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,287
<i>where Maria looks up and she says,
"What's your E.T.A.?"</i>

691
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,926
<i>And he goes, "Right freaking now!"
and flies over Maria,</i>

692
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,604
<i>and he's got this great shot
of her looking up,</i>

693
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,371
<i>and her eyes are,
"What the hell's going on?"</i>

694
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,851
<i>I think that's really important.</i>

695
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,205
What I like about Iron Man and
Tony Stark, what really works for me...

696
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,089
Actually, when I'm drawing Iron Man,

697
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,482
I enjoy drawing the Tony Stark scenes
more than I do the Iron Man ones.

698
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,811
<i>So many of Marvel's characters are
irradiated and become a monster,</i>

699
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,402
<i>or bit by a spider or cosmic rays,</i>

700
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,010
and Iron Man was...

701
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,011
I don't know if you can say you identify
with a guy who's a handsome billionaire

702
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,206
who gets all the ladies,

703
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,602
but he was still a real guy
and he's a self-made superhero.

704
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,082
He's a superhero 'cause he wants to be,
because he...

705
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,004
<i>He's the engineer as a superhero.</i>

706
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,764
<i>He's superhero by design.</i>

707
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,249
<i>That's unique. I love that.</i>

708
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,121
<i>The double-edged sword
of drawing</i> Iron <i>Man was</i>

709
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,807
<i>on the one hand you had these
supporting characters and Tony Stark</i>

710
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,003
<i>who were very emotive and going
through extreme emotional strain,</i>

711
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,647
<i>and on the other hand you had to draw
a guy with a face plate,</i>

712
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,445
<i>whose emotions were hidden
beneath the armour.</i>

713
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,403
<i>I mean, I enjoy
the emotional aspects of it.</i>

714
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,608
<i>With Maya and Sal,</i>

715
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,360
<i>I thought the Knaufs did a wonderful job
with those characters.</i>

716
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,121
<i>Some of my favourite scenes were
what was going on with them.</i>

717
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,642
<i>And I don't know if Daniel
was ever aware of this,</i>

718
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,564
<i>but from some pictures online
I saw of him</i>

719
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,321
<i>I started to base my drawings of Sal
off of how he actually looked.</i>

720
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,169
I mean, I actually think maybe Daniel
might be even more extreme-looking.

721
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,569
I think the picture I saw, he had a beret
and some braids in his beard,

722
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,807
but definitely there was
a Bohemian approach to Sal

723
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,487
that I picked up on
from just what I knew about Dan.

724
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,649
<i>When you're doing
something like Iron Man's armour,</i>

725
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,883
<i>and you have to draw sideways, front,
back, forward,</i>

726
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,764
<i>in comics you draw
every conceivable angle.</i>

727
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,162
<i>Not having that full field of information</i>

728
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,884
<i>by accident will bring about
a style of your own.</i>

729
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
<i>Fortunately there are enough people
out there still</i>

730
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,244
that just love the beauty
of a line approach, you know,

731
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,890
as opposed to photorealism.

732
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,603
<i>Colour-wise, I was really looking
for more of a pastel look</i>

733
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,001
<i>so that the openness and
the simple lines would come out more.</i>

734
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,686
When I was first offered
the assignment,

735
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,849
I was actually out on vacation
with my family

736
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,963
and my editor called on her cell phone

737
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,010
and said,
"How would you like to do Iron Man?"

738
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,210
And right away I want to scream,
"Are you kidding? Yeah, of course."

739
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,965
And she told me that
the Knaufs would be writing it

740
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,765
and that they had done
Carnivale for HBO,

741
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,363
and it just got better and better
as far as I was concerned.

742
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,002
To me great comics
start with great stories.

743
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,327
And these guys, I knew,
were going to write great stories.

744
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,686
<i>When I think about the project,</i>

745
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,883
<i>I remember there was an awful lot
of research about actual places.</i>

746
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,050
<i>If they say "London," they don't just say
"London," it's Piccadilly Circle, it's...</i>

747
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,284
<i>There's a library, a specific library
I had to draw a research scene in.</i>

748
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,964
There are a lot of places like that,
where they used exact locations.

749
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,804
So, are you ready to go?

750
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,370
This is my daughter, Genevieve,
and she wanted to get on this DVD, too,

751
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,245
so she did a drawing of Iron Man.

752
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,122
As you can see,
the Kuberts and the Romitas

753
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,487
have something to look out for, here.

754
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,206
I think it's pretty impressive, myself.

755
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,682
- What do you think?
- I think it's good, too.

756
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,881
Great.

757
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,402
- So, Genevieve, how old are you?
- I'm eight.

758
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,290
And how long did it take you to do this?

759
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,928
You spent a couple of hours on it
last night.

760
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,604
Yeah, a couple of hours, pretty much.

761
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,041
She came in, said,
"I wanna draw something."

762
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,367
I said, "Well, why don't you draw
one of the characters Daddy draws?"

763
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,841
- Then I said, "Yes."
- Yeah, so...

764
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,962
- Do you like Iron Man?
- Yeah, he's cool.

765
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,809
I've just written a serial
called Ultimate Human.

766
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,761
And this is a whole other
kettle of worms entirely,

767
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,363
because it's what they call
the Ultimate version of Tony Stark,

768
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,086
<i>and the idea was that
the Ultimate books</i>

769
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,770
<i>would represent all these old characters
as if they were new once again,</i>

770
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,321
to introduce an entirely new generation
to the properties,

771
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,563
one of whom, of course,
is Tony Stark, Iron Man.

772
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,044
Ultimate <i>Human</i> presents what I refer to
as "Ultimate Iron Man"

773
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,531
<i>and "Ultimate Hulk."</i>

774
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,611
<i>These two characters have been
re-envisioned for this new line of books,</i>

775
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,445
<i>so I found myself
writing Tony Stark again.</i>

776
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,127
<i>The Tony Stark of
the Marvel Ultimate line</i>

777
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,964
<i>is a cheerful drunk</i>

778
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,771
<i>who has a brain tumour
the size of a golf ball, oddly enough,</i>

779
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,407
<i>smells of chemotherapy drugs,</i>

780
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,323
<i>needs a team of at least eight people
to load him into his Iron Man suit.</i>

781
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,642
It's a very different take
on the character.

782
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,721
It wasn't mine, 'cause that Iron Man was
developed by a writer called Mark Millar.

783
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,806
<i>Ultimate Human, as I say, presents
these two characters together.</i>

784
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,363
<i>In that universe, their Bruce Banner,
their Hulk,</i>

785
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:43,530
<i>is someone who became the Hulk after
taking a flawed chemical process</i>

786
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,329
<i>that would make him superhuman,</i>

787
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,803
whereas their Tony Stark

788
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,242
is a full-bore futurist.

789
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,569
This is a man who plans
10 years into the future,

790
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,291
<i>and the Iron Man suit is very much
part of a grander game,</i>

791
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,327
a <i>broader plan than anyone
really knows the extent of.</i>

792
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,448
<i>So they both...</i>

793
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,005
<i>They both come from the intent
of developing superhuman abilities,</i>

794
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,490
<i>and they've both in their own ways
gone horribly wrong.</i>

795
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,051
What is it about Iron Man? He's a
character that can be reinterpreted

796
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,844
<i>for each new generation</i>

797
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,804
<i>in a way that
more iconic characters can't.</i>

798
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,884
I think what makes Tony Stark
so interesting to me

799
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,691
is that I happen to really love
conflicted characters,

800
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,207
I love characters that have,
sort of, a dark edge to them,

801
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,482
<i>that they sort of walk that line,</i>

802
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,566
<i>that if they go a little bit to the left
they may be in the dark, or in the light,</i>

803
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,165
<i>and that really appeals to me.</i>

804
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,205
And the fact that he's just so smart
and so Machiavellian,

805
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,641
not unlike myself, actually.

806
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,049
That really attracts me to the character,

807
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,886
he's not just a cookie-cutter
superhero or hero.

808
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,360
He's a guy with a bit of a past
and a bit of an edge to him.

809
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,324
Iron Man is a very conscious superhero.

810
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,566
His creation was very conscious.

811
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,768
<i>He had to do it, you know?</i>

812
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,451
<i>And it's a conscious choice
to continue to be Iron Man.</i>

813
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,769
<i>I mean, I'm talking about
just the original premise</i>

814
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,127
<i>of he has the heart problem,
he needs to wear the chest plate.</i>

815
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,443
<i>He could've come back
from that captivity</i>

816
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,403
<i>and simply worn the chest piece,
gone on as Tony Stark,</i>

817
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,960
<i>and just gone on with his life.</i>

818
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,882
<i>But he made a conscious choice
to keep going as Iron Man.</i>

819
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,531
He saw some kind of

820
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,645
greater good in continuing on with that.

821
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,286
It wasn't about the armour,
it was about the guy inside.

822
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,204
<i>And that was always
what the stories were about,</i>

823
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,970
<i>the guy inside.</i>
