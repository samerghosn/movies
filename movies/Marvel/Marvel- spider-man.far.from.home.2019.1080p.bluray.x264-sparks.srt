1
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,376
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,710
What, are we fighting
the weather now?

3
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:21,548
Locals say the cyclone
had a face.

4
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,150
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:26,152
That does not mean
that this is the start

6
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,954
to some other
big world-ending...

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,260
Who are you?

8
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,234
You don't want
any part of this.

9
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,445
d And I... d

10
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,418
d Will always love you, ooh d

11
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:07,926
d Will always love you d

12
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,663
d You d

13
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:13,432
d My darling, you... d

14
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,669
d Mm-mm d

15
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,838
d Bittersweet d

16
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,342
d Memories d

17
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,045
d That is all d

18
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,014

20
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,622

21

22
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,031

d I, I will always d

25
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:58,245
d Love you d

26
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,580
Gone,
but not forgotten.

27
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:02,715
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

28
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,084
for their help with that
touching video tribute.

29
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,219
This year has been
nothing short of...

30
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,556
is crazy.
It's, like, insane.

31
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,556
Jason.
What?

32
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:11,890
No swearing.

33
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,893
It's the last day of school.
We're good.

34
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,993
Historic.

35
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,296
Over five years ago,

36
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,498
half of all life
in the universe,

37
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,334
including our own
Midtown High...

38
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,770
was wiped from existence.

39
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:26,338
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

40
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,574
brought us back.

41
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,544
They called it "the Blip."

42
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:34,247
Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...

43
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,215
But our classmates
that didn't Blip

44
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,884
had grown five years older.

45
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,187
Yeah, my little brother
is now older than me.

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,021
Yeah, it's math.

47
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:46,158
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

48
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,260
and had already taken midterms,

49
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,929
the school made us
start the year

50
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,264
over from the beginning.

51
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,900
It's totally unfair.
It's not right.

52
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,534
Tigers...

53
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,370
it's been
a long, dramatic,

54
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,104
somewhat
confusing road.

55
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,640
As we draw this year
to a close,

56
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,643
it's time to move on...

57
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,579
to a new phase
of our lives.

58
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:08,180
Pray nothing crazy
happens again

59
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,282
because are the Avengers
a thing anymore?

60
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,783
Does anyone even have a plan?

61
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,286
I have a plan.

62
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,722
First, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

63
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:18,124
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual headphone adapter

64
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,125
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

65
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,427
Okay.
Three,

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,295
when we go to Venice,
Venice is famous

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,096
for making stuff out of glass.
True.

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,966
I'm gonna buy her
a black dahlia necklace

69
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,939
because her favorite flower
is the black dahlia

70
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,437
because of, well...
The murder.

71
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,404
The murder.
Four, when we go to Paris,

72
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,841
I'm gonna take her
to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

73
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,442
give her the necklace.
Oh.

74
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,577
Then, five,
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

75
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,613
Then, six,
hopefully she tells me

76
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:42,882
she feels
the same way.

77
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,283
Oh, don't forget
step seven.

78
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,418
Step seven?
Don't do any of that.

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,788
Why?

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,656
We're gonna be
bachelors in Europe.

81
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,658
Ned.
Look,

82
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,790
I may not know much,

83
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,060
but I do know this:

84
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:56,928
Europeans love
Americans.

85
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,096
Really?

86
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,466
More than half
are women.

87
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,132
Okay. Sure.

88
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,036
But...I really like MJ,
man, okay?

89
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,773
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

90
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,507
Sometimes I catch her
looking at me,

91
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,975
I feel like
I've stood up...

92
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,810
She's coming.
What up, dorks?

93
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,446
Excited about
the science trip?

94
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,781
Hey, yeah. We're just
talking about the trip.

95
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:16,915
Yeah,
and Peter's plan.

96
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:18,283
You have a plan?

97
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,286
I don't...
I don't have a plan.

98
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,923
He's... He's just gonna
collect tiny spoons

99
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:25,992
when we're traveling
to other countries.

100
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,560
Like a...
Like a grandmother?

101
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,396
I'm not collecting
tiny spoons.

102
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:30,997
He's collecting
tiny spoons.

103
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,665
Oh, okay, well...

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,502
that was a real
roller coaster.

105
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,504
By the way, travel tip:

106
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,738
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

107
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,108
so the government can't
track you while abroad.

108
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,677
Smart... Will do.

109
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,884
Dude, I think
that went really great.

110
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:57,355
When I Blipped back
to my apartment,

111
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,259
the family that was living there
was very confused.

112
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,995
The wife thought
that I was a mistress.

113
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,896
The grandma thought
that I was a ghost.

114
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,233
It was... It was really a mess.

115
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:08,901
Thank you all for coming out

116
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,538
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

117
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,839
And, of course,
thanks to our very own

118
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,374
Spider-Man!

119
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,221
Thank you, Miss Parker,
for having me.

120
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,757
And thank you, you guys,
for having me.

121
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:35,595
And thank you,
Spider-Man.

122
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,598
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos.

123
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,730
Thank you!

124
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,273
That was amazing.
That was great.

125
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,007
That was so cool.
I was so nervous.

126
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,209
I was a little stiff.
I wasn't in the pocket.

127
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,079
No, I thought you did great.
You were a little stiff.

128
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,716
Uh, yeah, I felt that too.
I felt that too.

129
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:57,949
It's fine, fine.
Okay.

130
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,552
Did you get your passport?
Yeah.

131
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,987
Mini toothpaste?
Yeah, I did.

132
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,122
Hey, sorry I'm late.

133
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,324
Happy. Hey.

134
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,494
Oh, you look lovely.

135
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,562
Thanks. You too.
Thank you.

136
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,730
New dress?
Yeah, yes, it is.

137
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,899
It's a new beard.

138
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,067
It's my... My Blip beard.

139
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,802
'Cause I grew it
in the Blip.

140
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,605
It's a Blip beard.

141
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,238
I see. Yeah.

142
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:23,309
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced.

143
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,976
Can you believe it?
It's enormous.

144
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,278
Not the amount,
the size.

145
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,081
The amount's nice too.
They're generous.

146
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,617
Pepper Potts said, sorry
she couldn't be here.

147
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,586
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno

148
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,254
under the vegan lasagna.

149
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,158
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

150
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,959
Will do.

151
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,298
What just happened?

152
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,769
Heads up,
Nick Fury's calling you.

153
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,838
Nick Fury's gonna call me? Why?
Yeah.

154
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,740
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

155
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,908
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

156
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,310
If it was that important,

157
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,312
he'd probably call
someone else, not me.

158
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,149
Apparently not.

159
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,153
No caller ID.
That's him.

160
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,487
I don't wanna
talk to Fury.

161
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,622
Answer the phone.
Why?

162
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,858
If you don't talk to him,

163
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,358
I have to and I don't want to.

164
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,293
Why not?
I'm scared. Answer the phone.

165
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,329
You sent Fury to voicemail?
Yeah.

166
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:19,966
You don't send Fury
to voicemail.

167
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,199
They're calling me.

168
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:23,002
I gotta go.
You gotta talk to him.

169
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:25,872
I'm gonna call him. I promise,
I'm gonna call him. I will.

170
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,839
You do not ghost
Nick Fury.

171
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,675
I promise you, I'll call him.

172
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,477
After my trip.

173
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,745
Hey!

174
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,884
Yeah, hi.
No, no, he's not ghosting you.

175
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,988
Okay, one question at a time.

176
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,822
Are you
the head Avenger?

177
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,256
Are you
the head Avenger now?

178
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,725
Uh, no, I'm not.

179
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,860
If aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

180
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,897
If aliens come back,
what will you do?

181
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,899
Does anyone have
neighborhood questions?

182
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,567
Sean Winford,
Queens Tribune.

183
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,736
What's it like to take over
from Tony Stark?

184
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,105
Those are
big shoes to fill.

185
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,143
I'mma...

186
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,245
I'm gonna go.
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

187
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,553
Okay.

188
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,192
Hungry?

189
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,998
So sorry.

190
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,333
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

191
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,770
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

192
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,907
So, what's up? You can dodge
bullets but not bananas?

193
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,908
No, I just really
need this vacation.

194
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,711
I need a break.

195
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,279
You deserve it. Mm.

196
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,115
Yeah.

197
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,618
You know what?

198
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,754
You should pack your suit,
just in case.

199
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,054
I have a tingle about it.

200
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,926
Please stop saying
"tingle," May.

201
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,995
No.

202
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,037
No. No, I'm not.

203
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,309
Vacation, yeah!

204
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,211
Can you help me
get my stuff up?

205
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,614
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

206
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,150
Give me a tablet.

207
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,820
Do you want first shift
or second?

208
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,187
I could take either.

209
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,288
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

210
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,725
I can't chaperone
kids alone.

211
00:10:58,857 --> 00:10:59,959
Yo, Parker.

212
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,360
This is called
an airplane.

213
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,995
It's like buses
you're used to,

214
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,897
except it flies over
poor neighborhoods

215
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,498
instead of driving
through them.

216
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,134
Ma'am?
Hmm?

217
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,336
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

218
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,172
I'll take that.

219
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,506
She's lying.
I don't even know this girl.

220
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:20,546
Classic MJ, right?

221
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,149
Did you know Brad
was coming?

222
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,152
It... It's so weird.

223
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:28,120
Like, one day,
he's that kid who cried

224
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,721
and got nosebleeds
all the time,

225
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,222
and suddenly, we Blip back,

226
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,292
and he's totally ripped
and super nice

227
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:34,961
and all these girls
are after him.

228
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,528
Not all the girls
are after him.

229
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,364
No, man,
they're all after him.

230
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,099
Yeah.
Here.

231
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,168
Anyway, on to more important
things. It's a nine-hour flight.

232
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,203
We can play Beast Slayers
the whole time.

233
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,273
Are you excited?

234
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,176
I need help
to sit next to MJ.

235
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,845
Seriously?

236
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:53,846
Yes, seriously.

237
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,081
What about our plan?

238
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,749
American bachelors
in Europe.

239
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,584
That's your plan.
That's a solo plan.

240
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,787
Come on, this is my plan.

241
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,222
Please.

242
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,095
Uh, hey, guys.

243
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,096
Uh, there's an old lady

244
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,331
sitting in front of us

245
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,200
wearing a crazy amount
of perfume,

246
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:17,403
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

247
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,772
Um, you know, Betty,
if you could just

248
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,673
switch seats with him,
that would be...

249
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,942
He's allergic
to perfume?

250
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,011
Yeah, yeah,
because, um, it...

251
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,613
It makes his eyes water,

252
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,081
and he can't really...
Peter has a perfume allergy?

253
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,250
Oh, uh...

254
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,250
From experience,

255
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,552
allergies are no joke.

256
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,520
I can feel hives
breaking out already.

257
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,923
MJ, stand up.

258
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,790
Ned, take MJ's spot.

259
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,692
MJ, you take my spot.

260
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,327
Peter,
let's get you out of there.

261
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,263
- Sorry.
- Zach, Sebastian,

262
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,664
you take Ned and Peter's seats.

263
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,168
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

264
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,802
Your safety is my
responsibility.

265
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,004
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

266
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,506
I got it for now.
Let's go, Peter!

267
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,475
Let's go!

268
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,318
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

269
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,825
So did you wanna
play Beast Slayer?

270
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,994
Nope.

271
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,462
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?

272
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,899
No.
Got it. Ahem.

273
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,769
Did I tell you my wife
pretended to Blip out?

274
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,504
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

275
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,073
We had a fake funeral
for her...

276
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,408
Well, the funeral
was real

277
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,110
because I thought
she was dead.

278
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,443
Do you wanna
see the video?

279
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,113
Oh, I got
a dual headphone adapter

280
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,514
if you wanna
watch a movie.

281
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,017
Only if it's depressing.
Or hilarious.

282
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,951
Oh, you have
a dual headphone adapter.

283
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,086
We can watch together.

284
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,620
Good afternoon,

285
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,355
this is your captain speaking.

286
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,457
Our flight time today will
be eight hours,

287
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,559
49 minutes
to Venice, Italy.

288
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,740
Oh! Oh!

289
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,562
Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

290
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,265
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

291
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,033
Dude, don't worry,
okay?

292
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,201
I'm sure
that's nothing.

293
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,202
Hey, babe.

294
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,471
Can you hold this for me?

295
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,273
Yeah, of course.
Thanks.

296
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,182
What was that?

297
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,051
Uh, well,

298
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,552
we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

299
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,121
we have a lot in common.

300
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,756
So, uh, we're boyfriend
and girlfriend now.

301
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,626
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

302
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,397
Peter, those were the words
of a boy.

303
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,932
And that boy met a woman.

304
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,768
A very strong
and powerful woman.

305
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,705
And now,
that boy's a man.

306
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,974
Babe?
Coming, babe.

307
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,081
There's nothing in there.
I swear.

308
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,597
These, no.

309
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,177
Sorry. Sorry.

310
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,446
- I'm here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

311
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,614
- I'm here.
- Thank goodness.

312
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,149
Looks like we're here.

313
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,186
They're doing renovations
to the place.

314
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,821
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

315
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,423
That must be the concierge.
Okay.

316
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,157
Come on, man.

317
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,693
Everyone, here we are.

318
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,929
Whoa!

319
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,397
- Wow!
- Come on in.

320
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,031
This place
is sinking.

321
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,234
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

322
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:18,703
Okay, everybody,
drop your bags off.

323
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,573
We're gonna meet at the
da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

324
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,741
- !Vámanos!
- It's "andiamo."

325
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,042
Andiamo!

326
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,678
When in Rome,
do as Romans do.

327
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,747
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

328
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,755
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

329
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:38,390
I'm here in
St. Marco Polo's...

330
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,059
This is so much fun.
Yeah?

331
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,075
Oh!

332
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:07,885
Three, two, one...
say pizza!

333
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,221
- Pizza!
- Pizza time!

334
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,410
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

335
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,911
Hi. Uh...

336
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm looking for a, uh...

337
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,057
It's perfect.

338
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,670
What?

339
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,971
The most perfect word.

340
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,807
Italians created it,
I discovered it.

341
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,009
What does it mean?
It means a million things.

342
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,844
I don't know.
Get out of my face.

343
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,778
I don't know
and get out of my face.

344
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,548
It's the best thing Italy
created, except for espresso.

345
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,318
Oh, so you've been
drinking espresso?

346
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,188
Hey. German?
American.

347
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,823
A rose for you.

348
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,625
Whoa.

349
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,193
"Boh" is my
new superpower.

350
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,029
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

351
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,298
So, what's in the bag?

352
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,268
Oh, uh...

353
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,302
Nice.

354
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,512
Whoa, cool.

355
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,364
What was that?

356
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,355
Betty! You okay?
Yeah.

357
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,857
Oh, my God!
Come on.

358
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,359
Guys, we gotta go!

359
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,598
What is that?
I don't know.

360
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,534
What'll you do?
My suit's in the hotel.

361
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,067
Why?
I'm on vacation, Ned!

362
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:39,069
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out.

363
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:40,203
Go! Just go!

364
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,682
Get out of here. Go!

365
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,554
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:04,628
Come on.

367
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,875
Oh, no, you don't.

368
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,057
You okay?
Get out of here. Go!

369
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,141
Excuse me, sir!

370
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,876
I... I can help.
Let me help.

371
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,645
I'm really strong,
and I'm sticky.

372
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,914
I need to lead it away
from the canals.

373
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,575
The da Vinci Museum.

374
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,876
This is why
we're here in Venice.

375
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,479
Oh, this is it.

376
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,712
It's closed.

377
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,582
What do you mean?
Till when?

378
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:04,714
November.

379
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,250
You didn't check
the website?

380
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,586
Oh, that's
a good idea.

381
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,969
Oh, come on.

382
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,141
- Stay low, kids.
- We'll be safe here.

383
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,769
Who is that guy?
I don't know,

384
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,436
but he's kicking
that water's ass.

385
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,936
Yeah! Yeah!

386
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,221
It's aliens.
It has to be.

387
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,423
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor,
Morris Bench,

388
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,092
who was exposed
to an experimental

389
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:29,193
underwater generator
and got hydro powers.

390
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:30,761
You should
definitely believe

391
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:32,363
everything
on the Internet.

392
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,865
Spider-Man could take him.
What do you think it is?

393
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,037
You know,
being a man of science...

394
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:41,538
witches.

395
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,508
No, no, no.
We wanna stay.

396
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,242
Good thing
I packed your suit, huh?

397
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,744
I can't believe you forgot it.

398
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:48,179
Yeah.

399
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,748
Who was that guy
you were with?

400
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,016
Was that Mr. Strange?

401
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:53,919
Doctor Strange, May.
Doctor Strange.

402
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,653
And, no, I don't know
who that was.

403
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,021
It was a new guy.

404
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,156
I was trying to help him...
That's my lunch.

405
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:00,391
Don't eat
that one.

406
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,392
Happy's there?

407
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,528
Yeah, it's Happy.

408
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,763
He's here.
He came by to volunteer.

409
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:08,032
And he's hanging
around the office.

410
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,535
And he wants to say hi.
I don't want... Hi, Peter.

411
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,103
Hey, Happy.

412
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,608
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

413
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,944
What are you...?
Glad you're having a good time.

414
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:22,079
Don't worry, I'm taking
care of your aunt.

415
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,551
So how's
the plan going?

416
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,588
There's been setbacks,
for sure.

417
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,092
Trust your instincts,
you'll be fine.

418
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:36,927
I know. Love you.
Bye.

419
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:39,765
Who is that guy?

420
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,666
He's Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

421
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,602
He's all right.
He's no Spider-Man.

422
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,570
What is it with you
and Spider-Man?

423
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,606
What?
He's just awesome, okay?

424
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,044
He protects the neighborhood
and, you know, he's inspiring.

425
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,246
He inspires me
to be a better man.

426
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,648
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

427
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:02,619
Sounds like
his name's Mysterio.

428
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,454
"L'uomo del misterio"

429
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:06,657
is Italian
for "man of mystery."

430
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,226
They don't know
who he is.

431
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,894
Mysterio.

432
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,230
Cool name.

433
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,665
Babe.

434
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,701
So how much of that
did you actually see?

435
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,769
Not much. I was running.

436
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,673
Right. Me too.
I was also running...

437
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,941
away.

438
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,045
So Paris tomorrow.

439
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,780
Go to the Eiffel Tower.
Should be great.

440
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,718
Yeah, I read it was secretly
built as a mind control antenna

441
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,451
to create an army
of the insane.

442
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:35,854
Oh.

443
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,855
It's my favorite

444
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,056
destination on the trip.

445
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:43,729
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

446
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,663
Nothing. It's dead.

447
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,098
Besides, that Mysterio guy's
all over it.

448
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:49,968
Look, I just wanna
spend time with MJ.

449
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,971
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

450
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,305
That's nice.

451
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,507
Reminds me of when
Betty and I fell in love.

452
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,844
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, and...

453
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,853
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

454
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,723
You're Nick Fury.

455
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,291
And you just shot Ned.

456
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,794
It's a mild tranquilizer.

457
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:16,795
He'll be all right.

458
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,931
So good to finally meet you.

459
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,598
I saw you at the funeral,

460
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:24,368
I didn't think that was
a good time to exchange numbers.

461
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,403
No, that would've
been inappropriate.

462
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,538
That's what I just said.
Right.

463
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,009
The important thing is,
you're here.

464
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,410
I tried to bring you here.

465
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:35,380
You avoided me,
and now you're here.

466
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:37,182
What a coincidence.

467
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,416
Wait. Was this
a coincidence?

468
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:42,788
I used to know everything.

469
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,622
Then I come back
five years later,

470
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,557
and now I know nothing.

471
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,359
No intel, no team.

472
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:51,662
And a high school kid

473
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:54,699
is dodging my calls.

474
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,401
Here's what I do know:

475
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:04,241
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

476
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,744
Witnesses say
that cyclone had a face.

477
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:16,086
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

478
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,855
A village was...

479
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,258
Just making the rounds.

480
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,059
See if anyone needs
any counseling

481
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,728
after today's
traumatic events.

482
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,330
No, we'll be okay.
We're fine. Thank you.

483
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:29,901
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...

484
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,301
Oh, he's passed out.

485
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:34,505
I'm not qualified to
do it anyway, so good night.

486
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,276
That was my teacher.
Sorry about that.

487
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,509
You were saying?

488
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,011
A village was
destroyed by what

489
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,948
may well be
another world-threatening...

490
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,348
Babe, you still awake?

491
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,183
You're not answering
any of my texts.

492
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,952
Um, he's asleep, Betty.

493
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,420
Oh, already?

494
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,256
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

495
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:53,124
That's why
it's imperative...

496
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,492
- Hey, boys.
- So that canal water today

497
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,662
was filled
with dangerous bacteria...

498
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,463
Another person
touches that door,

499
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,499
we are going
to attend another funeral.

500
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,134
- Suit up.
- Let me know if

501
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,634
either of you
develop vomiting.

502
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,307
Stark left these for you.

503
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,109
Really?

504
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:27,357
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

505
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,027
Stark said
you wouldn't get that

506
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,528
because it's not
a Star Wars reference.

507
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,834
You can lose the mask.

508
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,702
Everyone here
has seen you without it.

509
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,371
You'd only be
feigning anonymity

510
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,574
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

511
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,680
Come on.

512
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,682
Yeah.

513
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:57,055
Over there,
we have Maria Hill.

514
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,526
That is Dimitri.

515
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,130
And this is Mr. Beck.

516
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,432
Mysterio?

517
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,666
What?

518
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,636
Doesn't matter.
It's what my friends

519
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:13,837
have been calling you.

520
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:17,307
Well, you can
call me Quentin.

521
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,546
You handled yourself well
out there today.

522
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,213
I saw what you did
with the tower.

523
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,282
We could use someone like you
on my world.

524
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,018
Thanks.

525
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,519
I'm sorry. Your world?

526
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,288
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

527
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,856
Just not yours.

528
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,724
There are multiple realities.

529
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:37,929
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

530
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,132
I'm sorry, you're saying
there's a multiverse?

531
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,101
'Cause I thought
that was theoretical.

532
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,211
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

533
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,471
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

534
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,807
How does that even work
with all the quantum...?

535
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:50,941
It's insane.

536
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:56,346
S-sorry. It's really cool.

537
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,018
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

538
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,619
Anyway...

539
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,758
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

540
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,028
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

541
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,630
Air, water, fire, earth.

542
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:15,266
The Science Division had
a technical name.

543
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,434
We just called them
Elementals.

544
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:19,936
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

545
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,806
Turns out,
the myths are real.

546
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,708
Like Thor.

547
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,844
Thor was a myth, now I study him
in my physics class.

548
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,346
These myths are threats.

549
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,116
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

550
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,584
We mobilized
and fought them,

551
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,186
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

552
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,257
I was part of the last battalion
left trying to stop them.

553
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,526
All we did was
delay the inevitable.

554
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,694
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

555
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:46,163
Our satellites
confirm it.

556
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,965
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

557
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,800
There's only one left:
fire.

558
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,171
The strongest
of them all.

559
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,805
The one that destroyed
my Earth.

560
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:58,742
It's the one
that took my family.

561
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,647
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,183
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

563
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,086
We have one mission:
kill it.

564
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,454
And you're coming with us.

565
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,093
I'm sorry,
did you say Prague? Heh.

566
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,194
Mr. Fury,
this all seems like bigtime,

567
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:19,930
you know, huge superhero
kind of stuff.

568
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:23,500
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

569
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,369
Bitch, please.
You've been to space.

570
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:27,003
I know,
but that was an accident.

571
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,140
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

572
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,076
What about Thor?
Off-world.

573
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,877
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

574
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,512
Unavailable.
Captain Marvel.

575
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,013
Don't invoke her name.

576
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,848
Sir, look,
I really wanna help. I do.

577
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:41,719
If my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

578
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:44,322
If I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

579
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:46,523
my class will figure out
who I am, and then...

580
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:48,259
Then the whole world
will figure out

581
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,194
who I am,
then I'm done.

582
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,028
Okay.

583
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,530
I understand.

584
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm sorry, what?

585
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,769
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

586
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,338
and become suspicious.

587
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:02,839
Dimitri.

588
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:05,175
Take him back to the hotel,
please.

589
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,176
Yes.

590
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,246
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

591
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,315
And, uh, good luck.

592
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:13,751
See you, kid.

593
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,552
Yeah, see you.

594
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,389
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

595
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:25,362
Okay, drink lots
of water.

596
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,264
I'm gonna get you
a vitamin C pill.

597
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,235
You cannot get sick, okay?
Okay. Thanks, baby.

598
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,103
Hey, man, are you sure
you're good?

599
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,637
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

600
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,139
Okay. Nice.
Don't worry.

601
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,742
Seriously, getting tranq'd
in the neck by Nick Fury,

602
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,110
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

603
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,478
It is pretty awesome.
Yeah.

604
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,414
I'm happy I don't have
to go to Prague.

605
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:44,715
Seriously.
Good news.

606
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,251
We're going to Prague. Huh?

607
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,818
What?
Prague?

608
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:51,255
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

609
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,490
You should've heard me
on the phone with them.

610
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:54,958
I really gave them hell.

611
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,427
All I heard was
crying.

612
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,927
Look at
our upgraded ride. Huh?

613
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:59,130
Whoa, bro,
you see that?

614
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,398
It's pretty sick.

615
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,367
I'm impressed,
Mr. Harrington.

616
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,034
Oh, come on.

617
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,538
Peter, what...?
What's going on?

618
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,974
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

619
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:14,411
I'm, uh, Mr. Harrington
to the kids...

620
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,146
Oh, all right.
Okay.

621
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,481
Awesome.

622
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,951
Yeah. Awesome.

623
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,010
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

624
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,945
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

625
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,103
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you.

626
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,838
Say EDITH."

627
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:20,010
Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.

628
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:22,179
Retinal and biometric scan
accepted.

629
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,514
- Hello?
- Hello, Peter.

630
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:26,483
I am EDITH, Tony Stark's

631
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,686
augmented-reality
security and defense system.

632
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,489
- So he made you for me?
- No. But you have access

633
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,692
to all of Tony's protocols.
Cool.

634
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,760
Would you like to see
what I can do?

635
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,170
EDITH stands for
"Even dead, I'm the hero."

636
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,737
Tony loved his acronyms.

637
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,375
- Yeah, he did.
- I have access to

638
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,610
the entire
Stark Global Security network,

639
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:54,679
including multiple
defense satellites,

640
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:56,246
as well as back doors

641
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,248
to all major
telecommunication networks.

642
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:00,251
Whoa.

643
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:06,391
Is MJ texting?

644
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,994
No. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

645
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,063
That's wrong. That's wrong.

646
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,050
Petrol and toilets.
Ten minutes!

647
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:35,219
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

648
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,588
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

649
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,289
Ten minutes,
everyone.

650
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,559
Dimitri,
where exactly are we?

651
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,795
Okay.
I'll figure it out.

652
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,097
Oh, my gosh,
it's so sick.

653
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,300
It's beautiful.

654
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,735
What?

655
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,581
Hello.

656
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,949
Close the door.

657
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,789
Um...

658
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,157
I'm Peter Parker.

659
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,125
Take off your clothes.

660
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,762
Excuse me?
You told Fury

661
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:20,230
Spider-Man
cannot be seen in Europe.

662
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,333
So I made you this,
another suit.

663
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:26,336
Oh, uh, thank you.

664
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,572
I'm sure it fits fine.
I don't need to try...

665
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,141
Take off your clothes.
Okay.

666
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:34,143
Sure.

667
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,748
It's a little embarrassing.
Now. Hurry up.

668
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,851
This is weird. Heh.

669
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,320
No, no, no. Don't...

670
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:45,690
Whoa.

671
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,824
Uh...

672
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,860
Sorry. I thought
this was the bathroom.

673
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,461
This is not
what it looks like.

674
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,829
Just...
Yeah.

675
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,864
What are you doing?
I'll leave you alone.

676
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,634
Oh, my God.
Don't shoot anybody.

677
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,735
Brad? It's not what
it looks like, buddy.

678
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,737
Hey, man, look, that's...
Look, Peter,

679
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,007
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

680
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,710
If you want to hook up with
some random European chick,

681
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:07,677
that's on you.
That's not what that was.

682
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,646
I can't pretend
I didn't see what I saw.

683
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,115
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

684
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,284
But I like her too.
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

685
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,320
You cannot show her
that photo, dude.

686
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,188
I'm sorry, man.
I have to.

687
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,490
She deserves the truth.

688
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,059
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

689
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:24,994
and, everybody,
back on the bus.

690
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:27,130
- It's been 10 minutes.
- Let's go!

691
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:34,204
- What's up, Flash Mob?
- It's your boy, Big F...

692
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,972
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter.

693
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:37,974
How can I help you?
Hey. There's this guy

694
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,976
in my class who's gonna
ruin everything...

695
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,311
Peter, I'm having difficulty
hearing you.

696
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,748
Can you please speak up?

697
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,250
Um, Brad Davis.
He has a photo of me.

698
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,385
Brad Davis. Is he a target?

699
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:49,853
Is Brad a target? Um...

700
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,094
Yeah. He's a target.
He's a target.

701
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,695
Copy that.

702
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,398
Target is Brad Davis.
Initiating strike.

703
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,766
Initiating what, now?

704
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,469
Intercept point determined.

705
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,036
Releasing kill vehicle.
EDITH.

706
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,628
Oh, my God.
Dope glasses, Parker.

707
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,963
How'd you pay for these?
Flash, give them back.

708
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:37,134
I'm paying you a compliment.
Please give me...

709
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:38,469
I'm so sorry.

710
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,905
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

711
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,407
Do you want me to cancel

712
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,909
the drone strike
on Brad Davis?

713
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,309
Did you just punch Flash?
No.

714
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,443
Firing.

715
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:51,849
Oh, look out!

716
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,086
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

717
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,655
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

718
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,090
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

719
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,260
Commencing second strike.

720
00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:06,163
Peter. Plant your fanny
and buckle up.

721
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:07,764
Look at
the baby mountain goats!

722
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,467
- Baby mountain goats?
- Ooh, I see them.

723
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,282
I don't see
any mountain goats.

724
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,818
You missed them.

725
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,320
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

726
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,755
What?

727
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,324
...but your new look,
I love it.

728
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,326
Right, babe?
Thanks.

729
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,295
Yeah. Sophisticated,
classy, very European.

730
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:40,429
Oh, man.

731
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:43,634
Let's try that again.

732
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:47,003
- Uh, this is so weird.
- It was right here on my phone.

733
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,173
I-I...
Yeah. Weird.

734
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:56,880
Ow.

735
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:22,005
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

736
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,507
Wow, this place
is so classy.

737
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,076
Yeah, so why
are we here?

738
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,878
Speak for yourself.

739
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,512
I'm home.

740
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,181
What can I say?

741
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,516
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

742
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,221
Everyone get settled in, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

743
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:39,824
is Prague's annual...

744
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,425
- Carnival of Lights.
- Yeah!

745
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:43,027
- Hello?
- Parker, it's Hill.

746
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,728
There's an earpiece
with your suit.

747
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,731
Put it on and await
further instructions.

748
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,065
Understood?
Uh, yes, ma'am.

749
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:49,432
Yeah.
Hey, man.

750
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,768
Hey.
Look, I am so sorry

751
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,403
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

752
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,972
I'm still your guy
in the chair.

753
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,974
No, it's all good.
Don't worry about it.

754
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,610
Okay. Great, great.
It's fine.

755
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,047
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

756
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:05,581
Where's it gonna happen?
Uh, here in the city.

757
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,985
Peter, we're here.
I know, I know. It's not good.

758
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:09,385
It's... I'm figuring it out.

759
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,454
You have to do something,
Peter, please.

760
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:12,822
We're all counting on you.

761
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:14,791
Ned.
Yeah. Yeah, babe.

762
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,628
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

763
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,429
- It's about time.
- Serious?

764
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,931
Parker? Parker!
Yes, sir.

765
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:24,300
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

766
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,269
Are we boring you?
He's not bored.

767
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:28,371
He's thinking about
how you kidnapped him.

768
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:29,974
He had obstacles.

769
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:31,942
I removed them.

770
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,878
They still won't
evacuate the city.

771
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,545
Idiots.

772
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,414
So, what's the plan,
Parker?

773
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:40,918
I will be in
the cathedral tower,

774
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,619
keeping watch
for the fire monster.

775
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,222
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

776
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:48,793
and then Mr. Beck and I will...
My name is Mysterio.

777
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:53,931
That's when Mysterio and I
will move in.

778
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:55,331
Peter, listen to me.

779
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:58,001
The best hope you have,
the only hope,

780
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,538
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

781
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,673
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

782
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,643
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

783
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,612
If it gets too big,
it'll be able to

784
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,280
draw power
from the Earth's core.

785
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,650
After that,
there's no way to stop it.

786
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,989
Hey, my friends are here.

787
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,557
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

788
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,762
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

789
00:44:24,894 --> 00:44:29,867
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

790
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,302
Stark gave you
a multibillion-dollar

791
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:35,639
A.R. tactical
intelligence system,

792
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,306
and the first thing
you do with it

793
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,876
is try and blow up
your friends.

794
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,981
It's clear to me that
you were not ready for this.

795
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:52,889
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

796
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,059
He just... He felt bad
about snapping at you.

797
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,525
Really?

798
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:59,096
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

799
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,998
How you feeling?

800
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,570
Uh...

801
00:45:06,702 --> 00:45:09,940
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

802
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,675
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

803
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,782
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

804
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:20,751
and now it's all ruined.

805
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:30,559
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

806
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:33,496
It's a hard path.

807
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,865
You see things.
You do things.

808
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,266
You make choices.

809
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,204
People look up to you...

810
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,273
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

811
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,376
I like you, Peter.
You're a good kid.

812
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,615
There's a part of me that
wants me to tell you, just...

813
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:54,550
turn around,
run away from all this.

814
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:56,219
Then there's
another part of me

815
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,422
that knows what
we're about to fight,

816
00:45:58,554 --> 00:46:01,958
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

817
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:04,393
Me too.

818
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:06,762
But you're worried about
your friends.

819
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,632
Yeah.

820
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:11,568
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

821
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:14,170
Look,
just get them inside

822
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,672
and keep them in a safe place
for just a few hours.

823
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:17,842
They'll be all right.

824
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:22,278
It's really nice to have
somebody to talk to

825
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:24,347
about superhero stuff,
you know?

826
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,284
Anytime.

827
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,954
And, hey,
we survive this,

828
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:31,989
you'll have all summer
to kill Brad.

829
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:36,994
See you out there.

830
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:38,126
All right.

831
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:43,365
Scusi.

832
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,235
Sorry, that's Italian.

833
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:51,407
Okay. EDITH?
Oh, come on.

834
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,277
Hello, Peter.
Hey, uh...

835
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:56,146
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

836
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,813
Let's see what we can do.

837
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,548
Good news.

838
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:01,217
We're going to the opera!

839
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,887
You're kidding me.
The opera?

840
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:04,054
Don't look at me.

841
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,554
What happened
to the carnival?

842
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:07,291
This is upgrade living, guys.

843
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:11,128
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

844
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,164
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

845
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:18,635
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

846
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:21,670
Uh, I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

847
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:23,239
Thank you, Ned.

848
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:26,342
Everyone,
this is gonna be, maybe,

849
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,213
the best four hours
of our whole trip.

850
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,713
Four hours?

851
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,317
Guys, I think this
is gonna be fun. Seriously.

852
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,822
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

853
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,490
Yeah, because we'd much
rather go to a four-hour opera

854
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,559
instead of the biggest party
in the world.

855
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:46,163
Again,
don't look at me.

856
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:47,998
Parker, do you copy?

857
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,398
Comm check, one, two.

858
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,637
Okay, here we are.

859
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:55,338
Beat the rush.

860
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,974
Yeah, the rush out.

861
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:00,309
Lucky for us, we got
the best seats in the house.

862
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,478
Let's go.

863
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,916
Hey.
I'll save you a seat.

864
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:14,623
You look really pretty.

865
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,460
And therefore,
I have value?

866
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:19,429
No. No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just...

867
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,896
I'm messing with you.

868
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,934
Thank you.
You're welcome.

869
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,971
You look pretty too.
Thank you.

870
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:29,572
Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
So cute.

871
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,407
Can I...?
Yeah.

872
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,677
Want to go in on a pair?

873
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,278
You mean,
sit next to each other?

874
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:36,612
Yeah.

875
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,447
Are you in position?

876
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:40,016
No.
Okay. No...

877
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,550
Why the hell not? Parker?

878
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:43,186
You don't want to
sit next to me,

879
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,121
or, no, you just
don't want the glasses?

880
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,856
I didn't mean that.
Uh, uh...

881
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,358
If you go ahead,
I'll go grab us a pair.

882
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:52,262
I'll save you
a seat next to me.

883
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,530
Awesome.

884
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:55,798
A lot of seats,
so I'll be up there.

885
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,001
Okay.

886
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,802
Parker.
No, I'm coming. I'm...

887
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,271
Hey, I gotta go.
Could you tell MJ

888
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:04,173
that I'm sick
or something?

889
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:06,110
Okay. Be careful.

890
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:07,777
And Peter,
whatever you do,

891
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,280
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

892
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,081
Yeah, Ned, I know.

893
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,215
Okay.
Okay?

894
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,784
Yeah.
Gotta go.

895
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:32,802
- Parker!
- You better be on your way.

896
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:33,936
Coming.

897
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,445
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

898
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,914
Oh, I... I don't...
We should go. Yes, we should go.

899
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,318
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

900
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,335
All right. I'm in position.

901
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,137
Uh, as soon as
I see something,

902
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,306
Beck, I'll, uh...
I'll let you know.

903
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:11,474
- Roger that.
- How's the suit?

904
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,710
Ah, the suit's great.
It's awesome.

905
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:16,045
It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

906
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,081
Parker!
Okay, I'll shut up.

907
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,684
Oh, my God, babe,
isn't this beautiful?

908
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,086
Yeah, it's real beautiful,
babe.

909
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:26,422
What's wrong?
You know, honestly, I just...

910
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:29,059
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

911
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,329
I have the perfect thing.
Come on.

912
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:33,697
Heh.

913
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:42,005
Don't worry, babe.

914
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,507
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

915
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,342
You'll feel
a thousand times better.

916
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,548
Energy spiking.

917
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:53,882
We have seismic activity.

918
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:08,364
Okay, he's here! Beck, are you
ready? You know what to do.

919
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,900
On your lead, Spider-Man.

920
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,340
No, come back!

921
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,974
Come back and help us!

922
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,916
You're up, kid.

923
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:41,097
Wait, wait. Is that...?

924
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,632
Do you think
that's Spider-Man?

925
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,900
Uh-uh.
No, no, no.

926
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:45,869
It's a European
rip-off version of him.

927
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:47,871
I actually read about him.
It's not him.

928
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,452
No, Beck!
He's got the carousel!

929
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:05,289
He's getting bigger!

930
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,123
What's his name?
What's his name?

931
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,791
Uh, it's Night...
Night Monkey.

932
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,293
Night Monkey?
Yeah.

933
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,927
Yeah.
Night Monkey!

934
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:13,996
Yeah. Night Monkey.
Night Monkey, help!

935
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,264
Save us!
What?

936
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,932
Night Monkey, we're stuck!

937
00:52:17,065 --> 00:52:18,835
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

938
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:34,148
Are you okay?

939
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:39,289
On to Plan B?

940
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,958
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

941
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,427
I go left,
you go right! Now!

942
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:01,545
Okay, shoot him!

943
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:02,945
Yeah!

944
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,384
That hurt him.
Keep it coming.

945
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,260
Spider-Man,
keep your distance.

946
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:19,161
I'm trying!

947
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,498
Can't let him get near
the Ferris wheel.

948
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,099
Okay. I'm on it!

949
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:35,545
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

950
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:48,023
Whoa, what is that?!

951
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,865
Betty! Betty!

952
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:20,423
- That's it! Nice!
- Nice! You got him!

953
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,731
No, no, no.

954
00:54:35,137 --> 00:54:36,306
It's too late.

955
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:39,643
Whatever happens...

956
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:41,344
I'm glad we met.

957
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,246
Beck,
what are you doing?

958
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,916
What I should have done
last time.

959
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:52,922
Beck, don't do it!

960
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,661
Beck!

961
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:20,550
Mr. Beck?

962
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,653
Oh, thank God.

963
00:55:33,262 --> 00:55:34,664
I would totally kiss you,

964
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:37,166
but I think I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

965
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,237
I might have a mint.

966
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,041
So it's over?

967
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:46,876
That was the last of them.

968
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,045
But not the last threat
we'll ever face.

969
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:53,717
We need to stay vigilant.

970
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:56,318
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

971
00:55:56,452 --> 00:56:00,289
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

972
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,057
You should join us.

973
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,396
Thank you. I just might
take you up on that.

974
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,909
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

975
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,110
Mr. Fury, I...

976
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,847
I'd love to have you
in Berlin too.

977
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,918
But you got to decide whether
you're going to step up or not.

978
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,619
Stark chose you.

979
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:33,456
He made you an Avenger.

980
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,559
I need that.

981
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,927
The world needs that.

982
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,797
Maybe Stark was wrong.

983
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,800
Was he?

984
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,871
The choice is yours.

985
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,088
Let's get a drink.

986
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,391
I'm not 21.

987
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,900
Hey.

988
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:22,838
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

989
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,273
Yeah.

990
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:27,143
Fury was right.

991
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:29,679
Tony did a lot
for me...

992
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,780
so I owe it to him,
to everybody.

993
00:57:31,914 --> 00:57:33,750
Do you?

994
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:35,818
Yeah. I mean...

995
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:40,289
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

996
00:57:40,422 --> 00:57:42,125
He wanted me to be
better than him.

997
00:57:42,257 --> 00:57:44,193
And Fury just wants me
to live up to that.

998
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,762
What do you want, Peter?

999
00:57:45,894 --> 00:57:48,498
What do you mean?
What do you want?

1000
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,800
I don't know.

1001
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,601
What do you want?
Peter Parker. Now.

1002
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,170
I know you're
thinking about it.

1003
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:55,605
I wanna go on my trip,
right?

1004
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,806
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

1005
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,976
And go to
the top of the Eiffel Tower

1006
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,447
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

1007
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:08,284
and give her a kiss.
Whoa.

1008
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:09,952
Shut up, man.

1009
00:58:10,085 --> 00:58:11,621
You're not gonna do that,
are you?

1010
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:13,356
No, I can't.
Why not?

1011
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,592
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

1012
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,195
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
What are those?

1013
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,030
Are those the...?
EDITH glasses, yeah.

1014
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:23,699
They were just
on the floor?

1015
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,534
Try them on.
Let's see how they look.

1016
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,668
Yeah?
Yeah.

1017
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,175
I actually
really like them.

1018
00:58:32,307 --> 00:58:33,577
Can I be
completely honest?

1019
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,710
Please.

1020
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,545
They look really stupid.

1021
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,981
Oh.

1022
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,315
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

1023
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:41,851
You try them on.

1024
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,652
No, come on.
Try them on.

1025
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,889
I don't wanna try them on.
Just put them on.

1026
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,498
What do you think, kid?

1027
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,972
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1028
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,373
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you."

1029
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:06,876
What?

1030
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,012
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

1031
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:10,914
"For the next Tony Stark,
I trust you."

1032
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,750
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

1033
00:59:13,882 --> 00:59:15,518
He knew every mistake
I ever made.

1034
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,253
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

1035
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:19,655
Why would
he give it to you?

1036
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,556
Maybe he didn't trust me
to have EDITH,

1037
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,425
he just trusted me
to pick who should.

1038
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:26,094
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

1039
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:27,697
He's not gonna
give them to Fury

1040
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,565
because Fury would
give himself EDITH.

1041
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,067
You're probably right.

1042
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,302
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

1043
00:59:34,436 --> 00:59:37,373
And it's not me. I'm
a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1044
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:40,275
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

1045
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:43,311
and that's good
like Tony Stark, like you.

1046
00:59:43,445 --> 00:59:46,449
No. Peter, come on. No.

1047
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,119
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter.

1048
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,655
Hi. Yeah, um...

1049
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,891
I'd like to transfer your
control over to Quentin Beck.

1050
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,628
Peter, what are you doing?
Doing the right thing.

1051
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,864
Any transfer will
require confirmation.

1052
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,766
Stark gave you
the glasses.

1053
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:04,132
Stark gave me a choice.

1054
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:06,268
It's my choice to make.
I'm gonna make it.

1055
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,972
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

1056
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,775
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

1057
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:13,476
He'd want you to have them.

1058
01:00:13,608 --> 01:00:15,110
Waiting for confirmation.

1059
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,612
Confirm.

1060
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:21,583
Welcome to the Avengers.

1061
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,126
They look good on you.

1062
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:33,929
Thank you.

1063
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,831
It's an honor.

1064
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,434
Yeah.

1065
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,769
Mr. Stark would've
really liked you.

1066
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,206
Where you headed?
I'm gonna go find MJ.

1067
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,043
Good luck, kid. I'll give you
a fifty-fifty chance.

1068
01:00:47,175 --> 01:00:48,177
You're pretty awkward.

1069
01:00:49,644 --> 01:00:51,114
Yeah.

1070
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:53,648
See you later, man.
See you.

1071
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:27,016
See?
That wasn't so hard.

1072
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,184
Yes!

1073
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,088
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

1074
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:42,498
Okay, we got EDITH. Get these
connected to our system.

1075
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,900
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1076
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,670
This is a big win, but we still
got a lot of work to do.

1077
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,505
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1078
01:01:49,637 --> 01:01:51,273
Yeah!

1079
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,742
Okay, toasts!

1080
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,043
Give me that, Doug.

1081
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:57,179
To the man
who brought us all together,

1082
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,947
our former boss,
Tony Stark.

1083
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:00,349
Boo!

1084
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,050
The jester king.

1085
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:06,655
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

1086
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,690
that he was unfit to wield.

1087
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:11,094
Like the holographic system
I designed.

1088
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:12,527
A revolutionary breakthrough

1089
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:15,030
with limitless applications
that Tony turned

1090
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,099
into a self-therapy machine
and renamed...

1091
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,735
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1092
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:25,708
Oh, $611 million

1093
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,876
for my little
therapeutic experiment.

1094
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:31,447
He renamed my life's work...

1095
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:32,579
"BARF."

1096
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,050
I told him it was a mistake,

1097
01:02:34,182 --> 01:02:36,885
that my technology
could change the world.

1098
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,889
And then...

1099
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,257
he fired me.

1100
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,626
Said I was...

1101
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:46,963
unstable.

1102
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:49,364
To Tony.

1103
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:51,000
To Tony!

1104
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,668
Next, to William.

1105
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,670
William!

1106
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:58,507
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1107
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,177
With a box of scraps!

1108
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:03,146
The integration
of my illusion tech

1109
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:05,280
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

1110
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,916
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

1111
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,318
And it's just the beginning.

1112
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,387
Thank you, brother.
To Guterman.

1113
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:12,721
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

1114
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,389
The story you created
of a soldier

1115
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:16,125
from another Earth
named Quentin

1116
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,894
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

1117
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:21,998
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

1118
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,632
I mean,
everybody bought it.

1119
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,134
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

1120
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,070
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

1121
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:29,505
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

1122
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:31,907
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

1123
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,342
Inspired idea.

1124
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,643
- To Janice.
- Janice!

1125
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:38,514
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

1126
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:42,184
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

1127
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,351
but to a child.

1128
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:45,021
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

1129
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:47,956
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

1130
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,960
There's a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

1131
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:53,695
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

1132
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:56,032
the most qualified,
and no one cares.

1133
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:57,967
Unless you're flying around
with a cape

1134
01:03:58,101 --> 01:03:59,668
or shooting lasers
from your hands,

1135
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,005
no one will even listen.

1136
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,775
Well, I've got a cape
and lasers.

1137
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:10,947
With our technology
and with EDITH,

1138
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:15,851
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

1139
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,019
Yeah!

1140
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:20,655
Then everyone will listen!

1141
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,360
Not to a boozy man-child.

1142
01:04:24,492 --> 01:04:26,128
No!

1143
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,697
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1144
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,900
No!

1145
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,068
To me...

1146
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,371
and to my very wealthy crew.

1147
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:36,639
To us.

1148
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:37,771
To us.

1149
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,074
To Mysterio!

1150
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,775
To Mysterio!

1151
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:42,010
To Peter Parker.

1152
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,846
To Peter Parker!

1153
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,782
Poor kid.

1154
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:49,784
Let's get to work.

1155
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,291
Peter, oh, my God.
Hey. Hey.

1156
01:04:55,423 --> 01:04:56,425
We almost died.

1157
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,626
It's fine. It's fine.

1158
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,461
Hey,
I'm done with the mission.

1159
01:04:59,594 --> 01:05:01,797
Dude, the trip's over.
What?

1160
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,967
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

1161
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,768
Of course our parents
want us home.

1162
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,637
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

1163
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,007
Oh, my God.
Yes, good. Stay here.

1164
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:13,509
Don't... Put some clothes on.
We're booking flights.

1165
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:16,179
We came for science, we're
leaving because of witches.

1166
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:18,014
Welcome
to the new Dark Ages.

1167
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,418
What is going on?
We're going home in the morning.

1168
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,786
No, no, no.
All the Elementals are gone.

1169
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,755
Ned.
Coming, sweetie.

1170
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:30,693
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

1171
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:33,396
Yeah.
Hey.

1172
01:05:34,762 --> 01:05:36,764
Hey.
Where were you?

1173
01:05:36,898 --> 01:05:38,766
Um, I got lost.

1174
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,268
We were worried
about you.

1175
01:05:40,402 --> 01:05:41,503
Oh.

1176
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,172
Good thing you're back.
Hm.

1177
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,639
Yeah.

1178
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:46,141
So much for Paris,
right?

1179
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,476
It would've been fun.

1180
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,445
Yeah. Night.

1181
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:50,846
Night.

1182
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:53,481
You look ni...

1183
01:06:00,655 --> 01:06:01,655
Okay.

1184
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,059
Oh.
Hey.

1185
01:06:04,092 --> 01:06:05,594
Hey.

1186
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,829
Uh, look, um...

1187
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:10,365
I'm not ready for this trip
to be over yet,

1188
01:06:10,498 --> 01:06:12,735
and I kind of want
to do something fun

1189
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:15,570
that's not on the itinerary
or planned

1190
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:16,739
or with Mr. Harrington.

1191
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:18,574
Yes.

1192
01:06:18,706 --> 01:06:20,775
"Yes," like you wanna go?

1193
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,010
Yes.

1194
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,914
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1195
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,815
Meet me outside
in five minutes.

1196
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:30,418
Five is good.
Okay.

1197
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:33,188
Okay, bye.
Bye. Heh.

1198
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:39,594
Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!

1199
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:48,869
Hey.
Hey.

1200
01:06:48,936 --> 01:06:50,239
So where do
you wanna go?

1201
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,074
Who cares?
Awesome.

1202
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,876
Okay.
Let's go.

1203
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:01,817
I'm glad we're doing this.

1204
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:04,219
- Yeah, me too.
- To see the city a bit.

1205
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,755
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1206
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:09,925
Oh.
They would put them in a basket,

1207
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,161
and they would drown
in the water.

1208
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,831
Sorry.
It's okay.

1209
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,302
Uh...

1210
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:21,637
There's this thing
I've been wanting

1211
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:24,739
to talk to you about
for a while.

1212
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:27,876
Yeah?

1213
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:30,579
It's our last night
in Europe,

1214
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,483
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1215
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,318
I'm just gonna tell you.

1216
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,253
Uh...

1217
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,487
MJ, I...

1218
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:40,621
"I'm Spider-Man."

1219
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,025
What?
That's what you were gonna say.

1220
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:45,661
That you're Spider-Man.

1221
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,465
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1222
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:52,635
I mean, I've been watching you
for a while now.

1223
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:56,038
It's kind of obvious.
Heh.

1224
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,606
I'm not Spider-Man.
What would make you think

1225
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,742
that I was Spider-Man?

1226
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,876
Peter, Washington?
Yeah?

1227
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,581
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1228
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:07,550
No, I was sick. Remember?

1229
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:09,452
I had my... The tummy?
Susan Yang thinks

1230
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,052
you're a male escort.
What?

1231
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:13,789
Of course I'm not a male escort.
Then you're Spider-Man.

1232
01:08:13,922 --> 01:08:16,925
No, I'm not Spider-Man at all.
What about tonight?

1233
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,295
You snuck off and fought
that thing. I saw you.

1234
01:08:19,427 --> 01:08:21,796
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1235
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,399
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1236
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,934
The Night Monkey?
Yeah.

1237
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,036
That's what it said
on the news,

1238
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:30,439
and the news never lies.

1239
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:33,108
Night Monkey. Okay.

1240
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,609
What are you doing?

1241
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:38,314
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man

1242
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,948
use the same webs?

1243
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:42,385
I mean, maybe.

1244
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,453
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1245
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:50,693
Were you only watching me

1246
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,994
because you thought
I was Spider-Man?

1247
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:57,666
Yeah.

1248
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,702
Why else
would I be watching you?

1249
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,506
Doesn't matter.
Just thought that maybe...

1250
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,046
What the hell was that?

1251
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,551
I don't know.

1252
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,697
What is it, some kind
of projector or something?

1253
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,100
Yeah,
but it's really advanced.

1254
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,470
It... It looked so real.

1255
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:37,805
It...
Yeah, really real.

1256
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:41,009
Wait, does that mean that...?
The Elementals are fake?

1257
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:44,546
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1258
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,682
There was fire
and destruction, and...

1259
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:51,554
Who would do something
like that?

1260
01:10:00,628 --> 01:10:02,197
Mysterio.

1261
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,904
I am Spider-Man.

1262
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:10,238
And I've really messed up.

1263
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,875
Wait. You're b-being
serious right now?

1264
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:14,842
Mm-hm.
You're 100 percent serious?

1265
01:10:14,976 --> 01:10:17,011
Because it's not funny.
No, I'm not joking.

1266
01:10:17,145 --> 01:10:19,282
Because I was only
like 67 percent sure.

1267
01:10:19,414 --> 01:10:20,948
MJ...
So why are you here?

1268
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:22,551
Why are you
on this school trip?

1269
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,319
I know you have a lot
of questions,

1270
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,154
but we have to get out
of here, okay?

1271
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,358
Okay. Okay. I can't believe
I figured it out!

1272
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:34,396
You took everything from me!

1273
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:36,731
This is for my family!

1274
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,872
Pause.

1275
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,740
Pause.

1276
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,077
Uh... Sorry.

1277
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,079
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1278
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:53,916
Yep. Stand by.

1279
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,756
All right, fly, fly, fly,
zap, zap, zap.

1280
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,326
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography,

1281
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,327
but it'll do.

1282
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,894
Kill image.

1283
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,996
De-cloak drones.

1284
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,164
All right, weapons.

1285
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:12,501
You want to weaponize?
Yep.

1286
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,002
Weapons only. Stand by.

1287
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:24,747
Nice.

1288
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,481
Stop.

1289
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:28,250
Something.
I don't know what it is.

1290
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,384
It's something...

1291
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:31,753
Just dou...
You know what?

1292
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:33,822
Double the damage
and then run it again.

1293
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,423
You want me
to double it up?

1294
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,891
Yeah.
All right.

1295
01:11:37,024 --> 01:11:38,894
Cover your ears.

1296
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,404
Whoo! That is good!
That's good.

1297
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:52,106
We on schedule?
Oh, yeah.

1298
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,609
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1299
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,479
With her drones,
we'll create an event

1300
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,180
big enough to cover
an entire city.

1301
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:00,548
Well done. Make sure
every drone is weapons-hot.

1302
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:01,850
We need maximum damage.

1303
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,386
Gonna cause a lot of casualties.
Oh, yeah.

1304
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,390
More casualties, more coverage.
Gotta cut through the static.

1305
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,358
London's a beautiful city,
it'll suffer,

1306
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,993
but they can rebuild.
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1307
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:16,198
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1308
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,635
But when its new savior
descends,

1309
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:22,837
all those casualties
will be forgotten.

1310
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,239
Janice, be in position
with my quick-change armor

1311
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:26,875
for the victory lap?
Of course.

1312
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,543
You wanna try...?
No, that's...

1313
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:31,145
What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?

1314
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:33,681
Oh, one of the drones
that came back from the plaza

1315
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:35,384
was missing a projector.
It's fine.

1316
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:39,521
Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?

1317
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:42,557
It's one drone. The image
will be perfect, I promise.

1318
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:43,958
That projector is evidence.

1319
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:45,860
It's gonna tell people
what we're doing

1320
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:47,295
and how we're doing it.

1321
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,864
I am trying to fool
7 billion people here,

1322
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:52,635
including Nick Fury, who happens
to be the most paranoid

1323
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,569
and most dangerous person
on the planet.

1324
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,538
If he catches on
before I've killed him,

1325
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:58,105
he will put a bullet
in my head.

1326
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,908
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1327
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,246
Right?

1328
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,916
William,
can you look at me?

1329
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,219
Pull up EDITH.

1330
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,189
Hello, Quentin.

1331
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:16,057
Hi, honey.
I need a level-five search,

1332
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,092
full-resource protocol
for this device.

1333
01:13:18,225 --> 01:13:19,226
Magnifying.

1334
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,863
There.
Search everything

1335
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,966
going in and out
of that building.

1336
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,734
Located.

1337
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,103
shooot.

1338
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,007
You know, William,
one day,

1339
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,944
after I've had to kill
Peter Parker because of this,

1340
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:40,582
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1341
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,119
I can't believe
I gave Beck those glasses.

1342
01:13:45,252 --> 01:13:46,521
How could I be that stupid?

1343
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:48,256
He's probably spying on me
right now

1344
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,192
or sending a drone
to come and kill me.

1345
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:52,895
You had access
to killer drones?

1346
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,462
Yeah,
I didn't really want them,

1347
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,363
especially after
I almost killed Brad.

1348
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:57,966
You almost killed Brad?

1349
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,135
Look,
I have to call Mr. Fury

1350
01:14:00,268 --> 01:14:01,970
and tell him
that Beck's a fraud...

1351
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,172
but I think he tapped my phone.
So, what are you gonna do?

1352
01:14:05,306 --> 01:14:08,109
I need my suit,
and I have to go to Berlin

1353
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:11,145
and talk to Mr. Fury
in person.

1354
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,818
Uh... Just...

1355
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:36,771
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1356
01:14:36,904 --> 01:14:38,940
The costume looks great...

1357
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:41,510
for the costume party

1358
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,845
at the prince's castle.

1359
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,412
She knows.
I told her.

1360
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,750
He didn't tell me.
I figured it out.

1361
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,351
Oh.

1362
01:14:50,484 --> 01:14:51,353
That's cool.

1363
01:14:51,485 --> 01:14:52,654
Like, a long time ago.

1364
01:14:53,387 --> 01:14:54,256
Oh.

1365
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,024
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1366
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,326
But he saved me
and Betty's lives.

1367
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,628
He's been faking the thing
with illusion tech.

1368
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:03,131
Yeah, he's using these,
like, hologram projectors.

1369
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,833
Whoa. That's crazy.

1370
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,002
Yeah.

1371
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:12,239
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1372
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:14,076
It's been mostly me.

1373
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,712
Ned, call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1374
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,146
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin.

1375
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,548
Got it. Easy.

1376
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,851
Wow, you guys
lie with such ease.

1377
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:25,087
I gotta go.

1378
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,889
Wait, wait, wait.
The projector.

1379
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:28,856
You're gonna need this.

1380
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,225
Don't tell anyone about this,
okay?

1381
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,461
Anyone who knows
is in danger.

1382
01:15:40,935 --> 01:15:42,871
So you know too.

1383
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,640
It's cool. I've known first,
and I've known longer,

1384
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:47,909
but it's not a competition.
Heh.

1385
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,564
Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1386
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:14,036
Nacht Monkey!
No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1387
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:17,771
Get in.

1388
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,146
Mr. Fury...

1389
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,282
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

1390
01:16:27,414 --> 01:16:29,551
No, no, no, listen.
Wait until we're secure.

1391
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,219
Okay.

1392
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:37,859
Right.

1393
01:17:03,217 --> 01:17:06,253
So is there anything
you want to tell us

1394
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:07,387
about your girlfriend?

1395
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:08,957
He's talking about
EDITH.

1396
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,457
I made a mistake,
I'm sorry,

1397
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,127
but he is not
who you think he is.

1398
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,429
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals,

1399
01:17:14,561 --> 01:17:16,430
it's all fake.
He has some illusion tech.

1400
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:19,466
That's how he tricked you,
and me into giving him EDITH.

1401
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,337
It's a projector. I pulled it
off the fire monster in Prague.

1402
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:25,673
So all that death
and destruction

1403
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,510
we witnessed
was created by this?

1404
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:30,945
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1405
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:32,514
Well, if this is true,

1406
01:17:32,646 --> 01:17:36,184
then Beck's very dangerous
and we need to be smart.

1407
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,953
Who else did you tell
about this?

1408
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:41,122
Parker? Parker!

1409
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:44,225
What's wrong?
It's Beck. He's here.

1410
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,360
What? Hill?

1411
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:53,068
No, it's just an illu...

1412
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:55,369
Fury!

1413
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,806
Unh. Aah!

1414
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:03,045
Wow, Peter, wow.

1415
01:18:03,177 --> 01:18:05,180
I thought we were close.

1416
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,751
Fury always had to die,
but not you.

1417
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:10,018
Stop hiding, Beck!

1418
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,655
I tried to help
you walk away.

1419
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:16,123
Now you're making me
do this.

1420
01:18:21,595 --> 01:18:25,300
You told me,
you were just a kid.

1421
01:18:25,432 --> 01:18:28,670
You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.

1422
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,704
Help me!
MJ!

1423
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,875
Oh, God!

1424
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:36,677
Peter, what's going on?

1425
01:18:36,811 --> 01:18:38,012
I know this isn't real.

1426
01:18:38,145 --> 01:18:39,346
Do you, though?

1427
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:42,649
MJ!

1428
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,586
MJ!

1429
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:48,890
I don't think you know
what's real, Peter.

1430
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,694
Whoa! Whoa!

1431
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:03,872
You need to wake up!

1432
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,730
I mean, look at yourself.

1433
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,844
You are just a scared
little kid

1434
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:43,744
in a sweat suit.

1435
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:46,448
I created Mysterio

1436
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:49,617
to give the world
someone to believe in.

1437
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,485
I control the truth.

1438
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:54,322
Mysterio is the truth.

1439
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,015
If you were good enough,

1440
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,684
maybe Tony would still
be alive.

1441
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:38,600
Deep down,
you know I'm right.

1442
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,313
You made your choice.

1443
01:20:51,445 --> 01:20:54,515
And all you had to do
was step aside.

1444
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,684
And now you have...

1445
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:10,864
Fury. Unh.

1446
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:14,336
Beck's people
are trying to find everyone

1447
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,438
who could expose him.

1448
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,704
Who'd you tell?

1449
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:19,407
Um...
I know you told someone...

1450
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,608
Um...
so just tell me.

1451
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,409
Okay.
Who did you tell?

1452
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:23,912
Who else did you tell?

1453
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,680
Just Ned and MJ
from my class.

1454
01:21:25,813 --> 01:21:27,448
Maybe Ned told
his girlfriend Betty,

1455
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,016
but that's it.

1456
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,685
What?

1457
01:21:30,818 --> 01:21:33,421
You are so gullible.

1458
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,556
What?
You're smart as a whip.

1459
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:37,926
Just a...

1460
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,426
sucker.

1461
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,262
And now all your friends
have to die.

1462
01:21:41,395 --> 01:21:42,796
Oh, my God.

1463
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:48,369
It's easy to fool people

1464
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:50,972
when they're already fooling
themselves.

1465
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,578
But for what it's worth,
Peter,

1466
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:00,047
I really am sorry.

1467
01:22:09,623 --> 01:22:10,958
- EDITH.
- Yes, Quentin.

1468
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,628
Access files to
Peter Parker's class trip.

1469
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:17,099
I need them to fly home
from London.

1470
01:22:56,203 --> 01:22:57,203
Hi.

1471
01:22:58,439 --> 01:22:59,474
Where am I?

1472
01:22:59,606 --> 01:23:01,809
Municipal holding
facility.

1473
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,511
They said they found you
unconscious at the train yard.

1474
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:05,747
Very dangerous.

1475
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,015
And we gave you the shirt

1476
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,083
because you seemed
a bit cold.

1477
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:11,019
Thanks.

1478
01:23:12,819 --> 01:23:13,854
You guys are nice.

1479
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,024
You speak really good
English.

1480
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,327
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1481
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:21,328
I'm in the Netherlands
right now?

1482
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:22,863
Yep.

1483
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,800
Bye. Aah!

1484
01:23:25,932 --> 01:23:28,536
Guard!
The guard is on a break.

1485
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,038
Probably talking to his wife.
Yeah, she's pregnant.

1486
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,407
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1487
01:23:40,547 --> 01:23:42,250
Yeah.

1488
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:43,484
Yeah.

1489
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,520
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1490
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:51,893
You guys okay?

1491
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:05,840
Excuse me, sir?
Yeah?

1492
01:24:05,972 --> 01:24:08,042
Could I borrow your phone?
Yeah.

1493
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,413
Everyone is so nice here.
Uh...

1494
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:14,681
Okay.

1495
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,122
Okay.

1496
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:25,693
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Hey, hey, uh...

1497
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:29,163
I messed up.
I need a... I need a ride.

1498
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:31,666
Where am I?
Where am I, sir?

1499
01:24:31,798 --> 01:24:34,001
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1500
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,872
Hang on.
Could you say that into there?

1501
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:41,708
Hi.
It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1502
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:43,877
Yeah, no problem.
Heh, heh.

1503
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:45,512
Thanks.

1504
01:24:45,646 --> 01:24:46,646
Did you get that?

1505
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,537
Peter? Are you okay?

1506
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:13,408
Happy, is that you?
Yeah, of course it's me.

1507
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:16,978
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1508
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,814
Only I would know. Uh...

1509
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:22,984
Remember we went to Germany?
You pay-per-viewed a video

1510
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:24,985
in your room?
They didn't list titles,

1511
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:27,488
but I could tell by the price
it was an adult film.

1512
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,457
And you didn't know how I knew...
Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1513
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:36,363
It's so good to see you.

1514
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:39,634
Peter, you'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1515
01:25:39,766 --> 01:25:41,536
Okay, hold still.

1516
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:43,470
There we go.

1517
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:50,345
Ouch.

1518
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,979
I thought you had
super strength.

1519
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:54,114
It still hurts.

1520
01:25:55,949 --> 01:25:58,653
Happy, come on.
All right, relax.

1521
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:02,023
Just a few more. There we go.
Oh, my God.

1522
01:26:02,155 --> 01:26:03,858
Relax.
Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1523
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,360
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1524
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,363
I trusted Beck. Right?

1525
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,864
I thought he was my friend.

1526
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:13,234
I gave him the only thing
Mr. Stark left for me,

1527
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,903
and now he's gonna kill
my friends and half of Europe,

1528
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:18,805
so please
do not tell me to relax.

1529
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:23,411
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1530
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,048
I just really miss him.

1531
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:30,518
Yeah, I miss him too.

1532
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,856
Everywhere I go...

1533
01:26:35,989 --> 01:26:37,492
I see his face.

1534
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,961
And the whole world
is asking

1535
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,729
who's gonna be
the next Iron Man...

1536
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:48,336
And I don't know if that's me,
Happy. I'm not Iron Man.

1537
01:26:50,136 --> 01:26:52,306
You're not Iron Man.

1538
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:54,207
You're never gonna be
Iron Man.

1539
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,479
Nobody could live up
to Tony.

1540
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,046
Not even Tony.

1541
01:27:01,548 --> 01:27:03,350
Tony was my best friend.

1542
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:04,685
And he was a mess.

1543
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,554
He second-guessed
everything he did.

1544
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,256
He was all over the place.

1545
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,259
The one thing that he did
that he didn't second-guess

1546
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:12,993
was picking you.

1547
01:27:14,561 --> 01:27:17,731
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1548
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:21,368
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1549
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,171
Now, your friends
are in trouble,

1550
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:27,908
you're all alone,
your tech is missing.

1551
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,378
What are you gonna do
about it?

1552
01:27:36,216 --> 01:27:37,719
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1553
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,654
I mean, right now. Specifically,
what are we gonna do?

1554
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:42,556
We've been hovering
over a tulip field

1555
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:43,824
for the last 15 minutes.

1556
01:27:43,957 --> 01:27:45,560
Right.
I can't call my friends

1557
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,261
because he's tracking
their phones.

1558
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,496
Give me your phone.

1559
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,831
My cell phone?
Yeah.

1560
01:27:49,963 --> 01:27:51,432
Okay. Here.

1561
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:52,833
What's your password?

1562
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:53,835
"Password."

1563
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:55,502
No, what is your password?

1564
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:57,838
"Password," spelled out.
Head of security,

1565
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:00,807
and your password is "password"?
I don't feel good about it.

1566
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,944
Hello, governor. Cup of tea?
I'm gonna be in London soon.

1567
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:06,012
They're in London.
London, okay.

1568
01:28:06,146 --> 01:28:07,146
Yeah, I need a suit.

1569
01:28:07,213 --> 01:28:08,850
Suit?

1570
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,773
Okay, um...

1571
01:28:31,905 --> 01:28:34,975
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1572
01:28:41,548 --> 01:28:44,150
Yeah, open that.
Okay, no, no, no.

1573
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:54,295
What?
Nothing.

1574
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:57,297
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1575
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:02,970
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1576
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,311
Okay, can you pull up
my web-shooters?

1577
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,547
Isolate the Taser webs,

1578
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,949
and reconfigure
and boost the voltage

1579
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:19,052
to a factor of 25 percent,

1580
01:29:19,185 --> 01:29:21,956
and give me complete
manual control over detonation.

1581
01:29:22,088 --> 01:29:25,059
d Forget the hearse
'Cause I never die... d

1582
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:27,060
I thought Kree
having sleeper cells

1583
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:28,496
was top secret information.

1584
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:31,131
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1585
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,701
I thought that was over.
It's the biggest one yet.

1586
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,537
Where?
London.

1587
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:38,038
Okay, the company set up
a city tour,

1588
01:29:38,171 --> 01:29:41,341
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1589
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:45,880
Is no one else gonna
acknowledge how crazy this is?

1590
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:48,449
Oh, yeah, I get it.
There's been nothing scientific

1591
01:29:48,582 --> 01:29:49,951
about this science tour
at all.

1592
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,719
No, no, I'm talking
about Peter.

1593
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:53,555
Has no one noticed
how shady he is?

1594
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,556
I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop

1595
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:57,425
with some woman
in his underwear,

1596
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,193
and he's always
sneaking away,

1597
01:29:59,326 --> 01:30:01,127
like back at the opera, huh?

1598
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:04,599
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1599
01:30:04,731 --> 01:30:07,134
Is no one else here
interested in the truth?

1600
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:10,704
"The very concept
of objective truth

1601
01:30:10,837 --> 01:30:12,305
is fading out of the world."

1602
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:14,207
George Orwell.
Thank you, MJ.

1603
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:16,610
Yeah. Well, since
Peter's not really here

1604
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:17,743
to tell his truth,

1605
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:19,480
what about you, Brad?

1606
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:21,815
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1607
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:23,585
Yeah, dude,
what's that about?

1608
01:30:23,717 --> 01:30:26,287
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that. It was...

1609
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:27,588
I was trying to take a...

1610
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:29,623
Let's put all
this craziness behind us

1611
01:30:29,756 --> 01:30:32,493
and have a nice,
peaceful afternoon.

1612
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:36,564
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class. Okay.

1613
01:30:36,698 --> 01:30:39,634
I'm gonna be a cool teacher
right now.

1614
01:30:39,766 --> 01:30:42,235
You gotta stop doing that.
It is weird.

1615
01:30:42,368 --> 01:30:45,972
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1616
01:30:46,106 --> 01:30:47,708
- Okay?
- Look at this.

1617
01:30:47,841 --> 01:30:49,476
Mr. Harrington,
this is your bus.

1618
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,779
We got a bus all to ourselves.
Nice to see you all. Come along.

1619
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:54,916
I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
Thank you.

1620
01:30:55,048 --> 01:30:56,951
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1621
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:58,819
All right.

1622
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:00,654
I have the kids.

1623
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,327
I got here as fast as I could.

1624
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,430
I did a full perimeter sweep.
Nothing.

1625
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:10,564
Damn it.

1626
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,135
Pulse is spiking.

1627
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:15,603
I'll take
another look.

1628
01:31:15,737 --> 01:31:17,438
Soon as you see something,
report.

1629
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:19,806
You're all we've got, Beck.

1630
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,609
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1631
01:31:23,877 --> 01:31:26,479
God help us all.

1632
01:31:26,613 --> 01:31:28,515
Okay, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1633
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,452
William, launch the drones.
Copy that, brother.

1634
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:35,189
Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1635
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,796
Excellent. Janice?
Working on the cape.

1636
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,030
Get those wrinkles out.

1637
01:31:44,164 --> 01:31:46,000
I could be shaking hands
with the queen.

1638
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:47,569
Guterman?
Almost in position.

1639
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:50,136
Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
Increasing pulse.

1640
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:54,175
Whatever this is,
it's 100 times bigger

1641
01:31:54,307 --> 01:31:55,341
than the previous ones.

1642
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:56,677
EDITH?

1643
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,311
Yes, Quentin.

1644
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:00,081
Show me my loose ends.

1645
01:32:00,213 --> 01:32:01,916
Once the show's going,

1646
01:32:02,048 --> 01:32:03,751
execute the kill order
on my command.

1647
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:04,985
Copy.
All right.

1648
01:32:05,118 --> 01:32:06,753
Start the show.

1649
01:32:08,154 --> 01:32:10,190
Let's save the world,
people.

1650
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:15,261
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1651
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:18,431
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1652
01:32:18,565 --> 01:32:21,668
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1653
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:26,608
That doesn't
look good.

1654
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,676
But it's fake,
nothing to worry about.

1655
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:32,880
And the kids
are in the kill zone.

1656
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:35,015
Great work, Guterman.

1657
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,784
What?

1658
01:32:37,918 --> 01:32:40,386
Happy Hogan here.
I know. What do you want?

1659
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,590
At Mr. Stark's,
going through his belongings.

1660
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,557
There was a surfboard
you left behind.

1661
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:46,393
What?
People said they didn't think

1662
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:49,663
Nick Fury was a surfer, I said,
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1663
01:32:49,796 --> 01:32:52,399
It's not mine. And don't ever
call this number again.

1664
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:02,844
Fury's got the coded message.

1665
01:33:02,976 --> 01:33:04,679
Your friends
are at the Tower Bridge.

1666
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:07,381
Your boy called it London
Bridge, but I figured it out.

1667
01:33:07,514 --> 01:33:09,082
I'll scoop them up, okay?
Yeah.

1668
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,283
We're close.
We're close.

1669
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:11,685
How's the suit?
Almost done.

1670
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,087
Good.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

1671
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,722
Before you go,
if something happens to me,

1672
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,457
could you please give
this to MJ?

1673
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:19,726
You'll make it back.
Give it to her yourself.

1674
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,194
You got this.
I got this.

1675
01:33:21,328 --> 01:33:24,097
Walk me through it.
I know it's illusion tech.

1676
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:25,867
All I do
is get inside the illusion,

1677
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,100
then I can take it down,

1678
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:28,703
find him,
and he's just a guy.

1679
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,136
I can take EDITH
right back.

1680
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:32,640
Right, but last time,
you got hit by a train.

1681
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:35,810
True, but this time...

1682
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,746
How do I explain this? Uh...
I have a sixth sense.

1683
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,382
The Peter-tingle. That's what
you're talking about, right?

1684
01:33:42,515 --> 01:33:43,650
It's not working, though.

1685
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:45,618
I heard it wasn't working now.
Is it?

1686
01:33:45,752 --> 01:33:47,921
It is working.
I don't know if it's working...

1687
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:49,990
You got the Peter-tingle.
That's the plan.

1688
01:33:50,123 --> 01:33:51,457
I'm gonna go get
your friends.

1689
01:33:51,591 --> 01:33:53,661
You get that Peter-tingle
back online.

1690
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:54,828
I got this. I got this.

1691
01:34:09,576 --> 01:34:10,576
Cue the lightning.

1692
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:12,713
Cuing lightning.

1693
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:19,386
Sir, is it still safe
on the top,

1694
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,654
or should we all come down?

1695
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:22,788
Oh, my.

1696
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,960
What did
the bus driver say?

1697
01:34:26,092 --> 01:34:27,560
Bus driver's gone.

1698
01:34:27,694 --> 01:34:29,063
- What?
- Where?

1699
01:34:29,195 --> 01:34:31,899
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I
have it under control!

1700
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,367
No. Don't drag me into this.

1701
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,203
I'm doing my best,
Julius!

1702
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,639
Look...
Oh, the witches are back.

1703
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:41,074
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1704
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,715
Okay.
Okay, follow me, kids.

1705
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:53,054
Come on, let's go!

1706
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:08,368
Now, that is
an Avengers-level threat.

1707
01:35:25,051 --> 01:35:26,753
This way. This way!

1708
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,189
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1709
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:30,091
- Flash!
- Follow that hand.

1710
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,859
This way. Follow me.

1711
01:35:31,993 --> 01:35:35,029
It's not real, it's not real!
It looks real to me!

1712
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:37,363
Follow me, kids!

1713
01:35:37,497 --> 01:35:39,565
- Earth, wind, fire, water.
- Oh, no.

1714
01:35:39,699 --> 01:35:41,667
They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1715
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:43,436
You're thinking of Voltron.
Who?

1716
01:35:43,569 --> 01:35:45,405
Voltron!
You're thinking of Voltron!

1717
01:35:45,538 --> 01:35:47,274
Hey, look,
it's Mysterio!

1718
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,076
He's gonna save us!

1719
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:53,881
Wait, if Mysterio
knows we know...

1720
01:35:54,015 --> 01:35:56,050
Then we're in danger.
Yeah, and so are they.

1721
01:35:56,182 --> 01:35:57,384
We should go.

1722
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,220
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1723
01:36:01,788 --> 01:36:04,725
This is for my family!

1724
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:07,761
You should get
somewhere safe, Fury.

1725
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:09,430
I don't see this
ending well.

1726
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,431
I appreciate your concern,

1727
01:36:11,564 --> 01:36:13,567
but I never leave my men
behind.

1728
01:36:15,435 --> 01:36:17,337
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me?

1729
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:19,105
I can.
It's a little loud out here.

1730
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:20,807
I like the new suit.
Thanks.

1731
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:23,176
Whoa, Peter,
you sure that's not real?

1732
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,779
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1733
01:36:25,912 --> 01:36:27,081
Still the play?
Uh-huh.

1734
01:36:27,213 --> 01:36:28,649
We need to get high enough

1735
01:36:28,782 --> 01:36:32,485
so Beck doesn't see me coming.
Copy. Stay sticky.

1736
01:36:34,921 --> 01:36:36,957
Hey, Happy.
Yeah, kid. What is it?

1737
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:40,461
We need to have a conversation
about you and my aunt!

1738
01:36:54,574 --> 01:36:56,577
Beck, report!

1739
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:59,079
I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1740
01:36:59,212 --> 01:37:00,581
"It's all the Elementals.

1741
01:37:00,713 --> 01:37:02,515
They're merged
into something..."

1742
01:37:02,649 --> 01:37:04,918
into something else.
Something more powerful.

1743
01:37:05,051 --> 01:37:07,453
It's drawing energy
from the Earth's core.

1744
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,927
See, now,
that's some bullshit.

1745
01:37:16,662 --> 01:37:17,662
Is that...?

1746
01:37:22,735 --> 01:37:24,037
Be ready for anything.

1747
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,206
Yeah.

1748
01:37:31,112 --> 01:37:33,546
It's not real,
it's not real, it's not real!

1749
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,186
Whoa.

1750
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,122
That's awesome.

1751
01:38:07,347 --> 01:38:09,382
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1752
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:11,717
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1753
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:14,854
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1754
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,695
Do you see anything?

1755
01:38:22,828 --> 01:38:25,798
Yeah.
And I'm gonna kill him.

1756
01:38:30,503 --> 01:38:32,305
I hope this works.

1757
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:49,555
You got me?

1758
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:55,962
I got you.

1759
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,765
Boss, the illusion
is coming apart.

1760
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:02,802
I see you.

1761
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:08,742
- EDITH, give me protection.
- Copy.

1762
01:39:23,423 --> 01:39:24,925
Just kill the illusion.
Kill it.

1763
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,292
I'm not gonna. They'll see.

1764
01:39:26,426 --> 01:39:28,828
They'll see
what I want them to see!

1765
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,898
Do you still need the cape?
Yes, Janice.

1766
01:39:32,033 --> 01:39:34,068
I still need the cape.
Done.

1767
01:39:36,869 --> 01:39:39,239
Now render my illusion suit.
All right, hang on.

1768
01:39:39,372 --> 01:39:41,475
The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!

1769
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:42,809
There you are.

1770
01:39:46,579 --> 01:39:47,613
Easy.

1771
01:39:51,952 --> 01:39:53,253
Who the hell is that?

1772
01:39:54,988 --> 01:39:56,090
- Ned!
- Happy!

1773
01:39:56,222 --> 01:39:57,990
I gotta get you out of here!

1774
01:39:58,125 --> 01:39:59,359
Get on the jet!
Who are you?

1775
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,528
I work with Spider-Man.
Get on that jet.

1776
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:03,363
You work for Spider-Man?

1777
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,698
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1778
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,304
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1779
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:11,637
Happy, are you okay?

1780
01:40:11,771 --> 01:40:13,340
We're okay. Just get Beck.

1781
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,809
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
- Copy.

1782
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:22,483
I'll just kill the kids
myself.

1783
01:40:27,387 --> 01:40:28,387
Whoa!

1784
01:40:37,163 --> 01:40:38,498
There you are.

1785
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:42,569
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1786
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,570
Yeah, go, go, go!
Come on.

1787
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:49,943
- Go!
- Into the vault!

1788
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,212
The walls are 8 feet thick.
Go into the vault!

1789
01:40:52,345 --> 01:40:53,514
What?
Into the vault. Go!

1790
01:40:56,582 --> 01:40:58,219
Take cover!

1791
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:17,703
Okay.

1792
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:23,243
Yeah?

1793
01:41:23,344 --> 01:41:25,179
No. No.

1794
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:30,716
I see you.

1795
01:41:32,985 --> 01:41:33,985
Get that thing out...

1796
01:41:39,525 --> 01:41:40,694
Go!

1797
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:49,903
How does Cap do that?

1798
01:41:58,944 --> 01:42:02,114
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1799
01:42:02,248 --> 01:42:04,484
I'm here. I'm here.
Happy, thank God.

1800
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:08,654
I bought us some time,
but not much.

1801
01:42:08,788 --> 01:42:12,091
I'm trying to get to Beck,
but I can't shake these drones!

1802
01:42:26,172 --> 01:42:27,673
Gotcha.

1803
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:51,231
Going up!

1804
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:28,368
Finally.

1805
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:30,837
Hey, William, how we doing?

1806
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:33,038
Illusion almost back up.

1807
01:43:33,172 --> 01:43:35,676
I don't know
how you're gonna spin this.

1808
01:43:50,055 --> 01:43:51,324
Oh, great. No webs.

1809
01:44:05,037 --> 01:44:07,239
Are we gonna die?
Nobody dies on my watch.

1810
01:44:09,842 --> 01:44:11,645
I wasted my life
playing video games,

1811
01:44:11,778 --> 01:44:13,447
and we're gonna die.

1812
01:44:13,579 --> 01:44:17,384
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1813
01:44:17,518 --> 01:44:20,119
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1814
01:44:20,252 --> 01:44:22,823
Hey, if it wasn't
for those stupid videos,

1815
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:25,057
Spider-Man would've never
found you.

1816
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:28,628
Spider-Man...? Spider-Man
follows me? I saved us, guys.

1817
01:44:28,761 --> 01:44:30,631
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1818
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,097
MJ!
Stop it!

1819
01:44:32,231 --> 01:44:33,567
I'm sorry, okay?

1820
01:44:33,699 --> 01:44:35,268
I'm obsessed
with telling the truth

1821
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:37,904
even if it hurts
other people's feelings.

1822
01:44:38,037 --> 01:44:40,073
I'm in love
with Spider-Man's aunt.

1823
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:45,578
We're sharing, right?

1824
01:45:24,717 --> 01:45:27,319
Your lies are over, Beck.

1825
01:45:27,453 --> 01:45:30,923
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1826
01:45:31,056 --> 01:45:32,426
EDITH?

1827
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:42,668
Just give me the glasses.

1828
01:45:42,802 --> 01:45:44,537
You want these?

1829
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:46,971
Come and get them.

1830
01:45:57,182 --> 01:45:58,484
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1831
01:46:23,476 --> 01:46:24,845
Why aren't
these drones firing?

1832
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:26,712
You're in the strike zone.

1833
01:46:26,846 --> 01:46:30,917
The chance of getting hit is...
No, fire all the drones now!

1834
01:46:49,335 --> 01:46:50,770
Beck!

1835
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:55,207
Beck.

1836
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:57,778
You lied to me.

1837
01:46:57,911 --> 01:47:00,646
And I trusted you.
I know.

1838
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,115
That's the most...

1839
01:47:03,248 --> 01:47:05,385
d-disappointing part.

1840
01:47:06,619 --> 01:47:08,555
You're a good person,
Peter.

1841
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:12,592
Such a weakness.

1842
01:47:14,694 --> 01:47:16,796
Stark was right.

1843
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,931
You do deserve them.

1844
01:47:30,076 --> 01:47:32,444
You can't trick me anymore.

1845
01:47:35,748 --> 01:47:38,118
EDITH,
turn off the drones.

1846
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:41,787
- Biometric scan complete.
- Welcome back, Peter.

1847
01:47:41,921 --> 01:47:43,724
Execute
all cancellation protocols?

1848
01:47:43,856 --> 01:47:44,957
Just do it.

1849
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:46,659
Execute them all.
Confirmed.

1850
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:57,837
Give me the spear.

1851
01:47:57,970 --> 01:47:59,439
That's a halberd. Ahem.

1852
01:48:04,476 --> 01:48:06,078
Thank you.

1853
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:12,985
How could you do all of this?
You'll see, Peter.

1854
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:18,390
People,
they need to believe.

1855
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:21,327
And nowadays...

1856
01:48:23,128 --> 01:48:25,497
they'll believe anything.

1857
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:37,243
Is he...?

1858
01:48:38,444 --> 01:48:39,845
Is this real?

1859
01:48:41,346 --> 01:48:43,649
All illusions are down, Peter.

1860
01:48:58,131 --> 01:48:59,600
Whoo! Yeah!

1861
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:01,266
Hey, where you going?

1862
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,275
MJ.
Hey.

1863
01:49:11,144 --> 01:49:12,377
Hey.
Hey.

1864
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:14,213
Are you okay?
I'm okay. Are you okay?

1865
01:49:14,346 --> 01:49:16,548
Yeah. Yeah.
Is everybody else okay?

1866
01:49:16,682 --> 01:49:19,418
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1867
01:49:19,551 --> 01:49:22,087
What happened?
There was just the drones,

1868
01:49:22,221 --> 01:49:25,490
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1869
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:28,761
Was that you?
Yeah.

1870
01:49:29,695 --> 01:49:31,230
Did you get him?

1871
01:49:33,966 --> 01:49:35,568
Yeah.
Well, I, um...

1872
01:49:37,069 --> 01:49:38,939
brought that.

1873
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:41,240
In case
you needed some help.

1874
01:49:41,373 --> 01:49:43,376
Thanks.

1875
01:49:44,577 --> 01:49:46,345
Anyway, uh,

1876
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:49,015
there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1877
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:51,952
I think he works for you
or something.

1878
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:53,086
He, um...

1879
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:54,621
He gave me this.

1880
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:56,689
No. No.

1881
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,626
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1882
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,761
I had this stupid plan.
Peter.

1883
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:03,764
I wrote it down,
I was gonna buy you this

1884
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:05,931
and give it to you in Paris
at the top...

1885
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:10,703
And you kissed me.

1886
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:13,372
What? What?
Yeah.

1887
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:15,375
I don't really have
much luck

1888
01:50:15,507 --> 01:50:18,878
when it comes
to getting close to people.

1889
01:50:19,011 --> 01:50:21,814
Um... So I lied.

1890
01:50:23,115 --> 01:50:24,484
I wasn't just watching you

1891
01:50:24,617 --> 01:50:27,753
because I thought
you were Spider-Man.

1892
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:33,126
That's great.

1893
01:50:34,594 --> 01:50:36,997
Black dahlia, like the murder.
The murder.

1894
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:39,131
Good.
Yeah. Heh.

1895
01:50:39,265 --> 01:50:40,833
Sorry it's broken.

1896
01:50:40,966 --> 01:50:43,703
I actually like it better
broken.

1897
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:46,105
I really like you.

1898
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:49,274
I really like you too.

1899
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:51,811
Uh...

1900
01:51:03,355 --> 01:51:05,457
Uh. Okay. I should...

1901
01:51:05,591 --> 01:51:08,493
I should probably get back
to the class.

1902
01:51:08,627 --> 01:51:10,029
I'll go and...

1903
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:13,533
Yeah. Heh. I don't know.
Heh. Okay.

1904
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:15,902
Just in case.

1905
01:51:23,976 --> 01:51:25,377
Yeah, no.

1906
01:51:25,511 --> 01:51:28,715
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1907
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,884
Yeah.
I'm glad he stayed too.

1908
01:51:31,016 --> 01:51:32,853
I gotta go.

1909
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,055
I'm glad you're alive.

1910
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:36,789
I guess the coded message
worked.

1911
01:51:36,922 --> 01:51:39,391
"Appearances can be
deceiving." Heh.

1912
01:51:39,524 --> 01:51:41,828
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1913
01:51:41,962 --> 01:51:44,329
It worked.
Because I had serious doubts

1914
01:51:44,463 --> 01:51:45,798
about Beck
from the beginning.

1915
01:51:45,931 --> 01:51:47,500
Not true.
He had zero doubts.

1916
01:51:51,171 --> 01:51:52,171
Where's Parker?

1917
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:53,538
He's with a girl.

1918
01:51:53,672 --> 01:51:56,208
I need to speak with him.

1919
01:51:56,341 --> 01:51:58,011
He'll call you.

1920
01:51:58,144 --> 01:51:59,712
He'll...?

1921
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:05,217
Okay. Great.

1922
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,087
Well, he better.

1923
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,320
Or it's your ass.

1924
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:13,025
And don't even think
about ghosting me.

1925
01:52:17,396 --> 01:52:19,932
d Hey, little girl d

1926
01:52:20,065 --> 01:52:23,403
d I wanna be
Your boyfriend d

1927
01:52:24,703 --> 01:52:27,073
d Sweet little girl... d

1928
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:32,045
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1929
01:52:32,177 --> 01:52:35,648
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1930
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:36,649
Ouch.

1931
01:52:36,783 --> 01:52:38,484
Except for me.

1932
01:52:38,618 --> 01:52:39,920
Aw. Thanks.

1933
01:52:40,052 --> 01:52:41,720
Don't be late.
I won't.

1934
01:52:41,854 --> 01:52:42,922
See you later.

1935
01:52:43,055 --> 01:52:45,457
You guys are so cute.
Thanks.

1936
01:52:45,591 --> 01:52:47,260
Uh...

1937
01:52:47,393 --> 01:52:50,796
I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1938
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,466
Oh, we broke up.

1939
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:54,900
No. What? Why?

1940
01:52:55,034 --> 01:52:57,337
Men and women
grow apart,

1941
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:59,171
but the journey
they share together

1942
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:01,407
will always be a part
of them.

1943
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:04,176
You are so wise.
Thank you.

1944
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:09,782
Hello, Gerald.

1945
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:12,118
Could Mother not make it?

1946
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:14,787
Hmm.

1947
01:53:17,923 --> 01:53:19,359
May!
I promise you... Ah!

1948
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:22,095
Oh, he's here.
Don't give me a ticket.

1949
01:53:22,228 --> 01:53:25,865
Heh. Ah.
Ooh. I'm so glad you're okay.

1950
01:53:25,998 --> 01:53:28,935
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1951
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:30,735
Let's go.
Where are your bags?

1952
01:53:30,871 --> 01:53:32,137
Oh, right.
They got blown up.

1953
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:33,939
Yeah. Heh.

1954
01:53:34,073 --> 01:53:35,408
I got you
hot buttered bagels.

1955
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:37,510
Thank you so much.
I know my boy.

1956
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:39,444
I kept my identity
pretty guarded

1957
01:53:39,578 --> 01:53:40,980
this past couple years.

1958
01:53:41,113 --> 01:53:42,782
I faced a lot of deception.

1959
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:45,751
And I'm tired of the lies.

1960
01:53:45,886 --> 01:53:48,587
So it's time for the truth
to be out there.

1961
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:52,158
Are you dating?

1962
01:53:53,158 --> 01:53:55,328
Yes.
Not really.

1963
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:57,162
What?
Well...

1964
01:53:57,296 --> 01:53:58,663
I think...
Summer fling.

1965
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:01,333
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1966
01:54:01,466 --> 01:54:03,103
I still don't know
where it's going.

1967
01:54:03,235 --> 01:54:04,604
Open to wherever
it might lead.

1968
01:54:04,737 --> 01:54:06,939
Anywhere. On or off.
To share it with people...

1969
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:08,875
We'll always be friends,
no matter what.

1970
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:10,710
I'm gonna go
because I've got a date.

1971
01:54:10,842 --> 01:54:13,313
...because we all
are interconnected.

1972
01:54:13,445 --> 01:54:14,514
- Bye.
- We are.

1973
01:54:27,693 --> 01:54:28,962
Whoo!

1974
01:54:33,298 --> 01:54:34,867
Sorry!

1975
01:54:39,338 --> 01:54:40,372
Whoa!

1976
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:43,208
Whoa.

1977
01:54:45,877 --> 01:54:47,180
Whoo!

1978
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:57,189
Whoo-hoo!

1979
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:12,738
Hey.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1980
01:55:12,872 --> 01:55:15,140
It's fine.
You ready?

1981
01:55:15,274 --> 01:55:16,908
Yeah.
You're gonna love this.

1982
01:55:17,042 --> 01:55:18,877
Okay! Okay!

1983
01:55:19,011 --> 01:55:20,779
Okay. Okay.
You ready?

1984
01:55:20,912 --> 01:55:24,083
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1985
01:55:26,118 --> 01:55:29,154
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking! Heh.

1986
01:55:29,288 --> 01:55:31,623
Whoo!

1987
01:55:46,405 --> 01:55:50,743
d Can't seem to get my mind

1988

You can put me down now!

2011
01:57:50,061 --> 01:57:51,663
You okay?

2012
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:54,434
Uh...

2013
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:57,002
Whoo! Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

2014
01:57:57,136 --> 01:57:59,604
Let's just...
Never, never doing that again.

2015
01:57:59,738 --> 01:58:01,407
I'm never doing that again.
Okay.

2016
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:03,208
I should probably
get out of here.

2017
01:58:03,342 --> 01:58:04,944
Be safe. Heh.
See you later.

2018
01:58:08,213 --> 01:58:10,283
This is breaking news.

2019
01:58:10,416 --> 01:58:13,286
We come with revelations about
last week's attack in London.

2020
01:58:13,418 --> 01:58:15,555
An anonymous source
provided this video.

2021
01:58:15,688 --> 01:58:18,423
It shows Quentin Beck,
aka Mysterio,

2022
01:58:18,557 --> 01:58:20,426
moments before his death.

2023
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,694
A warning, you may find
this video disturbing.

2024
01:58:22,828 --> 01:58:24,796
I managed to send the Elemental
through the rift,

2025
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:26,731
but I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

2026
01:58:26,865 --> 01:58:28,634
Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason.

2027
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:31,304
He has an army of weaponized
drones, Stark technology,

2028
01:58:31,436 --> 01:58:34,939
saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man.

2029
01:58:35,073 --> 01:58:37,777
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

2030
01:58:37,909 --> 01:58:39,612
There will be
significant casualties.

2031
01:58:39,744 --> 01:58:41,613
Do it. Execute them all.

2032
01:58:45,451 --> 01:58:48,520
This shocking video
was released earlier today

2033
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:50,155
on the controversial
news website

2034
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:51,756
TheDailyBugle.net.

2035
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:53,024
There you have it, folks,

2036
01:58:53,158 --> 01:58:55,127
conclusive proof
that Spider-Man

2037
01:58:55,261 --> 01:58:58,029
was responsible
for the murder of Mysterio,

2038
01:58:58,163 --> 01:58:59,631
an interdimensional warrior

2039
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,533
who gave his life
to protect our planet

2040
01:59:01,667 --> 01:59:04,002
and who will no doubt
go down in history

2041
01:59:04,136 --> 01:59:07,105
as the greatest superhero
of all time.

2042
01:59:07,239 --> 01:59:09,274
But that's not all, folks.

2043
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:10,710
Here's the real blockbuster.

2044
01:59:10,842 --> 01:59:12,612
Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit.

2045
01:59:12,744 --> 01:59:15,715
Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...

2046
01:59:18,184 --> 01:59:21,787
Spider-Man's name
is Peter Parker.

2047
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:23,189
What the fu...?

2048
02:07:24,837 --> 02:07:27,605
d Stop
Your messing around d

2049
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,342
d Better think
Of your future... d

2050
02:07:31,475 --> 02:07:33,444
You gotta tell him.

2051
02:07:34,846 --> 02:07:36,881
It was fine.

2052
02:07:37,015 --> 02:07:38,984
The little boy
handled it.

2053
02:07:39,118 --> 02:07:40,685
We helped.

2054
02:07:40,819 --> 02:07:41,820
Talos.
Come off it.

2055
02:07:41,953 --> 02:07:43,154
How was I supposed to know

2056
02:07:43,287 --> 02:07:44,622
that the whole thing
was fake?

2057
02:07:44,756 --> 02:07:47,025
I mean, that was all
very, very convincing.

2058
02:07:47,158 --> 02:07:48,694
The performances,
the illusion,

2059
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:50,729
that costume,
the craftsmanship in that.

2060
02:07:50,863 --> 02:07:54,033
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

2061
02:07:56,435 --> 02:07:59,003
Hey there. I hope your mission
is going well.

2062
02:07:59,137 --> 02:08:02,875
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

2063
02:08:03,007 --> 02:08:06,444
And it was very touching,
you know?

2064
02:08:06,578 --> 02:08:08,313
Really, really
quite touching.

2065
02:08:08,447 --> 02:08:09,715
Talos.

2066
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:13,786
Um... And, you know,
shortly after that,

2067
02:08:13,918 --> 02:08:15,619
it really kind of went
off the rails,

2068
02:08:15,755 --> 02:08:17,122
so we need you to come back.

2069
02:08:17,256 --> 02:08:19,291
Everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

2070
02:08:19,423 --> 02:08:20,893
I don't know
what to say to that,

2071
02:08:21,025 --> 02:08:23,228
so you're lucky
that Spider-Man won...

2072
02:08:45,449 --> 02:08:47,586
Everybody back to work!

2073
02:08:54,458 --> 02:08:56,328
Who's got my shoes?
