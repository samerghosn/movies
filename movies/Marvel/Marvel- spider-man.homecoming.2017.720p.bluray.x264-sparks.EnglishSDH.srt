2197
02:05:37,863 --> 02:05:39,445
You know who he is.

2198
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,534
If I knew who he was...

2199
02:05:45,704 --> 02:05:47,287
...he'd already be dead.

2200
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:54,703
Toomes, your family's here!

Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

2203
02:12:36,823 --> 02:12:40,783
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

2204
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,614
Patience.

2205
02:12:42,787 --> 02:12:44,904
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

2206
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:47,118
Sometimes it leads to very little...

2207
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:49,626
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

2208
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:51,286
And you wonder...

2209
02:12:51,463 --> 02:12:55,298
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

2210
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:01,005
How many more of these?
