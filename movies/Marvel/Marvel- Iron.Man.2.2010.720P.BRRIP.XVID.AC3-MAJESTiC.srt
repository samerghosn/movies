1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,580
<i>It's been a while since I was</i>

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,880
<i>up here in front of you
maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,780
<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the
events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,480
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

5
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,481
<i>that was bodyguard in a suit</i>

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,382
<i>that conveniently appeared, despite the fact
that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

7
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,981
<i>Yes.</i>

8
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:34,581
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

9
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:37,481
<i>somehow equipped with...</i>

10
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,981
<i>an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

11
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,582
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:45,182
<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

13
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:49,783
<i>and another thing entirely to make wild
accusations or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:55,683
<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

15
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:59,082
<i>I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

16
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:01,182
<i>largely public.</i>

17
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:02,683
<i>The truth is...</i>

18
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,183
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

19
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,284
Ivan...

20
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:21,186
Ivan?

21
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,186
That should be you.

22
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,787
Do not listen to these morons.

23
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:56,888
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:02,188
I can only offer you
my knowledge.

25
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:26,798
<i>Iron Man stabilizes East-West relations</i>

26
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,300
<i>7-0 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15000 feet.</i>

27
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,201
<i>You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.</i>

28
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:14,502
Six months later

29
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,809
It's good to be back!

30
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,608
You missed me.

31
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,511
- Blow something up!
- Blow something up?

32
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,110
I already did that.

33
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,310
I'm not saying that the
world is enjoying...

34
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,810
its longest period of
uninterrupted peace in years...

35
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,411
because of me.

36
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:32,310
I'm not saying...

37
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,312
that from the ashes of captivity...

38
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:40,812
never has a greater Phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

39
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,711
I'm not saying...

40
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:49,911
that Uncle Sam can kick back
on a lawn chair,...

41
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,012
sipping on iced tea,...

42
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,812
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough...

43
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,812
to go toe to toe with me
on my best day!

44
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:05,413
- I love you Tony!
- Please. It's not about me.

45
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:09,213
It's not about you.

46
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:14,014
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

47
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:17,913
It's about what we choose to leave behind
for future generations.

48
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:20,113
And that's why for the next year...

49
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,213
and for the first time since 1974,...

50
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,213
the best and brightest men and women

51
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,613
of nations and corporations
the world over...

52
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:30,113
will pool their resources
share their collective vision,

53
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:33,316
to leave behind
a brighter future.

54
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:35,115
It's not about us!

55
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,115
Therefore, what I am saying,
if I'm saying anything,

56
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:42,015
is welcome back to the Stark Expo!

57
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:49,316
Now, making a special guest appearance
from the great beyond,

58
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:50,716
to tell you what it's all about,

59
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,817
please welcome my father, Howard.

60
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:58,517
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

61
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,316
<i>Better living.
Robust health.</i>

62
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,817
<i>And for the first time in human history,</i>

63
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,917
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

64
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:10,116
<i>So from all of us here at Stark Industries,
I would like to personally introduce you to</i>

65
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:12,418
<i>The city of the future.</i>

66
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:16,418
<i>Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind.</i>

67
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:17,918
Blood toxicity 19%

68
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:23,317
<i>soon, technology will affect
the way you live your life every day.</i>

69
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,219
<i>No more tedious work,</i>

70
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,818
<i>leaving more time,
leisure activities</i>

71
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,818
<i>and enjoying sweet life.</i>

72
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,818
<i>The Stark Expo.
Welcome.</i>

73
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,019
We are coming to you live from the kick-off
of the Stark Expo

74
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,519
where Tony Stark
has just walked onstage.

75
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,619
Don't worry if you can't
make it down here now,

76
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,620
because this expo goes on all year long.

77
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,820
And I'm gonna be here checking out
all the attractions

78
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:53,821
and the pavillions and the inventions
from all around the world.

79
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,621
It's a zoo out there, watch out alright.

80
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,520
Open up. Let's go.

81
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,821
Nice to see you, alright.

82
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:01,322
Thank you.
I remember you.

83
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:04,822
- Call me.
- Hey, come on...

84
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,221
Hi there, dear friend.

85
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:08,422
It'll be a pleasure.

86
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:11,421
- See ya buddy.
- This is Larry.

87
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:14,121
The oracle of goracle.
What a pleasure, nice to see you.

88
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:15,621
Call me.

89
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,822
- Larry King.
- Larry!

90
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:19,822
Yes, my people, my people.

91
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:22,721
- Did it go pretty mellow?
- It wasn't so bad.

92
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,623
- No, it's perfect.

93
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,624
Look what we got here,
the new model.

94
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:28,523
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

95
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:29,822
Hi. And you are?

96
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,822
- Marshall. - Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you Tony

97
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,823
I'm on the wheel, you mind?

98
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:35,423
- Where you from?
- Bedford.

99
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:36,822
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

100
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:39,424
Yeah? You found me.

101
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,923
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

102
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:45,825
Yikes.

103
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,724
- He doesn't like to be handed things.
- Yeah I have a peeve.

104
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:52,323
You are hereby ordered to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

105
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,924
tomorrow morning at 9 am.

106
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:56,926
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge? - He likes the badge.

107
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,225
- You still like it?
- Yup.

108
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,426
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.?

109
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,226
250 miles.

110
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:12,226
Mr. Stark, can we pick up now
where we left off?

111
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:13,725
Mr. Stark?

112
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:15,225
- Please.
- Yes, dear?

113
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,025
- Can I have your attention?
- Absolutely.

114
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:20,225
Do you or do you not possess
a specialized weapon?

115
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,125
- I do not.
- You do not?

116
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:26,125
- I do not, well it depends how you define
the word weapon. - The Iron Man weapon.

117
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,226
My device does not fit
that description.

118
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:32,827
- Well, how would you describe your..?
- I would describe it by defining it as what it is, sir.

119
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,629
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

120
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:40,427
That is, that's actually the most
apt description I could make of it.

121
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:45,528
- It's a weapon Mr Stark I hate to inform you it's a weapon.
- Please, if your priority was actually the well-being...

122
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:50,428
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned
over to the people of the United States of America.

123
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,028
Well, you can forget it.

124
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:56,229
I am Iron Man.
The suit and I are one.

125
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,509
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be
to turn over myself, which is tantamount to

126
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,230
indentured servitude or prostitution

127
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,429
depending on what state you're in.

128
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,729
- I can't have it.
- Look, I am no expert.

129
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,130
In prostitution? Of course not,
you're a senator, come on!

130
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,730
I'm not an expert in weapons.

131
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:17,629
But we have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.
I would now like to call Justin Hammer

132
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,230
Our current primary weapons contractor.

133
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:25,230
Let the record reflect that I observe
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber

134
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:26,530
and I am wondering...

135
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:31,731
if and when any
actual expert will also be in attendance.

136
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,730
Absolutely. I am no expert.

137
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,731
I defer to you, Anthony.

138
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,631
You're the wonder boy.

139
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,432
Senator, if I may...

140
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:47,134
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

141
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,932
Your dad!

142
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:52,232
Howard Stark.
Really a father to us all.

143
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:54,933
And to the millitary-industrial age.

144
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:59,234
Let's just be clear, he was no flower child.
He was a lion.

145
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:00,933
We all know why we are here:

146
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,732
In the last six months,

147
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:06,634
Anthony Stark has created
a sword with untold possibilities.

148
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,534
And yet I insists it's a shield.

149
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,134
He asks us to trust him

150
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,134
as we cower behind it.

151
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,534
I wish I were comforted, Anthony.
I really do.

152
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:20,634
I'd like to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

153
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,235
but this ain't Canada.

154
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,934
You know we live in a world
of grave threats,

155
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,135
threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

156
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:32,636
Thank you. God bless
Iron Man, God bless America.

157
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:36,636
Well said, Mr. Hammer.

158
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:39,336
The committee would now like to invite

159
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:41,836
Lieut. Col. James Rhodes to the chamber.

160
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:43,236
Rhodey?

161
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:52,836
Hey, buddy. Didn't expect
to see you here.

162
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:56,538
Look, it's me. I'm here. Deal with it.
Let's move on.

163
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,138
- I just...
- Drop it. - Alright, I'll drop it.

164
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,739
I have before me a complete report on
the Iron Man weapon

165
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,337
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.

166
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,138
And Colonel, for the record,
can you please read page 57, paragraph 4?

167
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,938
You're requesting that I read specific
selections from my report, senator?

168
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,638
Yes, sir.

169
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,038
My understanding that I was going to be testifying
in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

170
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,837
I understand, a lot of
things have changed today.

171
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:21,639
You do understand that reading a single paragraph out
of context does not reflect the summary of my finding?

172
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,440
Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

173
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,240
Very well.

174
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:32,640
As he does not operate within any
definable branch of government,

175
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:38,441
The Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation

176
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,040
and to her interests.

177
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:45,040
I did, however, go on to summarize that the
benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities

178
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,741
and that it would be in our interest

179
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:49,940
to fold Mr Stark into the existing
chain of command.

180
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:53,442
I'm not a joiner but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

181
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,543
We can amend the hours a little bit.

182
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:00,942
I'd like to go on and show, if I may, the
imagery that's connected to your report.

183
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:05,743
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal
these images to the general public at this time.

184
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:08,942
With all due respect, Colonel, I understand.
And if you could just narrate those for us,

185
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,842
we'd be very grateful.

186
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,744
Show the images.

187
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:17,842
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

188
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:20,442
are in fact attempts at
making manned copies

189
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:22,543
of Mr. Stark's suit.

190
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:25,644
This has been corroborated by our allies

191
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:27,443
and local intelligence on the ground

192
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,845
indicating that these suits are

193
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,845
quite possibly at this moment operational.

194
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:34,945
Hold on a second buddy, let me see.

195
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:38,244
There's something here.
Oh, boy I'm good.

196
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,245
Now can I get more screens.

197
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:44,145
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

198
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,044
- Let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

199
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,644
If you'll direct your
attention to said screens,

200
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:51,245
I believe that's North Korea.

201
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:02,145
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

202
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:04,147
Iran.

203
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:09,547
No grave, immediate threat here.

204
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,548
Is that Justin Hammer?

205
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:14,147
How did Hammer get in here?

206
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:16,148
Justin, you're on TV, focus up.

207
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,849
Wow. Yeah, I'd say most
countries, 5-10 years away.

208
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,948
- Hammer Industries 20.
- I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.

209
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,249
I think we got the point that he's making.
I don't think there's any reason...

210
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:40,849
The point is you're welcome, I guess.

211
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,450
- For what?
- Because, I'm your nuclear deterrent.

212
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,048
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

213
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,249
You want my property?
You can't have it!

214
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,448
But did I you a big favor.

215
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,149
I've successfully privatized world peace.

216
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,649
What more do you want?

217
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,451
For now!

218
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,851
I'm tired of all of these ass clowns!

219
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,851
flap you Mr Stark.
flap you buddy.

220
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:08,751
- We're adjourned, we're adjourned for today.
- Okay

221
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:10,851
You've been a delight.

222
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,352
<i>My bond is with the people.</i>

223
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,652
<i>And I will serve this great nation</i>

224
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:24,353
<i>at the pleasure of myself.</i>

225
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,653
<i>One thing I've proven
is that you can count on me...</i>

226
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:29,252
<i>to pleasure myself.</i>

227
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:07,855
- Wake up, daddy's home.
- Welcome home, sir.

228
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,654
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success.

229
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,757
As was your Senate hearing.

230
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:17,856
And may I say how refreshing it is to finally
see you in a video with your clothing on, sir?

231
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:22,156
You!

232
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:26,397
I swear to god I'll dismantle you, I'll switch
your motherboard and turn you into wine rack.

233
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:31,156
How many ounces a day of this gargle
am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:34,857
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

235
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:38,157
Check palladium levels.

236
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:42,857
Blood toxicity: 24%

237
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:48,259
It appears that the continued use of the Iron
Man suit is accelerating your condition.

238
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,459
Another core has been depleted.

239
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:57,759
God, they're running out quick.

240
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,458
I have run simulations
on every known element

241
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:04,058
and none can serve as a viable
replacement for the palladium core.

242
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,259
You are running out of both time
and options.

243
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,759
Unfortunately, the device that's keeping
you alive, is also killing you.

244
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,759
Ms. Potts is approaching.
I recommended that you inform her of...

245
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,060
Mute.

246
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:28,761
Is this a joke?

247
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,560
What are you thinking?

248
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,260
- What?
- What are you thinking?

249
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:36,461
Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy
and you're angry about something.

250
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,361
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.
Keep your distance

251
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:43,061
Did you just donate our entire
modern art collection to the...

252
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,362
- Boy Scouts of America?
- Yes it is a...

253
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:47,162
worthwhile organization.

254
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:50,561
I didn't physically check the crates,
but basically yes.

255
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,762
And it's not our collection,
it's my collection. No offense.

256
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:56,561
No, you know what I think I'm actually
entitled to say Our collection,

257
00:19:56,563 --> 00:20:00,762
considering the time that I've put in
over 10 years curating that.

258
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:01,961
It's a tax write-off, I needed that.

259
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,262
You know, there's only about 8,011 things

260
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:07,064
that I really need to talk to you about.

261
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:10,064
Dummy, hey stop now the bridgeport's
already machining that part.

262
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:12,463
The expo is a gigantic waste of time.

263
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:16,163
- I need you to wear a surgical mask until you're
feeling better is that okay? - That's rude.

264
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,765
There's nothing more important
to me than the Expo.

265
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:19,263
It's my primary point of concern.
I don't know why you...

266
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:22,565
The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

267
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,265
Wow, look at that.

268
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,263
That's modern art.
That's going up.

269
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,066
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

270
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,365
Stark is in complete disarray.
Do you understand that?

271
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,565
No, our stocks have never been higher...

272
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:39,865
- Yes from a managerial standpoint.
- Well if it's messy, then let's double back. Let's move on to another subject.

273
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:43,766
Oh, no no no, you are not taking down the
Barnett Newman and hanging that up!

274
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:46,365
I'm not taking it down, I'm just replacing
it with this, let's see where I can get...

275
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:47,967
Ok fine. My point is

276
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:51,567
We have already awarded contracts
to the windfarm people,

277
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,365
Don't say windfarm, I'm
already feeling gassy.

278
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:55,267
And to the Plastic Plantation Tree,
which was your idea by the way.

279
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:58,267
- Those people are on payroll, and you won't make a decision.
- Everything was my idea,

280
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:00,067
I don't care about the
liberal agenda anymore.

281
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,467
It's boring, boring!
I'm giving you a boring order,

282
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:03,666
you do it.

283
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,967
I do what?

284
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:07,468
Excellent idea, I just figured this out.
You run the company.

285
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,968
- Yeah, i'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

286
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,067
- Well stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not give me the information that I need

287
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:16,468
- I need you to do it.
- I am trying to do it but...

288
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:19,368
You're not listening to me.
I'm trying to make you CEO.

289
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,269
Why won't you let me?

290
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,470
Have you been drinking?

291
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:25,469
Uh, chlorophyl.

292
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,769
I hereby irrevocably appoint you

293
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,470
Chairman and CEO
of Stark Industries effective immediately.

294
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:36,769
Yeah, done deal.

295
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,369
Actually, I've given this
a fair amount of thought.

296
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:44,471
Believe it or not. Been doing a bit of
a headhunting so to speak...

297
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,672
trying to figure out who
a worthy successor would be.

298
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,971
And then I realized...

299
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,471
it's you.
It's always been you.

300
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:59,971
I thought there'd be a legal issue,
but actually

301
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,672
I'm capable of appointing my successor,

302
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,372
my successor being you.

303
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:09,471
Congratulations!

304
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:12,071
Take it, just take it.

305
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:14,173
- I don't know what to think.
- Don't think, drink.

306
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:05,476
Notary is here! Can you please come
sign the transfer paperworks?

307
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:06,776
I'm on Happy's count!

308
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:14,675
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

309
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:16,678
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

310
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,376
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

311
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,877
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

312
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:32,778
I need you to initial each box.

313
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:35,878
Lesson one:
Never take your eye off...

314
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:39,877
That's it I'm done.

315
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,077
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman, Natalie Rushman.

316
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:43,778
Front and center, come in to the church.

317
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:47,679
- No, you're seriously not gonna...
- If it pleases the Court, which it does.

318
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,979
- No problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

319
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,881
What?

320
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,980
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

321
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:15,082
What?

322
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:16,980
Who is she?

323
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,681
She is from legal and she is potentially

324
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:23,080
a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

325
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:25,381
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need an assistant boxer. I need an assistant.

326
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,980
Yes, and I have three excellent potential
candidates that are lined up and ready to beat you.

327
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:33,282
- I don't have time to meet. I need someone
now I feel like it's her. - No it's not.

328
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,080
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

329
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:38,282
Like Tae Bo, booty boot camp, crunch,
something like that?

330
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:42,882
- How do we spell your name Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

331
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:46,183
- What are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

332
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:51,282
- Oh wow. Very, very impressive individual...
- You're so predictable, you know that?

333
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:53,183
She's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin...

334
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:54,383
Who speaks Latin?

335
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:56,784
No one speaks Latin. It's a dead language.

336
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:01,383
You can read Latin or you can write,
but you can't speak Latin so...

337
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,584
- Did you model in Tokyo?
Cause she modelled in Tokyo. - No.

338
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,983
I need her, she's got
everything that I need.

339
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:07,384
Rule number one: Never take your eye off
your opponent.

340
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,385
Oh my God!

341
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:15,984
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

342
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:18,184
- I slipped.
- You did?

343
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,986
Looks like a TKO to me.

344
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:27,285
- Just, um, I need your impression.
- You have quite reserved, I don't know...

345
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:29,886
- I meant your fingerprints.
- Right.

346
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:35,886
- So, how're we doing?
- Great. Just half done,... hey.

347
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:38,686
You're the boss.

348
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:40,486
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

349
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:41,385
- No.
- Yes.

350
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,887
That will be all, Ms. Rushman.
Thank you very much.

351
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:48,988
- I want one.
- No.

352
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:02,587
Welcome to the Historic Grand Prix
of Monaco.

353
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:05,689
This year's race will be exciting...

354
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,190
It's Europe, whatever happens the next
twenty minutes just go with it.

355
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:28,890
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey

356
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,790
- How was your flight?
- It was excellent.

357
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:34,250
- Oh it's nice to see you.
- We have one photographer from the ACM if you don't mind.

358
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:37,789
- When did this happen?
- You made me do it.

359
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,291
- I made you do what?
- Smile and you. Look there.

360
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:41,790
Stop acting constipated.

361
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,490
- You are so predictable.
- Do not inflate your nostrils.

362
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:45,391
- Right this way.
- Thanks, you look fantastic.

363
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:47,992
- Why thank you very much.
- But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?

364
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,991
We have a 9.30 dinner.

365
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,593
- Perfect I'll be there at 11. Is this ours?
- It can be.

366
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:55,291
Great, make it ours.

367
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,291
Mr. Musk, how are you?

368
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,192
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

369
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:02,491
Elon, those Merlin engines
are fantastic.

370
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:04,491
Thanks. I got an idea
for an electric jet.

371
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,794
You do? Then we'll make it work.

372
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:10,792
- You want a massage? - Oh god no I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an appointment.

373
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:12,893
I do not want Natalie to do anything.

374
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:14,993
- By the way I didn't mean to spring this on you.
- Thank you very much.

375
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:16,893
Green is not your best color.

376
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:18,693
Anthony, is that you?

377
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:21,295
My least favorite person on earth,
Justin Hammer. - How you doing?

378
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:24,394
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

379
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:27,493
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair? You guys know each other?

380
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:28,894
- Hi.
- Yes.

381
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,694
- Yes!
- Yes, roughly.

382
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:32,894
BTW, big story,

383
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:35,194
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

384
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:37,596
- Congratulations.
- My editor will kill me...

385
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,493
if I don't grab a quote
for our Powerful Women issue.
- Oh.

386
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:40,996
- Can I?
- Sure.

387
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:43,195
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

388
00:27:43,296 --> 00:27:45,497
- I am.
- I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

389
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:50,296
She did quite a spread on
Tony last year.

390
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:53,194
- And she wrote a story as well.
- It was very impressive.

391
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:54,896
- That was good.
- Very well done.

392
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:58,197
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Do not leave me.

393
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:01,196
- How you doing? You look great.
- Please, this is hard.

394
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:06,196
- So is this the first time that...
- Oh, god that's so awful.

395
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:09,596
Listen, it's the first time you've
seen each other since the Senate?

396
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:13,397
- Since he got his contract revoked.
- Actually, it's on hold.

397
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:14,696
That's not what I heard.

398
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:17,497
What's the difference between
on hold and canceled? The truth?

399
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,896
No. The truth is, oh put that away,

400
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:24,298
The truth is I'm actually hoping to
present something at your expo.

401
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:27,618
Well, if you invent something that works,
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

402
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,500
- Mr. Stark?
- Yes.

403
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,098
- He's kidding,...
- Your corner table is ready.

404
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:33,799
- I actually have a slot, yes I do.
- Hammer needs a 'slot.'

405
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:38,099
- We'll give him. - We kid, we're kidders.

406
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,701
Got any other bad ideas?

407
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:13,903
Tony and I, Tony,
I love Tony Stark.

408
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,901
Tony loves me.
We're not competitors.

409
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:19,603
Him being out of the picture created tremendous
opportunity for Hammer Industries you know.

410
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:23,501
Everything that Tony and
I do is a healthy...

411
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,304
<i>What's the use of having and owning
a race car,</i>

412
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:28,603
competition.

413
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,002
<i>if you don't drive it?</i>

414
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,203
Is he driving?

415
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:41,804
Natalie! Natalie!

416
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:44,003
- Yes?
- Did you know about this?

417
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,805
This is the first time I hear it.

418
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,604
- That cannot happen.
- Absolutely, I understand. How can I help you?

419
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,403
- Where is Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

420
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,006
- Ok get him, I need Happy.
- Right away.

421
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:55,805
Tony is, we're, you know...

422
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:58,405
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

423
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,104
You know what?
Can you excuse me just one second?

424
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:02,224
- Why don't you just read me what you wrote?
- I will.

425
00:30:02,306 --> 00:30:05,605
- After I make one quick phone call.
- Where are you going?

426
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:08,367
- I got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff, I'll be right back!

427
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:26,211
<i>That asshole just goes inside the track!</i>

428
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,713
<i>God!</i>

429
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:10,115
Go, go!

430
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:14,714
Hang on!

431
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:25,420
- Give me the case.
- Here, take it.

432
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,219
- Where is the key!
- It's in my pocket.

433
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,721
Car!

434
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:42,724
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

435
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:45,824
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I wanted to scare him.

436
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:47,925
- Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

437
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:49,425
- Better security.
- Get in the car!

438
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,226
- I was attacked!
- You're a jerk!

439
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:52,425
- We need better security.
- Get in the car!

440
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:55,726
Better security measures!
God it's embarrassing.

441
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:58,525
First vacation in two years.

442
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,927
Oh my god!

443
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,827
- I got him!
- Hit him again, hit him again!

444
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:10,728
Give me the case.

445
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,228
- I hit him!
- Give me the case!

446
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:19,927
Give him the case!

447
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:26,628
Oh, god!

448
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:31,628
Give me the case! Please!
Come on!

449
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,335
You'll lose!

450
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:14,835
You'll lose. You'll lose, Stark.

451
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:37,038
We've checked his fingerprints. Nothing.
Not even a name.

452
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:39,538
- Where are we going?
- There.

453
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:41,936
He may not understand us.

454
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:45,237
In fact, he has not even spoken.

455
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,538
Five minutes.

456
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,440
Pretty decent tech. Cycles
per second were a little low.

457
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,041
You could double up your rotations,

458
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,739
You focused the Repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

459
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,641
Effective.

460
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:31,340
Not very efficient.
But it's passable enough though.

461
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:36,440
I don't get it. With a little fine tuning
you could've made a solid paycheck,

462
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:38,541
if you sold it to North Korea,
China,

463
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:42,141
Iran, or gone right to
the black market.

464
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,942
You look like you got
friends in low places.

465
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:48,041
You come from a

466
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:51,742
family of thieves and butchers.

467
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:55,443
And now, like all guilty men,

468
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,744
try to rewrite your own history

469
00:38:59,643 --> 00:39:02,242
and you forget all the lives

470
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,543
that Stark family has destroyed.

471
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,943
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

472
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:12,344
My father.
Anton Vanko.

473
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:14,643
Well I've never heard of him.

474
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:19,143
My father is the reason you're alive.

475
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,445
The reason I'm alive is cause you had
a shot, you took it and you missed.

476
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:24,445
Did I?

477
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:29,545
If you can make god bleed

478
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:32,545
people will cease to believe him.

479
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:37,144
And there will be blood in the water.

480
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:39,045
And the sharks will come.

481
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:44,347
The truth, all they have
to do is sit and watch

482
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:47,746
as the world will consume you.

483
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:50,246
Where will you be watching the world
consume me from?

484
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,547
That's right.

485
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:53,746
A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

486
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:56,447
Hey Tony, before you go,

487
00:39:56,447 --> 00:40:00,248
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

488
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:20,847
<i>It's just unbelievable it proves
the genie is out of the bottle</i>

489
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:23,347
<i>and this man
has no idea what he's doing</i>

490
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:27,250
<i>He thinks of the Iron Man
weapon as a toy.</i>

491
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:32,050
<i>I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark in fact was adamant</i>

492
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,748
<i>that these suits can't exist,</i>

493
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,349
<i>anywhere else, don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else</i>

494
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:41,650
<i>at least for 5-10 years
and here we are in Monaco</i>

495
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,550
<i>realizing, uh-oh, these suits exist now</i>

496
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,650
Mute.

497
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,750
He should be giving me a medal.

498
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,951
That's the truth.

499
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:57,050
What is that?

500
00:40:57,052 --> 00:41:00,351
This is your in-flight meal.

501
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,351
- Did you just make that?
- Yeah.

502
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:07,652
Where do you think I've
been for three hours?

503
00:41:08,452 --> 00:41:10,753
Tony...

504
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,353
What are you not telling me?

505
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:21,452
I don't want to go home...

506
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,552
at all.

507
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:26,652
Let's cancel
my birthday party and

508
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,054
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Chipriani.

509
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,253
- Remember?
- Oh yes.

510
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,853
It's a great place to...

511
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:34,853
be healthy.

512
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:38,054
I don't think this is the right time.

513
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:40,152
We are in a kind of a mess.

514
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:42,355
Yeah but maybe that's
why it's the best time.

515
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:44,653
Wow, I think as the CEO I need to

516
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:47,954
show up. - As CEO
you are entitled to a

517
00:41:48,855 --> 00:41:50,954
- leave?
- Company retreat.

518
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:53,054
A retreat? During a time like this?

519
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:56,356
I'm just saying to recharge our batteries
and figure it all out.

520
00:41:56,755 --> 00:42:00,456
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

521
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:35,559
<i>Have fun with the Püree</i>

522
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:29,460
Prisoner stop!

523
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:31,963
What are you doing?

524
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:15,065
Hey, here he is!

525
00:44:15,065 --> 00:44:18,065
There he is!

526
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,465
What an absolute pleasure.

527
00:44:20,465 --> 00:44:22,364
Welcome.

528
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:27,065
Goodness gracious, can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

529
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,166
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

530
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,164
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

531
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,166
I didn't wanna...

532
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,766
make a first impression like this.

533
00:44:34,768 --> 00:44:37,266
He's not an animal. Come on.

534
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:39,465
He's a human being.

535
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:42,168
Thank you.

536
00:44:42,668 --> 00:44:44,867
Leave us.

537
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,068
Oui, oui, I'm fine.

538
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:50,766
My name is Justin Hammer.

539
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,766
I'd like to do some business with you.

540
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:54,869
Please sit.

541
00:44:57,768 --> 00:45:00,768
Dig in.
What do we have today, Jack?

542
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:02,068
Some salmon carpaccio, sir.

543
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:03,869
Salmon carpaccio?

544
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:07,268
Anything you want here, we got it.

545
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:09,268
I like my dessert first.

546
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:11,268
I had this flown in from
San Francisco.

547
00:45:11,268 --> 00:45:13,168
It's Italian though.

548
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,168
Organic ice cream.

549
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,168
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do too

550
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,469
for Tony Stark.

551
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,168
When I saw what you do to
Tony Stark on that track

552
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,070
how you stepped up to him in front of
god and everybody,

553
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,268
that was wow!

554
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,369
You spoke to me was what you did.

555
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:33,271
And I know that you knew that
I'd be listening.

556
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:36,869
This is why I couldn't bear to have
you shipped off to god knows where.

557
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:38,871
It would've been such a waste of talent.

558
00:45:38,871 --> 00:45:40,869
But if I might make a suggestion you know
you don't just go

559
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,871
and try to kill the guy. I think...

560
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:45,871
if I may,

561
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,871
you go after his legacy.

562
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:49,871
That's what you should kill.

563
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:52,873
You and me we're a lot
alike in a lot of ways.

564
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:55,871
The only difference between you and I

565
00:45:55,871 --> 00:45:58,371
is that I have resources.

566
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:00,871
I think, if I may,

567
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:02,871
you need my resources.

568
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:04,871
Someone behind you.

569
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:07,972
A benefactor.
I'd like to be that guy.

570
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:21,373
Okay.
Do you speak English,

571
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:24,373
because I can get a translator.

572
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,773
I don't know if you've been understanding
everything I'm saying.

573
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:29,373
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

574
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,474
Very good, man.

575
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,574
- Yes.
- I want my bird.

576
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,375
A bird?

577
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,375
- You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

578
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:45,375
I can get you bird
I can get you ten birds.

579
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:47,375
- I want my bird.
- Okay,

580
00:46:47,376 --> 00:46:49,376
nothing's impossible.

581
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:52,976
I could, are we talking about...
is this a bird back in Russia?

582
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:56,476
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company
are still very, very strong.

583
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:00,275
Despite the events in Monaco.

584
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,376
Oh, oh, fax them.

585
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:04,376
- Where is he?
- He doesn't wanna be disturbed.

586
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:07,376
He's downstairs.

587
00:47:07,378 --> 00:47:09,376
<i>His continuing erratic behavior</i>

588
00:47:09,378 --> 00:47:11,677
<i>may lead many people to ask themselves</i>

589
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:13,777
<i>can this man still protect us?</i>

590
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:15,476
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.

591
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:18,376
The events in Monaco prove that.

592
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,378
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>

593
00:47:20,378 --> 00:47:22,876
<i>Anton Vanko was
a Soviet physicist</i>

594
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:26,077
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

595
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,378
<i>However, he was accused of espionage
and was</i>

596
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,378
<i>deported in 1967.</i>

597
00:47:30,378 --> 00:47:32,378
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,</i>

598
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:36,378
<i>was convicted of selling
Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium</i>

599
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:40,378
<i>to Pakistan and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.</i>

600
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,480
<i>No further records exist.</i>

601
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,378
Tony, you gotta get upstair
and get on top of this situation right now.

602
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,280
Listen, I've been on the phone with the
National Guard

603
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,980
all day

604
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:58,679
trying to talk them out of
rolling tanks and the PCH

605
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:01,179
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

606
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,280
They're gonna take your suits, Tony,

607
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,181
they're sick of the games.

608
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:08,179
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for twenty years.

609
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:11,181
Well guess what,
somebody else had it yesterday.

610
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:14,382
It's not theoretical anymore.

611
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:18,382
Are you listening to me?

612
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:22,181
Are you okay?

613
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:25,382
Let's go.

614
00:48:30,182 --> 00:48:33,382
- Are you alright?
- Yeah I should go to my desk.

615
00:48:33,483 --> 00:48:36,384
- See that cigar box?
- Yes.

616
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:39,684
It's palladium.

617
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:46,483
Is that supposed to be smoking?

618
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:48,483
If you must know
it's neutron damage.

619
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:51,585
It's from that reactor wall.

620
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:57,686
You had this in your body?

621
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,585
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

622
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,585
Rogue rash.

623
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:12,585
Thank you.

624
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,686
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

625
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:29,487
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act

626
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:32,487
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

627
00:49:32,487 --> 00:49:34,487
You know I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

628
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:36,487
But you gotta trust me.

629
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,688
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

630
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,487
This is where we do it
This is my humble abode.

631
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,487
You can work in absolute peace.

632
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:56,588
Must be kinda fun to be dead, right
No pressure.

633
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:59,489
Ah, here they are.
They're excited, they're combat ready.

634
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,489
I may have done a few miscalculations and

635
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:03,489
rushed the prototype, but sue me,

636
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:06,690
I'm enthusiastic.
Go ahead, take a look around.

637
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,489
Oh, you don't wanna do that.

638
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:17,489
You'll be able to access that as soon as
we generate some encrypted passcodes.

639
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,891
Can we generate some encrypted passcodes?
Let's get some of those...

640
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,490
encrypted passcodes, Jack.

641
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,590
Nevermind.

642
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,592
Wow, okay. Good stuff.

643
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,692
- Sorry?
- Software shooot.

644
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:42,492
You're good.

645
00:50:42,492 --> 00:50:45,592
You really blasted and
passed the firewall there.

646
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:49,492
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

647
00:50:49,492 --> 00:50:52,492
Go ahead, take a look.

648
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:54,692
Take a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

649
00:50:54,693 --> 00:50:57,693
You know they're really
just for show and tell.

650
00:50:58,494 --> 00:51:01,693
They're 125.7 million a pop.

651
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,492
Jeez, could you get somebody to help?

652
00:51:07,494 --> 00:51:10,494
That's where the pilot goes.

653
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:13,695
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

654
00:51:14,494 --> 00:51:17,695
I'll take care of that just leave it.

655
00:51:17,896 --> 00:51:19,494
What you want them do?

656
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,494
Long term
I want them to put me in

657
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:24,494
the Pentagon for the
next 25 years.

658
00:51:24,494 --> 00:51:26,594
I wanna make Iron Man look
like an antique.

659
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:28,494
I wanna go to that Stark Expo

660
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:30,594
and take a dump on Tony's front yard.

661
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:33,094
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Ya I can do that.

662
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:34,594
- Yes?
- No problem.

663
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:36,596
Hey, fabulous I love it.

664
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:39,697
This is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

665
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:51,596
Do you know which watch you'd like
to wear tonight Mr. Stark?

666
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:54,697
I'll give them a look.

667
00:51:56,496 --> 00:51:58,597
I should cancel the party now?

668
00:51:58,597 --> 00:52:01,496
- Probably.
- Yeah, cause it's, um...

669
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:04,496
- Ill-timed.
- Right, sends the wrong message.

670
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:07,699
Inappropriate.

671
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:14,498
Is that dirty enough for you?

672
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,599
Gold faced with the brown band...

673
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:19,498
The Jaeger.
I'll give that a look.

674
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,699
Bring them over here.

675
00:52:23,498 --> 00:52:26,699
I'll take that.
Why don't you...

676
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:40,599
I gotta say it's hard to
get a read on you.

677
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:43,701
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

678
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:48,701
Can I ask you a question hypothetically?
It's a bit odd.

679
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:55,101
If this was your last birthday party you're
ever gonna have how would you celebrate it?

680
00:52:57,501 --> 00:53:00,001
I'd do whatever I wanted to do.

681
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:02,702
With whoever I wanted to do it.

682
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,503
Yes, sir, I understand.

683
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,704
No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

684
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:43,704
Sir, I personally guarantee that
within 24 hours

685
00:53:43,706 --> 00:53:45,804
Iron Man will be back on watch.

686
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,605
Hey, Pepper...

687
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:58,806
- I'm gonna go get some air.
- What's wrong?

688
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:02,806
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

689
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:10,606
- That's it, I'm gonna make a...
- No, no, don't call anyone.

690
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:12,606
This is ridiculous I just stuck my neck up
for this guy.

691
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:15,606
I know. I get it. I'm gonna handle it okay,
just let me handle it.

692
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:18,708
Handle it, or I'm gonna have to.

693
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:23,447
You know the question I get asked most often is
Tony how do you go to the bathroom with the suit?

694
00:54:26,608 --> 00:54:29,708
Just like that.

695
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:34,809
Does this guy know how to throw a party
or what?

696
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,608
I love you.

697
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,510
Unbelievable. Thank you so much
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a

698
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,608
wonderful night. We're gonna say
Good night now

699
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,608
and thank you all for coming.

700
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,809
No, no, wait, we can't, we didn't bring out
the cake we didn't blow out the candle.

701
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:55,608
- You're out of control okay
- I'm out of control?

702
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,509
- Trust me on this one okay?
- You're out of control gorgeous

703
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,708
- It's time to go to bed.
- Give me a little smooch.

704
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,610
Come on you know you want to.

705
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,710
You just peed the suit.

706
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,010
- I know, has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

707
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,610
- You can drink that water.
- Just send everybody home, okay.

708
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,610
- It's time to...
- If you say so.

709
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,610
Okay, I'll take this.

710
00:55:12,612 --> 00:55:15,610
You take that.

711
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,610
Pepper Potts.

712
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:20,610
She's right.
The party is over.

713
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:23,612
Then again the party was over for me
like an hour and a half ago.

714
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:26,811
The after party
starts in 15 minutes!

715
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:32,811
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it,

716
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:35,713
there's the door.

717
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:48,713
Shoot!

718
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:57,815
Shoot!

719
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:08,815
Shoot!

720
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:14,815
Me!

721
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,815
I think she wants the Gallanger!

722
00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:23,815
There you go!

723
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:29,815
I'm only gonna say this once.

724
00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:35,617
Get out!

725
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:43,617
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

726
00:56:44,518 --> 00:56:47,516
Goldstein.

727
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:48,518
Yes, Mr. Stark?

728
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:51,617
Give me a fat beat to beat
my buddy's ass to...

729
00:56:55,617 --> 00:56:58,619
I told you to shut it down.

730
00:57:08,518 --> 00:57:11,619
Now, put that thing back where you found it
before someone gets hurt.

731
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,719
Really?

732
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:31,221
Sorry pal, but
Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

733
00:57:31,922 --> 00:57:35,621
Suck at this!

734
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:44,420
Had enough?

735
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:46,521
- Natalie!
- Ms. Potts...

736
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:50,422
Don't you Ms. Potts me. I'm on to you.
You know what, ever since you came here...

737
00:57:54,422 --> 00:57:57,422
Pepper!

738
00:57:57,422 --> 00:58:00,623
Let's get out of here!

739
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,724
You want it?
Take it!

740
00:58:30,525 --> 00:58:33,726
Out!

741
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:50,525
Put your hand down.

742
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:52,525
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

743
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:54,527
- We don't have to do this, Tony.
- You wanna be a war machine?

744
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:57,025
- Take your shot.
- Put it down!

745
00:58:57,027 --> 00:58:59,626
- You're gonna take your shot?
- Put it down, now!

746
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:02,726
- Drop it Tony
- Take it!

747
01:00:12,032 --> 01:00:16,333
<i>Tower this is Lt. Col. James Rhodes
eastbound for 3 miles,...</i>

748
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:03,237
Colonel.

749
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,835
Major.

750
01:01:08,436 --> 01:01:09,536
Yeah.

751
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:13,735
Let's take it inside.

752
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,036
<i>Clear the area.</i>

753
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:41,838
Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the donut.

754
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,139
I told you I don't wanna
join your super secret boyband.

755
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,840
No, see, I remember, you do
everything myself.

756
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,940
How's it workin out for you?

757
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,440
I'm sorry, I don't wanna get off on the wrong
foot, do I look in the patch or the eye?

758
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:04,840
Honestly I'm a bit hungover
I'm not sure if you're real or if...

759
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:09,440
I am very real. I'm the realest
person you're ever gonna meet.

760
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,240
- Just my luck. Where is the staff here?
- Oh, that's not lookin too good.

761
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,541
It's getting worse.

762
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:21,001
We've secured the perimeter, but I don't
think we should hold it for too much longer.

763
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,342
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

764
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:31,541
- Tony... I want you to meet agent Romanoff
- Hi

765
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:35,543
I'm a Shield shadow
and I was tasked to you by Dr. Fury.

766
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:37,143
I suggest you apologize.

767
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:39,242
You've been very busy.

768
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:42,842
Made your girl your CEO,
you've given away all your stuff.

769
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,043
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

770
01:02:45,043 --> 01:02:47,543
- If I didn't know better...
- You don't know better.

771
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:50,143
I didn't give it to him.
He took it.

772
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:55,344
He took it? You're Iron Man
and he just took it?

773
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:57,943
Little brother walked in there
kicked your ass and took your suit?

774
01:02:57,943 --> 01:02:59,543
Is that possible?

775
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:02,143
According to Mr. Stark's database
security guidelines

776
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:05,244
There are redundancies to prevent
unauthorized usage.

777
01:03:07,844 --> 01:03:10,244
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? No, no, no!

778
01:03:10,344 --> 01:03:12,344
What do you want from me.

779
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:16,344
You have become a problem, a problem
I have to deal with.

780
01:03:16,346 --> 01:03:19,744
- Contrary to your belief, you are not
the center of my universe. - Yeah I get it.

781
01:03:19,746 --> 01:03:24,045
I have bigger problems than you in the
Southwest region to deal with. Hit him.

782
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:28,646
Are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

783
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:32,346
Could you please not do anything
awful for 5 seconds?

784
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:33,746
What did you just do to me?

785
01:03:33,746 --> 01:03:36,146
What did we just do for you.

786
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:40,146
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.
We're trying to get you back to work.

787
01:03:40,347 --> 01:03:44,746
- Give me a couple of boxes and I'll be right as rain.
- It's not a cure, it's just to break the symptoms.

788
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:49,447
- Then the lag is gonna be an easy fix.
- Trust me I know I'm good at this stuff.

789
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:52,246
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

790
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:56,148
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

791
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:59,748
Well, I'm here to tell you
you haven't tried them all.

792
01:04:01,248 --> 01:04:04,048
Hey, hey, hey.
Special delivery.

793
01:04:04,248 --> 01:04:05,748
Candygram!

794
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:11,849
I brought you something.

795
01:04:16,248 --> 01:04:19,550
- We got you the bird, pal.
- This is not my bird.

796
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:23,248
What do you mean?
That's the bird.

797
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,949
I pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

798
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,349
- It's a great bird.
- It's a beautiful bird.

799
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:31,751
- We got this all the way from Russia.
- Hey man, it's not my bird.

800
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:38,050
Well listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean this is a gorgeous bird.

801
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,050
I mean, look, don't get so attached to
things, learn to let go.

802
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:47,952
Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

803
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:51,351
Is that...
That's not a helmet. What is that?

804
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:03,452
Ivan... What's this?
Jack?

805
01:05:04,253 --> 01:05:08,952
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me.
How are you supposed to get a head in there?

806
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:12,251
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No. - Try to put your head in there.

807
01:05:12,253 --> 01:05:14,153
Go ahead, try to put your head in there.

808
01:05:14,253 --> 01:05:16,753
See Ivan, he can't put his head in
there. That's...

809
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:19,452
That's not a helmet, it's a head.

810
01:05:19,454 --> 01:05:20,853
I need to put a guy in there.

811
01:05:20,853 --> 01:05:24,853
I need to fit a person
in that suit, you understand?

812
01:05:25,153 --> 01:05:26,253
Drone better.

813
01:05:26,353 --> 01:05:28,153
What? Drone better?
Why is drone better?

814
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:30,054
Why drone better?

815
01:05:30,054 --> 01:05:31,954
People make problem.

816
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,954
Trust me, drone better.

817
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:38,755
Ivan, you know I like you.
I got you the bird.

818
01:05:39,355 --> 01:05:44,054
You said no problem. That's what you
said to me, you said no problem.

819
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:47,054
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

820
01:05:47,056 --> 01:05:49,155
Like Iron Man, you understand?

821
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:52,556
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

822
01:05:53,056 --> 01:05:54,657
Hey, man...

823
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:59,056
Don't get to attached to things.

824
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,956
Learn to let go.

825
01:06:04,257 --> 01:06:07,657
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

826
01:06:07,657 --> 01:06:11,358
You understand? They better
rock my world, Ivan.

827
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:22,757
Unbelievable.

828
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,759
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

829
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:29,259
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

830
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,559
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

831
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,657
Sir?

832
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:37,659
Justin Hammer's making a weapons
presentation at the expo.

833
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,358
We'd like this to introduce it.

834
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,858
Sir, I don't believe that the expo is...

835
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:43,960
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

836
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:45,759
We've got to make this happen.

837
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,960
- Yes general, but the...
- It's also an order.

838
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,860
Yes, sir.

839
01:06:51,061 --> 01:06:54,059
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

840
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,460
Thank you, sir.

841
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:06,260
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

842
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,260
No it was finished, it's never
been particularly effective until

843
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:12,262
I've miniaturized it
and put it in my...

844
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,661
No, Howard said that the arc reactor was
a stepping stone to something greater.

845
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:17,362
He was about to kick off an energy race

846
01:07:17,362 --> 01:07:20,461
That was gonna dwarf
the arms race.

847
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,862
He was on to something big,
something so big

848
01:07:23,862 --> 01:07:27,561
that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor
look like a AAA battery.

849
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:29,961
Just him? Or was Anton
Vanko in on this too?

850
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:33,262
Anton Vanko is the other
side of that coin.

851
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,563
Anton saw it as a
way to get rich.

852
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:37,961
When your father found
out he had him deported.

853
01:07:37,963 --> 01:07:41,663
When the Russians found out he couldn't
deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia

854
01:07:41,664 --> 01:07:44,463
and he spent the next 20 years on a vodka
fuel rage.

855
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:46,963
Not quite the environment you wanna raise
a kid in.

856
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,164
His son you had the misfortune of
crossing paths with in Monaco.

857
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:53,864
You told me I hadn't tried everything. What
do you mean I haven't tried everything?

858
01:07:53,864 --> 01:07:55,463
What haven't I tried?

859
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:59,264
He said that you were the only
person with the means and knowledge

860
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:01,565
to finish what he started.

861
01:08:01,565 --> 01:08:02,965
He said that?

862
01:08:03,264 --> 01:08:05,563
Are you that guy?
Huh? Are you?

863
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:11,760
Because if you are then
you can solve the riddle of your heart.

864
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:19,256
I don't know where you get your
information, but he wasn't my biggest fan.

865
01:08:19,257 --> 01:08:22,354
- What do your remember about your dad huh?
- He was cold, he was calculating...

866
01:08:22,355 --> 01:08:25,354
He never told me he loved me
he never even told me he liked me.

867
01:08:25,354 --> 01:08:29,951
So it's a little tough for me to digest what're you
telling me he said the whole future is riding on me

868
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:32,452
and he's passing it down...
I don't get that.

869
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:34,149
We're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

870
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,747
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

871
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:36,847
That's not true.

872
01:08:36,849 --> 01:08:39,347
Well, then clearly you know my dad better
than I did.

873
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,746
As a matter of fact I did.

874
01:08:41,845 --> 01:08:43,645
He was one of the founding members
of The Shield.

875
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:46,543
- What?
- I got a two o'clock.

876
01:08:46,545 --> 01:08:48,341
Wait, wait, what's this?

877
01:08:48,342 --> 01:08:50,242
- Okay, you're good, right?
- No I'm not good.

878
01:08:50,243 --> 01:08:53,240
- You got this, right? - Got what? I don't
even know what I'm supposed to get.

879
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:56,439
Natasha will remain
a floater at Stark with her cover intact

880
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:58,438
and you remember
Agent Colson right?

881
01:08:58,439 --> 01:08:59,939
Yeah.

882
01:09:00,038 --> 01:09:01,337
Oh, and Tony...

883
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:05,536
Remember, I got my eye on you.

884
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:14,130
We've disabled all communications,
no contact with the outside world.

885
01:09:14,131 --> 01:09:15,930
Good luck.

886
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:22,126
Please...

887
01:09:22,127 --> 01:09:25,524
First thing I need a little body work.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

888
01:09:25,525 --> 01:09:30,222
If you could send of your goon squad down to the Coffee
Bean across the street or Starbucks, that'll be nice.

889
01:09:30,224 --> 01:09:32,820
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by

890
01:09:32,822 --> 01:09:35,619
Director Fury to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

891
01:09:35,621 --> 01:09:38,418
- If you attempt to leave - Right
- Or play any games

892
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,818
I will taze you and watch

893
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:41,738
Supernanny while you
drool into the carpet. Okay?

894
01:09:42,018 --> 01:09:45,515
- I think I got it, yeah.
- Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

895
01:10:12,103 --> 01:10:14,002
Think this is the power source?

896
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,899
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

897
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,000
Let's just focus
on arming it, alright?

898
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:21,698
Yes, sir.

899
01:10:21,698 --> 01:10:23,099
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

900
01:10:23,396 --> 01:10:25,296
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

901
01:10:25,396 --> 01:10:27,395
Is it my birthday?

902
01:10:27,395 --> 01:10:30,993
You gotta.. what did you do?
What did you do?

903
01:10:33,893 --> 01:10:36,591
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes it is.

904
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:40,189
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

905
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,487
What am I gonna do for you?

906
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,287
First thing I'm gonna do for you is
I'm gonna upgrade your software,

907
01:10:47,886 --> 01:10:51,083
I'm talking about firepower.

908
01:10:52,484 --> 01:10:54,582
Well you're talking to the right guy.

909
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:58,881
Claridge Hi-Tec semi-automatic 9 mm pistol.

910
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:02,479
Too downtown?
I agree.

911
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:05,377
M-24 shotgun pump action.

912
01:11:05,778 --> 01:11:08,475
5-round magazine, but
you know what, you're not a hunter.

913
01:11:08,475 --> 01:11:10,475
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

914
01:11:10,574 --> 01:11:13,372
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

915
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:15,094
They do make something better than waffles.

916
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,570
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't
disco enough for you

917
01:11:18,572 --> 01:11:20,069
so I'm gonna put it right here.

918
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:24,667
You're looking at a Milkor 40 mm
grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke.

919
01:11:24,668 --> 01:11:27,065
Hippie control.
You're tough.

920
01:11:27,067 --> 01:11:29,965
Let me tell you something,
Size does matter.

921
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:31,864
Don't let anyone tell you different.

922
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:36,862
This is an M134 7.62 minigun.
Six individual barrels.

923
01:11:36,863 --> 01:11:39,261
The torso taker, powder maker.

924
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:43,060
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

925
01:11:46,358 --> 01:11:47,556
Okay.

926
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:53,253
These are the Cubans baby.
These are the Cohibas, the Montecristos...

927
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:56,851
That's a kinetic-kill sidewinder vehicle

928
01:11:56,853 --> 01:12:01,150
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

929
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:05,346
It's capable of busting a bunker under
the bunker you just busted.

930
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:07,346
If it were any smarter
it would write a book.

931
01:12:07,347 --> 01:12:10,646
A book that would make Ulysses look like
it was written in crayon.

932
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:12,845
And would read it to you.

933
01:12:13,645 --> 01:12:17,242
This is my Eiffel Tower,
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.

934
01:12:17,243 --> 01:12:21,240
My Pieta. It's completely
elegant, it's bafflingly beautiful.

935
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,838
And it's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

936
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:29,636
I call it the Ex-Wife.

937
01:12:34,234 --> 01:12:36,134
That's the best I got.

938
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:43,930
How are you gonna do this? Give me something.
You're like a sphinx.

939
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:45,529
I can't read you.

940
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,228
I think I'll take it.

941
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,926
- Which one?
- All of it.

942
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,225
All of it?

943
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:27,310
<i>Action.</i>

944
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:34,304
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

945
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:36,604
<i>Better living, robust health.</i>

946
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:40,203
<i>And for the first time
in human history...</i>

947
01:13:40,302 --> 01:13:43,002
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

948
01:13:43,202 --> 01:13:46,597
<i>I'm Howard Stark. And everything
you'll need for the future,</i>

949
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:48,198
<i>can be found right here.</i>

950
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:52,398
<i>City of Future, City of
of Tomorrow? Hang on.</i>

951
01:13:57,295 --> 01:13:58,694
<i>I'm Howard Stark.</i>

952
01:13:58,694 --> 01:14:01,693
<i>And everything you'll need in
the future can be found right here.</i>

953
01:14:02,492 --> 01:14:07,189
<i>So, from all of us in Stark Industries
I would like to personally...</i>

954
01:14:08,389 --> 01:14:10,488
<i>Tony? What are you doing back there?
What is that?</i>

955
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,487
<i>Put it back.
Put it back where you got it from.</i>

956
01:14:14,485 --> 01:14:16,485
<i>Where is your mother?
Maria...</i>

957
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,283
<i>Go on, go, go, go...</i>

958
01:14:21,182 --> 01:14:23,082
<i>Sorry I think we got the...</i>

959
01:14:23,782 --> 01:14:26,180
<i>I'll come in in there...</i>

960
01:14:29,878 --> 01:14:31,677
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

961
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:37,475
<i>So from all of us in Stark Industries
I'd like to personally show you...</i>

962
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:39,872
<i>my ass.</i>

963
01:14:39,873 --> 01:14:44,471
<i>I'd like to... This...
I can't... We have this don't we?</i>

964
01:14:44,572 --> 01:14:46,970
<i>That looks ridiculous.</i>

965
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,270
<i>Everything...</i>

966
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:52,268
<i>is achievable...</i>

967
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:54,167
<i>through technology.</i>

968
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,460
<i>Tony...</i>

969
01:15:08,461 --> 01:15:12,757
<i>You're too young to understand this right now
so I thought I would put it on film for you.</i>

970
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:17,155
<i>I built this for you.</i>

971
01:15:17,956 --> 01:15:22,552
<i>And someday you'll realize that it represents a
whole lot more than just people's inventions.</i>

972
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,051
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

973
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:28,051
<i>This is key to the future.</i>

974
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:33,748
<i>I'm limited by the technology
of my time.</i>

975
01:15:34,247 --> 01:15:36,247
<i>But one day you'll figure this out.</i>

976
01:15:36,546 --> 01:15:41,045
<i>And when you do...
you will change the world.</i>

977
01:15:42,844 --> 01:15:47,141
<i>What is and always will be
my greatest creation...</i>

978
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,840
<i>is you.</i>

979
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,828
Hi, sir.

980
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:14,726
- $6.
- I don't have any...

981
01:16:14,728 --> 01:16:17,527
- No sir, that's too much.
- No it's fine, take that.

982
01:16:20,126 --> 01:16:21,725
Take it, take it.

983
01:16:21,925 --> 01:16:24,823
I don't like people hand me things so if you
could just drop that there that would be great.

984
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:27,421
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

985
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:29,322
We believe in you!

986
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,619
It was an illegal seizure
of trademarked property.

987
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,217
- Ms. Potts, Mr Stark is...
- Here.

988
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:38,516
- He refuses to...
- I don't. It's fine. I'll just be a second.

989
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:44,713
It's our position that Stark has the means to maintain
proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.

990
01:16:45,113 --> 01:16:48,011
<i>When Mr. Stark announced
he was the Iron Man</i>

991
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:52,208
<i>he was making a promise to America.</i>

992
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:54,210
<i>Obviously he did not.</i>

993
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:56,507
<i>Now we learn that his secretary,</i>

994
01:16:56,509 --> 01:16:59,105
<i>a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

995
01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:01,505
<i>has been appointed CEO
of Stark Industries executive.</i>

996
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:03,802
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

997
01:17:03,804 --> 01:17:04,403
No.

998
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:07,243
- Ms. Potts is doing nothing to manage
the terrible situation... - Mute.

999
01:17:08,302 --> 01:17:13,099
Bert, don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

1000
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,899
and then not let me pursue this.

1001
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,596
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1002
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:18,698
Well then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1003
01:17:20,096 --> 01:17:22,295
We'll talk about it at the expo.

1004
01:17:22,296 --> 01:17:24,595
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1005
01:17:24,795 --> 01:17:28,391
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1006
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:30,391
- No, he will not.
- I'd like to be.

1007
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,189
- Got a minute?
- No.

1008
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,289
Come on, you just got off the phone.
30 seconds.

1009
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,387
29... 28...

1010
01:17:40,587 --> 01:17:44,984
I was driving over here, and I thought I was
coming basically to apologize, but I'm not.

1011
01:17:44,984 --> 01:17:48,983
- You didn't come here to apologize?
- That goes without saying, and I'm working on that.

1012
01:17:49,283 --> 01:17:52,979
But I haven't been entirely up front
with you

1013
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,679
and I just wanna try to make good,

1014
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,078
Can I move this?
This is crazy I got ferris wheel...

1015
01:17:58,078 --> 01:17:59,377
No.

1016
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:04,076
Do you know how short life is?

1017
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:07,672
And if I never got to express...

1018
01:18:07,673 --> 01:18:10,572
and by the way somewhat revelatory to me,

1019
01:18:10,573 --> 01:18:13,371
I don't care... I mean, I
care, it would be nice,

1020
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:16,270
I'm not expecting you to...
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1021
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:19,568
Let me just stop you right here, okay,
because if you say "I"

1022
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,966
one more time, I'm gonna actually hurl
something at your head, I think.

1023
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:27,762
I am trying to run a company. Do you
know have any idea what that entails?

1024
01:18:27,764 --> 01:18:28,564
Yes.

1025
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:31,662
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man, and you've disappeared.

1026
01:18:31,662 --> 01:18:35,060
All I'm doing is putting out your fire
and taking the heat for it.

1027
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:41,358
I am trying to do the job that you
were meant to do.

1028
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:46,755
Did you bring me strawberries?

1029
01:18:48,055 --> 01:18:52,350
Did you know that there is only one thing
on earth that I am allergic to?

1030
01:18:52,351 --> 01:18:53,912
You're allergic to strawberries, uh-uh.

1031
01:18:56,451 --> 01:19:00,149
This is progress, Pepper. I knew there
was correlation between you and this...

1032
01:19:01,247 --> 01:19:03,448
- I need you...
- And I need you too, that's what I'm trying to say.

1033
01:19:03,546 --> 01:19:06,046
To leave now.

1034
01:19:10,644 --> 01:19:11,743
Ms Potts.

1035
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:15,940
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheel's up in 25 minutes.

1036
01:19:16,341 --> 01:19:17,939
Thank you.

1037
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:20,738
Anything else, boss?

1038
01:19:20,738 --> 01:19:24,337
- I'm good Hap.
- I'll be just... another minute.

1039
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:27,235
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1040
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:32,332
No.

1041
01:19:34,532 --> 01:19:37,331
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

1042
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,029
Here at Stark... Enterprises.

1043
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:42,328
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1044
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:46,326
I thought you two
didn't get along.

1045
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:48,725
- No, that's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1046
01:19:49,524 --> 01:19:50,622
No? Nothing?

1047
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:54,921
Actually while you're here maybe you and Natalie
could discuss the matter of personal belonging.

1048
01:19:54,922 --> 01:19:56,121
Absolutely.

1049
01:20:03,018 --> 01:20:07,315
- I'm surprised you could keep your mouth shut.
- You're good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.

1050
01:20:07,317 --> 01:20:08,114
How do you do it?

1051
01:20:08,115 --> 01:20:10,914
You're a triple impostor.
I've never seen anything like it.

1052
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,012
Is there anything real about you?
Do you even speak Latin?

1053
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:15,211
Fallaces sunt rerum species.

1054
01:20:15,212 --> 01:20:18,109
Which means?
What did you just say?

1055
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,951
It means you can either drive yourself home
or I can have you collected.

1056
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,507
You're good!

1057
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,078
Jarvis, could you kindly
backform a digital wireframe?

1058
01:21:27,177 --> 01:21:28,777
I need a manipulable projection.

1059
01:21:37,073 --> 01:21:40,372
1974 Stark Expo model scanning
complete, sir.

1060
01:21:42,371 --> 01:21:46,967
- How many buildings are there?
- Am I to include the Belgian waffles stand?

1061
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,167
It was rhetorical, just show me.

1062
01:22:01,962 --> 01:22:04,060
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

1063
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:06,658
Not unlike an atom.

1064
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:10,856
In which case, the nucleus...
would be here.

1065
01:22:11,655 --> 01:22:13,256
Highlight the Unisphere.

1066
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:27,349
- Notice the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1067
01:22:27,748 --> 01:22:31,046
I'm discovering,...
correction, rediscovering...

1068
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:33,345
a new element.

1069
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:37,842
Lose the landscape and the shrubbery there,
trees,

1070
01:22:37,844 --> 01:22:39,743
parking lots, exits, entrances.

1071
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,739
Structre protons and neutrons

1072
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:50,637
using flags the pavillions
as the framework.

1073
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:17,925
Dead for almost 20 years...

1074
01:23:19,323 --> 01:23:21,422
still taking me to school.

1075
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:31,420
The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.

1076
01:23:31,918 --> 01:23:33,118
Thanks, Dad.

1077
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:36,118
Unfortunately,
it is impossible to synthesize.

1078
01:23:40,318 --> 01:23:44,118
Get ready for major remodel, fellas!
We're back in hardware mode.

1079
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:34,210
How did you break the perimeter?

1080
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:36,408
That was like three years ago.
Where have you been?

1081
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:39,609
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me too and it worked.

1082
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:45,306
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Colson You
and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1083
01:24:45,307 --> 01:24:47,207
Let me work, or break my balls?

1084
01:24:48,806 --> 01:24:50,207
What's this doing here?

1085
01:24:52,907 --> 01:24:54,207
That's it.

1086
01:24:54,805 --> 01:24:56,305
Bring it to me.

1087
01:24:56,605 --> 01:24:59,367
- You know what this is?
- It's exactly what I need to make this work.

1088
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:02,104
Lift the coil.

1089
01:25:02,104 --> 01:25:05,104
Go, go! Put your knees under it.
There you go.

1090
01:25:05,204 --> 01:25:06,604
And...

1091
01:25:07,304 --> 01:25:09,304
- Drop it. - Okay.

1092
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:13,703
Perfectly level.

1093
01:25:14,603 --> 01:25:16,601
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Nothing.

1094
01:25:16,603 --> 01:25:19,302
Good bye. I've been reassigned.

1095
01:25:19,403 --> 01:25:21,001
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1096
01:25:21,002 --> 01:25:23,801
- Fantastic, the land of enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1097
01:25:23,902 --> 01:25:25,601
- Secret stuff.
- Something like that.

1098
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,201
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1099
01:25:28,701 --> 01:25:30,399
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1100
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,100
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1101
01:25:51,497 --> 01:25:53,796
<i>Initializing
prismatic accelerator.</i>

1102
01:26:00,296 --> 01:26:02,796
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

1103
01:26:50,188 --> 01:26:51,587
That was easy.

1104
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:09,784
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

1105
01:27:11,484 --> 01:27:13,885
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

1106
01:27:21,983 --> 01:27:25,483
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted the
modified core.</i>

1107
01:27:26,082 --> 01:27:28,282
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

1108
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,980
Hey, Ivan.

1109
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,529
<i>I got Senator Stern here. Thought we'd swing
over and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

1110
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:44,180
- The drone is not going to be ready.
- Not ready... What do you mean?

1111
01:27:44,779 --> 01:27:47,779
It can make presentation
not demonstration.

1112
01:27:47,878 --> 01:27:52,877
- What the hell is the difference?
- Presentation, no fly, no shoot.

1113
01:27:52,877 --> 01:27:56,078
Wait. What can we make 'em do, I mean,

1114
01:27:56,177 --> 01:27:57,978
This is a weapons demonstration.

1115
01:27:58,078 --> 01:27:59,676
I can make salute.

1116
01:28:00,176 --> 01:28:02,777
You can make salute, what do you mean
make salute?

1117
01:28:02,976 --> 01:28:04,877
What the hell does that mean, Ivan?

1118
01:28:05,176 --> 01:28:07,574
<i>It's not what we agreed to, okay.</i>

1119
01:28:07,576 --> 01:28:10,175
<i>You promised me suits, and
then you promised me drones.</i>

1120
01:28:10,176 --> 01:28:14,074
- Hey man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

1121
01:28:26,172 --> 01:28:28,872
Hey, there he is, the bird man.

1122
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:32,971
Oh, now you like the bird, is that right?

1123
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:36,372
Is that your bird?
I'm confused.

1124
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:40,371
You said it wasn't, but now
it's like you're best of pals.

1125
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,970
You love that bird, don't you?

1126
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,470
You know what? Take the bird.

1127
01:28:49,569 --> 01:28:52,069
Take his pillows too. Both of them.

1128
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:54,868
And shoes, take his shoes.

1129
01:28:59,268 --> 01:29:00,768
I took your stuff.

1130
01:29:01,268 --> 01:29:04,367
How does that make you feel?
You feel bad?

1131
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:07,867
Good. Cause that's how I feel!

1132
01:29:09,565 --> 01:29:11,565
We had a contract!

1133
01:29:11,765 --> 01:29:16,864
I saved your life
and you give me suits.

1134
01:29:17,164 --> 01:29:20,765
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.

1135
01:29:21,764 --> 01:29:24,762
I don't know if you're a genius
or a fraud.

1136
01:29:24,764 --> 01:29:26,663
I don't know what you are!

1137
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:31,863
Something really, really
great fell into my lap.

1138
01:29:32,762 --> 01:29:35,862
If it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1139
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:40,161
Now I have a piece of Stark
tech, and I pimped out myself.

1140
01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:44,560
Now your overpriced paperweights are gonna
look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

1141
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,960
You dig what I'm gettin' at here?

1142
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:53,759
I don't know if you noticed,
but I don't speak Russian!

1143
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:02,358
I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna go to the expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1144
01:30:03,158 --> 01:30:07,157
See these guys? They're your babysitters.
They are not to be trifled with.

1145
01:30:08,157 --> 01:30:11,556
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate
the terms of our agreement.

1146
01:30:12,756 --> 01:30:15,255
And you're gonna make
good on our arrangements.

1147
01:30:15,256 --> 01:30:17,954
Because if you don't, you're gonna be
exactly what you were when I found you,

1148
01:30:17,956 --> 01:30:20,354
a dead man.

1149
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:22,154
You got that?

1150
01:30:23,154 --> 01:30:25,453
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1151
01:30:34,653 --> 01:30:37,052
Dummy. You.
Can we clean up this mess?

1152
01:30:37,752 --> 01:30:41,951
- Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.
- Phone privileges reinstated.

1153
01:30:41,952 --> 01:30:43,551
Lovely.

1154
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:48,451
- Colson, how's land of enchantment?
- Hey, Tony, how you doin'?

1155
01:30:49,751 --> 01:30:51,350
- I doubled cycle. - You what?

1156
01:30:52,449 --> 01:30:56,847
You told me double cycle's
more power. Good advice.

1157
01:30:56,849 --> 01:31:00,548
- You sound pretty spitely for a dead guy.
- You too.

1158
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:03,846
- Trace it. - Sir.

1159
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:08,346
Now the true history of
Stark name will be written.

1160
01:31:08,347 --> 01:31:11,346
- Jarvis, where he is?
- Accessing the Oracle grid.

1161
01:31:11,947 --> 01:31:13,447
Eastern seaboard.

1162
01:31:13,546 --> 01:31:17,645
What your father did to my family
over 40 years

1163
01:31:18,345 --> 01:31:20,845
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1164
01:31:20,845 --> 01:31:23,243
Sounds good, let's get together
and hash it out.

1165
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:27,045
Tri-state area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1166
01:31:27,244 --> 01:31:29,043
I hope you're ready.

1167
01:31:31,844 --> 01:31:33,743
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

1168
01:31:44,442 --> 01:31:47,042
- Sir.
- You wanna run some tests, run 'em.

1169
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:50,340
And assemble the suit while you're at it
put it together now.

1170
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:53,101
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't wanna hear it, Jarvis!

1171
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:00,340
It tastes like coconut...
and metal.

1172
01:32:14,936 --> 01:32:18,436
I'll keep the car down here, alright.
- Thank you Happy.

1173
01:32:18,537 --> 01:32:24,036
<i>Justin Hammer, his presentation will
begin shortly in the main pavilion.</i>

1174
01:32:44,132 --> 01:32:47,131
That's what I'm talking about!
Thanks for coming.

1175
01:32:48,332 --> 01:32:51,331
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long

1176
01:32:51,831 --> 01:32:54,930
this country has had to place its brave men
and women in harm's way.

1177
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,529
But then the Iron Man arrived
and we thought that

1178
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:00,130
the days of losing lives were behind us.

1179
01:33:01,329 --> 01:33:03,729
Sadly that technology
was kept out of reach.

1180
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:06,229
That's not fair. That's not right.

1181
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:08,927
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, lord...

1182
01:33:08,929 --> 01:33:13,828
Regardless it was an impressive innovation
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

1183
01:33:14,328 --> 01:33:19,527
Today, my friends, the press
is faced with quite a different problem.

1184
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,426
They are about to run out of ink.

1185
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:29,625
Get that out of here.

1186
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:32,925
Ladies and gentlemen...

1187
01:33:33,925 --> 01:33:36,024
today I present to you

1188
01:33:36,524 --> 01:33:39,923
the new face of the
United States military!

1189
01:33:41,024 --> 01:33:42,722
The Hammer drone!

1190
01:33:44,922 --> 01:33:47,122
Army!

1191
01:33:59,220 --> 01:33:59,720
Navy!

1192
01:34:10,618 --> 01:34:13,418
Air Force!

1193
01:34:19,717 --> 01:34:22,617
Marines!

1194
01:34:39,114 --> 01:34:42,514
That's a hell of a lot better than some
cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1195
01:34:43,814 --> 01:34:46,512
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1196
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:50,412
there will always be a need for a man
to be present at the theater of war.

1197
01:34:50,813 --> 01:34:55,911
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud
to present to you the very first prototype

1198
01:34:55,912 --> 01:34:59,810
the variable threat response battle suit

1199
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:03,110
and its pilot Air Force Lt.
Col. James Rhodes.

1200
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:05,609
What?

1201
01:35:26,407 --> 01:35:29,606
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries, is reporting...

1202
01:35:47,203 --> 01:35:49,203
We got trouble.

1203
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:51,202
Tony, there are civilians present.

1204
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:53,703
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1205
01:35:53,802 --> 01:35:56,402
Give them a wave.

1206
01:35:56,902 --> 01:35:59,201
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1207
01:35:59,202 --> 01:36:01,400
You gotta trust
me for the next five minutes.

1208
01:36:01,402 --> 01:36:03,399
I tried that and
I got tossed around your house, remember?

1209
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,899
I think he's working with Vanko.

1210
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,100
Vanko is alive?

1211
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,198
- Where is he?
- What?

1212
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:13,899
Where is Vanko?

1213
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:16,198
- Who?
- Tell me.

1214
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:19,099
What are you doing here, man?

1215
01:36:23,597 --> 01:36:26,896
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that, it's not me.

1216
01:36:26,898 --> 01:36:30,096
I can't move.
I'm locked up, I'm locked up.

1217
01:36:30,497 --> 01:36:33,895
Get out of here! Go!
The whole system's been compromised!

1218
01:36:33,896 --> 01:36:37,095
Let's take it outside.

1219
01:36:47,894 --> 01:36:51,094
No!

1220
01:36:59,092 --> 01:37:02,091
- Jarvis, break in, I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

1221
01:37:04,891 --> 01:37:07,590
Tony, I'm locked on I have target locked.

1222
01:37:07,591 --> 01:37:11,091
- On what?
- On you.

1223
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:16,890
Tony on your six.

1224
01:37:32,886 --> 01:37:35,886
- What's going on, what's happening?
- The software's been overwritten.

1225
01:37:35,886 --> 01:37:37,885
What?
What do you mean it's been overwritten?

1226
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:40,484
- I think he slaved the drones.
- It is impossible.

1227
01:37:40,485 --> 01:37:41,885
- Call the guards
- All the phones are down, sir.

1228
01:37:41,886 --> 01:37:44,884
- Then call their cells.
- Their cell phones are not working either, sir.

1229
01:37:44,885 --> 01:37:47,884
- He's locked us out of the mainframe.
- Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1230
01:37:47,885 --> 01:37:50,483
Please, please, go away.
I got this handled.

1231
01:37:50,484 --> 01:37:51,882
- Have you now?
- Yes I do.

1232
01:37:51,884 --> 01:37:53,882
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up

1233
01:37:53,884 --> 01:37:56,483
This wouldn't be happening
Please now, go away!

1234
01:37:56,484 --> 01:37:57,881
Thank you.

1235
01:37:57,882 --> 01:38:00,881
Listen we gotta get these
bitches outta here.

1236
01:38:00,882 --> 01:38:03,081
You're gonna tell me who's behind
this.

1237
01:38:03,082 --> 01:38:04,881
Who's behind this?

1238
01:38:04,881 --> 01:38:07,481
Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1239
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:10,581
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1240
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,378
- I need NYPD please.
- No, no, no honey.

1241
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,579
Don't call the authorities!

1242
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,380
Step aside.

1243
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,479
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1244
01:38:30,877 --> 01:38:34,478
- How we doing Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1245
01:38:53,774 --> 01:38:57,872
- No one's answering the phone, what's going on?
- Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

1246
01:38:57,873 --> 01:38:59,273
I'm not taking you anywhere.

1247
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:02,672
- Fine. You want me to drive?
- No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1248
01:40:01,564 --> 01:40:03,163
Nice work, kid.

1249
01:40:04,863 --> 01:40:08,262
- You got multiples coming down on you.
- Let's get this away from the expo.

1250
01:40:13,561 --> 01:40:16,261
When we arrive I need you
to watch the perimeter.

1251
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:18,461
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1252
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:23,659
- Watch the road.
- I got it.

1253
01:40:55,255 --> 01:40:58,253
Listen, listen, a pack has peeled
off and headed back to the expo.

1254
01:40:58,255 --> 01:40:59,454
Got it.

1255
01:41:03,554 --> 01:41:07,650
I'm closing on you!
It's coming in hot, Tony! Watch it.

1256
01:41:22,942 --> 01:41:25,840
- Stay in the car!
- I'm not staying in the car.

1257
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:28,837
- I said stay in the car.
- What are you wearing?

1258
01:41:31,436 --> 01:41:33,197
Look, I'm not letting
you go in there alone.

1259
01:41:33,534 --> 01:41:36,134
- You wanna help? Keep the car running.
- Okay.

1260
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:42,029
Hey, you can't come in here!

1261
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,596
Each set of drones is communicating
in its own unique language.

1262
01:42:31,597 --> 01:42:35,595
- Choose one and focus on that.
- Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian.

1263
01:43:25,364 --> 01:43:26,663
I got 'em!

1264
01:43:41,453 --> 01:43:43,094
- Rhodey, you're still locked on? - Yeah.

1265
01:43:43,353 --> 01:43:47,350
Drop your socks and grab your
crocs, we're about to get wet on this ride.

1266
01:43:49,149 --> 01:43:50,849
Wait, wait!

1267
01:44:09,636 --> 01:44:11,136
He's gone!

1268
01:44:15,733 --> 01:44:18,230
Sorry buddy, had
to thin out the herd.

1269
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:20,029
What's your twenty?

1270
01:44:31,822 --> 01:44:34,720
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1271
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:42,416
Tony!

1272
01:44:58,805 --> 01:45:00,104
Reboot complete.

1273
01:45:00,904 --> 01:45:04,501
- You got your best friend back.
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

1274
01:45:04,502 --> 01:45:09,898
Well done with the new chest-piece. I'm reading significantly
higher output and your vitals all look promising.

1275
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:11,998
Yes, for the moment I'm not dying.
Thank you.

1276
01:45:12,997 --> 01:45:15,395
- What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you say you're dying? - That you?

1277
01:45:15,494 --> 01:45:17,293
No, I'm not. Not anymore.

1278
01:45:17,493 --> 01:45:19,692
- What's going on?
- I was going to tell you. I didn't want to..

1279
01:45:19,693 --> 01:45:22,788
- You're gonna tell me you really were dying?
- You didn't let me.

1280
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:26,587
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you!

1281
01:45:26,587 --> 01:45:29,984
Hey, hey, save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1282
01:45:29,985 --> 01:45:31,484
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1283
01:45:31,484 --> 01:45:33,283
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

1284
01:45:33,283 --> 01:45:36,081
- I'm fine. Don't be mad. I will formally...
- I am mad.

1285
01:45:36,082 --> 01:45:38,980
apologize when I'm not
fending off a Hammeroid attack!

1286
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,078
- We could've been in Venice.
- Oh, please...

1287
01:45:44,476 --> 01:45:45,876
Rhodes!

1288
01:45:46,475 --> 01:45:48,173
Snap out of it, buddy!
I need you.

1289
01:45:50,073 --> 01:45:51,792
They're coming. Come on let's roll. Get up.

1290
01:45:55,569 --> 01:45:57,569
Oh man, you can have your suit back.

1291
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:03,765
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

1292
01:46:05,963 --> 01:46:08,960
- Tony, look... I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

1293
01:46:08,961 --> 01:46:11,260
- No I should've trusted you more.
- I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

1294
01:46:11,659 --> 01:46:13,756
No it's your fault. I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

1295
01:46:13,757 --> 01:46:16,657
Thank you.
That's all I want to hear, partner.

1296
01:46:17,256 --> 01:46:20,554
They're coming in hot. Any
second. What's the play?

1297
01:46:21,653 --> 01:46:24,251
Well we wanna take the high ground, okay.
So let's take

1298
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:27,349
the biggest gun up on that ridge.
- Got you.

1299
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:29,448
- Where do you wanna be? - Where you going?
- What are you talking about?

1300
01:46:29,448 --> 01:46:31,845
- I mean me.
- I have a big gun, you are not the big gun.

1301
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:34,243
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No it's subtle with all the bells and whistles.

1302
01:46:34,244 --> 01:46:36,743
- It's called being a bad ass.
- Fine.

1303
01:46:38,042 --> 01:46:41,939
- Alright. You go up top. I'll draw 'em in.
- But don't stay down here

1304
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,639
it's the worst place to be.

1305
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:47,737
- Okay you got a spot. Where's mine?
- It's the kill box, Tony, okay, this is where you go to die.

1306
01:47:37,505 --> 01:47:39,104
- See that?
- Yea, yea, nice.

1307
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,798
Rhodey...

1308
01:47:49,497 --> 01:47:50,497
Get down!

1309
01:48:01,489 --> 01:48:03,988
Wow. I think you should lead with that
next time.

1310
01:48:03,988 --> 01:48:07,786
Yeah, sorry boss, I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

1311
01:48:09,685 --> 01:48:11,484
I told you that five minutes ago.

1312
01:48:13,182 --> 01:48:14,782
That's your guy here.

1313
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:17,822
- Excuse me?
- Sir, you're placed under arrest.

1314
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,478
Hands behind your back, sir.

1315
01:48:19,479 --> 01:48:20,778
I'm trying to help here.

1316
01:48:25,176 --> 01:48:28,773
I get it. I see what you're doing. Trying
to pin this on me, huh?

1317
01:48:29,073 --> 01:48:33,368
That's good. You start to think like a CEO.
Taking out the competition.

1318
01:48:33,369 --> 01:48:36,667
I like that.
You think you're making a problem for me?

1319
01:48:36,667 --> 01:48:39,865
I'm gonna make a problem for you.
I'm gonna be seeing you again, real soon.

1320
01:48:44,764 --> 01:48:48,661
When they get here, I think you should station
them at the Southeast and both West exits.

1321
01:48:49,159 --> 01:48:51,059
We shut down the seven train in and out of
Willets Point already.

1322
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:54,157
Well, have city buses there to ferry people
to operating lines.

1323
01:48:54,556 --> 01:48:55,954
You coming with us?

1324
01:48:55,956 --> 01:48:57,854
No, I'm gonna stay until the park is clear.

1325
01:49:00,953 --> 01:49:05,149
Heads up you got one more drone incoming.
This one looks different.

1326
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,849
Repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

1327
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:20,341
Good to be back.

1328
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:22,739
This ain't gonna be good.

1329
01:49:26,037 --> 01:49:30,333
I got something special for this guy.
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the ex-wife.

1330
01:49:30,434 --> 01:49:31,632
The what?

1331
01:49:42,426 --> 01:49:44,725
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1332
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:47,823
We got this.

1333
01:50:40,988 --> 01:50:42,889
Rhodes! I got an idea.

1334
01:50:43,787 --> 01:50:45,586
You wanna be a hero?

1335
01:50:45,587 --> 01:50:48,384
- What?
- I can really use a sidekick.

1336
01:50:48,385 --> 01:50:51,283
- Put your hand up.
- This is your idea?

1337
01:50:51,283 --> 01:50:54,780
- Yup.
- I'm ready, I'm ready, go go go.

1338
01:50:58,578 --> 01:51:00,277
Hit him!

1339
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,759
You lose.

1340
01:51:37,054 --> 01:51:39,752
All these drones are rigged to blow
We gotta get out of here man.

1341
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:41,652
Pepper?

1342
01:52:21,327 --> 01:52:23,423
Oh my god, I can't take this anymore!

1343
01:52:23,425 --> 01:52:24,523
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1344
01:52:24,524 --> 01:52:25,922
What do you mean, look at me!

1345
01:52:25,923 --> 01:52:30,020
My body literally cannot handle the stress. I
never know if you're gonna kill yourself...

1346
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:32,019
or wreck the whole company...

1347
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,318
I think I did okay!

1348
01:52:34,618 --> 01:52:36,617
I quit.
I'm resigning.

1349
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:38,914
That's it.

1350
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:42,113
What did you just say?
You're done?

1351
01:52:42,412 --> 01:52:44,610
Surprising, I mean not
surprising.

1352
01:52:44,612 --> 01:52:48,608
I get it.
You don't have to make any excuses.

1353
01:52:48,609 --> 01:52:50,907
- I'm not making any excuses.
- Well you actually were just making excuses.

1354
01:52:50,908 --> 01:52:54,505
I wasn't making an excuse but
I'm actually very justified.

1355
01:52:54,604 --> 01:52:56,404
You deserve better.

1356
01:52:57,003 --> 01:52:59,203
You've taken such good care of me.

1357
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,600
I've been in tough spot
you got me through it, so.

1358
01:53:02,699 --> 01:53:04,898
- Right?
- Thank you.

1359
01:53:04,899 --> 01:53:08,296
- Yeah.
- Thank you for understanding.

1360
01:53:08,296 --> 01:53:10,793
- Let's start clean up.
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.

1361
01:53:10,795 --> 01:53:13,292
What about the press? Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna be...

1362
01:53:13,292 --> 01:53:16,391
- With you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1363
01:53:16,692 --> 01:53:18,091
I mean it's like the President.

1364
01:53:30,082 --> 01:53:31,581
Weird.

1365
01:53:31,582 --> 01:53:32,880
No it's not weird.

1366
01:53:32,881 --> 01:53:35,479
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

1367
01:53:35,479 --> 01:53:38,176
I think it was weird.

1368
01:53:38,177 --> 01:53:41,574
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1369
01:53:41,576 --> 01:53:45,171
- I had just quit
- You don't have to do that.

1370
01:53:45,172 --> 01:53:46,770
- I heard the whole thing.
- You should get lost.

1371
01:53:46,771 --> 01:53:49,270
I was here first.
Get a roof.

1372
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:52,368
- I thought you were out of one-liners?
- That's the last one.

1373
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:55,068
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You too.

1374
01:53:55,266 --> 01:53:58,163
Listen, my car got taken
out in the explosions

1375
01:53:58,164 --> 01:54:01,363
so I'm gonna have to hang on to
your suit for a minute, okay?

1376
01:54:01,363 --> 01:54:03,560
Not okay with thats.

1377
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:07,759
It wasn't a question.

1378
01:54:12,256 --> 01:54:14,055
I don't understand...

1379
01:54:33,243 --> 01:54:36,039
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1380
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:38,739
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

1381
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:44,836
Now this, on the other hand, is agent
Romanoff's assessment of you.

1382
01:54:45,136 --> 01:54:47,534
Read it.

1383
01:54:47,634 --> 01:54:51,931
Personality overview:
Mr Stark displays compulsive behavior.

1384
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:54,729
In my own defense, that
was last week.

1385
01:54:56,627 --> 01:55:00,127
Prone to self-destructive tendencies.
I was dying.

1386
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:02,823
I mean, please, aren't we all?

1387
01:55:02,823 --> 01:55:06,122
Textbook narcissism?

1388
01:55:06,822 --> 01:55:09,319
Agreed.

1389
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:14,216
Recruitment assessment for Avenger
Initiative, Iron Man, yes.

1390
01:55:14,216 --> 01:55:16,815
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1391
01:55:19,613 --> 01:55:23,011
Tony Stark not recommended?

1392
01:55:23,712 --> 01:55:27,609
That doesn't make any sense. How can
you approve me but not approve me?

1393
01:55:28,807 --> 01:55:34,005
I got a new ticker, I'm trying to do right
by Pepper.

1394
01:55:34,104 --> 01:55:37,801
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1395
01:55:37,802 --> 01:55:43,099
Which leads us to believe at this juncture
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.

1396
01:55:49,194 --> 01:55:51,993
You can't afford me.

1397
01:55:54,192 --> 01:55:57,090
Then again I will waive
my customary retainer

1398
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:59,688
in exchange for a small favor.

1399
01:56:00,688 --> 01:56:03,311
Rhodey and I are being
honored in Washington

1400
01:56:03,313 --> 01:56:05,837
and we need a presenter.

1401
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,068
I'll see what I can do.

1402
01:56:10,582 --> 01:56:12,801
It is my honor to be here today

1403
01:56:12,802 --> 01:56:17,445
to present these distinguished awards
to Lt. Col. James Rhodes

1404
01:56:17,447 --> 01:56:21,283
and Mr. Tony Stark
who is of course

1405
01:56:21,283 --> 01:56:23,908
a national treasure.

1406
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:29,158
Thank you Lieutenant Colonel for such an
exceptionally distinguished performance.

1407
01:56:29,158 --> 01:56:32,287
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1408
01:56:33,399 --> 01:56:38,649
Mr Stark, thank you for such an
exceptionally distinguished performance.

1409
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:40,567
You deserve this.

1410
01:56:41,274 --> 01:56:43,796
Oh sorry.

1411
01:56:44,706 --> 01:56:48,845
Funny how annoying a little
prick can be, isn't it?

1412
01:56:49,148 --> 01:56:50,762
Let's get a photo.
