1
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:36,435
Peter.

2
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:40,926
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,945
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:22,480
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:26,043
Peter?

6
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:29,658
They killed a little frog that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,658
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:36,177
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:38,688
You even look like him.

10
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:41,915
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:45,902
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

12
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,859
You got a present there for Peter, don't you?

13
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,223
Of course.

14
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,307
There.

15
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:58,713
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:04,704
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,604
Your grandpa...

18
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:12,064
...is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,900
At least until your daddy comes back to get you.

20
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:20,429
Take my hand.

21
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:25,468
Peter.

22
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:27,954
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,014
Take my hand.

24
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,777
Mom?

25
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,079
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:41,390
Mom! No!

27
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:43,010
- Come with me.
- No!

28
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,823
No!

29
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:46,653
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,087
No...

31
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:50,838
Okay?

32
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,576
No.

33
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,133
Mom!

34
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,730
Drop it!

35
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,225
Uh, hey.

36
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,858
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,860
No problem at all.

38
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,108
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:18,687
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:21,206
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,697
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:24,994
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,464
Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.

44
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:27,555
What is your name?

45
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,591
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

46
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,264
- Move!
- Why?

47
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,234
Ronan may have questions for you.

48
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:34,692
Hey, you know what?

49
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,892
There's another name you might know me by.

50
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,376
Star-Lord.

51
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,596
Who?

52
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,909
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

53
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:47,283
- Guys?
- Move!

54
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:50,238
Ah, forget this.

55
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:37,938
Peter?

56
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,668
What happened?

57
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:45,038
Hey, uh...

58
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,124
Uh... I...

59
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,763
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

60
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:52,283
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

61
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:16,687
<i>REPORTER ON TV:
Scattered riots broke out</i>

62
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:18,254
<i>across the Kree Empire today</i>

63
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:21,715
<i>protesting the recent peace treaty
signed by the Kree Emperor</i>

64
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:24,162
<i>and Xandar's Nova Prime.</i>

65
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:27,879
Peter, you have call.

66
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,304
- No, wait, don't!
- Quill?

67
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,897
Hey, Yondu.

68
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,995
<i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

69
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,269
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

70
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,456
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

71
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:40,763
<i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

72
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,351
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

73
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,832
<i>- I slaved putting this deal together.
- Slaved?</i>

74
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:46,927
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

75
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,032
<i>And now you're gonna rip me off!</i>

76
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,484
<i>We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

77
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,209
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

78
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,540
<i>When I picked you up on Terra...</i>

79
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,591
"Picked me up."

80
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:57,631
<i>...these boys of mine
wanted to eat you.</i>

81
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:58,663
Yeah?

82
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,077
<i>They ain't never tasted any Terran before.</i>

83
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,302
<i>I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!</i>

84
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:03,589
<i>I Will find you, I Will...</i>

85
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:05,825
Put a bounty on him!

86
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,530
Forty K.

87
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,206
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

88
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,653
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

89
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,110
I told you when you picked that kid up,

90
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:14,091
you should have delivered him like we was hired to do!

91
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,644
He was cargo!

92
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,341
You have always been soft on him.

93
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,913
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

94
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,741
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

95
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:25,059
As soon as we get him back here,

96
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,918
I'm gonna kill him myself.

97
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:29,567
What we do need to worry about,

98
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:33,290
is who else out there wants that Orb!

99
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:54,998
<i>RONAN: They call me "terrorist,"</i>

100
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,162
<i>"radical," "zealot,"</i>

101
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,013
<i>because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,</i>

102
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:06,085
<i>and punish those who do not.</i>

103
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,206
<i>Because I do not forgive your people</i>

104
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,734
<i>for taking the life of my father,</i>

105
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,647
<i>and his father, and his father before him.</i>

106
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:21,294
<i>A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!</i>

107
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:24,403
You can't do this!
Our government signed a peace treaty.

108
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:27,683
My government knows no shame.

109
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:31,462
You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.

110
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:33,725
You

111
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,059
will never rule Xandar.

112
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:37,107
No.

113
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,109
I will cure it!

114
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,713
Ronan,

115
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,665
Korath has returned.

116
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,546
Master, he is a thief,

117
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:00,934
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

118
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,438
But we have discovered he has an agreement

119
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,254
to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known

120
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:07,779
as The Broker.

121
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:11,238
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him.

122
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:13,845
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

123
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:17,979
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.

124
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:19,730
It will be my honor.

125
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:20,841
It will be your doom.

126
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,504
If this happens again, you'll be facing our father

127
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:26,275
without his prize.

128
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,765
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

129
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:29,359
Just like you.

130
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:30,754
But I know Xandar.

131
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,453
Ronan has already decreed that I...

132
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:33,530
Do not speak for me.

133
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,870
You will not fail.

134
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:43,000
Have I ever?

135
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,182
Xandarians.

136
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,416
What a bunch of losers.

137
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:05,865
All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid,

138
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,828
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

139
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,169
Look at this guy!

140
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,774
Can you believe they call us criminals,

141
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,701
when he's assaulting us with that haircut?

142
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:15,879
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

143
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,440
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

144
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:21,370
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

145
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:25,623
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

146
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:27,662
Right, Groot?

147
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,159
Groot?

148
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,034
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

149
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,317
- That's disgusting!
- Mmm.

150
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,596
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

151
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:36,724
Why are you lying?

152
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,118
Whoop.

153
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,087
Looks like we got one.

154
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:46,162
Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you?

155
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,576
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

156
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:06,159
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

157
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,400
The Orb.

158
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,323
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

159
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,077
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

160
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:15,115
And told me to tell you,

161
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,427
that you got the best eyebrows in the business.

162
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,493
What is it?

163
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:24,471
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

164
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,474
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.

165
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:29,474
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.

166
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,235
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

167
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,447
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

168
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,528
I truly am.

169
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:38,239
But I want no part of this transaction

170
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:40,167
- if Ronan is involved.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

171
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,205
Who's Ronan?

172
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:45,532
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty,

173
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,750
who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture,

174
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,912
- is wiped from existence!
- Whoa, whoa!

175
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,351
- Come on.
- He's someone

176
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:53,768
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

177
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,505
What? What about my bad side?

178
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:56,875
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

179
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,403
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

180
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:07,251
What happened?

181
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:12,279
Ah, this guy just backed out of a deal on me.

182
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,392
If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity.

183
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:16,144
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

184
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,767
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

185
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,916
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

186
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:25,505
People say it about me, all the time,

187
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:27,334
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.

188
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:29,888
Ooh!

189
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,115
This wasn't the plan.

190
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:47,998
Ah!

191
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:50,684
Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

192
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,997
No! Not her, him!

193
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,461
Learn genders, man.

194
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:56,107
Ow!

195
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:57,886
Biting? That's not fair!

196
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,797
Take it easy!

197
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,211
Ow!

198
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,944
Fool. You should have learned.

199
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,796
I don't learn. One of my issues.

200
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:43,727
What the...

201
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:49,878
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

202
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:52,501
You gotta be kidding me.

203
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,239
Ooh. Hey!

204
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,564
I live for the simple things.

205
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,817
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

206
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,441
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

207
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,874
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

208
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:27,414
Quit whining.

209
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,608
<i>Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.</i>

210
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,645
Aw, crap.

211
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:42,138
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

212
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:43,953
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

213
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,141
<i>...for endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.</i>

214
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:49,270
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

215
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:52,496
- Star-Lord.
- Oh, sorry. "Lord."

216
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,592
I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft.

217
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,065
He's got a code name.

218
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:57,125
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

219
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,030
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

220
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,757
Just relax, pal.

221
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,964
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

222
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,811
Fascists.

223
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,796
<i>NOVA</i> PRIME: <i>Ronan is destroying</i>

224
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:22,030
<i>Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy.</i>

225
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,012
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

226
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,648
<i>We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.</i>

227
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,855
<i>What more do you want?</i>

228
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:30,679
At least a statement from the Kree Empire

229
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,921
saying that they condemn his actions.

230
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,421
He is slaughtering children.

231
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:36,828
Families.

232
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:39,195
<i>That is your business.</i>

233
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,244
<i>Now, I have other matters to attend to.</i>

234
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,535
Prick.

235
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,023
Well, some good news.

236
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:50,186
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

237
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,673
Gamora.

238
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,685
Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon.

239
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:57,212
The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

240
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:00,663
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

241
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,888
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

242
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,104
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

243
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,563
The result of illegal genetic

244
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:11,107
and cybernetic experiments

245
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:12,319
on a lower life form.

246
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,451
What the hell?

247
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:16,282
They call it "Groot."

248
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,785
A humanoid plant that's been traveling recently

249
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:21,994
as 89P13's personal houseplant/muscle.

250
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:25,960
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

251
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:29,078
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

252
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,869
led by Yondu Udonta.

253
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,436
Oh, I'm sorry.

254
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,410
I didn't know how this machine worked.

255
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,518
What a bunch of a-holes.

256
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:40,413
Transport all four to the Kyln.

257
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:46,438
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws,

258
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:49,814
but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.

259
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,057
But, hey, that's not my problem.

260
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:53,692
I ain't gonna be here long.

261
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,174
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

262
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,518
You're lucky the broad showed up,

263
00:21:58,529 --> 00:21:59,736
because otherwise, me and Groot

264
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,597
would be collecting that bounty right now,

265
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:03,521
and you'd be getting drawn and quartered

266
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:04,559
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

267
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,777
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years.

268
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:09,538
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

269
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:10,540
Hold.

270
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,494
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

271
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,810
It's what you are, stupid.

272
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:16,678
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

273
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:19,474
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase,

274
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:22,525
Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

275
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,298
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

276
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,037
So what? What's the Orb?

277
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,240
I have no words for an honorless thief.

278
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,544
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey

279
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,726
of a genocidal maniac.

280
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,667
Yeah, I know who you are.

281
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,671
Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.

282
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:37,269
Yeah, we know who you are.

283
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:39,769
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

284
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,738
Yeah, you said that.

285
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,818
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

286
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,520
I was betraying him.

287
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:48,599
I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.

288
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:51,769
I am Groot.

289
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:55,994
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

290
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:58,077
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

291
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,406
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you.

292
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:04,396
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

293
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,048
Exclusively in that order.

294
00:23:06,124 --> 00:23:08,330
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

295
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,782
Hey.

296
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:11,962
Put that away.

297
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,334
Hey!

298
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,576
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

299
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:18,285
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

300
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,203
That tape and that player is mine!

301
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:26,493
<i>Hooked on</i> a <i>Feeling,</i> Blue <i>Swede,</i> 1973.

302
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:27,984
That song belongs to me!

303
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,333
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

304
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:50,162
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

305
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:54,406
You're scum! You're scum!

306
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,228
It's like I said,

307
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,211
she's got a rep.

308
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,102
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families

309
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,240
to Ronan and his goons.

310
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,448
She'll last a day, tops.

311
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:06,789
Murderer!

312
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:08,364
The guards will protect her, right?

313
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,938
They're here to stop us from getting out.

314
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:12,916
They don't care what we do to each other inside.

315
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:16,471
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

316
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:20,119
are dreams compared to what's behind me.

317
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:23,816
Check out the new meat.

318
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:27,527
I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly,

319
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:28,814
and go to town...

320
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:35,013
Let's make something clear.

321
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:39,093
This one here is our booty!

322
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:41,453
You wanna get to him,

323
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:43,680
YOU go through us!

324
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,727
Or, more accurately,

325
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,492
we go through you.

326
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,787
I'm with them.

327
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:03,895
I hate you.

328
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:07,111
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

329
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:20,267
You're dead!

330
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:21,737
Dead!

331
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,310
Take her down to the showers.

332
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:50,431
It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.

333
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:04,873
Quill, where you going?

334
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,126
Quill.

335
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:09,838
Quill!

336
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,321
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

337
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,440
for your crimes against the galaxy.

338
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,645
You dare?

339
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,425
You know who I am, yes?

340
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,317
You're Drax.

341
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,493
The Destroyer.

342
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,560
Quill!

343
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:31,519
And you know why they call me this.

344
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,162
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

345
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:37,588
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

346
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:39,888
and my daughter, Camaria.

347
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,376
He slaughtered them where they stood.

348
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,980
And he laughed!

349
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:45,984
Quill?

350
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:47,141
Her life

351
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:49,824
is not yours to take.

352
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:53,688
He killed my family.

353
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:55,435
I shall kill one of his in return.

354
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:58,771
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

355
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:06,683
Quill! What are you doing?

356
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:10,402
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

357
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,151
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

358
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:22,996
Ah!

359
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:25,647
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

360
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,208
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Oh, crap.

361
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,398
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,

362
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,125
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

363
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:35,401
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?

364
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:36,669
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman

365
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,730
to try and do that to me.

366
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:41,012
Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

367
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:42,460
Stabbed me with a fork.

368
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:44,517
Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise.

369
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:47,044
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.

370
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:49,121
She caught me with this skinny little A'askavariian

371
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,169
who worked in Nova Records.

372
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,844
I was trying to get information.

373
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:53,569
You ever see an A'askavariian?

374
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,380
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.

375
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:57,692
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...

376
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,125
You don't care. But here's the point.

377
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,507
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

378
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,126
And when he does,

379
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,492
that's when you...

380
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,025
Why would I put my finger on his throat?

381
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:14,375
What?

382
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,515
Oh, no, it's a symbol.

383
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:21,828
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.

384
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,118
I would not slice his throat.

385
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:26,830
I would cut his head clean off.

386
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:28,955
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.

387
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,551
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

388
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:31,828
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

389
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,732
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

390
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:38,657
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.

391
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:41,588
Don't do his work for him.

392
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,338
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

393
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,411
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

394
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:02,560
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

395
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:05,308
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

396
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,970
You know where to sell my Orb.

397
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:09,314
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?

398
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:11,491
My friend Rocket, here,

399
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:13,269
has escaped 22 prisons.

400
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:15,023
Oh, we're getting out.

401
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:17,977
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

402
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:21,647
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?

403
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:23,962
Four billion units.

404
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:25,631
- What?
- Holy shooot.

405
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:29,512
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

406
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,289
If you free us,

407
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:34,566
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

408
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:36,307
and I'll split the profit between the three of us.

409
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:38,066
I am Groot.

410
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:39,453
Four of us.

411
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:41,559
Asleep for the danger, awake for the money,

412
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,561
as per frickin' usual.

413
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:46,891
<i>You have been betrayed, Ronan.</i>

414
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:48,961
We know only that she has been captured.

415
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,917
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

416
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:56,251
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

417
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,824
<i>Look, your partnership with Thanos</i>

418
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,625
<i>is at risk.</i>

419
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:05,000
<i>Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i>

420
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:14,169
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

421
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,694
and yet you summon me.

422
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:17,621
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

423
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,691
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.

424
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:21,500
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

425
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:24,304
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.

426
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:26,174
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.

427
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:30,164
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

428
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:31,451
Lower your tone!

429
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:32,586
I may be your...

430
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:44,298
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.

431
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,924
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,

432
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:50,441
is you.

433
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:53,598
Your politics bore me.

434
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:56,673
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

435
00:31:56,673 --> 00:32:01,395
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

436
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,608
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

437
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,417
if you bring me the Orb.

438
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,698
But return to me again empty-handed,

439
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:15,096
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.

440
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,046
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

441
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:24,916
This is one fight you won't win.

442
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,666
Let's head to the Kyln.

443
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:36,971
If we're gonna get out of here,

444
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,759
we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.

445
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,518
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.

446
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:43,049
The guards wear security bands

447
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:45,498
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

448
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:47,220
Leave it to me.

449
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:50,151
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

450
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:51,801
His leg?
Yeah.

451
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:54,119
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

452
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,339
All right.

453
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:59,663
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

454
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:01,659
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

455
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,686
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

456
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:07,835
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.

457
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:09,280
How are we supposed to do that?

458
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:11,557
Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.

459
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,205
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.

460
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:14,367
You must be joking.

461
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:16,198
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

462
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:17,846
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

463
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:20,263
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

464
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,988
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.

465
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:24,036
I got one plan,

466
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:26,172
and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

467
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,253
so figure it out!

468
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:28,412
Oh!

469
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,507
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

470
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,424
Now, this is important.

471
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,996
Once the battery is removed,

472
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,414
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.

473
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,101
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

474
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,991
so you definitely need to get that last.

475
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,458
Or we could just get it first and improvise.

476
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,540
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

477
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,040
<i>GUARD'. Prisoner,</i>

478
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,955
drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,

479
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,918
or we will open fire.

480
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,672
I am

481
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,465
Groot!

482
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:20,862
Fire!

483
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:35,251
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.

484
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:41,922
You idiot!

485
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,702
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?

486
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:52,056
The animal is in control.

487
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:54,188
Fire on my command!

488
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,108
Creepy little beast!

489
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,422
Oh, yeah.

490
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,572
You need my what?

491
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:53,512
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

492
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,010
It's internally wired.

493
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:56,746
I'll figure something out.

494
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:01,648
Drop the leg!

495
00:36:01,655 --> 00:36:04,262
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

496
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:19,789
Rocket!

497
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:24,811
Move to the watchtower!

498
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,449
You!

499
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,963
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

500
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,356
It was one time, man.

501
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,528
We need all available guards in full combat gear...

502
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:21,271
Whoa!

503
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,264
%THUDS)

504
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,385
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

505
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,436
Why is this one here?

506
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:33,405
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

507
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:34,697
I always keep my promises,

508
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,371
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

509
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:37,786
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

510
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,976
Oh, I was just kidding about the leg.

511
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:41,103
I just need these two things.

512
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,853
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

513
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:43,936
Was it funny?

514
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:45,728
Oh, wait, what did he look like hopping around?

515
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,699
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

516
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:51,500
How are we going to leave?

517
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,967
Well, he's got a plan.

518
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:56,739
Right? Or is that
another thing you made up?

519
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,266
I have a plan! I have a plan!

520
00:37:58,391 --> 00:37:59,961
Cease your yammering

521
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,612
and relieve us from this irksome confinement.

522
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,056
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus

523
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,913
on that one.

524
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:07,393
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

525
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:09,105
It's just a metaphor, dude.

526
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,047
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

527
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:13,697
Nothing goes over my head.

528
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:16,858
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

529
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:21,228
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

530
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,342
Those are some big guns.

531
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,702
On my command!

532
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:32,538
Number one!

533
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:35,487
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

534
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,251
Hold on!

535
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:39,981
Number two!

536
00:38:40,744 --> 00:38:42,545
I recognize this animal.

537
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:44,771
We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.

538
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:45,978
Their flesh was quite delicious.

539
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:47,275
Not helping!

540
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,382
Number three!

541
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:56,978
All fire on my command!

542
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:58,358
Three!

543
00:38:58,773 --> 00:38:59,980
Two!

544
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:01,507
One!

545
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:17,041
He turned off the artificial gravity,

546
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,077
everywhere but in here.

547
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:58,010
I told you I had a plan.

548
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,958
That was a pretty good plan.

549
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,333
Huh?

550
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,050
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

551
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:35,981
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one
over in the corner.

552
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,746
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

553
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:39,827
That's rude! They folded yours.

554
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:49,608
The Orb's there. Let's go.

555
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:52,250
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

556
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:53,980
That bastard didn't put it back.

557
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:56,885
- Put what back?
- Here.

558
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,655
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

559
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:01,224
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

560
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,512
Go.

561
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:03,893
Go!

562
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,135
Ah, my neck!

563
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:30,824
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

564
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:33,181
He declined to share that information with me.

565
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:34,184
Well, screw this, then!

566
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,018
I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish.

567
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:38,304
You got the Orb, right?

568
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,007
Yes.

569
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:04,331
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.

570
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:05,333
No!

571
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:07,369
We're not leaving without the Orb.

572
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:16,903
Behold.

573
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:26,139
This one shows spirit.

574
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:29,005
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.

575
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:31,476
Companion, what were you retrieving?

576
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,927
You're an imbecile.

577
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:48,996
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

578
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,436
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

579
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,085
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!

580
00:42:53,128 --> 00:42:54,969
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

581
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:55,971
It's a bomb.

582
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:57,007
- A bomb?
- Yup.

583
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,760
And you leave it lying around?

584
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,414
I was gonna put it in a box.

585
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,541
What's a box gonna do?

586
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,806
- How about this one?
- No! Whoa. Hey!

587
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:04,871
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

588
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,396
- Shut up.
- Hey!

589
00:43:07,592 --> 00:43:08,639
What is that?

590
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:11,474
That's for if things get really hardcore.

591
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:13,059
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

592
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:14,568
No one's blowing up moons.

593
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,733
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.

594
00:43:16,836 --> 00:43:18,918
So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.

595
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:22,092
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

596
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:24,572
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

597
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,070
And how much do you trust me?

598
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:29,166
I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was.

599
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:32,842
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.

600
00:43:32,873 --> 00:43:34,159
I don't know what it is.

601
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:36,498
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.

602
00:43:36,554 --> 00:43:38,478
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

603
00:43:38,512 --> 00:43:39,512
Or just you, murderess!

604
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:41,228
I let you live once, princess!

605
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:43,360
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

606
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,981
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

607
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:51,052
We're stuck together until we get the money.

608
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:53,184
I have no interest in money.

609
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,521
Great.

610
00:43:55,697 --> 00:43:58,780
That means more money for the three of us.

611
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:00,849
Mmm?

612
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,951
For the four of us.

613
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,340
Partners.

614
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:05,972
We have an agreement,

615
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,773
but I would never be partners with the likes of you.

616
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:10,003
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

617
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:14,253
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

618
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:20,086
Oh, she has no idea.

619
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:22,588
If I had a black light,

620
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,070
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

621
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,311
You got issues, Quill.

622
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:38,235
I swear.
I don't know where they went! I swear.

623
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:40,291
If he knew where they were headed,

624
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,474
he would have already told us.

625
00:44:41,503 --> 00:44:42,503
Yeah.

626
00:44:42,998 --> 00:44:44,000
Ronan,

627
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:47,141
the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.

628
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,143
Well, then,

629
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,463
send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant.

630
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:54,878
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

631
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:56,302
And this place?

632
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:57,831
The Nova can't know what we're after.

633
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:01,152
Cleanse it!

634
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,831
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one?

635
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:09,887
I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.

636
00:45:10,197 --> 00:45:12,199
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

637
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:14,389
He's being fully serious.

638
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,697
In that case, I can show you...

639
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:19,518
But first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is,

640
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:21,726
and why everybody cares so damn much about it.

641
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,929
And then you gonna tell me,

642
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:26,135
who out there might wanna buy it.

643
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,844
Sir, the high-end community is a...

644
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,635
The high-end community is a...

645
00:45:33,637 --> 00:45:35,047
It's a tight-knit...

646
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,338
Tight-knit...

647
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:38,166
The high-end community is a very tight-knit...

648
00:45:39,313 --> 00:45:40,679
I cannot possibly betray

649
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:42,840
the confidentiality of my buyers!

650
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:55,876
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

651
00:45:59,262 --> 00:46:00,708
Carina.

652
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:01,847
Yes, Master.

653
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:04,876
Your people do have elbows, do they not?

654
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:06,659
We do, Master.

655
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:09,713
Then use them.

656
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,255
I don't have to remind you

657
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:15,317
what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.

658
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:17,130
Do I?

659
00:46:19,556 --> 00:46:23,800
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

660
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:29,873
Heads up! We're inbound.

661
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:45,806
Whoa.

662
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:49,409
What is it?

663
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,317
<i>GAMORA: It's called Knowhere.</i>

664
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,288
<i>The severed head of an ancient celestial being.</i>

665
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:57,349
Be wary headed in, rodent.

666
00:46:58,378 --> 00:47:01,541
There are no regulations whatsoever here.

667
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:27,610
Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in

668
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,181
to mine the organic matter within the skull.

669
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,389
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

670
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:37,329
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

671
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,076
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

672
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:42,806
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

673
00:47:43,262 --> 00:47:44,422
Billy the Kid,

674
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,496
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

675
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,090
It sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.

676
00:47:48,096 --> 00:47:49,143
Yeah, you should.

677
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:51,559
Excuse me.

678
00:47:51,586 --> 00:47:53,954
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

679
00:48:00,985 --> 00:48:02,635
Get out of here.

680
00:48:07,507 --> 00:48:09,554
Your buyer's in there?

681
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:11,733
We are to wait here for his representative.

682
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:13,286
Get out of here!

683
00:48:13,376 --> 00:48:15,583
This is no respectable establishment.

684
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,688
What do you expect us to do while we wait?

685
00:48:19,322 --> 00:48:20,449
Yes! Yes!

686
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,255
Whoa!

687
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:30,440
Yahoo!

688
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:38,849
My Orloni has won,

689
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:40,728
as I won at all things!

690
00:48:41,304 --> 00:48:43,989
Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.

691
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:48,000
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shooot crazy!

692
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,201
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

693
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:53,443
I might actually lose money on this job.

694
00:48:53,505 --> 00:48:55,155
My connection is making us wait.

695
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:59,507
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

696
00:48:59,525 --> 00:49:01,369
Where yours is more,

697
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:04,324
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

698
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:06,842
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

699
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:08,010
Thanos?

700
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,019
He's not my father.

701
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,518
When Thanos took my home world,

702
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:15,885
he killed my parents in front of me.

703
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,164
He tortured me,

704
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:20,686
turned me into a weapon.

705
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:25,074
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

706
00:49:25,076 --> 00:49:27,043
I couldn't stand by and...

707
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,637
Why would you risk your life for this?

708
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:37,152
My mother gave it to me.

709
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:41,724
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

710
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:42,726
I happened to have it on me,

711
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:44,987
when I was...

712
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,481
The day that she...

713
00:49:49,704 --> 00:49:51,469
You know, when I left Earth.

714
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:53,481
What do you do with it?

715
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:57,260
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

716
00:49:57,262 --> 00:50:01,864
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

717
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,027
Really?

718
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:07,313
On my planet, there's a legend about people like you.

719
00:50:07,313 --> 00:50:08,599
It's called

720
00:50:08,885 --> 00:50:10,092
<i>Footloose.</i>

721
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,179
And in it, a great hero

722
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,510
named Kevin Bacon,

723
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:20,974
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

724
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:23,889
It's the greatest thing there is.

725
00:50:24,576 --> 00:50:26,179
Who put the sticks up their butts?

726
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:27,710
What? No, that's just a...

727
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:29,608
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

728
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:31,885
people use.

729
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,711
The melody is pleasant!

730
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:10,202
- No!
- Ow! What the hell?

731
00:51:10,264 --> 00:51:11,630
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

732
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:14,931
And I am not some starry-eyed waif
here to succumb to your...

733
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:17,112
Your pelvic sorcery!

734
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,574
That is not what is happening here.

735
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:25,273
Oh, no.

736
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,380
Stop it!

737
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:36,768
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

738
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:40,164
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!

739
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:42,112
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

740
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:44,550
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

741
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:46,601
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

742
00:51:46,746 --> 00:51:48,748
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!

743
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,389
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

744
00:51:51,427 --> 00:51:54,159
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

745
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,192
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

746
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:58,608
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

747
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:00,601
and put back together, over and over

748
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:02,755
and turned into some...

749
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:03,938
Some little monster!

750
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:05,976
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

751
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:08,172
He called me "vermin"!

752
00:52:08,231 --> 00:52:10,836
She called me "rodent"!

753
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,242
Let's see if you can laugh

754
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:15,307
after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!

755
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,777
No, no, no, no!

756
00:52:16,862 --> 00:52:19,023
Four billion units! Rocket!

757
00:52:19,126 --> 00:52:20,092
Come on, man. Hey!

758
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:21,125
Suck it up for one more lousy night

759
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:22,885
and you're rich.

760
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:32,342
Fine.

761
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:34,193
But I can't promise, when all this is over

762
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:35,900
I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.

763
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,449
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

764
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:42,525
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

765
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:46,476
We have traveled, halfway across the quadrant.

766
00:52:46,478 --> 00:52:48,480
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

767
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:52,708
- Drax!
- Let him go.

768
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:54,014
We don't need him.

769
00:52:56,413 --> 00:52:58,255
Milady Gamora.

770
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:00,179
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

771
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:08,081
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

772
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:11,266
We house the galaxy's largest collection

773
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:14,282
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.

774
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:21,742
I present to you,

775
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:25,878
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

776
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,085
Oh, my dear Gamora.

777
00:53:41,757 --> 00:53:44,159
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

778
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:46,769
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

779
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,612
We have what we discussed.

780
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:54,952
What is that thing there?

781
00:53:54,954 --> 00:53:56,682
I am Groot.

782
00:54:00,516 --> 00:54:02,166
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

783
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:03,688
Sir...

784
00:54:04,315 --> 00:54:07,559
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

785
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:10,465
At the moment of your death, of course.

786
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,735
I am Groot.

787
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,594
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?

788
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:15,597
That's your pet?

789
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,471
- His what?
- Tivan.

790
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:22,728
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

791
00:54:22,766 --> 00:54:24,815
Very well, then.

792
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:27,358
Let us see what you brought.

793
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,106
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.

794
00:54:43,137 --> 00:54:46,436
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

795
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:47,563
Uh...

796
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:50,856
You shall send a message for me.

797
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:52,563
Oh, my new friends.

798
00:54:53,802 --> 00:54:56,931
Before creation itself,

799
00:54:56,947 --> 00:54:58,677
there were six singularities.

800
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:04,467
Then the universe exploded into existence,

801
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,516
and the remnants of these systems

802
00:55:06,577 --> 00:55:10,023
were forged into concentrated ingots.

803
00:55:10,605 --> 00:55:12,891
Infinity Stones.

804
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:15,393
These stones, it seems,

805
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:17,320
can only be brandished

806
00:55:17,394 --> 00:55:20,876
by beings of extraordinary strength.

807
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:21,932
Observe.

808
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:30,628
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

809
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,157
like wheat in a field.

810
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:37,713
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.

811
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,626
Once, for a moment,

812
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:43,750
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,

813
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,719
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.

814
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,224
Beautiful.

815
00:55:55,871 --> 00:55:58,327
Beyond compare.

816
00:55:58,327 --> 00:56:00,322
Blah, blah, blah.

817
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:04,009
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

818
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:07,057
How would you like to get paid?

819
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,199
What do you think,
fancy man? Units!

820
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:11,608
Very well, then.

821
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:18,298
Carina.

822
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:19,545
Stand back.

823
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:22,802
I will no longer be your slave!

824
00:56:22,842 --> 00:56:24,286
No!

825
00:57:09,605 --> 00:57:10,686
What the...

826
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:22,474
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

827
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:24,563
What do you still have it for?

828
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:25,907
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

829
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,831
I can't believe you had that in your purse!

830
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,614
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

831
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:31,436
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.

832
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:33,342
There's a chance they can contain it.

833
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:34,353
Are you kidding me?

834
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,306
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

835
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,581
So he can destroy the galaxy?

836
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:40,485
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?

837
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:43,478
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

838
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:45,280
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

839
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,726
Peter, listen to me.

840
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:49,949
We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

841
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,565
We have to go back to your ship,

842
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,139
and deliver it to Nova.

843
00:57:53,222 --> 00:57:55,623
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

844
00:57:56,291 --> 00:58:00,204
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

845
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:01,445
who's really nice

846
00:58:01,547 --> 00:58:03,231
for a whole lot of money.

847
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:05,838
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

848
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:06,884
You're despicable.

849
00:58:07,494 --> 00:58:08,494
Dishonorable.

850
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:10,067
Faithless!

851
00:58:10,715 --> 00:58:12,286
- Oh, no.
- At last!

852
00:58:14,628 --> 00:58:17,155
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

853
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:18,927
You called Ronan?

854
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,539
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

855
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:29,646
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

856
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:35,726
Ronan the Accuser!

857
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:38,219
You are the one who transmitted the message?

858
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:39,552
You killed my Wife.

859
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,217
You killed my daughter!

860
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:53,108
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

861
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,682
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the Orb.

862
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,635
No!

863
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:12,673
Nebula,

864
00:59:13,438 --> 00:59:15,088
retrieve the Orb.

865
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:32,777
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

866
00:59:33,347 --> 00:59:34,634
Bring it down!

867
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:51,925
Ah!

868
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:05,134
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.

869
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,552
How? We've got
no weaponry on these things.

870
01:00:07,606 --> 01:00:09,369
These pods are industrial grade.

871
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:10,572
<i>They're nearly indestructible.</i>

872
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:12,882
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

873
01:00:13,282 --> 01:00:14,887
That's not what I'm saying.

874
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:17,097
Oh!

875
01:01:01,313 --> 01:01:02,996
Let me borrow your ride.

876
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,186
I don't recall killing your family.

877
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:42,659
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

878
01:01:58,472 --> 01:02:01,317
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

879
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:02,811
I have to head out.

880
01:02:05,148 --> 01:02:07,117
Wait! These things
aren't meant to go out there.

881
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,706
You are a disappointment, sister.

882
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:18,271
Of all our siblings,

883
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:20,521
I hated you least.

884
01:02:20,914 --> 01:02:22,121
<i>GAMORA: Nebula, please.</i>

885
01:02:22,257 --> 01:02:23,860
If Ronan gets this stone

886
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:25,943
<i>- he'll kill us all.
- Not</i> all.

887
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:29,197
You will already be dead.

888
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:24,460
<i>NEBULA: Ronan, it is done.</i>

889
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:28,251
<i>ROCKET". Quill, come on.</i>

890
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:31,222
<i>Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,</i>

891
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:33,273
<i>but there's nothing we can do for her.</i>

892
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,871
<i>These pods aren't meant to be out here.</i>

893
01:03:34,952 --> 01:03:37,353
<i>In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.</i>

894
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:46,789
Aw, damn it.

895
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,402
<i>ROCKET'. Quill?</i>

896
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,257
Yondu! Yondu.

897
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:52,572
<i>This is Quill!</i>

898
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:56,161
<i>- My coordinates are 227K324.
- Quill.</i>

899
01:03:56,244 --> 01:03:57,405
Quill, what are you doing?

900
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,956
Just outside Knowhere.

901
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:01,173
If you're there, come get me.

902
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,259
I'm all yours.

903
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,248
<i>ROCKET". Quill, don't be ridiculous.</i>

904
01:04:15,693 --> 01:04:17,822
<i>Get back into your pod!</i>

905
01:04:18,072 --> 01:04:21,155
<i>You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.</i>

906
01:04:22,215 --> 01:04:24,059
You'll die in seconds!

907
01:04:24,286 --> 01:04:25,447
Quill.

908
01:05:23,978 --> 01:05:25,628
Quill?

909
01:05:27,163 --> 01:05:28,652
What happened?

910
01:05:29,695 --> 01:05:31,742
I saw you out there.

911
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,474
I don't know what came over me.

912
01:05:36,293 --> 01:05:38,135
But I couldn't let you die.

913
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:43,182
I found something inside of myself.

914
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:45,652
Something

915
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:47,697
incredibly heroic.

916
01:05:49,297 --> 01:05:51,824
I mean, not to brag,

917
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,155
but, objectively...

918
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,257
Where's the Orb?

919
01:05:55,974 --> 01:05:58,215
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

920
01:05:58,275 --> 01:05:59,322
What?

921
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:04,362
Welcome home, Peter.

922
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:28,967
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

923
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,402
Quill just got himself captured.

924
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:36,713
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

925
01:06:36,713 --> 01:06:37,954
take on a frickin' army!

926
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:40,831
You're right.

927
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:45,474
I was a fool.

928
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:49,454
All the anger,

929
01:06:49,987 --> 01:06:51,831
all the rage,

930
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,108
was just to cover my loss.

931
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:07,668
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
"My wife and child are dead."

932
01:07:08,976 --> 01:07:11,184
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

933
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,128
Everybody's got dead people.

934
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:15,346
It's no excuse to get everybody else

935
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,349
dead along the way!

936
01:07:20,907 --> 01:07:23,592
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

937
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,851
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

938
01:07:26,853 --> 01:07:28,742
as fast as we can and maybe,

939
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:33,452
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

940
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:37,003
I am Groot.

941
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:39,382
Save them? How?

942
01:07:39,436 --> 01:07:42,202
I am Groot.

943
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:44,884
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,

944
01:07:44,885 --> 01:07:47,615
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.

945
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:49,295
And there's only two of us!

946
01:07:50,215 --> 01:07:51,456
Three.

947
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:59,021
Aw!

948
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:02,355
You're making me

949
01:08:02,414 --> 01:08:03,985
<i>beat... up</i>

950
01:08:04,103 --> 01:08:05,105
grass!

951
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,208
The Orb is in my possession,

952
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:11,726
as I promised.

953
01:08:11,813 --> 01:08:13,338
<i>Bring it to me.</i>

954
01:08:13,463 --> 01:08:16,752
Yes, that was our agreement.

955
01:08:17,337 --> 01:08:18,988
Bring you the Orb,

956
01:08:19,103 --> 01:08:22,630
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

957
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:27,158
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,

958
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:29,161
I wonder what use I have for you.

959
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,756
<i>BOY,</i>

960
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:33,440
<i>I would reconsider your current course.</i>

961
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:36,688
Master! You cannot!

962
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,275
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.

963
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,430
Not anymore.

964
01:09:03,257 --> 01:09:05,498
You call me "boy!"

965
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:10,086
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,

966
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:13,613
and burn it to its core!

967
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:15,583
Then, Thanos,

968
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:17,618
I am coming for you.

969
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:22,716
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?

970
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:24,895
You dare to oppose me?

971
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:26,810
You see what he has turned me into.

972
01:09:26,811 --> 01:09:31,055
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

973
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:33,171
You <i>betray</i> me?

974
01:09:33,985 --> 01:09:34,987
Steal my money?

975
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,663
Stop it! Leave him alone!

976
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:39,060
When I picked you up as a kid,

977
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:41,448
these boys wanted to eat you.

978
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:43,944
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

979
01:09:43,998 --> 01:09:45,725
I saved your life!

980
01:09:45,725 --> 01:09:47,886
Oh, will you shut up about that? God!

981
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:50,250
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,

982
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:52,935
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

983
01:09:52,936 --> 01:09:56,497
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!

984
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,988
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!

985
01:09:59,037 --> 01:10:00,162
You abducted me, man.

986
01:10:01,108 --> 01:10:03,349
You stole me from my home and from my family.

987
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:05,537
You don't give a damn about your Terra!

988
01:10:05,943 --> 01:10:06,944
You're scared

989
01:10:07,054 --> 01:10:09,163
because you're soft in here.

990
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,246
Here, right here!

991
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:11,546
Yondu!

992
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:12,896
Listen to me.

993
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:15,164
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.

994
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:16,996
I know what he's got, girl.

995
01:10:17,104 --> 01:10:19,391
Then you know we must get it back!

996
01:10:19,444 --> 01:10:22,846
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

997
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:25,850
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

998
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:28,460
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

999
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:29,462
Sentiment?

1000
01:10:30,838 --> 01:10:32,681
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1001
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,578
That's it.

1002
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:40,210
No!

1003
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,337
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

1004
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,579
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1005
01:10:49,252 --> 01:10:51,493
If you kill me now,

1006
01:10:51,555 --> 01:10:55,685
you are saying goodbye to
the biggest score you have ever seen.

1007
01:11:00,453 --> 01:11:01,864
The Stone?

1008
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,493
I hope you got something better than that.

1009
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:07,210
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.

1010
01:11:08,242 --> 01:11:09,573
We got a ringer.

1011
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:11,072
Is that right?

1012
01:11:12,117 --> 01:11:14,484
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.

1013
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:15,774
His ships,

1014
01:11:15,877 --> 01:11:17,447
his army.

1015
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:19,369
He's vulnerable.

1016
01:11:20,057 --> 01:11:21,389
Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh?

1017
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,962
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1018
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:33,300
Let him go!

1019
01:11:34,904 --> 01:11:37,430
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1020
01:11:37,474 --> 01:11:40,204
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1021
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:50,029
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1022
01:11:50,095 --> 01:11:52,301
<i>ROCKET: Attention, idiots.</i>

1023
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:57,997
<i>The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.</i>

1024
01:11:57,997 --> 01:11:59,726
It's a weapon of my own design.

1025
01:11:59,801 --> 01:12:00,926
What the hell?

1026
01:12:01,336 --> 01:12:04,020
<i>If you don't hand over our companions now,</i>

1027
01:12:04,097 --> 01:12:06,385
<i>he's gonna tear your ship a new one.</i>

1028
01:12:06,438 --> 01:12:08,202
<i>A very big new one!</i>

1029
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:11,123
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

1030
01:12:11,538 --> 01:12:14,667
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

1031
01:12:14,685 --> 01:12:16,449
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1032
01:12:16,527 --> 01:12:18,529
We figured it out! We're fine!

1033
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:19,979
<i>ROCKET". Oh, hey, Quill.
What's going on?</i>

1034
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:23,237
You call that "figured it out"?

1035
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,560
We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.

1036
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:27,064
Oh, you want to talk about senseless?

1037
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:29,377
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?

1038
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:32,177
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1039
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:33,988
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over

1040
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:35,438
when you only gave them a count of five?

1041
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:37,989
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae

1042
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:39,048
of the plan.

1043
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:41,385
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

1044
01:12:41,386 --> 01:12:43,467
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

1045
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:44,659
What's important now

1046
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:46,412
is we get the Ravagers' army

1047
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:47,694
to help us save Xandar.

1048
01:12:47,716 --> 01:12:49,206
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1049
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:50,815
who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

1050
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:52,452
We'll figure that part out later.

1051
01:12:52,587 --> 01:12:54,271
We have to stop Ronan.

1052
01:12:54,274 --> 01:12:55,720
How?

1053
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:56,890
I have a plan.

1054
01:12:56,922 --> 01:12:57,923
You've got a plan?

1055
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,381
Yes.

1056
01:12:59,773 --> 01:13:00,988
First of all, you're copying me from

1057
01:13:00,988 --> 01:13:02,403
- when I said I had a plan.
- No, I'm not.

1058
01:13:02,484 --> 01:13:05,360
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1059
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:07,011
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.

1060
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,011
I have part of a plan!

1061
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:11,567
What percentage of a plan do you have?

1062
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:13,064
You don't get to ask questions

1063
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,560
after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

1064
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,448
I just saved Quill.

1065
01:13:16,448 --> 01:13:17,449
We've already established

1066
01:13:17,484 --> 01:13:19,168
that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

1067
01:13:19,172 --> 01:13:21,335
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

1068
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:23,192
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1069
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,278
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1070
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:26,889
What percentage?

1071
01:13:26,997 --> 01:13:28,363
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1072
01:13:28,378 --> 01:13:29,743
Twelve percent?

1073
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:32,728
That's a fake laugh.

1074
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:34,594
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

1075
01:13:34,595 --> 01:13:39,158
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1076
01:13:39,158 --> 01:13:40,159
because that is not a plan.

1077
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,720
It's barely a concept.

1078
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:42,807
You're taking their side?

1079
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,125
I am Groot.

1080
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:45,587
So what, it's better than 11%?

1081
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:47,128
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

1082
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:49,345
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1083
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:53,194
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1084
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,881
Guys.

1085
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:00,725
Come on.

1086
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:02,865
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1087
01:14:02,867 --> 01:14:05,346
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1088
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:08,511
I need your help.

1089
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,408
I look around at us.

1090
01:14:12,764 --> 01:14:13,810
You know what I see?

1091
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:15,682
Losers.

1092
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:19,782
I mean, like,

1093
01:14:19,862 --> 01:14:21,817
folks who have lost stuff.

1094
01:14:21,818 --> 01:14:23,979
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1095
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:26,293
Our homes,

1096
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,332
our families,

1097
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:31,261
normal lives.

1098
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:34,064
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1099
01:14:34,746 --> 01:14:36,270
Today, it's given us something.

1100
01:14:36,356 --> 01:14:37,926
It has given us a chance.

1101
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,372
To do what?

1102
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,440
To give a shooot.

1103
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:44,917
For once.

1104
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:47,029
Not run away.

1105
01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:52,122
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

1106
01:14:52,123 --> 01:14:55,207
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

1107
01:14:56,153 --> 01:14:58,759
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1108
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,729
it's impossible.

1109
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:04,422
You're asking us to die.

1110
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:12,618
Yeah, I guess I am.

1111
01:15:24,846 --> 01:15:25,972
Quill.

1112
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:33,271
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

1113
01:15:37,007 --> 01:15:41,217
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

1114
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,103
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1115
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,877
I will fight beside you.

1116
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,456
And in the end,

1117
01:15:55,268 --> 01:15:57,315
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1118
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,104
I am Groot.

1119
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:19,112
Oh, what the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1120
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,971
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1121
01:16:27,338 --> 01:16:29,501
We're all standing up now.

1122
01:16:29,564 --> 01:16:32,853
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

1123
01:16:39,653 --> 01:16:41,177
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1124
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:43,296
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

1125
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:46,461
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1126
01:16:46,483 --> 01:16:48,132
All plants, animals,

1127
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,698
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1128
01:16:50,242 --> 01:16:52,210
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1129
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,927
<i>PETER: Rocket will lead a team
to blow a hole</i>

1130
01:16:57,032 --> 01:16:59,159
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1131
01:16:59,217 --> 01:17:03,207
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1132
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:05,969
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1133
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:08,814
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1134
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:15,645
Once they know we're on board,

1135
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:19,127
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1136
01:17:19,128 --> 01:17:21,574
<i>Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.</i>

1137
01:17:21,622 --> 01:17:23,347
<i>PETER". We'll make it to the flight deck,</i>

1138
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,351
<i>and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.</i>

1139
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,762
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

1140
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:34,215
Use these devices to contain it.

1141
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,881
If you touch it,

1142
01:17:36,545 --> 01:17:37,876
it will kill you.

1143
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:42,452
<i>PETER: I'll contact
one of the Nova officers</i>

1144
01:17:42,453 --> 01:17:43,693
<i>who arrested us.</i>

1145
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:45,368
<i>Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.</i>

1146
01:17:46,824 --> 01:17:49,988
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.

1147
01:17:50,586 --> 01:17:51,792
That guy's eye.

1148
01:17:52,618 --> 01:17:55,144
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1149
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:56,520
that guy's eye.

1150
01:17:57,529 --> 01:18:00,135
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1151
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:06,194
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE:
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,</i>

1152
01:18:06,198 --> 01:18:07,324
<i>and will arrive in T-minus</i>

1153
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:09,030
<i>fifteen minutes.</i>

1154
01:18:09,345 --> 01:18:10,836
Remember, boy.

1155
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:13,074
At the end of all this,

1156
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:14,427
I get the Stone.

1157
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,969
You cross me, we kill you all.

1158
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:39,907
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1159
01:18:48,972 --> 01:18:50,212
This is a terrible plan.

1160
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:52,435
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1161
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,221
Nova Prime.

1162
01:18:59,675 --> 01:19:00,881
I received a transmission

1163
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:02,220
from one of the Ravagers.

1164
01:19:02,706 --> 01:19:05,277
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1165
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:06,717
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1166
01:19:06,734 --> 01:19:07,939
Good God.

1167
01:19:08,038 --> 01:19:09,962
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1168
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:12,488
Did he say why we should believe him?

1169
01:19:12,488 --> 01:19:14,650
He said his crew just escaped from prison

1170
01:19:14,752 --> 01:19:17,722
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1171
01:19:18,398 --> 01:19:19,559
He says that he's an

1172
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:21,554
"a-hole."

1173
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,055
But he's not,

1174
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,921
and I'm quoting him, here,

1175
01:19:24,956 --> 01:19:27,162
"100% a dick."

1176
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,506
Do you believe him?

1177
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,130
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1178
01:19:32,131 --> 01:19:35,055
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

1179
01:19:38,498 --> 01:19:39,500
Yeah.

1180
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:50,613
A fleet approaches.

1181
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:52,569
They appear to be Ravagers.

1182
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:04,208
Fire!

1183
01:20:15,057 --> 01:20:16,219
<i>YONDU: Cover it down.</i>

1184
01:20:16,323 --> 01:20:18,246
Submerge!

1185
01:20:30,595 --> 01:20:31,801
Rocket, hurry!

1186
01:20:37,997 --> 01:20:39,203
All pilots, dive!

1187
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,462
<i>They're beneath us!</i>

1188
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:50,304
Evacuate the city.

1189
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:53,872
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

1190
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:01,479
Forward thrust, now!

1191
01:21:14,404 --> 01:21:15,404
Come on!

1192
01:21:17,012 --> 01:21:18,617
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1193
01:21:39,953 --> 01:21:41,443
AW, hell!

1194
01:21:41,525 --> 01:21:42,970
I'm going down, Quill!

1195
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,824
No more games with me, boy!

1196
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:45,948
I'll see you

1197
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:47,782
<i>at the end of this!</i>

1198
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:55,171
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1199
01:21:55,835 --> 01:21:57,564
We'll never make it up there!

1200
01:22:11,908 --> 01:22:13,034
<i>SAAL: Peter Quill.</i>

1201
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,537
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

1202
01:22:15,591 --> 01:22:18,878
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

1203
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:20,256
They got my "dick" message!

1204
01:22:20,617 --> 01:22:21,778
Prove me wrong.

1205
01:22:28,904 --> 01:22:30,792
Yes!

1206
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:52,119
Yes!

1207
01:22:55,336 --> 01:22:57,145
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1208
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:02,537
The starboard kern has been breached!

1209
01:23:02,623 --> 01:23:03,954
We have been boarded.

1210
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:05,377
Continue our approach.

1211
01:23:05,462 --> 01:23:06,748
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1212
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:09,489
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

1213
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:10,492
Seal security doors!

1214
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,728
Now!

1215
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:15,613
Get out of my way!

1216
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:27,818
Oh, man.

1217
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:32,274
All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade.

1218
01:23:32,278 --> 01:23:36,123
<i>The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.</i>

1219
01:23:47,967 --> 01:23:49,173
NOVA CORPS PILOT 12 Locked in!

1220
01:23:49,886 --> 01:23:51,091
NOVA CORPS PILOT 22 Locked in.

1221
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:53,533
We're locked in.

1222
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:32,412
I can barely see.

1223
01:24:57,596 --> 01:24:59,326
When did you learn to do that?

1224
01:24:59,782 --> 01:25:00,863
Pretty sure the answer is

1225
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,574
"I am Groot."

1226
01:25:03,618 --> 01:25:06,145
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1227
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:12,510
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1228
01:25:12,903 --> 01:25:15,109
It is pleasing to once again have

1229
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:16,627
friends.

1230
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:20,458
You, Quill, are my friend.

1231
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,666
Thanks.

1232
01:25:21,802 --> 01:25:24,533
- This dumb tree, he is my friend.
- Mmm.

1233
01:25:25,868 --> 01:25:27,073
And this green whore, she, too...

1234
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:28,659
Oh, you must stop!

1235
01:25:31,354 --> 01:25:34,118
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1236
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:36,661
You have always been weak.

1237
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,967
You stupid, traitorous...

1238
01:25:43,823 --> 01:25:46,144
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1239
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:48,240
Head to the flight deck.

1240
01:25:48,349 --> 01:25:51,000
I'll shut down the power to the security doors.

1241
01:25:58,552 --> 01:26:00,362
Yondu Udonta.

1242
01:26:00,432 --> 01:26:03,914
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.

1243
01:26:19,882 --> 01:26:21,408
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1244
01:26:21,493 --> 01:26:23,302
Time to die...

1245
01:26:54,601 --> 01:26:55,649
Nebula, please.

1246
01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:12,253
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1247
01:27:12,324 --> 01:27:14,372
enact immolation initiative.

1248
01:27:17,657 --> 01:27:19,181
They're dive-bombing the city!

1249
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,001
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

1250
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,720
No! Hold your positions.

1251
01:27:52,988 --> 01:27:54,399
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1252
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:56,126
<i>We'll take care of the people down here.</i>

1253
01:27:56,134 --> 01:27:58,341
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1254
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:02,552
Star-Lord.

1255
01:28:02,962 --> 01:28:03,962
Finally.

1256
01:28:09,253 --> 01:28:10,460
Ah!

1257
01:28:14,394 --> 01:28:15,440
You thief!

1258
01:28:26,786 --> 01:28:29,630
You will never make it to Ronan.

1259
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:37,274
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.

1260
01:28:45,467 --> 01:28:46,832
Come on!

1261
01:29:27,858 --> 01:29:31,340
Finger to the throat means death.

1262
01:29:36,796 --> 01:29:38,207
Metaphor.

1263
01:29:38,292 --> 01:29:39,578
Yeah, sorta.

1264
01:29:39,673 --> 01:29:40,835
Oh, no.

1265
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,051
Xandar!

1266
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:12,286
You stand accused.

1267
01:30:12,932 --> 01:30:15,936
<i>Your wretched peace treaty will not</i>

1268
01:30:16,002 --> 01:30:17,162
<i>save you now.</i>

1269
01:30:17,574 --> 01:30:20,863
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1270
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:45,314
Rocket!

1271
01:30:45,426 --> 01:30:47,234
Hold on, Saal, just...

1272
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:14,019
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1273
01:31:14,121 --> 01:31:15,770
<i>The city's been evacuated,</i>

1274
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,341
<i>but we're getting our asses kicked down here.</i>

1275
01:31:18,341 --> 01:31:19,787
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1276
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,431
Nebula!

1277
01:31:45,923 --> 01:31:48,404
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1278
01:31:48,456 --> 01:31:49,980
You know he's crazy.

1279
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,382
I know you're both crazy.

1280
01:31:52,484 --> 01:31:53,645
No!

1281
01:31:56,358 --> 01:31:57,359
- What the...?
- Ah!

1282
01:31:58,545 --> 01:32:00,069
Get out!

1283
01:32:39,707 --> 01:32:40,707
You did it!

1284
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,430
I was mistaken.

1285
01:33:07,444 --> 01:33:09,014
I do remember your family.

1286
01:33:09,591 --> 01:33:11,320
Their screams were

1287
01:33:11,395 --> 01:33:13,523
pitiful. I...

1288
01:35:05,752 --> 01:35:06,878
No, Groot!

1289
01:35:07,402 --> 01:35:08,528
You can't.

1290
01:35:08,552 --> 01:35:10,042
You'll die.

1291
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,353
Why are you doing this?

1292
01:35:12,427 --> 01:35:13,917
<i>Why'?</i>

1293
01:35:20,176 --> 01:35:21,747
We

1294
01:35:22,056 --> 01:35:23,137
are

1295
01:35:23,667 --> 01:35:25,193
Groot.

1296
01:36:26,889 --> 01:36:28,936
I called him an idiot.

1297
01:36:50,635 --> 01:36:52,557
You killed Groot!

1298
01:36:56,466 --> 01:36:57,796
Behold!

1299
01:36:58,577 --> 01:37:01,989
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1300
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:04,444
What fruit have they wrought?

1301
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:08,472
Only that my father and his father

1302
01:37:08,474 --> 01:37:12,034
shall finally know vengeance.

1303
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:14,283
People of Xandar,

1304
01:37:14,802 --> 01:37:16,567
the time has come

1305
01:37:16,645 --> 01:37:19,454
to rejoice and renounce

1306
01:37:19,483 --> 01:37:21,689
your paltry gods!

1307
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:25,721
Your salvation is at hand.

1308
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:39,345
Listen to these words.

1309
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:49,671
Now bring it down hard!

1310
01:37:52,859 --> 01:37:53,939
What are you doing?

1311
01:37:54,393 --> 01:37:56,963
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1312
01:38:00,146 --> 01:38:01,557
Gamora.

1313
01:38:02,487 --> 01:38:04,534
Subtle. Take it back.

1314
01:38:04,865 --> 01:38:07,106
What are you doing?

1315
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,641
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

1316
01:38:25,121 --> 01:38:26,610
No!

1317
01:38:59,149 --> 01:39:02,278
Peter! Take my hand!

1318
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,359
Take my hand, Peter.

1319
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:11,569
Mom.

1320
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,047
<i>GAMORA". Take my hand!</i>

1321
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:08,136
You're mortal!

1322
01:40:08,201 --> 01:40:09,487
How?

1323
01:40:09,582 --> 01:40:11,805
You said it yourself, bitch.

1324
01:40:11,806 --> 01:40:14,173
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1325
01:40:42,725 --> 01:40:43,931
Well, Well, Well.

1326
01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:45,496
Quite the light show.

1327
01:40:47,636 --> 01:40:49,320
Ain't this sweet.

1328
01:40:50,706 --> 01:40:53,231
But you got some business to attend to

1329
01:40:53,277 --> 01:40:55,722
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1330
01:40:57,228 --> 01:40:59,435
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1331
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:01,538
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1332
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:03,511
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1333
01:41:03,518 --> 01:41:05,440
but the only way the universe can survive

1334
01:41:05,512 --> 01:41:07,197
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1335
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:10,091
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1336
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,039
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1337
01:41:15,604 --> 01:41:17,094
Hand it over, son.

1338
01:41:33,211 --> 01:41:34,212
Yondu.

1339
01:41:37,123 --> 01:41:40,412
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1340
01:41:40,884 --> 01:41:43,329
You've seen what it does to people.

1341
01:41:53,542 --> 01:41:55,783
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1342
01:41:56,536 --> 01:41:59,141
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

1343
01:41:59,144 --> 01:42:00,145
like we was hired to do.

1344
01:42:00,217 --> 01:42:02,948
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1345
01:42:07,506 --> 01:42:11,068
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1346
01:42:13,569 --> 01:42:15,412
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1347
01:42:16,483 --> 01:42:18,167
Oh, I know.

1348
01:42:19,898 --> 01:42:21,502
But he was about the only family I had.

1349
01:42:24,234 --> 01:42:25,280
No.

1350
01:42:26,457 --> 01:42:27,663
He wasn't.

1351
01:43:13,873 --> 01:43:15,204
<i>PETER'. Why would you
even know this?</i>

1352
01:43:15,485 --> 01:43:18,207
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1353
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:19,573
so we had it checked out.

1354
01:43:20,818 --> 01:43:22,421
I'm not Terran?

1355
01:43:22,506 --> 01:43:24,030
You are half Terran.

1356
01:43:24,117 --> 01:43:27,757
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1357
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:31,322
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

1358
01:43:31,481 --> 01:43:32,643
That could be why you were able

1359
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:34,988
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1360
01:43:35,355 --> 01:43:36,801
Your friends have arrived.

1361
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:40,820
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1362
01:43:41,112 --> 01:43:43,717
we'd like to express our profound gratitude

1363
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:46,140
for your help in saving Xandar.

1364
01:43:47,787 --> 01:43:50,518
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1365
01:43:50,547 --> 01:43:52,152
he has something to show you.

1366
01:43:52,235 --> 01:43:54,000
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1367
01:44:02,171 --> 01:44:06,654
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1368
01:44:06,966 --> 01:44:08,127
Yes.

1369
01:44:08,234 --> 01:44:10,157
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1370
01:44:10,804 --> 01:44:12,966
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1371
01:44:15,444 --> 01:44:18,210
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

1372
01:44:18,667 --> 01:44:20,636
We salvaged as much as we could.

1373
01:44:21,813 --> 01:44:22,939
Wow.

1374
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:24,541
I...

1375
01:44:26,417 --> 01:44:27,542
Thank you.

1376
01:44:28,948 --> 01:44:30,632
I have a family.

1377
01:44:31,059 --> 01:44:32,548
They're alive because of you.

1378
01:44:36,966 --> 01:44:39,333
Your criminal records have also been expunged.

1379
01:44:39,384 --> 01:44:43,389
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1380
01:44:43,795 --> 01:44:44,796
Question.

1381
01:44:44,907 --> 01:44:46,068
What if I see something that I want to take,

1382
01:44:46,096 --> 01:44:47,427
and it belongs to someone else?

1383
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:48,725
You will be arrested.

1384
01:44:48,743 --> 01:44:50,984
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

1385
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:53,354
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1386
01:44:53,423 --> 01:44:54,872
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1387
01:44:54,958 --> 01:44:56,164
What are you laughing at?

1388
01:44:56,301 --> 01:44:57,746
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1389
01:44:57,759 --> 01:44:59,601
What if someone does something irksome

1390
01:44:59,676 --> 01:45:01,838
and I decide to remove his spine?

1391
01:45:03,283 --> 01:45:04,363
That's...

1392
01:45:05,393 --> 01:45:07,634
That's actually murder.

1393
01:45:09,229 --> 01:45:11,800
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1394
01:45:11,837 --> 01:45:14,681
So... also illegal.

1395
01:45:15,328 --> 01:45:16,376
Hmm.

1396
01:45:18,014 --> 01:45:19,060
They'll be fine, Dey.

1397
01:45:19,703 --> 01:45:20,863
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1398
01:45:20,967 --> 01:45:21,969
You?

1399
01:45:25,226 --> 01:45:28,197
Yeah. Me.

1400
01:45:46,287 --> 01:45:47,813
Peter,

1401
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,689
<i>I know these last few months have been hard for you.</i>

1402
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:55,341
<i>But I'm going to a better place.</i>

1403
01:45:55,417 --> 01:45:57,863
<i>And I will be okay.</i>

1404
01:45:57,911 --> 01:46:01,631
<i>And I will always be with you.</i>

1405
01:46:03,128 --> 01:46:05,814
<i>You are the light of my life.</i>

1406
01:46:05,851 --> 01:46:08,092
<i>My precious son.</i>

1407
01:46:08,921 --> 01:46:11,845
<i>My little Star-Lord.</i>

1408
01:46:12,451 --> 01:46:14,418
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

1409
01:48:09,954 --> 01:48:11,604
So, what should we do next?

1410
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:12,835
Something good?

1411
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:14,917
Something bad?

1412
01:48:15,363 --> 01:48:17,012
A bit Of both?

1413
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:21,394
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1414
01:48:23,457 --> 01:48:24,503
Bit of both.

1415
01:55:30,582 --> 01:55:32,903
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1416
01:55:34,112 --> 01:55:35,636
Gross.

1417
01:55:38,484 --> 01:55:39,975
<i>Yeah!</i>

1418
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:41,828
<i>But it burns going down.</i>
