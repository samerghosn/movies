cosmic fluke.

538
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:41,967
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

539
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,202
A time heist?

540
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:47,570
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

541
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:48,873
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,509
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,710
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,112
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:57,481
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,750
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,217
I don't believe we would.

548
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:04,755
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,657
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,693
if there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:12,195
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,164
I believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,498
will be our
collective demise.

554
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:18,233
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:21,036
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

556
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,806

on sporting events.

right there, Scott.

telling me

559
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:28,878
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,615
is based on

561
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,650
- Is it?
- No.

562
00:35:33,652 --> 00:35:34,751
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:35,918
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

564
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,487
That's not how
quantum physics works.

Tony.

566
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:43,693
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:45,597
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:49,699
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,268
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:55,003
But I lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,606
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:59,942
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:35:59,943 --> 00:36:01,143
to bring everyone back,

574
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:02,811
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:04,648
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

No, I wanna do it right.

First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

611

For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

like he's some kind
of disease...

616
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,471
something to get rid of.

617

at him as the cure.

01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:09,617
but I don't even know

1066
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:10,952
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1067
01:02:10,954 --> 01:02:14,121
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1068
01:02:14,123 --> 01:02:16,090
for one round-trip each.

1069
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:17,125
And these stones have been

1070
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:19,393
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1071
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:20,762
Our history.

1072
01:02:20,764 --> 01:02:23,898
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1073
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,936
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

1074
01:02:26,302 --> 01:02:27,704
Correct.

1075
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:30,603
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1076
01:02:30,606 --> 01:02:31,974
Thor, what do you know?

1077
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:38,744
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1078
01:02:38,746 --> 01:02:41,583
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1079
01:02:44,452 --> 01:02:46,188
Uh, where to start? Um...

1080
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,724
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1081
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:53,726
Someone called it
a stone before.

1082
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:58,231
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1083
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,000
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1084
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:01,501
and stop saying that.

1085
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:04,271
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1086
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:06,306
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1087
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:10,411
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1088
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:12,945
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)
Scary beings.

1089
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:14,717
So, Jane, actually...

1090
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:16,983
Oh, there she is.

1091
01:03:16,985 --> 01:03:21,420
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1092
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,791
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1093
01:03:24,793 --> 01:03:28,195
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1094
01:03:28,197 --> 01:03:29,963
and she became
very, very sick.

1095
01:03:29,965 --> 01:03:32,132
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1096
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:33,400
which is where I'm from...

1097
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:35,501
and we had to try
and fix her.

1098
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:37,137
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1099
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:40,842
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1100
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:44,146
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1101
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,980
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1102
01:03:46,981 --> 01:03:49,148
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1103
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,083
(MOUTHING)

1104
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:51,485
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1105
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:52,784
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1106
01:03:52,786 --> 01:03:54,786
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1107
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,489
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1108
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:58,025
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1109
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,193
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1110
01:04:01,195 --> 01:04:03,161
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1111
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:06,333
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1112
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:09,302
- SMART HULK: Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1113
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,971
Quill was a person.

1114
01:04:11,972 --> 01:04:14,572
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1115
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:15,974
Oh, look.

1116

all happy and everything.

the Soul Stone on Vormir.

What is Vormir?

1121
01:04:28,922 --> 01:04:30,822

of celestial existence.

murdered my sister.

Mm... Bleecker Street.

01:04:58,251 --> 01:04:59,784
Wait, he lived
in New York?

1133

<i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i>

1148

<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

we should know what to expect.

Did you see what happens
in the future?

1928
01:47:14,842 --> 01:47:17,345
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1929
01:47:18,579 --> 01:47:20,782
You wanna know
how he does that?

1930
01:47:22,082 --> 01:47:26,421
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1931
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,220
That's enough.

you're useless.

01:48:18,372 --> 01:48:19,372
Wow.

Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

No.

I don't think so.

1971
01:50:23,528 --> 01:50:25,863
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1972
01:50:27,264 --> 01:50:28,500
I didn't.

1973
01:50:29,701 --> 01:50:32,403
Thanos left here
with the stone...

01:51:04,002 --> 01:51:05,335
I guess we do.

1984

I'm starting to think

1985
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:18,646
we mean different
people here, Natasha.

all decent on me now.

want you to. How's that?

no offense,

but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

about space magic.

who's gonna put that on yet.

just sitting around

waiting for
the right opportunity?

2073
01:58:14,157 --> 01:58:15,590
We should at least
discuss it.

Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2075
01:58:17,627 --> 01:58:19,462
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

okay?

falls upon me.

- It's my duty.

- It's not that. (SHUSHES)

- Stop it! Just let me.

Just let me do it.

Just let me do something good.
Something right.

Look, it's not
just the fact...

2084
01:58:37,145 --> 01:58:38,445
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

2085

to light up a continent.

01:58:39,381 --> 01:58:41,448
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.
