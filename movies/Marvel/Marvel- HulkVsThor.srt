1
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:23,328
Outside of the world you know...

2
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:26,899
There exists the realm eternal.

3
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,314
Asgaard.

4
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:32,339
The shining light of the
nine worlds.

5
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:36,742
Asgaard is home to the gods.

6
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:43,758
All of them who bow down before the all father...

7
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,743
Odin.

8
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:53,941
Odin's life blood flows through Asgaard,
And Asgaard is Odin.

9
00:01:53,976 --> 00:02:00,220
His power is all and
he keeps the Asgaardian realm safe.

10
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:04,841
But once each winter the all father
must rest...

11
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:08,160
and enter the Odin sleep.

12
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:14,844
While Odin slumbers his absence
leaves Asgaard vulnerable.

13
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,426
And this is when the wicked 
descend upon his kingdom.

14
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:47,905
For seven days an onslought of trolls,
giants, dark elves and demons...

15
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,459
seek to take control of the nine worlds.

16
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:56,988
But they are eternally defeated
By Him!...

17
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:03,798
My arrogant, Oafish, brute of a step brother...

18
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,469
Thor.

19
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:20,389
I don't understand.
Where am I?

20
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,291
Here me, Human.

21
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:36,885
You have been brought to Asgaard
Because in all the Universe...

22
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:43,852
Only you have ever brought near defeat
to the mighty Thor.

23
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:48,820
What?
I couldn't.

24
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:55,198
Not thee, Bruce Banner.
You are but a snivelling, sad creature.

25
00:03:55,463 --> 00:04:00,874
I speak of your other half.
I speak of the Hulk.

26
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:05,704
There is one day left in Odin-sleep.

27
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,746
The cycle is nearly complete.

28
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:16,349
As always the Asgaardians will emerge
victorious against the seige of darkness.

29
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:24,570
My brother will seek peace,
And then,Then I shall destroy him.

30
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:43,657
Verily we must say that was
far better than the last winter.

31
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:48,461
Tell us, Volstagg, are you going
to dispatch that troll beneath you...

32
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,663
or are you saving it for dinner?

33
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:56,278
That all depends on how much need I partake in.

34
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,930
Did my ears deceive me?
Did Hogan the grim make a joke?

35
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:06,170
And here we thought you were in a foul mood
because you didn't get to slay a frost giant.

36
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,392
I've still slain more than thee, Fandral.

37
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:12,686
Well we shall see who the 
maidens reward more.

38
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:29,404
In a mere hours the all father will awaken
then we may all rejoyce.

39
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:39,043
Your lady Siff, would know what vexes thee.

40
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:45,330
Aye, we won the day.
All is well in the realm of Asgaard.

41
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:51,559
But only untill the next Odin-Sleep.
-It is as it has always been.

42
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:55,126
We must learn to savour 
the moments of peace.

43
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:57,126
And accept the cycle of death?

44
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,335
How many of our brothers and sisters
have fallen to this madness?

45
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,377
Must we be chained to 
this eternal struggle?

46
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:07,139
Be careful what you wish for my love...

47
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:12,234
But when the cycle does break,
when things do change...

48
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,060
then comes the end of days.
Then comes Ragnarok.

49
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,154
Perhaps our fates are not ours to choose.

50
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:25,622
Then come, let us return to
my fathers palace...

51
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,682
prepare for his awakening.

52
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:37,099
Please I'm begging you.
Don't do this.

53
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:40,875
I've fought all my life
to keep the Hulk inside.

54
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,039
You don't know the destruction he can cause.

55
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:49,443
Don't know?
You fool.

56
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:52,601
I'm counting on it.

57
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:56,039
Look at you.
so weak.

58
00:06:56,074 --> 00:07:00,055
Were it not for you inside the Hulk's mind
suppressing his power...

59
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,990
He would rule Midgaard
with his rage.

60
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,855
I won't let him out.
I won't let you do this.

61
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,552
You won't let me?
How amusing you mortals are.

62
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,377
Now let me see if I recall correctly.

63
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:21,104
It is anger that unleashes the beast?

64
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:34,113
I seem to have forgotten the 
frailty of mortals.

65
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:38,353
Look Amora I do believe he's going to...

66
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,369
No.
That is impossible.

67
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,767
Now.

68
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:55,463
And so begins the end of Thor.

69
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:07,448
You wouldn't thing thee, Balder?

70
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,976
One last troll with dreams of conquest?

71
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,442
Perhaps.

72
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,842
Come Hogun, Fandral.

73
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:27,368
Let us give it to this scoundrell the gift of battle.

74
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:09,643
The creature's power is incredible.

75
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,740
Take care Loki.
My spell bonds you to the creature...

76
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:17,621
and while you are master to it
I can feel him fighting you.

77
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:22,057
You have to listen to me.
It can't be controlled.

78
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:27,077
Do not try my patience worm.
Must I turn my attentions to thee.

79
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:26,490
You are no troll, monster.

80
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:45,629
That is Balder's horn.
But this is not right.

81
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:50,761
Asgaards enemies are all defeated.
- And yet the alarm has sounded.

82
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,492
Stay at Odin's side.

83
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:57,163
Should I fail to meet this threat
You must protect him.

84
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:10,422
If Thor should fall,
What Hope has Asgaard?

85
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:23,776
You will have to kill me monster...

86
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:27,183
For I shall not yield.

87
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:59,266
Thor, the creature like nothing
I've ever seen.

88
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:05,116
Aye, my friend.
This is no immortal evil that we face now.

89
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:08,704
The Hulk has come to Asgaard.

90
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:24,397
Dr. Banner, can you hear
me inside the beast?

91
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,499
Why have you come here?

92
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:34,885
Why to kill you of course.
Dear step brother.

93
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,901
I have waited an eternity for this.

94
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,562
To crush you with my bare hands.

95
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,011
To match your might.

96
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:57,893
To feel your life fade away as my hands
wrap around your throat.

97
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,283
Never.

98
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,848
Come to your new master, Mjolnir...

99
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:16,292
And let us smite my step brother.

100
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:19,455
For there are none stronger than Loki now.

101
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:32,661
Rise Cussed hammer.

102
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:35,599
Loki enough.
Your own rage fuels the beast.

103
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:38,502
I can feel the spell breaking.

104
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:44,198
I will, have this hammer.

105
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,328
Neh, you will have its thunder.

106
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:17,449
For Odin.
For Asgaard.

107
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:38,208
The monster, it is raging carnage.
It has shattered the spell.

108
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:43,622
The Hulk is free.

109
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:55,926
Will thou yield, Loki?

110
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:20,377
Truly this is the best of both worlds.

111
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:24,502
I need not control the beast 
to enjoy it's wrath.

112
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,901
Goodbye, brother.

113
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:30,332
This...
This is not what I wanted.

114
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:35,323
There's no going back Amora.

115
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:42,400
After all, if not for your black broken heart
none of this would have been possible.

116
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:48,595
You don't know what you've done.

117
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,789
With no one to bring the Hulk in,
he'll tear down your entire world.

118
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:59,900
I find your prattling useless mortal,
just as you are now useless to me.

119
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:00,996
For Odin.
For Asgaard.

120
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:19,775
Thor,
My love.

121
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,003
I...I was angered,
When you chose Siff over me, I did not.

122
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:29,565
I wanted thy love, not your death.

123
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,240
Please,
Please come back to me.

124
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,109
Amora,
- Yes my love?

125
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:01,430
Where, is Loki?

126
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:47,184
What is that monster doing?
He travels towards Odin.

127
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:59,629
Loki,
I would have words with you.

128
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:03,986
No, You were at Hela's door,
I defeated you.

129
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,236
You,
You dare cross the god of...

130
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:36,184
The Hulk will be sent back to Midgard
and then you will answer to Odin.

131
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:40,318
Fine, Take the creature,
It provided me with amusement enough...

132
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,769
Seeing it pummel you nion to death.

133
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:46,435
Loki you fool,
You killed him.

134
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:48,696
Do you know what you've done?

135
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:53,571
Because the mortal died here
Hela claimed his soul.

136
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,672
Without his soul I cannot
return him to Midgard.

137
00:23:56,707 --> 00:24:01,485
Without Bruce Banner, The Hulk
cannot leave Asgaard.

138
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:39,605
Valkeries, Wariors...
Your seats in Walhalla are promised.

139
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,849
Protect Odin with your lives.

140
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:46,139
For Asgaard.

141
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:54,075
I saw the beast's eyes brother.

142
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,945
It will not stop untill all of Asgaard is destroyed,
Untill Odin is broken.

143
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:03,015
You have bought a new Ragnarok down
upon us all.

144
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:08,579
It's possible I made
a poor choice.

145
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:17,099
Amora, I need you by Odin's side.
Protect him along with Lady Siff.

146
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,279
As you wish.

147
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:31,689
Loki, you will send whatever dark forces you have left
to battle the Hulk.

148
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:36,065
Then you and I,
we go out to help destiny.

149
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:58,875
Rest your weapons, Shieldmage.
I've come to aid thee at Odin's defence,
At Thor's request.

150
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,141
His request You say?
More likely his penance, witch.

151
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:07,373
No doubt he saw your hand in this attack.

152
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:12,439
A punishment more cruel than you can imagine cow.

153
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,784
Loki, The god of mischief bids 
you death mortal creature.

154
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,040
Long have I wished never
to see this realm.

155
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:11,645
I always forget what a busy time the 
Odin sleep is for my daughter.

156
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:15,024
Does thou see any newly arrived
friends here, brother?

157
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,153
Have a care, Loki.
Unless yee stay here.

158
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:32,391
Where am I?

159
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:59,010
No, this
Doesn't make any sense.

160
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,218
Bruce?
Are you OK?

161
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,080
Betty?

162
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,781
I thought...
I don't understand.

163
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:16,023
I was alone, and then...
- Your not alone Bruce.

164
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
Not any more.

165
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,112
Daddy.

166
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,211
Come play with me.

167
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,640
Hail, Hela,
goddess of the dead.

168
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,890
We seek an audience.

169
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:02,122
The sons of Odin risk much
entering my realm.

170
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:06,450
The nine worlds of Asgaard are in
great peril, mistress...

171
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,773
including Hell and Niflheim.

172
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:12,024
A new Ragnarok is upon us
and we need your help.

173
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,317
We need Bruce Banner.

174
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:24,040
The mortal soul is mine, Asgaardian.

175
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,333
As yours nearly was this very day.

176
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,706
and may well be again

177
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:36,102
You would risk everything for the sake of one soul?
- Just as you would, Odin's son.

178
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:41,994
But you do not have one soul daughter.
you have half a soul.

179
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:43,752
You have Bruce Banner.

180
00:29:43,852 --> 00:29:47,672
You'll need the Hulk to
complete your prize.

181
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:33,193
Are you alright?

182
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:37,681
I feel...
I feel great.

183
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,867
I can't imagine anything better.

184
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,087
Bruce Banner.

185
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,478
Awake from this dream.

186
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,496
Betty?

187
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:17,155
Where are you?

188
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,996
The world of the living has need of you.

189
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,922
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

190
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,570
Not I.
He.

191
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:39,655
Friend Banner, for the sake of all Asgaard
you must become the Hulk once more.

192
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:45,288
Betty?
Where is...

193
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,689
No.

194
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:49,329
No. you can't ask me to do that.
I finally had peace.

195
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,116
You don't know what your asking.

196
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:56,350
Your time in Hell
certainly has not made you less of a worm, mortal.

197
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:33,266
Bruce Banner, I know thee to
be a man of honour, I know.

198
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:38,396
Thee to be a hero, the lives at stake are
not your concern, not even human.

199
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:43,203
But I ask you anyway, be that hero now.

200
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:50,465
No, I can't.

201
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,814
Die beast.

202
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,804
The Hulk's soul is rightfully yours, daughter.

203
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:13,404
Take it bring the Hulk to hell merge the
two halves of his soul and claim him.

204
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:35,681
I will not force you to forsake me
the rewards of the after life

205
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:43,185
But you must be whole.
- No. I won't, you don't understand.

206
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:56,282
No.

207
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:45,766
Curse you Loki, for convincing me
to bring this creature to my realm

208
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,121
stay thy hand Hela.
We shall retrieve the Hulk.

209
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:53,304
We? the Hulk's fists have Addled
your mind thunderer.

210
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,985
Fight with me brother, or die alone.

211
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:00,839
Not much of a threat,
considering we're already in hell.

212
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:05,824
Have that thee.

213
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:03,706
My apologies.
I was enjoying the performance.

214
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:34,063
Let them go.
I'm the one you want.

215
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:42,316
Come on.

216
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:04,448
Hulk...
Tired.

217
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,124
You called him weak, Loki.

218
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,661
But there is more strength and 
courage in that man than you will ever know.

219
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:24,856
This soul is too dangerous to keep in Hell...

220
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:27,642
And to valuable to lose to Walhalla.

221
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,827
I will return him to Midgaard.

222
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,651
Enough of this Ridiculousness.

223
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:48,644
To think that loki, prince of darkness, should
waste his time defending Asgaard.

224
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,342
Nay brother, we leave together...

225
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:54,789
For you still have much to answer for.

226
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:58,063
Indeed you both do.

227
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:01,387
For today Hela has Relinquished a soul...

228
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,644
And she demands one in exchange.

229
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:09,123
You may try to take my soul death Goddess,
But I will make you fight for it.

230
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:12,387
And your realm has suffered
much already this day.

231
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:21,356
You speak the truth.
so I shall take his soul instead.

232
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:31,769
Thor.
I'v helped you.

233
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,334
I could fight you for Loki's soul.
- will you?

234
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,602
He is my father.
His day will not be eternal.

235
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:51,329
But know this Odin's son:
your soul will be mine.

236
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:53,918
And I will keep it forever.

237
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,688
Your fate is Inescapable.

238
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,125
We shall see.

239
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:39,826
Thus the cycle begins anew.

240
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:46,349
Asgaard is safe once again,
defended to the end by it's heroes...

241
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:49,169
I am proud of each of you that stand before me..

242
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:52,975
The day was saved by loyalty and sacrifice.

243
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,297
We honour those who fought beside us.

244
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:59,974
Those who are know longer with us.

245
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:04,628
and we defy those who would
see us brought to ruin.

246
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:14,437
And while the rewards of Walhalla await all of Asgaard's
heroes, this day we honour a hero of Midgaard.

247
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:19,834
A mortal who sacrificed everything
for a land not his own.

248
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:27,156
This day a human showed
the gods what legends are made of.

249
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:30,952
Hail the mortal,
Bruce Banner.
