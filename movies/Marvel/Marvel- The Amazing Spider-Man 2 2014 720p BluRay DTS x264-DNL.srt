1
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:55,578
People will say I am
a monster for what I've done.

2
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,250
And maybe they're right.

3
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,754
I always thought
that I'd have more...

4
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:05,043
- time.
- Dad?

5
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:06,793
Dad!

6
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,044
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,921
Peter?

8
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,188
He likes to sleep
with the light on at night.

9
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:29,939
Mary, we have to go.

10
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:34,865
Dad.

11
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:39,323
Be good.

12
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,711
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

13
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:55,930
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

14
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:57,800
Just in case we...

15
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,312
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

16
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,977
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

17
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:05,848
Mary, we've been through this.

18
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,901
Our life as we know it is over.

19
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:12,697
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

20
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:15,866
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

21
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,865
He's just a little boy.

22
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,954
I know, I know.
But it's gonna be okay.

23
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,490
It's gonna be all right.

24
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:40,219
No rest for the weary, huh?

25
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,433
No, I'm afraid not.

26
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,686
Occupational hazard, I guess.

27
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,727
What is it you're working on?

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,530
Uh, just planning ahead. Do you
think I could speak with the pilot?

29
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:56,651
Something you need?

30
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:59,231
Perhaps I can help.

31
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,878
I'd just like to radio ahead
and make sure everything's in order

32
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,242
for when we land.

33
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:07,459
I think we both know

34
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,021
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

35
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,802
Richard.

36
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,053
- They say you're a genius.
- Richard!

37
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,725
Not if you thought
you could escape.

38
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:31,973
Richard!

39
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:34,225
Mary!

40
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,615
Mary!

41
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:01,961
Mare.

42
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:04,346
It's okay. It's okay.
That's okay. It's okay.

43
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,762
I got you. I have you,
okay? Okay?

44
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,393
Just gonna make you safe.

45
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,103
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

46
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:14,975
Roosevelt. What?

47
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:16,315
Roosevelt.

48
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,848
It's back up. It's back up.
Oh...

49
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,497
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,951
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

51
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,526
Whoo!

52
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,149
Ow!

53
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,576
Yee-hee! Hoo-hoo!

54
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,459
What do you got for me today,
New York?

55
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:47,625
Reporting live from
New York 1 chopper.

56
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:51,091
An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium
has been hijacked.

57
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:53,129
A police chase is in progress.

58
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,752
All right. Let's get to work.

59
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,927
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

60
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:33,378
Spider-Man!

61
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,174
Hello, pedestrians.

62
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,020
Knock, knock.

63
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:57,025
Mr. Criminal?

64
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,653
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing,

65
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,153
just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it? Whoa!

66
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,913
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

67
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,578
I am killer! Whoa, okay.

68
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:12,703
Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material

69
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,547
and is highly explosive.

70
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:18,668
Excuse me. There's more room on
the sidewalk, folks, please.

71
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,758
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

72
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,009
A little help?

73
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,381
A little help, please.

74
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:29,721
You having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

75
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,395
Whoa. Coming through.

76
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,731
Too much work...

77
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,513
Oh, this is bad.

78
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:38,903
I'm gonna be right back. Aah!

79
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,442
Heads up. Watch out.

80
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,990
Whoo... Okay. Okay.
There you go.

81
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,990
You okay? You all right?
You're Spider-Man.

82
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,538
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

83
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,629
"Max"? How do you know my name?

84
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,043
It's written on your badge.

85
00:09:58,289 --> 00:09:59,290
I'm a nobody.

86
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,759
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

87
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:02,673
Lick that.

88
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,261
All right. Listen to me.

89
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,551
Now I need you. Really?

90
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,317
You're my eyes and ears out here.
Okay.

91
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,505
All right? All right.

92
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:09,765
I'll see you out there.

93
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:14,062
Warning. Violation of protocol.

94
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,838
Hands up!

95
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,095
Get him, Spidey!

96
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,312
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

97
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:02,809
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

98
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,562
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

99
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:09,153
Get the hell out of the way!

100
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,903
Okay. Stop it! Stop it! Whew.

101
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:14,621
Oh, come on.

102
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,789
Hey, wait. Come back here.

103
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:20,701
Heel!

104
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,077
I got you.

105
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,010
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

106
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,057
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

107
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,645
I know, I'm sorry.
Where are you?

108
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,605
1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.

109
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:44,441
Five minutes. Ten tops.

110
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,399
Are those sirens? No.

111
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:48,692
Peter? No.

112
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:50,438
Peter? No sirens.

113
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,115
No...

114
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:53,900
Peter.

115
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,702
What is happening?

116
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,071
Peter.

117
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,618
Peter.

118
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:04,961
Hello?

119
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:09,419
Peter? Pe...
I'll be right there. Promise.

120
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:14,046
This year's Valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

121
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:30,277
Good morning, esteemed faculty,

122
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,397
and families of my fellow graduates.

123
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,865
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

124
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,030
Hello.

125
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,703
Hey! Get off! I told you.

126
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,748
I am running a bit late.

127
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:48,586
It's over, Spider.

128
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:49,830
Really?!

129
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,048
I know we all think that we're immortal.

130
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,918
We're supposed to feel that way.

131
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:55,259
We're graduating.

132
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,172
But, like our brief four years
in high school,

133
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:01,674
what makes life valuable

134
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,052
is that it doesn't last forever.

135
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,725
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

136
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,788
And I know that now more than ever.

137
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,820
And I say it,

138
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,567
today of all days,

139
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,448
to remind us that time is luck.

140
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,744
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

141
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,663
Make yours count for something.

142
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,043
Fight for what matters to you.

143
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,538
No matter what.

144
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:35,173
Because even if we fall short,

145
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:38,130
what better way is there to live?

146
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:52,731
I'll take that. That's not yours.

147
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,519
Huh?

148
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,741
This is not end, Spider!

149
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,243
Michael Oates.

150
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,626
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

151
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,251
Alexis Ortiz.

152
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,211
Bo Parisi.

153
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,302
Peter Parker.

154
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,683
Hey, I think I know that guy.

155
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,099
Peter Park...

156
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:35,890
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:49,238
Ha, ha. Wait, do that again.
Do that again. Oh.

158
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:54,288
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

159
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,706
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

160
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,705
I am so proud of you.
You earned it.

161
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:02,332
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

162
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,172
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

163
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:06,419
Yeah, I know too.

164
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,799
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

165
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:14,144
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

166
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:15,638
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

167
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:17,433
No. What do you mean, no?

168
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,058
Ha-ha-ha! Ben told me he made it up.

169
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:23,485
You really did
learn something here.

170
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:29,033
I wish your Uncle
could have been here.

171
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,445
Yeah, me too.

172
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,614
And my folks.

173
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,578
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,379
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

175
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,128
All right, you can go. Go on.
Huh?

176
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,374
I'll be right back.

177
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,346
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

178
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:52,090
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

179
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,932
Cheese. Cheese.

180
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:57,099
Okay. I'll just be over here.
Yeah, just give me two seconds.

181
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,937
Don't go too far.
It's good to see you.

182
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:00,648
All right. All right.

183
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:02,524
Hey.

184
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,730
Did your traffic jam
have anything to do with

185
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,854
the Russian Mob

186
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:10,982
and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

187
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,234
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

188
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,202
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

189
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:16,445
Okay.

190
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:18,451
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

191
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,456
Can't keep me away.

192
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:22,041
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

193
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,500
I won't be. Okay.

194
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:28,082
And I'm gonna do my speech
for you.

195
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:30,551
All night? I wanna hear it
all night long.

196
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,841
Over and over again, all night long.
Okay.

197
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:34,755
Oh, my gosh. It was pretty good.

198
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:37,975
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

199
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:43,769
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

200
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:45,856
Hi.

201
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,445
You're gonna make enemies.

202
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,480
People will get hurt.

203
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:56,408
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

204
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:00,533
Leave Gwen out of it.

205
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,291
Promise me that.

206
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,246
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

207
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,431
Peter's outside. I'm gonna
go see if he's okay.

208
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:26,396
What are you doing?
What are you?

209
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:29,856
Peter.

210
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,025
What is it?

211
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,568
Hey. What's wrong?

212
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:38,904
Are you all right?

213
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,528
I don't know what I'm doing.

214
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,701
It's my father, isn't it?

215
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,374
Yeah.

216
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,663
I see him everywhere I go.

217
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,461
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

218
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:56,506
Yeah, but we've talked about this.
I know, but, Gwen...

219
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,628
It's not his choice. Gwen.

220
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,798
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

221
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:06,053
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.

222
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:09,438
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

223
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,932
I don't know,
what does that make you?

224
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,560
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

225
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:21,441
I thought that it meant you loved me.
I do love you.

226
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:24,824
I love you.

227
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,281
Then why isn't that enough?

228
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:29,909
Huh?

229
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,126
Because what if
something happens to you

230
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,871
just like it happened to him
because of me?

231
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:38,295
No, wait, wait, wait.
Listen. No, n...

232
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,213
I cannot let that happen.

233
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,090
Listen to me.

234
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:44,009
You're Spider-Man...

235
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:46,804
and I love that.

236
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,305
But I love Peter Parker more.

237
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:55,981
That's worth it to me.

238
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,060
I can't lose you too.

239
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,988
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,

240
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:08,570
who does that work out for, Peter?

241
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:13,000
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

242
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:17,496
Wow.

243
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:20,298
You have done this to me

244
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:25,011
again and again, Peter.

245
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,506
I can't live like this.

246
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,599
I break up with you.

247
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,105
I break up with you.

248
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,595
Good morning, New Yorkers.

249
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:20,189
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

250
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:21,729
A few clouds to start us off...

251
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:25,229
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate

252
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:27,855
over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

253
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:29,145
How about that Spider-Man?

254
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:31,734
Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.

255
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,576
We wanna hear your calls.

256
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:37,163
I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

257
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,535
Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?

258
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,875
It's you and me, taxpayers.

259
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,665
You make this? Yeah.

260
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,792
This is a wind turbine.

261
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,462
You made this? No way.

262
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,134
This is amazing.

263
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:52,840
It's good as new, right?

264
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,972
I'll walk you home.

265
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:57,016
What's your name? Jorge.

266
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,477
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

267
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,644
I don't feel like my kids
are safe with him out there.

268
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,733
Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.

269
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:09,775
Some folks think that there
might be more than one Spider-Man.

270
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,568
What do you think?

271
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,488
One guy or many?

272
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,577
I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.

273
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,820
Hey.

274
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,539
Nice outfit. Thanks.

275
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,941
We have a caller on the line
named Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.

276
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,996
Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

277
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,588
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

278
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,049
He saved my life one time.

279
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,531
We sort of became best friends.

280
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,630
How much?

281
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,096
Hey, you're that spider guy.

282
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,467
I'm Spider-Man.

283
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:40,883
Huh?

284
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,314
I'm Spider-Man.

285
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,434
This Spider-Man... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.

286
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,483
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

287
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,598
Peter, honey?

288
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,770
Can I come in?

289
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,766
No!

290
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,064
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

291
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,394
You said you would
take my car into the shop

292
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,113
because it keeps dying,
remember?

293
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,278
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

294
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,323
Peter, please just let me in.
All right?

295
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:43,569
I'm trying to get my...

296
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:46,993
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

297
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,913
No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
What are you do...?

298
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,962
Peter! For goodness sakes.
You said you're gonna

299
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:55,790
take my car into the
shop because it Kee...!

300
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,010
Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm okay.

301
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:00,377
I'm just...

302
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,172
I'm very naked right now.

303
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:04,640
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

304
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:06,971
It is? Yes.

305
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:10,016
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

306
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,105
We have no chimney.

307
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:13,641
What?

308
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:15,358
You're late. I know, I'm late.

309
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,228
Downstairs, now.

310
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:20,230
Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
All right, I'm leaving.

311
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,862
Morning, I love you.
I love you too. Hurry up.

312
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,200
Whoa. Well, look who's here.

313
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:08,614
Spidey.

314
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,445
How was your morning?

315
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,788
Aces, Max, aces.

316
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:15,031
I've been out saving the world.

317
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:16,622
Protecting everybody.

318
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,621
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

319
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,173
That's why you're here.

320
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,339
You remembered my birthday.

321
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:30,259
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,

322
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:34,009
you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

323
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,061
But of course you would.

324
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:38,814
Why wouldn't you visit me?

325
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:40,895
We're best friends.

326
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:47,230
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

327
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,681
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

328
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,698
I know what they say about you
in the press

329
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:55,073
but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

330
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:56,914
Because you're amazing.

331
00:24:57,157 --> 00:25:00,207
Wow. That's what the press needs.

332
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:03,295
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

333
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:05,381
You like that, Spidey?

334
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,546
I like it a lot, Max.

335
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,470
Good. Because today

336
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,259
is going to be

337
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,506
amazing.

338
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:17,268
Yeah. Circuit 39.

339
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:24,141
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

340
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:27,361
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress

341
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:29,946
to replace me because I start
my training rounds

342
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:31,280
at the hospital.

343
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:34,073
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

344
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:35,615
Because he'll worry.

345
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:38,239
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

346
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,035
Uh, double shift on Thursday.

347
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,787
Okay, bye.

348
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,291
Who was that? Harvey.

349
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,585
Doing a double shift, huh?
Sometimes.

350
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,086
Got nothing else to do.
I like the girls.

351
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:56,714
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar. Heh.

352
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:58,549
MM.

353
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,144
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

354
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:05,480
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

355
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:07,191
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

356
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,777
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

357
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,443
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

358
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:15,691
I'm doing my laundry.
No, I do the laundry.

359
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:19,445
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

360
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:21,321
I understand that. I'm in college now.

361
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:24,290
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

362
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,093
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

363
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,325
so no. That was a mistake.

364
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:31,539
Because I was washing
the American flag.

365
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:34,838
My... Can I please just...?
No one washes a flag.

366
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:36,125
I do, and I won't anymore.

367
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:38,337
This is my machine.
Fine. It's just underwear.

368
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:41,010
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

369
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:42,555
Back off, eat your breakfast.

370
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:47,436
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

371
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,022
I'll do it. No, forget it.

372
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:51,063
Give it to me.
I'll do it some other time.

373
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:53,727
Hey. Excuse me.

374
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:55,028
Jerk.

375
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,148
Not gonna make it.

376
00:27:01,193 --> 00:27:03,820
Logjam. Come on, come on,
come on.

377
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:06,952
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

378
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:13,080
Oscorp Industries

379
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,756
is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

380
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:22,338
By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers,

381
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:26,092
we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy

382
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:28,810
to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs

383
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,352
and eventually the world
for generations to come.

384
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:34,602
Dillon. You're late.
Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

385
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:36,693
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible

386
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,482
for the entire city's
energy supply?

387
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,698
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid

388
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,067
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,

389
00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:45,820
and those power grids
were designed by me.

390
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
You designed them?

391
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:49,623
Sure you did.

392
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:51,371
And I'm Spider-Man.

393
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,662
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

394
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:58,039
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

395
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:00,258
Now, get to work.

396
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,715
What floor, please?

397
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,265
Seventy-four. Thank you.

398
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:07,798
Oh, hold that!

399
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,265
Can you hold that, please?
I got it.

400
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:12,478
Thank you,
you're a real gentleman.

401
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,519
Most people would have
just let those close.

402
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:16,392
Most people
don't notice other people.

403
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,019
What floor, please?
Um, ahem... Sixty-three...

404
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:20,862
I got it. I got it. What is it?

405
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:22,151
Uh, sixty-three.

406
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:24,281
Sixty-three, please.

407
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:25,570
- Thank you.
- In a hurry.

408
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:28,035
Thank you very much.

409
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:34,077
Um... I'm Max. Max Dillon.

410
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,667
I'm Gwen.

411
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,708
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

412
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:40,164
Is it your birthday?

413
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:45,381
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They... Friends
of mine made this flyer up.

414
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,470
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club.

415
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,180
A lot of celebrities. Wow.

416
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:52,471
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

417
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:55,892
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

418
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:58,031
- That's exciting.
- ... dressed as Spider-Man

419
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:59,354
hanging out near the blaze.

420
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,023
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

421
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,489
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

422
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,575
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved

423
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:10,818
me.

424
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:12,702
He said he needed me.

425
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,957
That must be a good feeling.

426
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,496
Sixty-third floor.

427
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:20,994
Oh. It was nice
to meet you, Max.

428
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,708
Wait. She remembered my name.

429
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:44,401
Welcome home.

430
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,826
It's dark in there.

431
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,157
Your eyes will adjust.

432
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:03,327
It's better this way.

433
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:33,693
Dad.

434
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,369
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

435
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,460
Looking at my son

436
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:48,792
and seeing a stranger.

437
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,713
You have such potential, Harry.

438
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:57,638
Such fierce intelligence,

439
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:59,722
and you're throwing it all away.

440
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:01,967
No, you threw me away.

441
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,390
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.

442
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:11,192
On my 16th birthday,

443
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:13,153
you sent me Scotch.

444
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:15,488
Or one of your assistants did.

445
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:18,570
I'm pretty sure
because the card read:

446
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:23,201
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

447
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,165
I don't expect forgiveness
from you

448
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,917
anymore.

449
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:31,755
I don't believe in miracles.

450
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:34,714
How could you
possibly understand

451
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:38,758
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed

452
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:40,755
for something greater?

453
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,429
And not just for me.

454
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:45,099
For you!

455
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:50,306
Has your hand
started to twitch yet?

456
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:55,853
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming,

457
00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:58,905
hiding under your skin,

458
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:02,238
waiting to show itself.

459
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:04,827
To show you

460
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,868
who you really are.

461
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:14,666
Retroviral hyperplasia.

462
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:18,962
I never told you...

463
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:22,220
that it's genetic.

464
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:25,885
Our disease,

465
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:29,219
the Osborn curse.

466
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,605
And it began at your age.

467
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:35,391
Let me see it.

468
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:39,480
Your hand. Give it to me.

469
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:50,957
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

470
00:32:51,574 --> 00:32:53,076
isn't merely money.

471
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:54,326
It's this.

472
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:58,500
The sum total of all my work.

473
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:02,718
Everything I did to stay alive.

474
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,423
Maybe you can succeed

475
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:07,672
where I failed.

476
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:35,871
Norman Osborn, the legendary founder and
CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died,

477
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,788
the Osborn estate has confirmed.

478
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:40,333
He is survived by his only son,
Harry Osborn

479
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:43,423
who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.

480
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:44,883
Harry.

481
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,344
Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing

482
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:50,971
and affected
the lives of millions.

483
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:55,676
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:

484
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:58,395
"We can do better.
And we should do better."

485
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:04,019
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."

486
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:06,770
But change isn't just a slogan.

487
00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:08,905
It begins with hard work.

488
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:12,572
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

489
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:16,326
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

490
00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:20,826
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

491
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:22,284
But not today.

492
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:24,871
Today is for mourning.

493
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:27,250
- Hello?
- Is this Gwen Stacy?

494
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,625
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

495
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:32,675
I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.

496
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:40,052
Whoa. Dillon. You stay here.
What?

497
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:43,023
There's a current flow problem in the lab.
Why don't you take a look?

498
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:45,905
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

499
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,445
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

500
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,063
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

501
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,860
Happy Birthday.

502
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,990
Bioelectrogenesis:

503
00:34:58,237 --> 00:35:02,036
The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off...

504
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:04,333
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

505
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:05,777
The genetically manipulated...

506
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,663
At least somebody's partying.

507
00:35:08,246 --> 00:35:10,500
All right. Just a little sick.

508
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:14,085
MM-hm. I got your medicine, though.

509
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:18,764
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

510
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:20,054
Designed the grid...

511
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,949
Warning: I should've stretched.

512
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:25,768
Malfunction in Sector 5A.
I know. Just a little indigestion.

513
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:28,516
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, huh, did you, Kari?

514
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:30,735
Think you can sing
"Happy Birthday" for me?

515
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:32,945
I'll just have to sing it
for myself.

516
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:34,438
- Gilbert?
- What?

517
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:38,193
It's Max. Can we shut down
power on Sector 32, please?

518
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:39,568
Forget it. I'm out the door.

519
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:41,619
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

520
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:43,206
Sorry, Max. Hello?

521
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:49,036
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

522
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,003
This is crazy.

00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:15,190
♪ To me ♪♪

529
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:19,068
Ah...

530
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,280
System restored.

531
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,766
Have a nice day.

532
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,733
Harry,

533
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,818
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny

534
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:59,233
in the wake of
Dr. Connors' recent, uh,

535
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:00,570
breach of trust.

536
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,157
You mean people are pissed off

537
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:05,322
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

538
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:08,822
Given that,

539
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:12,496
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed

540
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,994
to restore investor confidence.

541
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:18,840
Ah. That is the Osborn way.

542
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:22,677
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

543
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:26,427
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

544
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,804
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

545
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,802
Sure, sure. I get it.

546
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,309
Twenty-year-old kid.

547
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:36,231
Two hundred billion dollar company.

548
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:38,065
What was Dad thinking?

549
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:40,818
I mean, you're all lawyers,
right?

550
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:46,487
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

551
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,862
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

552
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,329
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

553
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,869
Harry... it's Mr. Osborn.

554
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:58,250
We're not friends.

555
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:04,963
Hi.

556
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,724
You were his assistant, right?

557
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,184
MM-hm.

558
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:16,686
What's your name?

559
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:18,597
Felicia.

560
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:20,018
Felicia.

561
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:21,851
From now on,

562
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,900
everybody at this table
works for Felicia

563
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:29,695
because Felicia works for me.

564
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,032
Would anybody like to speak up?

565
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:38,659
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

566
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:43,295
Sir, there's a Peter
Parker here to see you.

567
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:54,722
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

568
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,976
Every single one.

569
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,027
Peter Parker.

570
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,396
It's like seeing a ghost.

571
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:12,900
Hey, Harry.

572
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:14,949
Random.

573
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:17,780
What, 10 years. It's eight.

574
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,373
But you're close.

575
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:22,706
What's up?

576
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:25,043
I saw the news, man.

577
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:28,503
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

578
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:32,753
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

579
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:35,505
I'm with some people.

580
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm in a...

581
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:42,052
I'm in a meeting.

582
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:43,894
I'm sorry,
I don't wanna intrude.

583
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:45,639
I know it's been a long time.

584
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:48,938
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

585
00:39:49,184 --> 00:39:51,777
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

586
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:55,115
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

587
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:56,943
Thank you.

588
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,034
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

589
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,742
It's good to see you.

590
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:07,536
I'm sorry about your dad.

591
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:12,666
You got your braces off.

592
00:40:16,753 --> 00:40:20,007
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

593
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:24,931
There he is.

594
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,809
There he is. Ha-ha-ha.

595
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:29,932
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

596
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:34,905
Um... You know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer

597
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,943
but I work the comb, okay?
Ha-ha-ha.

598
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,195
So at least
I'm not completely helpless.

599
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:43,445
You're stupid.

600
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:52,329
After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.

601
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:53,699
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

602
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,628
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

603
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:57,000
I saw you.

604
00:40:57,918 --> 00:40:59,170
What do you mean, you saw me?

605
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,579
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

606
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:03,548
You know what I'm talking about?

607
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,472
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.

608
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:08,469
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

609
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,016
I know.

610
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:15,693
What? You got a lady?

611
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:19,322
Uh...

612
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:22,032
That's a question.

613
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,576
That's a question.

614
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,070
Unh. Whoa, buddy.

615
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,664
No, I don't.

616
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:30,829
Yeah.

617
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,293
I don't know. It's, uh...

618
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,673
I don't know. It's complicated.

619
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,757
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

620
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,721
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?

621
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,090
Her name's Gwen.

622
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,012
Gwen Stacy.

623
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,516
Gwen Stacy. She works for you.

624
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:54,231
Really? She works for me?

625
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:57,771
She does work-study at Oscorp.
Is she a model employee?

626
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:01,983
You know, when my father
sent me away

627
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,108
I tried to forget
everything about this place.

628
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:09,530
I guess that kind of
included you.

629
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:15,159
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.

630
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,454
We both got dumped.

631
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,460
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

632
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,219
My dad left a briefcase.

633
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:33,222
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.

634
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,811
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

635
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,806
How's that working out for you?

636
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,849
Perfectly.

637
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:48,233
Dude. Nice arm.

638
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,119
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

639
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,565
You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.

640
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,079
Yeah, right.

641
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,835
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

642
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,170
Giant lizards

643
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,668
and spider guys.

644
00:43:05,873 --> 00:43:08,592
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

645
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:12,135
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

646
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,469
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

647
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,813
I'm so impressed.

648
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,148
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

649
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:23,016
For what?

650
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,985
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

651
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,606
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

652
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:33,947
Who was he?

653
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,947
Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.

654
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,952
No associates or friends
to speak of.

655
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,541
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

656
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:44,911
The guy was

657
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:46,876
invisible.

658
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:51,715
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

659
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:53,963
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.

660
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:57,384
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,

661
00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:58,849
our stock will crater.

662
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:02,938
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

663
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:07,567
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

664
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:15,791
Hey.

665
00:45:42,692 --> 00:45:44,693
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

666
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:59,960
Hey. Hi.

667
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:03,050
Hi.

668
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:05,588
You look amazing.

669
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:11,266
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of...

670
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:13,981
No. I don't... I... Spontaneous...

671
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,349
is all right. You know.

672
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,068
Well, I just figured it was time.

673
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:21,400
You know?

674
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,570
Time that we try to be friends.

675
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:26,235
Yeah.

676
00:46:28,027 --> 00:46:30,326
Friends, yeah. That's...

677
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:32,449
great.

678
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,952
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

679
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:37,375
I was just saying that
to someone. I hate complicated.

680
00:46:37,788 --> 00:46:39,210
Keep it simple.

681
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:43,172
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

682
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:44,670
Well, I mean...

683
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:51,806
Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

684
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,974
Some ground rules?
Yeah, some ground rules.

685
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:55,938
Heh, heh. Heh. Like that.

686
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,396
Like what?

687
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:00,902
That laugh. That laugh. What?

688
00:47:01,143 --> 00:47:02,690
That's off the table.

689
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:04,735
My laugh is off the table?
Off the table.

690
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:07,028
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

691
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:11,367
That's still adorable.

692
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,114
That was not adorable.
It's adorable.

693
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,581
No, it's not adorable.

694
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:18,498
Okay. I have a ground rule. Um...
Oh, good.

695
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,289
What is it? Uh...

696
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,880
Don't tell me that I look amazing

697
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:27,172
with your big brown Doe eyes.
Okay?

698
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,222
I'm really serious
about that one.

699
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:33,425
What? Oh. no.

700
00:47:33,675 --> 00:47:35,516
I just figured out
the next ground rule.

701
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:36,885
What?

702
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:38,637
No more of this.

703
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:40,889
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

704
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:42,686
This?
Don't think I haven't... Hey.

705
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:45,652
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

706
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,318
This is killing me.

707
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:50,067
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

708
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:51,568
Come on. Heh.

709
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:55,574
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

710
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:35,655
Um, yeah. So I did that.

711
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:40,782
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

712
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:43,704
Yeah. No, I know.
Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

713
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:46,329
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

714
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:50,798
How do you know that?

715
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:55,675
Hm?
How do you know I love it there?

716
00:48:56,547 --> 00:48:57,639
Because, um...

717
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,512
Because you told me.

718
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:06,813
It just opened last month.

719
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:12,396
Have you been following me?

720
00:49:17,983 --> 00:49:19,235
I knew it.

721
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,112
How often?

722
00:49:24,824 --> 00:49:26,201
Just once a day.

723
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:27,793
Sometimes.

724
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,876
Sometimes more.

725
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:38,003
Oh, boy.

726
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:39,503
Why?

727
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,597
Make sure I'm safe?

728
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:48,313
And... And what?

729
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:51,980
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

730
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:06,327
I'm moving to England.

731
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:15,956
What?

732
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:17,916
Yeah. Um...

733
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,965
I have a...
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

734
00:50:23,172 --> 00:50:26,221
In molecular medicine. And it's
between me and this other kid.

735
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:28,344
There's this oral exam
that we have to do

736
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:31,347
and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

737
00:50:31,597 --> 00:50:33,474
And... And it's... It could be him.

738
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:35,521
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

739
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:39,068
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

740
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:42,280
Wow. Yeah.

741
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,282
And I'm really excited.

742
00:50:45,735 --> 00:50:47,032
That's, uh...

743
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:51,619
England.

744
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:55,786
What?

745
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,226
Station, I need a 10-85.

746
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:57,516
Send out additional units to
the South-end corner of Duffy Square.

747
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:59,606
Folks, could you step to the side?

748
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:01,976
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

749
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:05,853
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

750
00:52:06,396 --> 00:52:09,023
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

751
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:11,242
Let me see your hands, please!

752
00:52:13,068 --> 00:52:14,286
You stay right where you are!

753
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:15,746
Do not move!

754
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:18,117
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

755
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:37,635
Get down on the ground, now!

756
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:38,885
Stop!

757
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:40,615
Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

758
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:42,476
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

759
00:52:42,722 --> 00:52:44,282
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you.

760
00:52:44,307 --> 00:52:46,025
Please,
to get down on the ground, now!

761
00:52:46,268 --> 00:52:49,442
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

762
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,362
Oh, my gosh.

763
00:52:54,818 --> 00:52:57,411
They see me. You see me.

764
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:00,916
You see me.

765
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:03,001
They see me.

766
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,047
No! No! Stop! On the ground now!

767
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,925
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

768
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:22,474
Wait! It's not my fault.

769
00:53:22,762 --> 00:53:23,762
It's not my fault!

770
00:53:27,057 --> 00:53:28,105
I said stop!

771
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,222
I'm glad you're not one of
those cops that rides a horse.

772
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:46,458
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

773
00:53:49,913 --> 00:53:53,416
All units, hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire! Stand down!

774
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:57,463
Stop. Stop it.

775
00:53:57,711 --> 00:53:58,838
Yo, Sparkles!

776
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,762
Hey, how you doing?

777
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:05,264
It's you? Yeah, I know it's me.

778
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,510
Who are you?

779
00:54:08,304 --> 00:54:09,431
You don't remember me?

780
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:11,813
No. Should I?

781
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,860
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

782
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:17,527
You saved me.

783
00:54:17,773 --> 00:54:19,447
You said you needed me.

784
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:22,365
You're the guy with the blueprints.
Yes.

785
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,820
Blueprints.

786
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:28,960
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

787
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:32,000
Uh, what's your name again?
How could you forget me?

788
00:54:32,246 --> 00:54:34,668
I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
It's Max.

789
00:54:34,914 --> 00:54:36,713
Is it "Max"? Yes.

790
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,880
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
with the...

791
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,802
You look different.

792
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,512
How are you?

793
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,599
I don't know what's going on
with me.

794
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:46,891
I can see that. I can...
I believe you.

795
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:52,432
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much...

796
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:54,601
I got so much anger.

797
00:54:54,851 --> 00:54:57,603
I can see that. I can see you
don't wanna be here and you're scared.

798
00:54:57,853 --> 00:54:59,614
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

799
00:54:59,856 --> 00:55:01,608
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

800
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:04,552
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

801
00:55:04,693 --> 00:55:06,653
I don't want them shooting me anymore.
They won't.

802
00:55:06,862 --> 00:55:09,365
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

803
00:55:09,615 --> 00:55:12,960
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

804
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:15,521
You and me, okay? It's just you
and me talking. Whoa, whoa.

805
00:55:15,704 --> 00:55:19,083
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

806
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,333
I just...

807
00:55:22,043 --> 00:55:23,967
I just wanted everyone to see me.

808
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:26,135
He makes a move, take that shot.

809
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,302
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

810
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:30,347
Away from all these
people, okay?

811
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:31,592
Yeah, yes.

812
00:55:33,472 --> 00:55:34,472
No! No! Stop!

813
00:55:38,143 --> 00:55:39,235
Max!

814
00:55:57,827 --> 00:56:00,456
Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!

815
00:56:02,331 --> 00:56:04,130
You stupid freak!

816
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:12,050
Electro dummy!

817
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:21,268
Get out of here, you freak!

818
00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:22,518
Shut up!

819
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:26,815
You're so selfish.

820
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:29,199
Stay with me, Max.

821
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:30,739
You set me up.

822
00:56:30,985 --> 00:56:32,202
No, I didn't set you up.

823
00:56:32,445 --> 00:56:33,947
You lied to me!

824
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:35,947
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

825
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:25,045
Are you all right?

826
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:32,503
It's my birthday.

827
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:34,722
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

828
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:54,836
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

829
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,385
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

830
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:12,016
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

831
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:13,643
Mike. Yeah.

832
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:15,143
Big John. Nice job.

833
00:59:15,476 --> 00:59:16,820
Nice work, fellas.

834
00:59:17,061 --> 00:59:19,860
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

835
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,373
Spider-Man.

836
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:37,041
England?

837
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:39,793
Really?

838
00:59:49,844 --> 00:59:51,061
Good talk.

839
01:00:09,362 --> 01:00:10,659
Our coverage

840
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,534
of this breaking story begins with New
York 1's Jessica Abo at the scene.

841
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,960
That's right. We're standing
here with two eyewitnesses

842
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:18,163
who are going to tell
us what they just saw.

843
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,380
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

844
01:00:20,623 --> 01:00:22,184
How do you think
he beat this creature?

845
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,994
Yeah, it's gotta be
rubberized, Spidey's

846
01:00:24,007 --> 01:00:25,804
suit. That's why he
didn't get electrocuted.

847
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:28,344
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.

848
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,092
Thank you very
much to the two of you.

849
01:00:30,342 --> 01:00:32,809
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.

850
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:35,612
We will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.

851
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:38,123
For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.

852
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:28,797
Online polls show a sudden uptick

853
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,416
in public sentiment
in favor of the web-crawler.

854
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:35,465
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

855
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,123
Next-generation military body armor.

856
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:13,375
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair,

857
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,922
direct nervous system interface.

858
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:27,141
So the common household spider,

859
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:28,731
um, unlike human cells,

860
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,565
theirs contain the power
to self-heal

861
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:35,358
from severe infection,
tissue damage, etcetera.

862
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:40,199
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

863
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:45,322
Welcome to Dr.
Jallings, Science Investigator.

864
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,414
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

865
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:51,706
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

866
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:54,456
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

867
01:03:54,704 --> 01:03:57,878
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

868
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,880
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge

869
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,804
the battery might explode! Ouch!

870
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:06,300
Explode!

871
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,050
Boom!

872
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:11,972
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

873
01:04:12,222 --> 01:04:13,347
You're not invincible.

874
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:15,474
We're gonna need
a bigger battery.

875
01:04:56,931 --> 01:04:58,400
- Hello.
- Pete.

876
01:04:58,976 --> 01:05:00,273
It's me.

877
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:02,235
Hey, Harry. What...?

878
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,027
What time is it?

879
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,070
Uh, late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

880
01:05:09,568 --> 01:05:10,786
I need to see you.

881
01:05:11,028 --> 01:05:12,246
You all right?

882
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:13,865
Not really, Pete.

883
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:15,576
I'm dying.

884
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:18,577
But I think you can help
save my life.

885
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,175
You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.

886
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:27,295
The hope is to extract
the venom from their glands

887
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:29,967
and turn that into a cure.

888
01:05:30,215 --> 01:05:32,809
An agent that heals diseased cells.

889
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:38,181
And if I can be cured, imagine
what this could do for other diseases

890
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:40,523
like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

891
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:47,110
They never made it to human trials.

892
01:05:47,438 --> 01:05:51,068
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

893
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,536
Except maybe this.

894
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:05,166
Spider-Man.

895
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,418
What about him?

896
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:11,088
He was bitten by one of
those things, and it worked.

897
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:15,342
I don't know how
and I don't know why,

898
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:19,224
but he can do everything else
a spider can,

899
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:21,597
including self-heal.

900
01:06:21,972 --> 01:06:23,565
I need to find him.

901
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:25,943
I need his blood.

902
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:42,827
You need...

903
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:46,086
Spider-Man's blood?

904
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:51,713
It'll save my life.

905
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:54,054
It may not, Har.

906
01:06:54,588 --> 01:06:56,635
It may not be that simple.

907
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,641
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

908
01:06:58,882 --> 01:06:59,884
Connors was weak.

909
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,393
This is me, Peter.

910
01:07:02,635 --> 01:07:04,730
I don't think you can just
set up a van

911
01:07:05,764 --> 01:07:06,889
and have him donate.

912
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:12,362
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

913
01:07:12,605 --> 01:07:13,731
Ah, he's sensitive, okay.

914
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:18,987
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,

915
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,534
and I will go ask him myself.

916
01:07:22,155 --> 01:07:23,155
What?

917
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:28,043
You took his picture. So?

918
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:30,289
You know him. Harry.

919
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:33,838
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

920
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,300
I don't know him.

921
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:40,097
I put together what you said
at the river.

922
01:07:41,382 --> 01:07:44,385
What I...
About how he gives people hope.

923
01:07:46,512 --> 01:07:47,809
Come on.

924
01:08:01,568 --> 01:08:02,615
What in the...?

925
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:09,121
Just say yes.

926
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:17,960
Don't turn your back on me!

927
01:08:18,835 --> 01:08:21,759
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

928
01:08:23,465 --> 01:08:24,886
Please.

929
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:28,101
Peter, please.

930
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:29,720
I can't.

931
01:08:33,724 --> 01:08:34,770
Please.

932
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:41,279
I'm gonna try

933
01:08:41,815 --> 01:08:43,783
and find Spider-Man.

934
01:08:54,078 --> 01:08:55,805
Hey, what's security doing over here?

935
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:56,831
That's so weird.

936
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,081
She's right over there.

937
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,847
Hey! Miss Stacy!

938
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:24,106
Hi.

939
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:25,609
Hi.

940
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,238
What are you doing here?

941
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,404
What are you doing here? Oh...

942
01:09:31,197 --> 01:09:32,368
Come here.

943
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:41,006
She's not here. Check another floor.

944
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,795
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

945
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,087
You're in trouble.

946
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:45,506
Yeah. Who's that guy?

947
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:48,514
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

948
01:09:48,756 --> 01:09:52,009
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

949
01:09:52,257 --> 01:09:55,432
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

950
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,649
And he loved Spider-Man,
by the way. He was, like, a fanatic.

951
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,694
I didn't get love vibes.
I got more of a

952
01:10:00,706 --> 01:10:02,520
"want to kill me with
his electricity" vibe.

953
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,818
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

954
01:10:06,023 --> 01:10:09,117
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

955
01:10:09,358 --> 01:10:10,609
My God. He's completely erased.

956
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:12,032
That's Oscorp.

957
01:10:13,069 --> 01:10:14,242
And what about you?
Why are you here?

958
01:10:14,488 --> 01:10:15,489
Harry.

959
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:17,207
Osborn? He's dying.

960
01:10:17,783 --> 01:10:19,001
What do you mean? He's dying.

961
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:21,666
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life

962
01:10:22,037 --> 01:10:24,586
is my blood,
is Spider-Man's blood.

963
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:27,300
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

964
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:29,340
Or something worse.

965
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:31,128
I know.

966
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:33,849
This is the maintenance closet,
Gwen.

967
01:10:34,382 --> 01:10:37,261
This is the most clichéd
hiding place you could've chosen.

968
01:10:37,511 --> 01:10:39,479
This is the stupidest hiding place.
I'm sorry,

969
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:43,692
I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

970
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:47,689
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

971
01:10:57,404 --> 01:11:00,498
You just kissed me.
I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

972
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:02,542
How'd you like it?

973
01:11:03,034 --> 01:11:04,377
It felt a little bit rushed.

974
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:06,747
I know. I know, I know.

975
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:10,756
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

976
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,002
Okay.

977
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:28,564
Ooh! God! Damn it! I'm so...

978
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:32,029
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

979
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:34,114
And you too? I'm sorry.

980
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,859
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

981
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:38,362
Just stay right...
Wait, wait, wait.

982
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:39,612
Hey! Stop!

983
01:11:42,073 --> 01:11:43,194
All right. On your way. Aah.

984
01:11:43,323 --> 01:11:45,577
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

985
01:11:50,413 --> 01:11:52,542
Gwen Stacy. Ha, ha. Oh, my God.

986
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:54,797
Sorry. Sorry.

987
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,386
No, it's okay.

988
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:59,556
Uh, I'm... I'm Harry.

989
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:01,259
Yeah.

990
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:05,641
I'm an old friend of Peter's.
Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

991
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,515
I was kind of rushing.

992
01:12:07,764 --> 01:12:10,186
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

993
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:12,528
I thought you two had broken up.

994
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,395
Oh.

995
01:12:15,314 --> 01:12:17,737
Yeah. Yes, we had.

996
01:12:17,983 --> 01:12:19,529
And it's...

997
01:12:19,775 --> 01:12:21,652
It's complicated.
Complicated. Yeah.

998
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:25,122
I mean, it's Peter. Heh. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

999
01:12:25,363 --> 01:12:26,364
Yeah.

1000
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:28,159
Yeah.

1001
01:12:28,868 --> 01:12:30,337
Yeah, you're right.

1002
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:32,631
But that's why he needs you.

1003
01:12:34,332 --> 01:12:35,505
Right?

1004
01:12:37,668 --> 01:12:40,171
To help him make his choices clear.

1005
01:12:44,007 --> 01:12:45,009
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1006
01:12:45,259 --> 01:12:48,262
Yeah, it's such a pleasure,
Gwen.

1007
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:47,202
You've been in a terrible accident.

1008
01:13:48,487 --> 01:13:50,454
I'm Dr. Kafka.

1009
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:53,037
I'm here to help you.

1010
01:13:53,408 --> 01:13:55,002
Course you are, doc.

1011
01:13:56,036 --> 01:14:00,131
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

1012
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:02,710
High-intensity capacitors.

1013
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,170
The kind they make at Oscorp.

1014
01:14:05,752 --> 01:14:08,346
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

1015
01:14:08,588 --> 01:14:09,761
You are correct.

1016
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:12,100
I'm here to study you.

1017
01:14:12,342 --> 01:14:17,019
To understand what you are,
why you are.

1018
01:14:17,265 --> 01:14:19,141
Und I will get results.

1019
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:25,734
I always do.

1020
01:14:28,818 --> 01:14:30,536
You do realize

1021
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:32,952
you looked me in a prison

1022
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:34,786
that runs

1023
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:36,871
on electricity?

1024
01:14:39,202 --> 01:14:42,001
MM. I can feel it in the walls.

1025
01:14:42,288 --> 01:14:44,166
I can feel it in my veins.

1026
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:47,716
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

1027
01:14:49,212 --> 01:14:50,304
It's a force of nature.

1028
01:14:51,965 --> 01:14:52,966
Like me.

1029
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,932
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1030
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:04,435
Well, so do I.

1031
01:15:04,685 --> 01:15:05,731
Ooh!

1032
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:12,234
I'm dying to know,

1033
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:14,069
doc.

1034
01:15:14,904 --> 01:15:17,828
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

1035
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:19,576
Because if you don't,

1036
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:22,248
I'm gonna kill the light.

1037
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:26,966
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1038
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:29,676
A world without power.

1039
01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:32,296
A world without mercy.

1040
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:34,088
A world

1041
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:35,966
without Spider-Man.

1042
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:40,766
And everyone will be able to see me
for who I truly am.

1043
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:43,430
And who are you?

1044
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,439
Don't you know?

1045
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,318
I'm Electro.

1046
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:55,863
Warning: Electrical
restraint capacity reached.

1047
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,863
Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1048
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:00,740
Very impressive,

1049
01:16:01,448 --> 01:16:03,371
Electro.

1050
01:16:04,118 --> 01:16:05,994
Lockdown initiated.

1051
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:19,011
Aunt May?

1052
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:20,222
Aunt May?

1053
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,978
What are you doing?

1054
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:28,854
When did you do this?

1055
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:40,987
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1056
01:16:41,237 --> 01:16:44,240
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1057
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:47,789
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1058
01:16:48,034 --> 01:16:49,877
I don't lie.
I know you love me, but you do.

1059
01:16:50,121 --> 01:16:51,497
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1060
01:16:52,497 --> 01:16:54,295
You have to tell me, May.

1061
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:56,509
That's my father.

1062
01:16:56,751 --> 01:16:58,172
Yes, he was your father.

1063
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,047
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1064
01:17:01,756 --> 01:17:02,927
here.

1065
01:17:04,594 --> 01:17:06,061
I need the truth.

1066
01:17:08,514 --> 01:17:10,856
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1067
01:17:11,099 --> 01:17:12,850
You were this little boy
whose whole world

1068
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,819
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1069
01:17:16,061 --> 01:17:20,818
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1070
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,658
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1071
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:26,155
Your father?

1072
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:27,579
No.

1073
01:17:27,823 --> 01:17:31,953
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

1074
01:17:32,203 --> 01:17:34,877
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1075
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:39,844
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1076
01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:41,712
who has to take nursing classes

1077
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:44,841
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1078
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:47,184
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1079
01:17:47,426 --> 01:17:48,551
I don't know how. And...

1080
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:52,519
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

1081
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:55,439
who was never here. No.

1082
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:58,149
No, I won't tell you.

1083
01:17:58,436 --> 01:17:59,528
You're my boy.

1084
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:02,114
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1085
01:18:02,356 --> 01:18:03,448
And I won't hurt you.

1086
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:14,793
I'm your boy.

1087
01:18:15,244 --> 01:18:16,791
You're my everything.

1088
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:21,500
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1089
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,173
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1090
01:18:25,296 --> 01:18:28,048
I love you so much. I know.

1091
01:18:32,929 --> 01:18:34,270
It's okay.

1092
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:36,730
It's okay.

1093
01:18:39,685 --> 01:18:40,856
May.

1094
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:46,154
I need to know.

1095
01:18:50,778 --> 01:18:51,994
All right.

1096
01:18:55,615 --> 01:18:57,458
I'll tell you everything I know.

1097
01:19:00,453 --> 01:19:01,922
But it will hurt you.

1098
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,126
Okay.

1099
01:19:06,836 --> 01:19:09,259
A few days after the funeral,

1100
01:19:09,505 --> 01:19:13,260
two government men
came to see us.

1101
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:18,222
They said the genetics research

1102
01:19:18,471 --> 01:19:21,942
that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,

1103
01:19:22,184 --> 01:19:24,810
and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1104
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,063
And that's why he ran off with it.

1105
01:19:27,314 --> 01:19:29,032
They said he was a traitor.

1106
01:19:29,274 --> 01:19:31,025
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1107
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,203
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

1108
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:35,913
for the money.

1109
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:38,289
I don't...

1110
01:19:40,827 --> 01:19:43,146
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1111
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:47,001
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1112
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,502
It doesn't make any sense.

1113
01:19:48,752 --> 01:19:49,969
Peter, I don't know.

1114
01:19:50,377 --> 01:19:53,426
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1115
01:19:53,672 --> 01:19:55,926
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1116
01:19:56,176 --> 01:19:58,677
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1117
01:19:58,926 --> 01:20:02,021
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1118
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:04,938
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1119
01:20:05,184 --> 01:20:07,356
Came home at 6 every night.

1120
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,939
I don't know.

1121
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,734
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1122
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:17,279
Even from the people they love.

1123
01:20:23,577 --> 01:20:24,668
Peter.

1124
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,207
Peter.

1125
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:34,753
Mr. Osborn.

1126
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:40,934
Look up.

1127
01:20:42,136 --> 01:20:43,682
Think you're looking for me.

1128
01:20:46,431 --> 01:20:48,604
I cannot believe my eyes.

1129
01:20:50,351 --> 01:20:51,649
Spider-Man.

1130
01:20:58,944 --> 01:21:00,947
Just the man I wanted to see.

1131
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,082
You, um...

1132
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:07,997
talked to Peter?

1133
01:21:08,912 --> 01:21:09,958
Yeah.

1134
01:21:15,335 --> 01:21:19,260
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1135
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,969
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1136
01:21:24,217 --> 01:21:25,344
Excuse me?

1137
01:21:26,302 --> 01:21:28,055
It's too dangerous.

1138
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:31,309
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1139
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:34,565
I'm already dying.

1140
01:21:35,895 --> 01:21:38,319
Your blood can't make me die more.

1141
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:40,318
But it could do something worse.

1142
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:44,242
Okay.

1143
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:47,621
All right, how much?

1144
01:21:47,867 --> 01:21:50,164
How much what?
How much do you want? Name it.

1145
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:54,381
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1146
01:21:54,622 --> 01:21:57,876
I don't want your money.
Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1147
01:21:58,710 --> 01:21:59,711
I don't.

1148
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:03,426
I thought you...

1149
01:22:04,256 --> 01:22:06,600
I thought you were
supposed to save people.

1150
01:22:07,635 --> 01:22:11,310
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1151
01:22:11,555 --> 01:22:13,853
You're... You're just gonna
let me die.

1152
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:17,319
I'm trying to protect you right now.
No. No, you are not.

1153
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:19,984
You're trying to protect yourself.

1154
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:24,778
Look, we just need
a bit more time

1155
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:26,948
to figure out something else.
I do not have time!

1156
01:22:34,536 --> 01:22:35,627
I'm sorry.

1157
01:22:44,755 --> 01:22:48,132
You're a fraud, Spider-Man! Unh!

1158
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:03,480
Unh! Hey! Hi. Hi.

1159
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,654
Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
I'm running late right now.

1160
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,494
It's just gonna take a second.
I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1161
01:23:09,737 --> 01:23:13,037
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1162
01:23:13,282 --> 01:23:15,282
Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.
Shh. Shh.

1163
01:23:15,493 --> 01:23:17,712
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1164
01:23:17,953 --> 01:23:20,877
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1165
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:23,002
I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do with Harry.

1166
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,676
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1167
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,557
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1168
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:29,639
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1169
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:31,349
I don't know. I got no idea.

1170
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:35,889
Oh, God.
I got nothing. I got nothing.

1171
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:38,855
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1172
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:41,689
Ms. Stacy?

1173
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,481
Shall I take you upstairs?

1174
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:46,105
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1175
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:50,532
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1176
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:52,574
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1177
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,997
I'm... Ahem. Okay. I have to be...
Where are we?

1178
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,617
I'm at my...

1179
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:01,041
last interview for Oxford
right now.

1180
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:04,372
Oxford. I didn't know. Yeah.

1181
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:06,841
Oh. Okay, well...

1182
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,587
I'm sorry to bother you, uh,

1183
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:11,429
my fair lady... Madam.

1184
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,422
But who am I?

1185
01:24:13,672 --> 01:24:15,220
I mean, who am I?
I'm John Hopkins.

1186
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:17,515
I'm one of the young
professors at Harvard,

1187
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,730
and I've been trying to
get her to be in my...

1188
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,688
Be a part of my team
for a while now.

1189
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,858
And she's just the best person
I know and a scientific genius.

1190
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,104
And...

1191
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:29,775
Anyway, God save the queen.

1192
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,820
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1193
01:24:32,065 --> 01:24:33,568
Peter. Peter.

1194
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,411
What do you want to say to me?

1195
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,704
What's the "one thing"?

1196
01:24:41,783 --> 01:24:43,627
I have to go to England, Peter.

1197
01:24:45,621 --> 01:24:46,997
It's important to me.

1198
01:24:51,376 --> 01:24:55,006
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1199
01:24:55,672 --> 01:24:57,766
You know? I don't know.

1200
01:24:58,009 --> 01:24:59,351
Maybe we're just

1201
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,387
going different ways. I don't...

1202
01:25:01,636 --> 01:25:03,730
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1203
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:08,141
Gwen.

1204
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:12,150
Good luck.

1205
01:25:15,692 --> 01:25:17,944
Hi. Sorry.

1206
01:26:18,168 --> 01:26:21,514
He took the D train
every morning at 7 to work.

1207
01:26:22,006 --> 01:26:24,555
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1208
01:26:32,181 --> 01:26:34,059
"Roosevelt's secret station."

1209
01:26:34,309 --> 01:26:36,686
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension

1210
01:26:36,936 --> 01:26:39,655
of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square

1211
01:26:39,898 --> 01:26:43,527
built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye,

1212
01:26:43,775 --> 01:26:47,201
"to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1213
01:26:57,373 --> 01:26:58,671
Mr. Osborn?

1214
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:01,547
You all right?

1215
01:27:01,793 --> 01:27:04,296
Is there anything I can get you?

1216
01:27:04,546 --> 01:27:07,551
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1217
01:27:08,216 --> 01:27:09,264
Spiders?

1218
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:11,478
The ones that they destroyed...

1219
01:27:12,637 --> 01:27:15,811
"to restore
investor confidence."

1220
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:19,023
Go home, Felicia.

1221
01:27:19,269 --> 01:27:20,565
Take the day off.

1222
01:27:22,855 --> 01:27:23,948
Harry.

1223
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:29,868
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1224
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:36,502
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1225
01:27:37,578 --> 01:27:39,377
Before they destroyed
the spiders,

1226
01:27:40,332 --> 01:27:41,958
they had the venom extracted.

1227
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,757
Uh, what?

1228
01:27:48,047 --> 01:27:49,470
What are you saying?

1229
01:27:49,716 --> 01:27:51,557
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits,

1230
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:54,645
but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1231
01:27:56,012 --> 01:27:57,014
Where is it?

1232
01:27:57,389 --> 01:27:59,186
It's somewhere in the building.

1233
01:28:00,684 --> 01:28:04,234
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1234
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,069
Special Projects.

1235
01:28:08,315 --> 01:28:09,738
Most recent entry:

1236
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,282
One hour ago.

1237
01:28:11,945 --> 01:28:14,198
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1238
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:19,377
Accessing Ravencroft Archive.

1239
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:26,292
File 713.

1240
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,171
What the hell?

1241
01:28:31,547 --> 01:28:33,175
File 71.

1242
01:28:33,423 --> 01:28:35,643
Subject: Dillon, Max.

1243
01:28:35,885 --> 01:28:37,386
And then I'm gonna
kill the light

1244
01:28:37,636 --> 01:28:41,731
so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.

1245
01:28:41,974 --> 01:28:43,942
A world without power.

1246
01:28:44,184 --> 01:28:45,400
A world

1247
01:28:45,644 --> 01:28:47,317
without Spider-Man.

1248
01:28:47,563 --> 01:28:48,985
Warning:

01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:54,324
He's busy. You can't
go in there. He's busy.

1251
01:28:55,488 --> 01:28:56,579
What did you do?

1252
01:28:56,823 --> 01:28:59,244
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1253
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:03,541
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1254
01:29:03,787 --> 01:29:08,167
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1255
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:12,216
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1256
01:29:12,462 --> 01:29:14,385
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1257
01:29:14,631 --> 01:29:16,802
Progress has its
stepping stones.

1258
01:29:17,048 --> 01:29:19,847
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1259
01:29:20,094 --> 01:29:21,686
How do I put this gently?

1260
01:29:21,929 --> 01:29:22,930
...fired.

1261
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:26,313
You are not going to bury me too.

1262
01:29:26,559 --> 01:29:29,234
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1263
01:29:30,021 --> 01:29:31,649
It's only a matter of time.

1264
01:29:32,314 --> 01:29:34,568
You're going to die
a horrible death.

1265
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,573
Like your father.

1266
01:29:37,235 --> 01:29:38,783
The difference is,

1267
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:41,114
no one is going to miss you.

1268
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:45,161
Get him out.

1269
01:29:45,411 --> 01:29:46,412
Wait. Wait.

1270
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:55,425
I know my way out.

1271
01:30:06,139 --> 01:30:07,699
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1272
01:30:07,932 --> 01:30:10,105
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1273
01:30:10,351 --> 01:30:11,694
I tried. Good luck.

1274
01:30:11,936 --> 01:30:15,016
You should tell her to come down
here and find one of those alligators.

1275
01:32:38,952 --> 01:32:40,168
Test.

1276
01:32:40,787 --> 01:32:42,506
My name is Richard Parker.

1277
01:32:43,332 --> 01:32:44,835
Whatever lies will be told about me,

1278
01:32:45,085 --> 01:32:46,962
I would like the world
to know the truth.

1279
01:32:47,921 --> 01:32:51,175
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research

1280
01:32:51,423 --> 01:32:56,270
when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization

1281
01:32:56,511 --> 01:32:59,015
to continue funding my research.

1282
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,641
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1283
01:33:01,975 --> 01:33:04,444
Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.

1284
01:33:04,685 --> 01:33:06,029
So I refused.

1285
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,399
And now, to eliminate me
from the picture,

1286
01:33:09,649 --> 01:33:13,529
Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me

1287
01:33:13,778 --> 01:33:17,282
in order to take control
of my work.

1288
01:33:20,784 --> 01:33:22,037
Can I help you?

1289
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:24,585
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.

1290
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,128
I'm Harry Osborn.

1291
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:30,378
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1292
01:33:30,627 --> 01:33:33,506
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1293
01:33:33,756 --> 01:33:36,775
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1294
01:33:40,054 --> 01:33:42,476
But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...

1295
01:33:43,515 --> 01:33:45,313
that Norman doesn't know.

1296
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,528
The human DNA

1297
01:33:49,104 --> 01:33:51,653
that I implanted in the spiders...

1298
01:33:53,524 --> 01:33:54,650
was my own.

1299
01:33:57,154 --> 01:33:59,452
Which means that without me,

1300
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:01,372
without my bloodline,

1301
01:34:02,033 --> 01:34:06,253
Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1302
01:34:06,662 --> 01:34:09,041
Keep Electro incubated

1303
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:13,466
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1304
01:34:14,421 --> 01:34:18,095
I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.

1305
01:34:19,675 --> 01:34:21,643
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1306
01:34:21,886 --> 01:34:25,105
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1307
01:34:25,346 --> 01:34:29,146
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.

1308
01:34:29,393 --> 01:34:31,190
But as a father,

1309
01:34:31,561 --> 01:34:34,690
it means I may not
see my boy again.

1310
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:39,034
And nothing is as important to me

1311
01:34:39,777 --> 01:34:41,779
as my son, Peter.

1312
01:34:42,155 --> 01:34:43,908
Nothing in this world.

1313
01:34:44,533 --> 01:34:46,501
But I have a responsibility

1314
01:34:46,743 --> 01:34:48,792
to protect the world
from what I've created,

1315
01:34:49,037 --> 01:34:52,007
and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.

1316
01:34:52,873 --> 01:34:55,252
People will say I am a monster

1317
01:34:56,252 --> 01:34:57,845
for what I've done.

1318
01:34:59,546 --> 01:35:01,048
And maybe they're right.

1319
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:05,929
I always thought that I'd have more

1320
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:07,270
time.

1321
01:35:07,512 --> 01:35:09,390
Dad? Dad!

1322
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,936
I'm sorry.

1323
01:35:29,868 --> 01:35:31,461
Sedation off.

1324
01:35:32,996 --> 01:35:34,042
Psst.

1325
01:35:38,377 --> 01:35:40,378
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1326
01:35:40,796 --> 01:35:42,797
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1327
01:35:43,713 --> 01:35:44,715
Who are you?

1328
01:35:44,966 --> 01:35:48,095
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1329
01:35:49,886 --> 01:35:51,139
I should kill you.

1330
01:35:51,389 --> 01:35:53,106
Oh, come on.

1331
01:35:53,599 --> 01:35:55,521
Think bigger, Max.

1332
01:35:55,768 --> 01:35:57,770
I'm not the one you want.

1333
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,318
You want Spider-Man.

1334
01:36:00,814 --> 01:36:02,658
And I can give him to you.

1335
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:07,576
But I need something first.

1336
01:36:08,948 --> 01:36:11,167
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1337
01:36:11,617 --> 01:36:13,038
Get you in?

1338
01:36:13,493 --> 01:36:14,586
You own it.

1339
01:36:14,828 --> 01:36:17,207
Heh. Uh, not anymore.

1340
01:36:17,454 --> 01:36:18,707
Oscorp betrayed us both,

1341
01:36:18,957 --> 01:36:22,802
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

1342
01:36:23,646 --> 01:36:24,646
What's happening?

1343
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:26,430
Someone pulled an
alarm in the Iso Unit.

1344
01:36:26,588 --> 01:36:29,137
Get a containment team
up there now.

1345
01:36:29,801 --> 01:36:31,519
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1346
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:33,479
You submitted
the design for the grid,

1347
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:35,597
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1348
01:36:35,847 --> 01:36:37,646
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1349
01:36:37,891 --> 01:36:40,610
How?
It is all the power in the city, Max,

1350
01:36:40,854 --> 01:36:42,777
and it's right at your fingertips.

1351
01:36:43,023 --> 01:36:44,820
And then once you
shut down the grid,

1352
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:48,990
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1353
01:36:50,947 --> 01:36:51,993
Break it! Break it!

1354
01:36:55,074 --> 01:36:56,667
Max, we don't have much time!

1355
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:59,253
Go! Go. Go! Go!

1356
01:36:59,496 --> 01:37:01,543
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1357
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:02,837
Because I need you!

1358
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:05,752
You need me?

1359
01:37:06,002 --> 01:37:08,926
Yes. I need you.

1360
01:37:09,255 --> 01:37:13,305
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1361
01:37:13,551 --> 01:37:14,551
You need me?

1362
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,643
Yes. I need you.

1363
01:37:17,722 --> 01:37:18,895
I need you. Please! Please!

1364
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:21,814
Please!

1365
01:37:22,144 --> 01:37:24,020
I know what it's like
to be thrown away!

1366
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:25,270
Please, Max!

1367
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,444
I need you! I need you!

1368
01:38:17,863 --> 01:38:18,863
No!

1369
01:38:22,909 --> 01:38:24,537
You wanna be my friend?

1370
01:38:25,203 --> 01:38:27,377
I thought we were already friends.

1371
01:38:28,998 --> 01:38:30,421
I had a friend once.

1372
01:38:31,502 --> 01:38:33,252
It didn't work out.

1373
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:35,467
Yeah. Me too.

1374
01:38:36,966 --> 01:38:39,060
Then let's go catch a spider.

1375
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:44,974
You have one new voice message.

1376
01:38:47,268 --> 01:38:49,065
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1377
01:38:49,978 --> 01:38:53,608
Uh, I got in to Oxford.

1378
01:38:53,856 --> 01:38:58,078
Woo-hoo. It's very exciting.

1379
01:38:58,569 --> 01:39:01,914
I came by your house
a little bit ago and I, um...

1380
01:39:02,532 --> 01:39:03,578
You weren't there,

1381
01:39:03,824 --> 01:39:07,203
and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now,

1382
01:39:07,453 --> 01:39:10,127
because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,

1383
01:39:10,372 --> 01:39:13,466
and I thought that
it would somehow

1384
01:39:13,835 --> 01:39:17,840
be easier, I guess, this way.

1385
01:39:18,422 --> 01:39:21,847
I think that maybe it's time

1386
01:39:22,092 --> 01:39:24,265
to let this go.

1387
01:39:24,927 --> 01:39:27,225
And that's not because
I don't love you.

1388
01:39:27,472 --> 01:39:30,773
It's actually because I do, so, um...

1389
01:39:31,393 --> 01:39:32,770
Okay, bye.

1390
01:39:47,283 --> 01:39:49,706
We have to move, now.
Why? What's happened?

1391
01:40:02,631 --> 01:40:04,259
Remember me?

1392
01:40:08,637 --> 01:40:09,980
Oh, my, oh, my.

1393
01:40:10,222 --> 01:40:12,190
How the tables have turned.

1394
01:40:12,766 --> 01:40:15,144
I know it's hard to admit,

1395
01:40:15,393 --> 01:40:19,738
but how spectacular
a move is this?

1396
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:23,576
Am I right? Right as rain.

1397
01:40:25,194 --> 01:40:27,823
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother,

1398
01:40:28,073 --> 01:40:30,871
it is time to grant me a wish.

1399
01:40:31,115 --> 01:40:35,337
I want in to Special...
How dare you come back in here?

1400
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:40,010
You recalcitrant,
unworthy, defective,

1401
01:40:40,252 --> 01:40:42,220
urchin freaks.

1402
01:40:44,797 --> 01:40:49,974
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1403
01:41:03,606 --> 01:41:04,653
Clear.

1404
01:41:06,484 --> 01:41:09,033
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1405
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:13,952
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1406
01:41:18,288 --> 01:41:21,087
The grid is all yours.

1407
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:55,832
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1408
01:42:01,829 --> 01:42:03,252
What is all this stuff?

1409
01:42:03,497 --> 01:42:05,000
The future.

1410
01:42:18,762 --> 01:42:19,979
Load one up.

1411
01:42:24,644 --> 01:42:25,815
It won't work.

1412
01:42:26,061 --> 01:42:29,737
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1413
01:42:29,981 --> 01:42:33,953
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1414
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:40,037
Do it. Now.

1415
01:42:59,677 --> 01:43:01,520
You had it all this time.

1416
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:32,725
It's Spider-Man.

1417
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:39,862
Stop the cab.

1418
01:44:40,108 --> 01:44:42,155
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1419
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:08,134
Whoa!

1420
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,311
- Hi.
- Hi.

1421
01:45:15,016 --> 01:45:16,993
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1422
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:19,692
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1423
01:45:19,938 --> 01:45:21,735
Don't do that.
I couldn't make it out.

1424
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:24,109
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1425
01:45:25,777 --> 01:45:27,494
Because I love you.

1426
01:45:28,529 --> 01:45:30,953
And no offense, but you're wrong.
I'm wrong about what?

1427
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:33,042
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1428
01:45:33,283 --> 01:45:35,627
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1429
01:45:36,703 --> 01:45:38,876
And you're always gonna be
my path.

1430
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:43,381
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1431
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:45,384
But I'm tired of them.

1432
01:45:48,006 --> 01:45:50,305
I'm tired of every single one
of them.

1433
01:45:50,801 --> 01:45:52,724
We've all gotta make a choice.

1434
01:45:54,637 --> 01:45:56,105
Right? Well, I choose you.

1435
01:45:58,725 --> 01:45:59,976
So,

1436
01:46:00,226 --> 01:46:01,774
here's my thought.

1437
01:46:03,396 --> 01:46:04,739
England.

1438
01:46:06,065 --> 01:46:07,408
Both of us.

1439
01:46:09,277 --> 01:46:10,869
I'm following you now.

1440
01:46:11,404 --> 01:46:13,247
I'm just gonna
follow you everywhere.

1441
01:46:13,823 --> 01:46:15,791
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1442
01:46:16,951 --> 01:46:20,171
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1443
01:46:20,412 --> 01:46:22,086
Yeah.
They got tons of crime, it seems.

1444
01:46:22,331 --> 01:46:24,255
Tons. They got, uh,

1445
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:27,011
Jack the Ripper. Heh, heh.

1446
01:46:27,295 --> 01:46:28,296
What?

1447
01:46:28,546 --> 01:46:31,048
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet.
You didn't know that?

1448
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,323
What the hell is that?

1449
01:47:02,953 --> 01:47:04,501
Is that Max?

1450
01:47:05,081 --> 01:47:07,333
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1451
01:47:15,926 --> 01:47:17,643
PNA 322, you are...

1452
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:20,057
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1453
01:47:20,304 --> 01:47:22,648
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1454
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:25,393
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1455
01:47:25,768 --> 01:47:27,565
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1456
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:31,565
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1457
01:47:31,814 --> 01:47:34,658
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1458
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:37,744
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1459
01:47:37,987 --> 01:47:40,747
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

1460
01:47:40,907 --> 01:47:42,876
Have you tried grounding them?
Tried everything.

1461
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:45,166
Rubber, plastic...
Did you try magnetizing them?

1462
01:47:45,412 --> 01:47:47,881
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1463
01:47:48,122 --> 01:47:50,295
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1464
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:53,587
If you magnetize a nail
with a battery...

1465
01:47:54,002 --> 01:47:55,880
It holds an electric charge.
Yes.

1466
01:47:58,256 --> 01:48:01,476
New York Approach. This is
Pan National 273 on approach.

1467
01:48:01,719 --> 01:48:03,015
How do you hear?

1468
01:48:04,012 --> 01:48:05,355
Approach, do you copy?

1469
01:48:05,597 --> 01:48:07,564
Radio's working. It's not us.

1470
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:19,157
Do not panic.
Everyone, please return to your vehicles.

1471
01:48:19,403 --> 01:48:21,280
Go back to your cars.

1472
01:48:21,738 --> 01:48:22,956
Remain calm.

1473
01:48:24,408 --> 01:48:27,002
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1474
01:48:27,243 --> 01:48:28,712
Go into your homes. Officer!

1475
01:48:29,121 --> 01:48:30,247
Spider-Man! Oh!

1476
01:48:30,497 --> 01:48:32,750
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1477
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,752
I knew who he was. What can we do?
Jumper cables.

1478
01:48:36,002 --> 01:48:38,131
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1479
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,801
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?!

1480
01:48:41,548 --> 01:48:43,051
Yes. Ho.

1481
01:48:43,384 --> 01:48:45,743
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1482
01:48:48,805 --> 01:48:51,685
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1483
01:48:51,934 --> 01:48:52,935
Okay, it works, good.

1484
01:48:53,185 --> 01:48:54,864
That is why you were
number two at Midtown.

1485
01:48:55,104 --> 01:48:56,104
Rub it in. Okay. Heh.

1486
01:48:58,355 --> 01:48:59,948
I gotta go. I'm coming with you.

1487
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:02,034
You're not coming with me.
Yes, I am.

1488
01:49:02,278 --> 01:49:03,529
It's too dangerous. I'm coming.

1489
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:06,202
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1490
01:49:06,448 --> 01:49:10,420
I'm coming with you! You need me!
Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1491
01:49:10,661 --> 01:49:11,912
Shut the thing.

1492
01:49:12,287 --> 01:49:14,039
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1493
01:49:15,832 --> 01:49:17,175
Peter!

1494
01:49:17,417 --> 01:49:19,260
We still don't have
backup generators.

1495
01:49:19,502 --> 01:49:20,878
Get me Engineering!

1496
01:49:21,253 --> 01:49:22,453
I need a respirator right now.

1497
01:49:22,671 --> 01:49:24,515
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1498
01:49:24,757 --> 01:49:25,930
Hang on.

1499
01:49:26,676 --> 01:49:27,722
Okay.

1500
01:49:50,532 --> 01:49:52,784
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1501
01:49:53,077 --> 01:49:56,331
It's time to meet our destiny.

1502
01:50:11,469 --> 01:50:13,908
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1503
01:50:14,137 --> 01:50:16,640
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1504
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:19,319
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1505
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:26,363
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1506
01:50:26,609 --> 01:50:29,863
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1507
01:50:30,113 --> 01:50:31,831
Time to impact?
Four and a half minutes.

1508
01:50:32,073 --> 01:50:33,198
Clock it right now.

1509
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:49,342
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1510
01:50:49,672 --> 01:50:51,345
I designed this power grid.

1511
01:50:51,591 --> 01:50:53,184
Now I'm gonna take back

1512
01:50:53,426 --> 01:50:55,144
what is rightfully mine.

1513
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:57,684
I will control everything.

1514
01:50:57,930 --> 01:51:01,560
And I will be like a God to them.

1515
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:03,106
A God named Sparkles?

1516
01:51:13,444 --> 01:51:14,742
Not this time.

1517
01:51:15,113 --> 01:51:16,832
Is that all you got? Come on!

1518
01:51:36,676 --> 01:51:37,849
Come on!

1519
01:51:42,099 --> 01:51:43,270
You ready to give up?

1520
01:51:53,943 --> 01:51:56,445
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1521
01:52:07,163 --> 01:52:08,791
Just shake it off.
It's just your bones,

1522
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:11,920
and your muscles and your organs.
Huh!

1523
01:52:14,837 --> 01:52:16,306
Oh, boy.

1524
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:24,680
I hate this song!

1525
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:46,661
Spider-Man,

1526
01:52:47,078 --> 01:52:48,421
bet you never saw this coming.

1527
01:52:56,087 --> 01:52:57,885
Really? You web me to a car?

1528
01:52:58,213 --> 01:52:59,511
What are you, a caveman?

1529
01:52:59,756 --> 01:53:00,974
You shouldn't be here.

1530
01:53:01,216 --> 01:53:03,810
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1531
01:53:04,052 --> 01:53:06,180
What are you doing here?!
I know the grid specs.

1532
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:07,726
I can reset the system!

1533
01:53:07,974 --> 01:53:10,193
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1534
01:53:10,434 --> 01:53:12,153
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1535
01:53:12,394 --> 01:53:15,363
Nobody makes my decisions
for me. All right? Nobody.

1536
01:53:15,604 --> 01:53:17,653
This is my choice, okay?

1537
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:20,780
My choice. This is mine. Oh!

1538
01:53:21,069 --> 01:53:23,242
Now, how do we stop him?
Okay, so he's electric,

1539
01:53:23,488 --> 01:53:24,956
he's like a battery.

1540
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:26,871
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1541
01:53:27,117 --> 01:53:28,117
It explodes. Right.

1542
01:53:28,367 --> 01:53:29,967
So we use his power
against him. Perfect.

1543
01:53:30,202 --> 01:53:32,045
Okay.
I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1544
01:53:32,287 --> 01:53:33,756
But I need you to reset
the system.

1545
01:53:34,038 --> 01:53:36,884
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1546
01:53:37,127 --> 01:53:39,425
No matter what. No matter what.
Peter.

1547
01:53:44,466 --> 01:53:45,809
Go, go!

1548
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:39,899
Sixty seconds to impact.

1549
01:55:05,252 --> 01:55:06,253
Aah!

1550
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:15,512
Now, Gwen, now!

1551
01:55:15,762 --> 01:55:16,889
Do it now!

1552
01:55:42,497 --> 01:55:43,668
Uni 687...

1553
01:55:54,801 --> 01:55:57,600
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1554
01:55:58,304 --> 01:56:01,306
You have incoming traffic.
I repeat: 280.

1555
01:56:01,556 --> 01:56:02,854
Defend immediately.

1556
01:56:13,569 --> 01:56:14,912
Whoo!

1557
01:56:18,364 --> 01:56:19,365
Yes!

1558
01:56:19,992 --> 01:56:22,233
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1559
01:56:22,453 --> 01:56:23,829
I'll be back in a minute.

1560
01:56:24,371 --> 01:56:26,623
Oh, thank God. All right!

1561
01:56:26,873 --> 01:56:28,876
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1562
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:06,708
I think we can still make your flight.

1563
01:57:15,545 --> 01:57:16,671
Gwen, stay there.

1564
01:57:42,738 --> 01:57:44,159
Peter.

1565
01:57:45,073 --> 01:57:48,247
When you said Spider-Man
said no,

1566
01:57:48,743 --> 01:57:52,793
you meant you said no.

1567
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:55,462
Harry, what did you do?

1568
01:57:55,708 --> 01:57:57,711
What you made me do.

1569
01:57:58,252 --> 01:57:59,755
You were my friend

1570
01:58:00,003 --> 01:58:02,552
and you betrayed me!

1571
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:03,966
No.

1572
01:58:04,425 --> 01:58:06,347
I was trying to protect you. Oh.

1573
01:58:07,095 --> 01:58:08,347
Look at me.

1574
01:58:08,596 --> 01:58:10,690
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1575
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,739
You don't give people hope.

1576
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,606
You take it away.

1577
01:58:14,853 --> 01:58:15,899
No, Harry.

1578
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:18,447
I'm gonna take away yours.

1579
01:58:18,689 --> 01:58:20,237
- No. Gwen, run!
- Aah!

1580
01:58:20,483 --> 01:58:21,654
Harry!

1581
01:58:22,277 --> 01:58:23,573
Harry, put her down!

1582
01:58:40,502 --> 01:58:42,345
Harry, stop this right now!

1583
01:58:42,587 --> 01:58:45,306
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1584
01:58:45,881 --> 01:58:47,805
Harry. Harry is dead!

1585
01:58:48,051 --> 01:58:51,020
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1586
01:58:51,262 --> 01:58:53,310
Fight me! Let her go!

1587
01:58:53,849 --> 01:58:54,975
Okay.

1588
01:58:56,184 --> 01:58:57,184
No!

1589
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:07,362
You okay? MM-mm.

1590
01:59:11,823 --> 01:59:13,952
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1591
02:00:34,194 --> 02:00:35,194
Peter?

1592
02:01:38,841 --> 02:01:41,060
Hey. Hey.

1593
02:01:44,305 --> 02:01:45,351
Gwen?

1594
02:01:48,016 --> 02:01:49,018
Hey.

1595
02:01:49,393 --> 02:01:50,519
Hey!

1596
02:01:55,355 --> 02:01:56,448
Gwen?

1597
02:01:58,484 --> 02:01:59,485
Hey.

1598
02:02:03,032 --> 02:02:04,078
Breathe.

1599
02:02:05,618 --> 02:02:07,541
Hey, Gwen.

1600
02:02:08,537 --> 02:02:09,537
Hey.

1601
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:14,337
Hey.

1602
02:02:16,752 --> 02:02:18,050
You're okay.

1603
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:22,891
Gwen?

1604
02:02:28,805 --> 02:02:30,307
Stay with me, stay with me.

1605
02:02:30,556 --> 02:02:32,935
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1606
02:02:38,689 --> 02:02:39,782
Gwen.

1607
02:02:42,487 --> 02:02:43,533
Gwen!

1608
02:02:46,532 --> 02:02:49,081
No, please, please.

1609
02:02:51,619 --> 02:02:52,997
Please.

1610
02:02:59,877 --> 02:03:02,131
I can't do this without you.

1611
02:05:04,789 --> 02:05:06,212
Leave us.

1612
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:12,096
You've made progress.

1613
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:15,559
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1614
02:05:15,801 --> 02:05:17,894
Now that Spider-Man's gone,

1615
02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:21,185
this city will never be the same.

1616
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:23,979
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1617
02:05:24,225 --> 02:05:25,819
Speaking of progress,

1618
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,108
you're looking better.

1619
02:05:28,063 --> 02:05:29,905
It comes and goes.

1620
02:05:31,608 --> 02:05:33,076
Tell me more.

1621
02:05:33,652 --> 02:05:35,198
How many men
did you have in mind?

1622
02:05:35,444 --> 02:05:37,445
I wanna keep it small.

1623
02:05:37,697 --> 02:05:41,076
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1624
02:05:43,034 --> 02:05:44,537
Access granted.

1625
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:46,710
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1626
02:05:46,997 --> 02:05:48,716
Who's our first volunteer?

1627
02:05:48,957 --> 02:05:50,756
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1628
02:05:51,002 --> 02:05:53,173
Currently serving a life sentence.

1629
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:54,636
He is

1630
02:05:54,878 --> 02:05:57,131
most eager to join us.

1631
02:05:57,966 --> 02:05:59,264
Good.

1632
02:05:59,926 --> 02:06:01,929
Start with him.

1633
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:03,976
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich

1634
02:06:04,222 --> 02:06:06,145
was broken out of
a classified penitentiary

1635
02:06:06,391 --> 02:06:09,564
known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1636
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:12,234
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity

1637
02:06:12,479 --> 02:06:15,654
since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1638
02:06:15,899 --> 02:06:19,154
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1639
02:06:19,404 --> 02:06:21,997
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department

1640
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:24,242
has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping

1641
02:06:24,492 --> 02:06:26,585
for the return
of the web-slinger.

1642
02:06:26,827 --> 02:06:29,000
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1643
02:06:29,662 --> 02:06:31,039
Where is Spider-Man?

1644
02:06:33,042 --> 02:06:35,465
Oh. Too bad about that spider guy.

1645
02:06:37,005 --> 02:06:39,884
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

1646
02:06:41,884 --> 02:06:43,180
Where you going?

1647
02:06:44,386 --> 02:06:47,060
Eat my cereal. Peter.

1648
02:06:47,472 --> 02:06:49,145
Where you going?

1649
02:06:59,108 --> 02:07:00,154
I don't know.

1650
02:07:02,444 --> 02:07:04,118
You know, it's so funny.
I've been...

1651
02:07:04,863 --> 02:07:07,707
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized,

1652
02:07:08,117 --> 02:07:12,337
and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1653
02:07:13,122 --> 02:07:16,842
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1654
02:07:17,585 --> 02:07:19,632
You're throwing his stuff away?
No.

1655
02:07:19,878 --> 02:07:21,095
No. God, no.

1656
02:07:21,463 --> 02:07:24,592
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1657
02:07:25,467 --> 02:07:28,438
I'm just finding

1658
02:07:29,387 --> 02:07:30,855
a better place for it.

1659
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:36,524
I'm gonna take one last look,

1660
02:07:37,979 --> 02:07:39,605
and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1661
02:08:04,881 --> 02:08:09,100
It's easy to feel
hopeful on a beautiful day like today.

1662
02:08:10,301 --> 02:08:13,180
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1663
02:08:14,014 --> 02:08:16,563
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1664
02:08:19,103 --> 02:08:21,525
And that's when hope
is needed most.

1665
02:08:22,981 --> 02:08:25,029
No matter how buried it gets,

1666
02:08:25,859 --> 02:08:27,953
or how lost you feel,

1667
02:08:28,194 --> 02:08:29,912
you must promise me

1668
02:08:30,154 --> 02:08:33,500
that you will hold on to hope.

1669
02:08:35,202 --> 02:08:36,453
Keep it alive.

1670
02:08:37,371 --> 02:08:39,998
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1671
02:08:40,247 --> 02:08:41,716
My wish for you

1672
02:08:41,957 --> 02:08:44,086
is to become hope.

1673
02:08:44,543 --> 02:08:46,011
People need that.

1674
02:08:47,337 --> 02:08:49,305
And even if we fail,

1675
02:08:49,673 --> 02:08:51,721
what better way is there to live?

1676
02:08:53,302 --> 02:08:55,055
As we look around here today

1677
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:58,649
at all of the people
who helped make us who we are,

1678
02:08:59,349 --> 02:09:01,771
I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1679
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:04,984
But we will carry
a piece of each other

1680
02:09:05,229 --> 02:09:07,983
into everything that we do next,

1681
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:12,654
to remind us of who we are,

1682
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:16,158
and of who we're meant to be.

1683
02:09:18,618 --> 02:09:20,792
I've had a great four years with you.

1684
02:09:21,037 --> 02:09:23,039
I'll miss you all very much.

1685
02:09:38,345 --> 02:09:39,346
Whoa!

1686
02:09:45,435 --> 02:09:46,528
Let's go! Move it.

1687
02:09:54,904 --> 02:09:56,372
Get down! Take cover!

1688
02:10:00,201 --> 02:10:04,502
I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.

1689
02:10:04,746 --> 02:10:06,965
A man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit

1690
02:10:07,207 --> 02:10:08,628
is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1691
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:15,298
I am the Rhino!

1692
02:10:15,547 --> 02:10:17,970
I told you I would be back!

1693
02:10:29,228 --> 02:10:31,356
A kid! No! No!

1694
02:10:36,569 --> 02:10:37,569
Hold your fire!

1695
02:10:37,945 --> 02:10:39,572
Everybody, hold your fire.

1696
02:10:40,405 --> 02:10:43,501
- Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
- Civilian in our line of sight.

1697
02:10:47,453 --> 02:10:48,501
Kid! You gotta get...

1698
02:10:50,666 --> 02:10:52,463
Look, New York!

1699
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:54,552
Spider-Man is back.

1700
02:10:55,128 --> 02:10:56,128
Leave the kid alone!

1701
02:10:56,378 --> 02:10:58,301
That's my baby! Please.

1702
02:11:01,384 --> 02:11:03,478
Brave boy. Huh?

1703
02:11:03,761 --> 02:11:06,104
Does Aleksei scare you,
little boy?

1704
02:11:23,405 --> 02:11:24,908
Hey, Spider-Man.

1705
02:11:35,333 --> 02:11:36,631
I knew you'd come back.

1706
02:11:37,127 --> 02:11:39,470
Yeah. Thanks for
stepping up for me.

1707
02:11:39,712 --> 02:11:41,806
You're the bravest kid
I've ever seen.

1708
02:11:42,048 --> 02:11:44,770
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1709
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:47,557
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1710
02:11:54,603 --> 02:11:55,774
You fight me?

1711
02:11:56,104 --> 02:11:58,903
You fight me now? Huh?

1712
02:11:59,190 --> 02:12:02,536
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere,

1713
02:12:02,778 --> 02:12:05,780
I ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air.

1714
02:12:06,029 --> 02:12:07,030
Never!

1715
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:10,284
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1716
02:12:10,533 --> 02:12:12,036
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1717
02:12:12,328 --> 02:12:13,328
Yes!

1718
02:12:13,578 --> 02:12:14,921
I'll be right there. Ah...

1719
02:12:15,163 --> 02:12:16,962
There's no place like home.
