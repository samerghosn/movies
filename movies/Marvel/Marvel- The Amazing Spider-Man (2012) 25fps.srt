1
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,889
Five, four, three..

2
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,565
two, one.

3
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,131
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,690
Hey.. Dad?

5
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,764
Dad..

6
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,369
You will stay with Aunt May and
Uncle Ben for a little while.

7
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,998
- I want to go with you.
- No.

8
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,848
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches..

9
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,412
and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

10
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,998
Mary. Come on, come on. Oh, God.

11
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,851
Dad.

12
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,284
Be good.

13
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,045
- Sorry.
- Morning, Flash.

14
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,882
Good morning, Parker.

15
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,991
Hey.. It's Peter, right?

16
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,730
I really like your photos.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

17
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,246
Listen are you
busy Friday night?

18
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,403
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

19
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:38,686
I just you know, I really want to
frame a good one for his birthday.

20
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:42,209
That's really nice of you. Wow,
that's such a nice thought.

21
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,044
Yeah, I will have a look at the old..
The old schedule. Okay.

22
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,240
Parker.

23
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,367
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

24
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:53,405
- Yeah. Keep it off the ground.
- Sure. Yeah. Wheels up.

25
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:56,450
Like that? That's it. Okay.

26
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,925
Eat it. Eat it. Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it. Eat it.

27
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,400
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on. Eat it.

28
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,970
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.

29
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,730
Hey, Parker, come on. Eat it.
Get a picture of this. Come on.

30
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,928
No, I am not going to take a picture of it.
Come on. Put him down, man.

31
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:38,968
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

32
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,120
Take the picture, Parker.

33
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,690
Put him down, Flash.

34
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,364
Take the picture.

35
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:46,000
Put him down, Eugene.

36
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,206
Hey, man.

37
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,409
Come on. Get up, Parker.

38
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,209
- Get up. Come on.
- Come on. Get up.

39
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,625
Still not taking the picture.

40
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,385
Stay down, Parker.

41
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:09,159
Who wants one more?
One more. Flash.

42
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,490
Flash..

43
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,448
we still on for
after school today?

44
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,680
My house, 3:30?

45
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:16,605
I hope you been doing your homework.
Last time, I was..

46
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,481
very disappointed in you. Okay. Move.
No, how about we go to class?

47
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:21,801
How about it?

48
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,010
Whatever.

49
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,289
I thought that was great
what you did out there.

50
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,802
It was stupid..

51
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,482
but it was great.

52
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,124
You should probably go to the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

53
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,042
What's your name?

54
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,646
You don't know my name?

55
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,723
No, I know your name.

56
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,524
I just want to know if
you know your name.

57
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,690
Peter.

58
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,802
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

59
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,688
I'd still go to
the nurse though.

60
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:27,290
- You're Gwen, right?
- Gwen Stacy. All right.

61
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,083
Hey.

62
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,930
I am making spaghetti
and meatballs tonight.

63
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,641
You're serious? Spaghetti
and meatballs.

64
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:39,361
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

65
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,999
- Oh, my God. What's up?
- What happened to your face?

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,245
I am all right. Just.. I fell.
Skating. It's all right.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,842
Ben Parker, don't you even..

68
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,843
think about leaving that
filthy box in my kitchen.

69
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:55,649
These are my bowling trophies.
Oh, well, then, by all means..

70
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,244
please leave that filthy
box in my kitchen.

71
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:58,810
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

72
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,056
Why you kids ride those
things, I will never know.

73
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,324
Because it's stupid
and dangerous.

74
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,866
Remember when we were
stupid and dangerous? No.

75
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:08,367
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know. Hey.

76
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:12,820
- Where's the flood? Follow me.
- I will show you. You serious? Yes.

77
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,041
All right.

78
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,199
I think it's the condenser tray.

79
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,349
No. Too much water for the condenser
tray or the heat exchange tubing.

80
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,362
This has got to
be the fill line.

81
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,806
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

82
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,246
Can you fix it?

83
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,530
No, not tonight. I will go by
the hardware store tomorrow.

84
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:32,001
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

85
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,570
How's the other guy look?

86
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,084
Come on. I know a right
cross when I see one.

87
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,891
Yes or no? Do I have to
call somebody's father?

88
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,286
No, no.

89
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,486
All right.

90
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,642
Well, I wouldn't
tell your Aunt May.

91
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,965
I pity the poor kid who'd
have to suffer her wrath.

92
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,561
Hey, before you come up, see if there's
anything else worth saving. Okay.

93
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,380
Plumbers don't fix appliances.
Oh, yes, they do.

94
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:17,604
They fix pipes and pump things.

95
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,524
If you ask them to..

96
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,201
I forgot all about that thing.
It was your dad's.

97
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:29,924
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe one.

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,243
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

99
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,924
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old
kid need with a briefcase?

100
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,809
And guess who sold it to him.

101
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,563
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

102
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,767
That's how they met.

103
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,688
He asked you to keep this safe?
Why? There's nothing in here.

104
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,523
Have you looked in here?
There's nothing here.

105
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,728
Your father was a very
secretive man, Peter.

106
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,291
Yeah, I know.

107
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,001
Who's that?

108
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,649
Do you know who that is?

109
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,321
Some guy who worked
with your dad, I guess.

110
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,842
Just take this off the
table, all right?

111
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:15,913
We're going to eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

112
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:19,007
Now. All right. Go on.

113
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,724
I need you to be a good boy.

114
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,960
Where are you going?

115
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,245
There's something..

116
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,323
something your mom
and I have to do.

117
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,320
What is this?

118
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,248
"Zero, zero, decay
rate algorithm."

119
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,484
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

120
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,889
Come in.

121
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,720
- You okay? Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

122
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:21,962
- You look just like him.
- Can I come in? Yeah.

123
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,042
Listen..

124
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:31,171
I don't have much education.
You know that, Peter.

125
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,843
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

126
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,487
What I am trying to say is..

127
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,287
I know it's been rough for
you without your dad.

128
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,528
And I know we don't
talk much about them.

129
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,011
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not all right.

130
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,531
I wish I could change
it, but I can't.

131
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,651
Curt Connors.

132
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,924
That's the name of the guy in
the picture with your dad.

133
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,320
They worked together for
years and they were close.

134
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,767
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

135
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,804
He never even called.

136
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,121
Not once.

137
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,090
Go figure.

138
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,483
She's pretty.

139
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,046
- Uncle Ben.
- What?

140
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,445
You're a pretty great dad.
Alright.

141
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,039
Excuse me.

142
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,961
What?

143
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,644
Can I help you?

144
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:22,970
I don't know. I am here to
see Dr. Connors. Right.

145
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:24,929
You will find
yourself to the left.

146
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,364
You are here for the internship?

147
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,519
Yeah. Yeah.

148
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,726
Okay.

149
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:33,689
You will find your
badge to the left.

150
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,487
Are you having trouble finding yourself?
No. Yeah, I got it.

151
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,749
Okay. Mr. Guevara. Gracias.

So, I will be with you for
the duration of your visit.

161
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:15,759
Where I go, you go.

162
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,130
That's the basic rule. If you remember
that all will be fine. Come on.

163
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,646
- If you forget that, then..
- Listen. Look, listen.

164
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,524
Tell them Rodrigo
Guevara is down here.

00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:26,965
Please. Just tell them Rodrigo Guevara
is down here. My name's Rodrigo.

166
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:30,151
Well, I guess I don't need to tell
you what happens if you forget.

167
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,329
Shall we?

168
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,570
Come around this way.

169
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,802
Good afternoon, Gwen.
Dr. Connors.

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,641

And yes, in case you're
wondering, I am a southpaw.

173
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,165
I am not a cripple..

174
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,528
I am a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

175
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,330
That's reptiles, for those
of you who don't know.

176
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:05,645
But like the Parkinson's patient who
watches on in horror as her body..

177
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,087
slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration..

178
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:12,925
whose eyes grow dimmer each
day, I long to fix myself.

179
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:16,765
I want to create a world
without weakness.

180
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,764
Anyone care to venture
a guess just how?

181
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,081
Yes.

182
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:26,685
Stem cells? Promising. But the solution
I am thinking of is more radical.

183
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,370
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

184
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,769
Person gets Parkinson's
when the brain cells

185
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,562
that produce dopamine
start to disappear.

186
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:48,008
But a zebra fish has the ability
to regenerate cells on command.

187
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,009
If you somehow could
give this ability..

188
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,925
to the woman you're talking
about, that's that. She's..

189
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,206
She's curing herself.

190
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,126
Yeah, you just have to look
past the gills on her neck.

191
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,686
And you are..?

192
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,164
He's one of Midtown Science's
best and brightest. Really?

193
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:12,123
He is second in his class.
Oh. Second? Yeah.

194
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:14,651
You sure about that?
I am pretty sure.

195
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,721
I am afraid duty calls. I will leave you in
the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

196
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,690
Nice meeting you all.

197
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,403
If you'd like to gather round.
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

198
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,991
Our planet's tree
of life is immense.

199
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,089
- At Oscorp's Cross-Species Division..
- Hi.

200
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,530
We endeavour to explore
exciting new methods..

201
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,941
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

202
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,760
Oh, yeah.

203
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,125
What are you doing here?

204
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:51,384
I work here. I don't work here. I
was going to say I work here..

205
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:54,322
but it seems like you in fact do work here.
So you know that I don't work here.

206
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,321
You following me?

207
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:58,483
No, I am not following you, no. I am not.
I had no idea you worked here.

208
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,723
Then why would you be here?
I just snuck in because..

209
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,244
I love science.

210
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:05,128
- You love science.
- I am passionate about it.

211
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,849
So you snuck in..?

212
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,081
I have to lead this tour group. I know.
I will ask you more about this later.

213
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,929
Do not get me in trouble.
Stay with the group.

214
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,799
I promise you I won't.

215
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,322
All right, guys? I am going to take
you to the bioreactor room now.

216
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,405
Sorry. Yo.

217
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,807
Sorry.

218
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,401
We received the results from the
mRNA sequences this morning.

219
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:49,645
They were.. disappointing.

220
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,285
Define "disappointing."

221
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:57,725
Another dead end.

222
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:59,484
It's the decay rate algorithm.

223
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,047
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

224
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:03,485
You said you were close.

225
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:05,721
We are close, but it's
going to take time.

226
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,040
He doesn't have time.

227
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,407
Norman Osborn is
dying, Dr. Connors.

228
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,126
Save him.

229
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,124
Or we will both lose our heads.

230
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,171
All right, give me the badge.

231
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,566
Give it to me.

232
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,411
Sorry.

233
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,087
Disgusting. Now I
smell like beer.

234
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,510
All right, I am sorry. I
didn't mean to do that.

235
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,244
I didn't mean to..

236
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,084
I didn't.. I didn't..

237
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,244
Get your hand off her. I am
trying to get my.. Yo man.

238
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,561
Are you kidding? I am sorry.

239
00:22:58,562 --> 00:22:59,881
Are you freaking kidding me?

240
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,090
- Hey, get him, Rudy.
- Hey.

241
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,997
Man. I am sorry. Help him..
Man, are you all right?

242
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,550
- Take him down.
- Come on.

243
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,485
Get him, man. Get him.

244
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
No, man, no. Not my board.
Please, dude, don't..

245
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,047
Sorry.

246
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,801
Sorry. Sorry.

247
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:30,200
I am so sorry.

248
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,489
Coney Island, next stop. Next
and final stop, Coney Island.

249
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,949
Hey.

250
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
Hey. Hey.. Sorry. I am late.

251
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,123
- I got..
- We have been so worried.

252
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:57,360
I know. I am sorry.

253
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,806
Watch out.

254
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,721
That's a fly, Peter.

255
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,205
Yeah.

256
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,405
I am so sorry..

257
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,685
I kept you guys up..

258
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:24,925
I am insensitive, I am irresponsible..
and I am hungry.

259
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,764
Meatloaf.

260
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,360
Drinking?

261
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:35,520
What's this?

262
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,010
I don't think so.

263
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,764
This is your meatloaf.

264
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,848
This beats all other meat loafs.

265
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,003
Something is very wrong.

266
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,728
Yeah. Nobody likes
your meatloaf.

267
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,085
I got it.

268
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,681
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

269
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,600
I noticed that.

270
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,246
Why didn't you tell me you
didn't like my meatloaf?

271
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,607
You could have said that
to me 37 years ago.

272
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:13,331
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

273
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,208
Peter.

274
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,205
What are you doing up there?
I am..

275
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,201
Homework.

276
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:05,849
Be careful.

277
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,525
Sure.

278
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,731
Dr. Connors.

279
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,446
You don't remember me. I.. The
intern from the other day.

280
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,603
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

281
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:26,966
I am sure you're very nice
young man, but this is a home.

282
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,360
I ask you to make an
appointment with my office.

283
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:30,851
I am Richard Parker's son.

284
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,961
Peter?

285
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,128
I am afraid..

286
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:46,328
I can't help you much, Peter. I don't know
why they left or where they were going.

287
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,410
Good reflexes.

288
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:51,891
Thank you.

289
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,250
- Thank you.
- I read your book. Yeah.

290
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:03,408
It's something, you know.
So you really think it's..

291
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,165
possible, cross-species genetics?
Yes, of course but.

292
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,686
For years your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

293
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,490
Not just in the community at
large, but at Oscorp, as well.

294
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:13,688
They called us mad scientists.

295
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,530
And then your father bred the
spiders and everything changed.

296
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:20,283
The results were
beyond encouraging.

297
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:22,329
They were spectacular.

298
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,249
We were going to change
the lives of millions.

299
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,289
Including my own.

300
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,285
Then it was over.

301
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,930
He was gone.

302
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,489
Took his research with him.

303
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,000
And I knew without him, I..

304
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,804
I..

305
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,402
I was angry.

306
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,482
So I stayed away from
you and your family.

307
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,483
And for that, I am truly sorry.

308
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,090
Say..

309
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,002
Say it worked. Say
you got it to work.

310
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Like, how much would the
foreign species take over?

311
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,202
What could the side effects be?

312
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,729
It's hard to say, considering
no subject survived.

313
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,365
The problem was always..
The decay rate algorithm?

314
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,250
- Right.
- Right.

315
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,680
Can I..?

316
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:40,444
Of course.

317
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,689
- Extraordinary.
- How did you come up with this?

318
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,368
Peter, how about you
feel about coming to see

319
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:16,999
me at the Tower one day
after school? Yeah.

320
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,404
Thank you.

321
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,990
Number one, Reggie. Run it, buddy.
Let's go. Reggie.. Yeah.

322
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,848
Rejected.

323
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,049
You did that on purpose, Flash.

324
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,202
No, but I should have. You
better watch your back.

325
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,604
Hey.

326
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,322
All right?

327
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,862
Give it up, Parker.

328
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,887
Come on, man.

329
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,687
One sec.

330
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,997
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

331
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,766
That's right, Flash. Take it, man.
Go ahead. Take it.

332
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,088
Just take it.

333
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,442
All right, how about this?

334
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,206
All right?

335
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:00,647
How about that? Come on, Flash.

336
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,367
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

337
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,567
- Take it from him.
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

338
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,005
Yo, Flash, let's go.

339
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:10,604
- Let's go.
- Do it, Flash.

340
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:12,443
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash. Come on.

341
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:15,204
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

342
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,992
What you doing, man?

343
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,268
All right, bring it. Come on, Parker.
Come on.

344
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,041
Peter's behaviour is
just unacceptable.

345
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,991
They are not going to make us pay
for the backboard. You know that.

346
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:40,930
I don't care about
the backboard.

347
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,729
- Was that true?
- What?

348
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,608
What I heard in there just now.

349
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:47,604
Did you humiliate that boy?

350
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,566
Yeah, I did.

351
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,210
But.. But what? This guy deserved it.
Did he?

352
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,010
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

353
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,445
Is he?

354
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:02,522
Yeah, yeah, but.. So all
this is about getting even.

355
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,367
If so, I guess you must feel pretty
good about yourself now, right?

356
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:07,487
Am I right or wrong?

357
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,925
Yeah, I thought so.

358
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours..

359
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,808
I had to change shifts at work..

360
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:19,487
so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

361
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,170
- Is that understood?
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good.

362
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,481
She looks familiar.

363
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,331
She is the girl
on your computer.

364
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,084
Yeah. He's got you on his computer.
I am his probation officer.

365
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,410
Don't forget Aunt May.

366
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,684
Okay.

367
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,048
He's a character.

368
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,166
That's my uncle.

369
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,287
He's a pathological liar.

370
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:52,770
He thought you
were someone else.

371
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,369
Oh, man, you don't have
me on your computer?

372
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:55,990
Yeah. I mean, like I have.

373
00:34:55,991 --> 00:35:00,189
I took a photo of the debate team, and
you're in the debate team. So. Right. So.

374
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,280
He must have seen.. I
was touching up stuff.

375
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,359
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

376
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,342
I was.. I am not going
to answer that.

377
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,046
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

378
00:35:12,047 --> 00:35:14,328
I didn't get expelled. I
got community service.

379
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,330
So you want to.. I don't know..?

380
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,522
Want to what?

381
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,320
I don't know.

382
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,130
Just..

383
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,527
I don't know.. We could..

384
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,362
We could do something
else, or we could..

385
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,886
If you don't feel like, we could..
Yeah.

386
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,530
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

387
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,928
- Really?
- Sure.

388
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,082
- Okay. All right, good.
- Sounds good. Cool.

389
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,446
Okay. I can't right now.
I can't right now. Yeah.

390
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:55,982
- No. I am so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

391
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,650
But maybe..

392
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:01,881
- Yeah, just, you know..
- Some other..

393
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:05,404
time, all right. Okay.
Bye. All right.

394
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,364
We've protein structure,
rDNA, chromatography,

395
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,991
transgenics testing,
that's X-ray video.

396
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:37,769
That's the only one on the planet.
We have..

397
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,600
- Human line testing over..
- I remember that.

398
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:42,363
I have seen that before.

399
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,759
The Ganali device.

400
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,325
Yeah, I remember a picture
of that in my dad's office.

401
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:49,080
The idea was so simple. You
load it with an antigen.

402
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:52,761
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even an entire city.

403
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:55,963
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

404
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,932
That's incredible. Well,
others disagreed.

405
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,328
What if the device were
loaded with a toxin?

406
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,602
What if you wanted to opt out? You
can't run away from a cloud..

407
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:06,848
after all, so here it
lies, gathering dust.

408
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,159
What you see here is a
computer model of a lizard.

409
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,402
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted..

410
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,960
that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

411
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,883
You can imagine my envy.

412
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:22,201
We're trying to harness this capability
and transfer it into our host subject:

413
00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:24,522
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

414
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,602
Enter the algorithm now.

415
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,607
You need to take that?

416
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,804
System ready for gene insertion.

417
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,530
Okay.

418
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,371
Check.

419
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,320
See what I am trying to do?

420
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:48,288
- Preempt the proteins.
- Preempt the immune response.

421
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:52,199
- Beginning trials.
- Pending. Pending.

422
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,888

Come on, come on. Pending.

423
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:56,881

Subject deceased. Pending.

427
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,845
Peptide algorithm accepted.

428
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:06,994
- Regrowth complete. Hey.
- Vitals normal.

429
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:09,361
Blood pressure normal.

430
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,281
Limb regeneration successful.

431
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,170
Extraordinary.

432
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,969
And thank you.

433
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,401
Meet Fred and Wilma..
our three-legged mice.

434
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,961
Here you go.

435
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,724
Hey, buddy. I got you.

436
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,401
Okay. Careful, don't want
to stick you by mistake.

437
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:38,369
Human trials aren't
until next week.

438
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,008
There.

439
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,759
Hey.

440
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,206
Hey, I thought you..

441
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,203
Didn't you forget something?

442
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,040
What?

443
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:00,886
Now, don't answer that, but I
am glad to know it's working.

444
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,646
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

445
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,330
Be a man. Get in
there and apologise.

446
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,479
I am sorry, Aunt May, I..
Honestly, you don't have..

447
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,549
to apologise to me. It's your..
The hell he doesn't. Ben.

448
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,769
Look, I am sorry, uncle
Ben I got distracted.

449
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:24,682
Oh, he got distracted. Yeah.

450
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:28,243
Your aunt, my wife, had
to walk 12 blocks alone..

451
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:31,621
in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station..

452
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:34,443
because you got distracted.
Ben, sweetheart, honestly..

453
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:38,487
I am completely capable of walking home..
You will not defend this boy.

454
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:42,640
I am not defending.. You are defending him.
Listen to me, son. Yeah, go ahead.

455
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,289
You're a lot like your father.

456
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,840
You really are, Peter, and
that's a good thing..

457
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:50,003
but your father lived by a
philosophy, a principle, really.

458
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:53,468
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people..

459
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:55,886
you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

460
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,564
That's what's at stake here.

461
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:58,686
Not choice.

462
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:00,763
Responsibility.

463
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,241
That is nice. That's great.

464
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,248
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

465
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,208
- What?
- Where is he?

466
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,248
Where's my dad?

467
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:16,767
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me this himself?

468
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:18,205
Oh, come on, how dare you?

469
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:20,010
How dare I? How dare you?

470
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,406
Where you going?

471
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,289
Peter, come back here, please.

472
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,444
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He will be all right.

473
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,887
Peter.

474
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,930
Peter?

475
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,645
Peter.

476
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,442
It's $2.07.

477
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,205
- All right. It's $2.07.
- Yeah. No, I know.

478
00:42:15,206 --> 00:42:18,090
Yeah, you're holding up the line.
No.

479
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:20,447
You can leave a penny.
You can't take a penny.

480
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,205
What? You can leave a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars..

481
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,402
to take a penny.
It's store policy.

482
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:28,630
You are going to pay.
You're holding up my line.

483
00:42:28,643 --> 00:42:29,880
I don't have 2 cents.

484
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,643
You can't afford milk,
just step aside.

485
00:42:31,644 --> 00:42:33,961
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

486
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:36,561
It's 2 cents. We're talking about 2 cents.
Just step aside, kid.

487
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,167
Really?

488
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,630
Yo, not cool, bro.

489
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,610
Hey, man, stop.
Somebody stop that guy.

490
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:05,090
Hey, kid, little help?

491
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:06,571
Not my policy.

492
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,121
Somebody stop that dude.

493
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,728
Hey.

494
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:11,120
Hey, stop.

495
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,810
Somebody stop that dude.

496
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,962
Hey.

497
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,690
Oh, God, oh, God.
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

498
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,849
Call an ambulance.

499
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,321
Someone call an ambulance.
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

500
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,524
Oh, God, oh, my God.

501
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,690
Oh, God.

502
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,851
No..

503
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,209
Oh, Jesus.

504
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,498
Witnesses gave a description
to the sketch artist.

505
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:23,760
I need you to take a look.

506
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,724
No, I don't know him.

507
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,290
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives..

508
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:37,084
are on it. We will see
what they turn up. Okay.

509
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,251
Can I.. Can I have that? Sure.

510
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:51,606
There's one other thing. He has a
star tattooed on his left hand.

511
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,860
Peter, I know things have
been difficult lately..

512
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:24,484
and I am sorry about that.

513
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,168
I think I know what
you're feeling.

514
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,244
Hey, Parker.

515
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,948
- Not today. Flash.
- Hey come on, man. I just want to talk.

516
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,044
It feels better, right?

517
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,445
Look, your uncle died.

518
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,490
I am sorry.

519
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:00,051
I get it.

520
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,930
I am sorry.

521
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,805
Okay?

522
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,046
Peter.

523
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,880
Listen to me. Stay
away from him.

524
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,391
You understand me? Hey.
Stay away from Joey.

525
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:56,925
You understand me? Hey.

526
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,920
You like beating on girls?

527
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,570
You like beating on old men?

528
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:03,281
Hey, pal just keep on walking.

529
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:05,761
- You're in the wrong place, buddy.
- When were you in Queens?

530
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,520
I asked you a question, man.

531
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,566
Nicky, no.

532
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:09,402
That the gun?

533
00:47:09,403 --> 00:47:10,607
You going to kill me too?

534
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,601
- Hey.
- Stop it.

535
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,367
- Hey.
- Get off.

536
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,201
- Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky.
- Back up.

537
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,690
This guy is crazy.

538
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,487
Get him.

539
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,362
Get back here, man. Get him.

540
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,248
Follow him.

541
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,404
- Go around, man.
- I will follow you.

542
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,128
Go, go, go.

543
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,560
There he is.

544
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:55,528
Can't get away.

545
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,444
He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.

546
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,607
Oh, yeah? Come on.

547
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,209
I know what you look like.

548
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,089
You hear me?

549
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,767
I have seen your face.

550
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,564
Is that all you got?

551
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,995
Just take it, take it.

552
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,450
Engineered from genetically
enhanced spiders..

553
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:30,635
Oscorp's BioCable tensile
strength is unparalleled.

554
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,843
We're just beginning..

555
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,606
to understand all the potential
industrial applications.

556
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:42,044
A single pellet can safely store several
hundred meters of the lightweight cable.

557
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,402
Mother..

558
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,042
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30..

559
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,406
on West 19th Street
and Broadway.

560
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:56,210
Assailant is Caucasian
male, mid-30s..

561
00:50:56,211 --> 00:51:00,650
170 to 180 pounds
shoulder-length blond hair.

562
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:03,326
Last seen on foot heading
eastbound on 19th Street.

563
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,409
Hey.

564
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,720
You got a description?
Well, no, he wears a mask.

565
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:34,845
A mask?

566
00:51:34,846 --> 00:51:36,125
Yeah. And most of his victims..

567
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,812
are suspects. Some of them
with serious rap sheets.

568
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:39,522
They're calling him a vigilante.

569
00:51:39,523 --> 00:51:41,966
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

570
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:45,881
Help me, somebody. Arrest me.
Please. Get me out of here.

571
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,526
Hey, look.

572
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,089
Spandex. Spandex.

573
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,806
Everything..

574
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:03,802
spandex.

575
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,123
Extraordinary velocity vector is a
function of both mass and acceleration.

576
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,008
Oh. Come on, you know
better than anyone..

577
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:12,526
the weight on any pendulum has
no effect on swing speed.

578
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:16,287
It doesn't affect frequency, but
it's totally a factor in momentum.

579
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,571
Hey, Aunt May.

580
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,359
Yeah. Eggs? Organic, got it.

581
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,642
You know, in the future, if
you're going to steal cars..

582
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,688
don't dress like a
car thief, man.

583
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:33,330
What are you? You a cop?

584
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,204
Really? You seriously think I am a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

585
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:39,805
You know, you're, you're..

586
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,450
You have got a mind of
the true scholar, sir.

587
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:45,887
I was going more for the
guys who do the luge.

588
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,753
Good thinking. Good thinking.
Get out the window.

589
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,129
Get out the window.

590
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,520
There you go. You got it.

591
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,965
Crotch.

592
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,431
Just let me go. Is that a knife?
Is that a real knife?

593
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,205
Yes, it's a real knife.

594
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:07,804
My weakness, it's small knives.

595
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:11,482
Just let me go. Anything but knives.
Oh, it's so simple.

596
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:13,050
- That was cool.
- What the hell is this?

597
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:15,679
Webbing that I developed myself. I
don't think you really want to know.

598
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,489
Come on. Let me go.

599
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,199
Okay, one second. Hold on, one second.
Knock it off, man. No.

600
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,607
Come on, let me go. Stop it.

601
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,471
That isn't funny. It is kind of funny.
Come on. Help.

602
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,810
This could have
gone a lot worse.

603
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:41,849
Now hold still.

604
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,445
Boys in blue here.

605
00:54:48,446 --> 00:54:50,000
Yo, I got him.

606
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:52,923
- Freeze. He's not going anywhere.
- You in the tights, don't move.

607
00:54:52,924 --> 00:54:54,046
You serious?

608
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:55,326
Who are you?

609
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,369
No one grasps the
concept of the mask.

610
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,282
Freeze.

611
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,052
I just did 80 percent of your job.
And that?

612
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:04,967
That's how you repay me?

613
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,566
Hold it right there.

614
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,920
All right. Well, that was fun.

615
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,390
Bus. Hey there, everybody.

616
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,561
What are you doing?

617
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,006
Hey, watch out.

618
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,240
I am swinging here.

619
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,845
I am swinging here.

620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,209
So 38 of New York's finest
versus one guy in a unitard.

621
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,246
Am I correct?

622
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,559
You don't have to wait up for me, you know.
Yes, I do. No, you don't.

623
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,686
Yes, I do.

624
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:28,125
- Okay.
- Where were you?

625
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:29,280
I was out.

626
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:31,329
Did you get the eggs?

627
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,244
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

628
00:56:34,245 --> 00:56:35,560
I am going to get them now.

629
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:37,244
No, you most certainly will not.

630
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:39,323
Not at this hour.

631
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,889
Look at me, Peter.

632
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,040
Take off the damn
hood and look at me.

633
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,402
Peter. Where do you go?

634
00:56:57,403 --> 00:56:58,970
Who does this to you?

635
00:56:58,971 --> 00:57:00,848
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

636
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:04,747
Please tell me. Aunt May, please,
please, please go to sleep.

637
00:57:04,748 --> 00:57:08,124
I can't sleep. Don't you understand?
I can't sleep.

638
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,561
Peter, listen to me.

639
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,049
Secrets have a cost.
They're not for free.

640
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,328
Not now, not ever.

641
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,808
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

642
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:41,644
I have used the lizard DNA to help
Freddy regrow that limb. It's a miracle.

643
00:57:41,645 --> 00:57:43,324
No, it's hard work and promise.

644
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:45,273
And it's a step closer
to the primate lab. But

645
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:47,245
he doesn't have time
for every little step.

646
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:49,929
Little? I just mean
he can't wait.

647
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,683
Well, he will have to.

648
00:57:51,684 --> 00:57:53,683
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

649
00:57:53,684 --> 00:57:55,647
That's not what I am saying.

650
00:57:55,648 --> 00:57:56,926
So, what are you saying?

651
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,767
You have to start human trials.

652
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,167
Now.

653
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:05,849
No, I don't, and no, I won't. Well,
then he's going to die. People die.

654
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,522
Even Norman Osborn.

655
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:09,646
We are not finished.

656
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:11,324
Human trials?

657
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:13,959
Where enough are you going to find
the people to volunteer? For what?

658
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,599
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a winter flu shot.

659
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,524
I might think the Veterans
Hospital is a place to start.

660
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:20,966
You have got to be kidding me.

661
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,087
I don't think I am.

662
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,988
It's a little late for shock
and indignation Curt.

663
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,720
About 15 years late.

664
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:34,683
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

665
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:36,284
Richard Parker wore it well.

666
00:58:36,285 --> 00:58:39,170
On you, it's a cheap
suit, as it was then.

667
00:58:39,171 --> 00:58:42,370
I had nothing to do with that. Is
that what you told his son? Peter.

668
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,039
I don't know what you're saying.

669
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,646
You don't know, or you
don't want to know?

670
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,323
I will remind you what happened.

671
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:59,402
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

672
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,129
The clock is ticking,
Dr. Connors.

673
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,764
I..

674
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,650
I won't.

675
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,330
Fine.

676
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,326
The formula is ours now anyway.

677
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,124
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

678
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,769
I am shutting you down.

679
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,729
Have your office cleared
out by the morning.

680
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,248
Your toys can be taken
away too, you know.

681
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,327
Right, Freddy?

682
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,920
- Hey.
- Hi.

683
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:57,841
How's it going?

684
00:59:57,842 --> 00:59:59,161
Where you headed?

685
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,566
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

686
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,609
- It's Thursday?
- What happened to your eye?

687
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:07,725
What? Your eye, it looks bruised.
Oh, yeah, no, I don't..

688
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:09,449
Maybe I got a rash or..

689
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,729
It's pretty bad. Have
you gone to the nurse?

690
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,130
Do you like branzino?

691
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:21,608
Like, a fish. No, no. I know.
I know. Well, if you want..

692
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:26,084
you can come to this
address at 8:00 tonight.

693
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,444
My mom's making branzino.

694
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,284
So..

695
01:00:30,285 --> 01:00:32,693
It's apartment 2016. I
didn't write that part down.

696
01:00:32,706 --> 01:00:35,125
I don't know why I..

697
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:38,531
- I will remember it.
- Oh, okay. 2016.

698
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,086
Hi.

699
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,566
How did you get out there?

700
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,890
The fire escape.

701
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,445
Your doorman's intimidating.

702
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,890
It's 20 storeys.

703
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,205
Yeah. It's all right.

704
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,522
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

705
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:04,283
Books.

706
01:02:04,284 --> 01:02:05,891
Shoes.

707
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,925
Oh, hey..

708
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,731
I got your mom.. these.

709
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,683
Oh, lovely. Beautiful, right?
Beautiful.

710
01:02:14,684 --> 01:02:18,048
They were nice. No, they're beautiful.
I am sorry.

711
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,850
No, it's impressive. They
actually held together very well.

712
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:22,490
I am going to keep these.

713
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,611
You have your suit in there?

714
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,123
My suit?

715
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:32,800
It's for dinner. Are you going to..?
Are you going to wear that?

716
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:34,927
That's.. Hey, hon.

717
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,124
You must be Peter.
Dad, this is Peter.

718
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,141
Nice to meet you, sir.

719
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,765
Nice to meet you.
Dinner's ready.

720
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,805
Hope you like branzino.

721
01:02:51,806 --> 01:02:53,450
Who doesn't?

722
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,106
Emma, it's Curt.

723
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,647
- Is he there?
- I am afraid not, doctor.

724
01:03:54,648 --> 01:03:57,530
The car is taking him to the
Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

725
01:03:57,531 --> 01:04:01,206
No. No. No. He can't, Emma.
You have to stop him. He..

726
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:03,680
I would, but I always lose him
when he is on the bridge.

727
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:07,284
I will make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.

728
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,732
I am going to Holton
Avenue, across the river.

729
01:04:17,745 --> 01:04:19,488
I am in a hurry.

730
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,215
Okay. You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

731
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:22,965
Bridge. Take the bridge.

732
01:04:22,966 --> 01:04:24,405
All right, we will do that.

733
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:26,488
Hey, man, you all
right back there?

734
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,321
You tweaking man?

735
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,970
Just drive.

736
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,681
Okay.

737
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,993
You're having trouble there? The
head goes on the other.. Simon.

738
01:04:42,994 --> 01:04:44,529
Help Gwen's friend
with his fish.

739
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,840
Oh, I..

740
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:47,046
I got no idea.

741
01:04:47,047 --> 01:04:48,689
First time.

742
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,364
- Branzino.
- George.

743
01:04:50,365 --> 01:04:51,756
Why don't you tell us about your day.
Oh, yeah.

744
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:53,170
Dad, did you catch
that spider guy yet?

745
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:54,844
No, we didn't catch him yet.

746
01:04:54,845 --> 01:04:56,808
But we will. He's an amateur..

747
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,565
who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

748
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:03,011
He's clumsy, he leaves clues
but he's still dangerous.

749
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,651
He's assaulting people?

750
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,530
I am not sure. I mean,
I saw that video..

751
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,568
with him and the
car thief, and..

752
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:14,724
I think most people
would say that he was..

753
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,771
providing a public service.

754
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,329
Most people would be wrong.

755
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,881
If I wanted the car thief off the
street, he'd already be off the street.

756
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:25,746
So why wasn't he then?

757
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,765
Let me illuminate you. See, the car thief
was leading us to the people who run..

758
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,047
the entire operation. It's
been a six-month-long sting.

759
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:38,089
It's called strategy. I am sure you
are aware of the term strategy?

760
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:43,005
You probably heard about that in school?
Yeah. Good. I know. Obviously..

761
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,730
he didn't know you had a plan.
You seem to know..

762
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:47,763
an awful lot about this case. You
know something that we don't know?

763
01:05:47,764 --> 01:05:49,926
- I mean, whose side are you on here?
- I am not on anyone's side.

764
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:53,349
I saw a video on the internet.. You
saw the video on the Internet.

765
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,327
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

766
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:57,970
I am just saying if you watch the video..
Maybe send you a link?

767
01:05:57,971 --> 01:05:59,523
It looks like he's trying to help.
Stop, stop, stop.

768
01:05:59,524 --> 01:06:01,072
Yeah, sure. On the Internet
he's being made out

769
01:06:01,085 --> 01:06:02,644
to look like some kind of
mask hero or something.

770
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:05,249
No, no. I am not saying he's a hero.
I don't think he is hero at all.

771
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,640
What are you trying to say? I am saying
he's trying to help. But it looks like..

772
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:09,094
he's trying to do something
maybe the police can't.

773
01:06:09,107 --> 01:06:10,570
Something the police can't?

774
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:12,209
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do there?

775
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,728
We just sit around eating doughnuts with
our thumbs planted firmly up our asses?

776
01:06:15,729 --> 01:06:17,154
George. George. Daddy. You
think that we do down there?

777
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:18,603
Up your what, dad? Howard.

778
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:20,435
I think he stands for
what you stand for, sir.

779
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:22,289
Protecting innocent
people from bad guys.

780
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:26,124
I stand for law and order, son. That's
what I stand for. Okay? I wear a badge.

781
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:29,203
This guy wears a mask like a..
you know like an outlaw.

782
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:31,805
He's hunting down a bunch of
criminals that all look the same..

783
01:06:31,806 --> 01:06:34,041
like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

784
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:37,089
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

785
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,004
Let's get some air, Peter.

786
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,682
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

787
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,989
Thank you for having me. I
am sorry if I insulted you.

788
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,041
It was not my intention.

789
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,402
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

790
01:06:51,403 --> 01:06:53,562
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

791
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,646
- Dad.
- Yeah?

792
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,963
Well, that was something.

793
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,329
I am sorry. You know I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

794
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,006
No, I wouldn't have
let him arrest you.

795
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,166
- What happened to your face?
- I want to tell you something.

796
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,166
Okay.

797
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,320
I have been bitten..

798
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,327
So have I.

799
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,925
Okay.

800
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,760
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. I
got to tell you this one thing.

801
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,114
I got to tell you this
thing about the vigilante

802
01:07:47,127 --> 01:07:49,490
and the car thief. Alright.
Oh, okay.

803
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:51,243
What?

804
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:53,561
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

805
01:07:53,562 --> 01:07:55,323
Okay, no. Forget that. I am
not going to talk about that.

806
01:07:55,324 --> 01:07:57,641
- I am going to talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

807
01:07:57,642 --> 01:08:01,485
It's important. I
wish I could just..

808
01:08:01,486 --> 01:08:02,845
I can't. It's hard to say.

809
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:06,168
Just say it. I don't know.
Say it.

810
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,120
What? What?

811
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,090
What?

812
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,769
Okay, then forget it.

813
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,971
You..?

814
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,288
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

815
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,525
Gwen?

816
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,006
Gwen..

817
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,527
Your father wants you to come inside.
Right away. Okay. Okay? Yeah.

818
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,200
Gwen.

819
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:59,964
I am coming.

820
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,919
Oh, I am in trouble.

821
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,249
Will you please go and find
out what is going on, Alfred?

822
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,208
Excellent.

823
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,022
Hey.

824
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,071
Hey. What is that? Oh, my God.
I don't know.

825
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:16,765
Get back in the car.

826
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,571
Help.

827
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,442
Help.

828
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,048
Incoming..

829
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,339
Somebody help.

830
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,244
Help me. My kid is trapped.

831
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,726
I want my dad.

832
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,561
Dad. Hey, hey, hey. Help.
Hey, buddy. It's okay.

833
01:11:42,574 --> 01:11:45,105
Get away. It's all right.

834
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:46,601
- Help..
- Hey, look.

835
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,889
Just a normal guy, all right?

836
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,362
Want to hold this?

837
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,762
Hold my mask.

838
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,247
All right.

839
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,130
What's your name?

840
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:00,042
Jack?

841
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,524
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

842
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,523
Okay, stay very still.

843
01:12:05,524 --> 01:12:06,487
All right.

844
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,846
Okay, I got you.

845
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,503
Okay, now look. I am
going to undo the belt.

846
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:14,949
You hold on..

847
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,567
to that seat in front of you.
Okay. On three?

848
01:12:16,568 --> 01:12:19,871
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

849
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,487
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

850
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:25,290
All right, okay.

851
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,370
Jack, climb now. I can't.
Yes, you can.

852
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,442
Put it on, the mask.

853
01:12:48,443 --> 01:12:49,965
It's going to make you strong.

854
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,805
Jack, trust me.

855
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:52,882
Put it on.

856
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,400
There you go. That's it. That's it, buddy.
That's it. Okay, now, climb.

857
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:58,527
Come on, Jack.

858
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,365
Do me a favour. A little
faster, okay, bud?

859
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,840
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

860
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,046
That's it. Keep coming.

861
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:09,564
Keep it coming.

862
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:10,721
Keep coming.

863
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,886
No..

864
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,569
Jack. Oh, God.

865
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,165
Thank God.

866
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,086
You okay?

867
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,911
- My son.
- My son.

868
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,280
Oh, my son.

869
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,124
My son.

870
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,441
Who are you?

871
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,205
Spider-Man.

872
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,249
Beautiful.

873
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,000
Settle down, guys.

874
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:48,609
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

875
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,841
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately..

876
01:14:50,842 --> 01:14:54,322
9 p.m. last night, an incident took
place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

877
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,403
Much of what occurred
is merely speculation..

878
01:14:56,404 --> 01:14:59,444
at this point. However,
several eyewitnesses..

879
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:01,771
to the crime, as well
as our own preliminary

880
01:15:01,784 --> 01:15:04,120
findings, have
positively placed one..

881
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:05,883
individual at the scene.

882
01:15:05,884 --> 01:15:07,450
Which is why, this morning..

883
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:08,964
I am issuing an arrest warrant..

884
01:15:08,965 --> 01:15:13,329
for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.

885
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,560
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials..

886
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:23,924
in the first of four
meetings scheduled..

887
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,650
It's so beautiful.

888
01:15:31,651 --> 01:15:33,563
Knows how to bite though.

889
01:15:33,564 --> 01:15:35,403
Who else knows about this?

890
01:15:35,404 --> 01:15:36,401
Just you.

891
01:15:36,402 --> 01:15:37,766
Really?

892
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,963
Hey, you don't, you don't..

893
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,160
You don't believe what the
police are saying, do you?

894
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,445
Of course not.

895
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,685
Does it scare you?

896
01:15:50,686 --> 01:15:52,604
What you can do?

897
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,286
No.

898
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,407
No.

899
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,362
What did that thing on
the bridge look like?

900
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,247
It was real big. Too
big to be human.

901
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,170
You got to lay low.
No, can't do that.

902
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:09,850
You have got to.

903
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,085
I mean, why..?

904
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,766
Because of last, last night.

905
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:16,542
Those people on the bridge.

906
01:16:16,543 --> 01:16:20,846
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

907
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,844
So.. I got to go after it.

908
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,281
That's not your job.

909
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,165
Maybe it is.

910
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,770
I really liked kissing you.

911
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,625
And you're an amazing kisser.

912
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,203
Well, you know, it was..
It was good for me too.

913
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,330
Yeah?

914
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,941
Who did that?

915
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,247
Hello.

916
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,608
It's not nice to snoop.

917
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,209
I gave everyone the week off.

918
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,009
Yeah.

919
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,486
Shouldn't you be at school?

920
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,203
No, I got a free track. I
wanted to ask you a question.

921
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,279
How would a predator
track a reptile?

922
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:56,525
Oh, they don't. Most reptiles are at the
top of their respective food chain.

923
01:17:56,526 --> 01:17:58,124
Kings of their domain.

924
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,724
They got to have
vulnerabilities, right.

925
01:17:59,725 --> 01:18:02,360
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

926
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,959
Just asking a question.

927
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,850
I got school stuff.

928
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,922
Biology profiles to do.

929
01:18:11,923 --> 01:18:16,482
So because of the cold blood would they
react to sudden changes in temperatures?

930
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,570
You'd have to catch one first.

931
01:18:18,571 --> 01:18:22,002
Did you know there's a rumor
of a new species in New York?

932
01:18:22,003 --> 01:18:23,995
Beautiful and quite large.

933
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,608
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

934
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:28,683
No, it's not yet classified.

935
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,443
But it can be aggressive..

936
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,202
if threatened.

937
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,845
Doc, you all right?

938
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:46,525
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

939
01:18:46,526 --> 01:18:50,970
Now, if you will excuse me. Afraid I have
to ask you to leave. I have a new project..

940
01:18:50,971 --> 01:18:53,441
I am working on. I
need to be alone.

941
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,524
- Good. Good, good.
- Good.

942
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,890
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I will be back.

943
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,888
Wonderful things are coming.

944
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,809
Wonderful things.

945
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,000
Fred?

946
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,727
Mr. Mayor, I can assure you
if there was a giant dinosaur

947
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:32,280
running around the streets of Manhattan
you would be the first to know.

948
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:34,885
So tell your son he can
rest easy, all right?

949
01:19:34,886 --> 01:19:37,007
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

950
01:19:37,008 --> 01:19:39,287
Okay. Bye-bye.

951
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:43,163
Mr. Parker, why are you not in school?
Got a free track.

952
01:19:43,164 --> 01:19:45,885
Okay, well, I do not have a free track.
So make your point quickly.

953
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:48,326
Okay. Fine, there may not be a
dinosaur running around Manhattan.

954
01:19:48,327 --> 01:19:50,686
But there is something more
dangerous, and I know who it is.

955
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:53,850
You know who it is? Dr. Curtis Connors.
Of Oscorp? He's a biochemist.

956
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:55,975
That's right. Okay. Dr. Curtis
Connors who's also my

957
01:19:55,988 --> 01:19:58,122
daughter's mentor. Is that
who you're talking about?

958
01:19:58,123 --> 01:19:58,840
- That's the one.
- Okay.

959
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:02,162
You know recently, Dr. Connors gave
Gwen a glowing college recommendation.

960
01:20:02,163 --> 01:20:04,287
It was beautiful. When
I read it, I cried.

961
01:20:04,288 --> 01:20:06,921
But you would have me believe
that he in his spare time..

962
01:20:06,922 --> 01:20:08,807
is running around dressed
up like a giant dinosaur?

963
01:20:08,808 --> 01:20:12,987
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur. He has
transformed himself into a giant lizard.

964
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,089
Let me ask you a question.

965
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:20,243
Do I look like the
mayor of Tokyo to you?

966
01:20:20,244 --> 01:20:22,766
I am telling you the
absolute truth.

967
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:25,643
This man has worked for his whole
life on cross-species genetics.

968
01:20:25,644 --> 01:20:27,511
He lost one arm, he tried
to grow it back, but

969
01:20:27,524 --> 01:20:29,401
there was something imbalance
about the equation.

970
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:31,926
And he has turned into a full lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

971
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,640
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

972
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:38,167
Okay. All right, I get it.

973
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,001
Here's what we are going to do.

974
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,130
You are going to go back to hanging
out with the citizens of Tokyo.

975
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:47,527
And I am going to go back to protecting the
citizens of this fine, fair city of ours.

976
01:20:47,528 --> 01:20:49,841
Sergeant Butler, would you
please escort Mr. Parker..

977
01:20:49,842 --> 01:20:52,843
back to school. Captain Stacy,
I am not messing around.

978
01:20:52,844 --> 01:20:55,923
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

979
01:20:55,924 --> 01:21:00,362
He is a danger to everybody. Just,
please, listen to me. Let's go.

980
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,406
Jimmy.

981
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,248
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

982
01:21:09,261 --> 01:21:11,959
Okay? Right away. Yeah.

983
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,168
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

984
01:21:38,169 --> 01:21:41,370
Current temperature: 89.7,
steady for 48 hours.

985
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:45,684
Blood panels reveal lymphocyte and monocyte
readings consistent with subject's past.

986
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,803
Clotting rate vastly improved.

987
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:54,404
Marked enhancement..

988
01:21:54,405 --> 01:21:55,845
in muscle response..

989
01:21:55,846 --> 01:21:57,331
strength and elasticity.

990
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,841
Eyesight similarly improved.

991
01:22:06,842 --> 01:22:09,901
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

992
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,879
This is no longer
about curing ills.

993
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,407
This is about
finding perfection.

994
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,012
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse

995
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:34,047
dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

996
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,944
You stopped me once.

997
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,921
You won't stop me again.

998
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,530
I am getting stronger every day.

999
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,170
Oh, that sucked.

1000
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,724
Peter Parker.

1001
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:23,870
Come in.

1002
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,724
You should maybe consider
coming in through the lobby.

1003
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,403
Also, my father is
under the impression..

1004
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:38,845
that you require psychiatric attention.
Oh, really? Peter.

1005
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,766
What happened? What happened?
You should see the other guy.

1006
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,763
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1007
01:25:47,764 --> 01:25:51,961
Hey, Gwen, honey. Do you want cocoa?
Howard's making some cocoa.

1008
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,924
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1009
01:25:56,925 --> 01:25:58,683
Honestly, I am 17 years old.

1010
01:25:58,684 --> 01:25:59,247
Okay.

1011
01:25:59,248 --> 01:26:01,307
I just thought, I remembered
somebody saying last

1012
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,390
week her fantasy was to
live in a chocolate house.

1013
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,250
Well, that's impractical.

1014
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:06,765
And fattening.

1015
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,927
Chocolate house.

1016
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,444
Sorry, Dad. It's good. I just, I can't..
have cocoa right now because I am working..

1017
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:21,369
I am doing this..

1018
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:23,090
I have cramps.

1019
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,271
I feel kind of pukey and just
sort of like, emotional.

1020
01:26:26,284 --> 01:26:28,646
It's okay. I keep crying.
Good. Good.

1021
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:30,050
It's brutal.

1022
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,445
You don't want to know. I got it.
Trust me, it's, like, bad.

1023
01:26:33,446 --> 01:26:35,489
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1024
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:03,965
Easy, Bug Boy.
What'd you call me?

1025
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:13,366
I am going to be all right.
No. No. Yes. Yes.

1026
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,080
I know what this is.

1027
01:27:17,081 --> 01:27:18,526
What is it?

1028
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,443
Every day, for as long as I
can remember, my father..

1029
01:27:22,444 --> 01:27:26,730
has left every morning and he's
put a badge on his chest..

1030
01:27:26,731 --> 01:27:29,087
and strapped a gun to his hip.

1031
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,626
And every day, for as
long as I can remember..

1032
01:27:33,627 --> 01:27:36,947
I haven't known if he was
going to make it home.

1033
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,364
I got you.

1034
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,686
Okay?

1035
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:52,947
Okay?

1036
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,762
I got to stop him, though.

1037
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,210
I have to, because
I created him.

1038
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,771
What do you mean?

1039
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,122
I gave him an equation..

1040
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,608
that made all of this possible.

1041
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,684
Something my father had
been working on, you know.

1042
01:28:22,685 --> 01:28:25,730
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1043
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,767
Point is, this is
my responsibility.

1044
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,042
I have to fix it.

1045
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,604
Peter.

1046
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,250
Hey.

1047
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,447
Let's get out of here.

1048
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,328
Let's just get out of here.

1049
01:28:50,329 --> 01:28:54,688
Just for a minute. Can we?
No. No. Yeah. Yes.

1050
01:28:54,689 --> 01:28:59,801
Yes. No. Yes. If my parents
see me leaving, I am dead.

1051
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,502
Your parents aren't going
to see you leaving.

1052
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,569
Peter Parker.

1053
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:22,324
Spider-Man.

1054
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,759
I am not the one who needs help.

1055
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,130
There will be no more
loneliness no more outcasts.

1056
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:35,327
Species-wide distribution could enhance
humanity on an evolutionary scale.

1057
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,001
One has to adapt to survive.

1058
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,850
"That, changing like the
snake, I might be free..

1059
01:29:43,851 --> 01:29:47,481
to cast off flesh wherein
I dwell confined."

1060
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:51,761
Would you give it all up after
all you know you can do?

1061
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,446
All the power you feel.

1062
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,047
I can save them.

1063
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,950
You are not going to get in the
way of my plan Peter Parker.

1064
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,966
Go. Go.

1065
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,163
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1066
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,649
All these souls lost and alone. I
can save them. I can cure them.

1067
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:38,367
There's no need
to stop me Peter.

1068
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,522
You're not thinking
straight, doc.

1069
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,650
Stop this. This isn't you.

1070
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,522
Let's talk this out.

1071
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,328
Doc.

1072
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,161
Oh, boy.

1073
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:15,521
Alright. You don't want to talk?

1074
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,810
There you go.

1075
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,441
Don't..

1076
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,846
make me.. have to..

1077
01:32:25,847 --> 01:32:27,242
hurt you.

1078
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,086
That is disgusting.

1079
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,851
Gwen.

1080
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,628
I am going to throw you out
the window, now. What?

1081
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,564
Somebody's been a bad lizard.

1082
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,321
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City..

1083
01:34:14,322 --> 01:34:18,802
Police Department. We have got
this building surrounded.

1084
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:28,723
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go.

1085
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:42,166
- Hey. Where are you?
- I am fine. I am okay.

1086
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:45,562
I am down the sewer. I am tracking him. I
got to stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1087
01:34:45,563 --> 01:34:46,800
But we need an antidote.

1088
01:34:46,801 --> 01:34:48,358
Do you know how to run a serum?
Yeah, I do it

1089
01:34:48,371 --> 01:34:49,939
for Connors all the time.
OK, great, great. OK.

1090
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:51,920
Listen, I need you
to go to Oscorp.

1091
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:53,433
I need you to access the
cross-species file.

1092
01:34:53,446 --> 01:34:54,969
It's a blue serum.

1093
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:58,366
File 12389. Okay, got it.

1094
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:00,204
On my way.

1095
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,881
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness..

1096
01:35:33,882 --> 01:35:36,121
without outcasts.

1097
01:35:36,122 --> 01:35:40,222
I sought to create a stronger human
being but there's no such thing.

1098
01:35:40,223 --> 01:35:45,763
Human beings are weak, pathetic,
feeble-minded creatures.

1099
01:35:45,764 --> 01:35:49,647
Why be human at all when
we can be so much more?

1100
01:35:49,648 --> 01:35:53,524
Faster. Stronger. Smarter.

1101
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:56,411
This is my gift to you.

1102
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,164
Oscorp.

1103
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,600
- Captain Stacy.
- What?

1104
01:36:09,601 --> 01:36:11,926
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed..

1105
01:36:11,927 --> 01:36:14,207
toward Canal Street Station.
What about Spider-Man?

1106
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:17,523
Inside the high school. I want
that Spider-Man off the street.

1107
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,524
The lizard creature has
released a biological agent.

1108
01:38:02,525 --> 01:38:05,247
All efforts to stop him
have failed and he

1109
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,993
is now proceeding north
on 7th Avenue. Over.

1110
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,919
- Hi. Hey. Where are you?
- Peter, hi. I am at Oscorp.

1111
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,563
You have to get out of
there right now. Okay.

1112
01:38:15,564 --> 01:38:18,006
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no. Connors..

1113
01:38:18,007 --> 01:38:20,526
is on the way. He's
coming to you right now.

1114
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:23,125
He needs the device. He's going
to infect the whole city.

1115
01:38:23,126 --> 01:38:24,205
Eight minutes left.

1116
01:38:24,206 --> 01:38:25,594
You're going to wait there
for 8 minutes after

1117
01:38:25,607 --> 01:38:27,005
what I just told you?
People are going to die.

1118
01:38:27,006 --> 01:38:29,600
You leave right now.
That is an order, okay?

1119
01:38:29,601 --> 01:38:32,404
I will get everybody out.
Did you hear what?

1120
01:38:32,405 --> 01:38:35,784
Gwen. Gwen. You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1121
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,446
He's heading south.

1122
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,682
Stand down now, or
we will open fire.

1123
01:39:04,683 --> 01:39:07,965
You are surrounded.
There is no escape.

1124
01:39:07,966 --> 01:39:09,465
Go, go.

1125
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,490
Clear.

1126
01:40:10,491 --> 01:40:11,721
Clear up top.

1127
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,685
Clear, sir.

1128
01:40:14,686 --> 01:40:15,966
All clear here, sir.

1129
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,890
Freeze.

1130
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,645
Down on the ground.

1131
01:40:43,646 --> 01:40:46,931
Your hands behind your head.
Now.

1132
01:40:50,161 --> 01:40:51,572
Parker.

1133
01:40:53,361 --> 01:40:56,767
It's headed to Oscorp. And your
daughter's there right now.

1134
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,240
You got to let me go.

1135
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:24,968
Hold your fire.

1136
01:41:31,761 --> 01:41:34,161
Well, Paul, if I didn't see
it, I wouldn't believe it.

1137
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:36,841
I won't venture to say exactly
what it is that's crawling up..

1138
01:41:36,842 --> 01:41:38,642
the north side of
the Oscorp Tower..

1139
01:41:38,643 --> 01:41:41,930
but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1140
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:59,483
Time remaining: one minute.

1141
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,442
Antidote complete.

1142
01:43:23,561 --> 01:43:25,834
Oh, man. We're now getting
the latest details.

1143
01:43:25,847 --> 01:43:28,130
This is just coming in.

1144
01:43:28,131 --> 01:43:31,962
The New York Police Department has
called for a city-wide evacuation..

1145
01:43:31,963 --> 01:43:34,799
everything south of 54th Street.

1146
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,647
If you are south of 54th Street, you have
to move out of the area immediately.

1147
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,599
Spider-Man appears to be
heading towards Oscorp.

1148
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,491
He looks injured and it's really not
clear if he's going to make it.

1149
01:43:54,492 --> 01:43:57,170
That's the guy who saved
my boy on the bridge.

1150
01:43:57,171 --> 01:43:58,650
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1151
01:43:58,651 --> 01:44:01,120
Something bad's going
down in Midtown. Hey.

1152
01:44:01,121 --> 01:44:03,759
You still friends with Matthews, that
crane operator down on 6th Avenue?

1153
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,762
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1154
01:44:05,763 --> 01:44:07,921
The cops are evacuating everybody.
Who the hell cares?

1155
01:44:07,922 --> 01:44:10,208
Get him on the phone for me.

1156
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,405
Hey, Charlie, get me
Enrique: on 54th Street.

1157
01:44:29,406 --> 01:44:31,761
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1158
01:44:31,762 --> 01:44:34,162
Wolski. You're getting
some overtime.

1159
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,168
All tower cranes on 6th..

1160
01:44:37,169 --> 01:44:40,880
swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1161
01:44:40,881 --> 01:44:43,480
Spider-Man needs those big
boys high and lined up.

1162
01:44:43,481 --> 01:44:45,608
Let's give him a clear approach.
Over.

1163
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,564
Come on, Parker.

1164
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,243
Hey.

1165
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,701
Dad. I have to get this to Spider-Man.
Get in the car. Let's go.

1166
01:47:14,702 --> 01:47:16,723
- No, no. It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1167
01:47:16,724 --> 01:47:19,644
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

1168
01:47:19,645 --> 01:47:21,961
Your boyfriend is a
man of many masks.

1169
01:47:21,962 --> 01:47:23,245
I get it.

1170
01:47:23,246 --> 01:47:24,446
Give me this.

1171
01:47:24,447 --> 01:47:26,364
Get in the car.

1172
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,802
Please make sure he's okay.

1173
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,689
Initializing Ganali device.

1174
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:50,730
Detonation in T-minus
two minutes.

1175
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,086
Poor Peter Parker.

1176
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,801
No mother, no father..

1177
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,564
no uncle.

1178
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,489
All alone.

1179
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,647
He's not alone.

1180
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:45,200
Detonation in
T-minus 45 seconds.

1181
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:54,569
Hey. Gift from Gwen.

1182
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,971
- I got this, Peter.
- Go.

1183
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:07,306
T-minus.. 30 seconds.

1184
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:27,250
Detonation in
T-minus 10 seconds.

1185
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:28,647
Nine.

1186
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,289
Eight.

1187
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:32,771
Seven.

1188
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,480
Six.

1189
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:36,480
Five.

1190
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:37,843
Four.

1191
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,727
Three.

1192
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,049
Two.

1193
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,369
One.

1194
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,830
No..

1195
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,870
No..

1196
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,281
The captain.

1197
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,205
Captain.

1198
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,124
The Lizard.

1199
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:30,962
It's okay.

1200
01:52:30,963 --> 01:52:32,281
We stopped him.

1201
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:36,802
Okay. Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

1202
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,565
Okay, okay, okay.

1203
01:52:38,566 --> 01:52:40,130
Look at me. Stay with me.

1204
01:52:40,131 --> 01:52:42,281
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to..

1205
01:52:42,282 --> 01:52:45,807
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1206
01:52:45,808 --> 01:52:47,245
Okay?

1207
01:52:47,246 --> 01:52:48,640
I am not going anywhere.

1208
01:52:49,201 --> 01:52:51,522
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1209
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,690
This city needs you.

1210
01:52:55,601 --> 01:52:57,125
Here.

1211
01:52:57,126 --> 01:52:58,906
You're going to need this.

1212
01:53:02,341 --> 01:53:04,530
You're going to make enemies.

1213
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,604
People will get hurt.

1214
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,363
Sometimes the people
closest to you.

1215
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,993
So, I want you to promise
me something, okay?

1216
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:23,121
Leave Gwen out of it.

1217
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,130
Promise me that.

1218
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,124
You promise me.

1219
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:48,127
An eerie calm has set
in over New York City.

1220
01:54:48,128 --> 01:54:52,669
Apparently, some sort of aerosolised
antidote was launched from Oscorp..

1221
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:55,803
Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

1222
01:54:55,804 --> 01:54:58,803
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully..

1223
01:54:58,804 --> 01:55:01,082
knowing that the alleged
mastermind of this terror..

1224
01:55:01,083 --> 01:55:04,522
plot, Dr. Curtis
Connors, is behind bars.

1225
01:55:04,523 --> 01:55:08,481
We have got John Niles on the street
for a report in Lower Manhattan.

1226
01:55:08,482 --> 01:55:10,607
John, what do you see?

1227
01:55:10,608 --> 01:55:12,607
[INDISTINCT TV CHATTERING]

1228
01:55:12,608 --> 01:55:15,608
[INDISTINCT TV
CHATTERING CONTINUES]

1229
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:44,088
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1230
01:55:46,161 --> 01:55:47,970
It's all right.

1231
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,365
It's all right.

1232
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,762
Rough night.

1233
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,364
It's going to be all right.

1234
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,570
Where have you been?

1235
01:56:51,441 --> 01:56:52,191
Hi.

1236
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,170
My father died.

1237
01:57:02,961 --> 01:57:04,645
There was a funeral.

1238
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,326
They shot off..

1239
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,891
rifles and they made speeches.

1240
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,169
Two of my teachers showed up.

1241
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:19,851
And Flash showed up.

1242
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,086
Everyone was there but you.

1243
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,128
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1244
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:48,764
I am sorry. I can't..
What are you saying?

1245
01:57:48,765 --> 01:57:50,684
I can't see you anymore.

1246
01:57:52,561 --> 01:57:53,972
I can't.

1247
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,443
He made you promise, didn't he?

1248
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,001
To stay away from
me, so I'd be safe.

1249
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:56,485
- What a pretty girl.
- Yeah.

1250
01:58:56,486 --> 01:58:58,369
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1251
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,964
Did you ask her out?

1252
01:59:04,561 --> 01:59:05,847
Why?

1253
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,291
Can't.

1254
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,851
Why?

1255
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:14,970
I am just no good for her.

1256
01:59:18,001 --> 01:59:21,923
Peter Parker, if there's one
thing you are, it's good.

1257
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,250
Anyone has a problem with
that can talk to me.

1258
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:46,480
Peter, I know things have
been difficult lately..

1259
01:59:46,481 --> 01:59:48,642
and I am sorry about that.

1260
01:59:49,041 --> 01:59:51,884
I think I know what
you're feeling.

1261
01:59:51,885 --> 01:59:54,219
Ever since you were
a little boy..

1262
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:58,924
you have been living with
so many unresolved things.

1263
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,287
Well, take it from an old man:

1264
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:05,809
Those things send
us down a road.

1265
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:08,206
They make us who we are.

1266
02:00:08,207 --> 02:00:13,480
And if anyone's destined for
greatness, it's you, son.

1267
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,361
You owe the world your gifts.

1268
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,685
You just have to figure
out how to use them.

1269
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:25,767
And know that wherever they take
you we will always be here.

1270
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,040
So come on home, Peter.

1271
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,643
You're my hero.

1272
02:00:31,644 --> 02:00:33,245
And I love you.

1273
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:44,531
- What's up, Parker? What's up?
- Hey. How's it going?

1274
02:00:44,532 --> 02:00:46,771
You coming along, man?

1275
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:49,088
Cool shirt.

1276
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,960
Yeah.

1277
02:00:51,961 --> 02:00:53,564
Dude's crazy.

1278
02:00:53,565 --> 02:00:55,051
But chicks dig him.

1279
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:00,726
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1280
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,164
I had a professor once who liked
to tell his students that..

1281
02:01:12,165 --> 02:01:15,449
there were only 10 different
plots in all of fiction.

1282
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:18,361
Well, I am here to
tell you he was wrong.

1283
02:01:18,362 --> 02:01:19,885
There is only one:

1284
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,205
"Who am I"?

1285
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,722
Mr. Parker.

1286
02:01:24,723 --> 02:01:25,847
Tardy again.

1287
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,483
Well, at least we can
always count on you.

1288
02:01:29,484 --> 02:01:32,090
Sorry, Miss Ritter, won't
happen again, I promise.

1289
02:01:32,091 --> 02:01:34,442
Don't make promises you
can't keep Mr. Parker.

1290
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:38,681
Yeah, but those are
the best kind.

1291
02:01:38,682 --> 02:01:40,603
Okay, class, open your books.

1292
02:01:40,604 --> 02:01:42,683
Let's begin on page one.

1293
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,239
Hello, doctor.

1294
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:34,685
Did you tell the boy?

1295
02:04:34,686 --> 02:04:35,840
Tell him what?

1296
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:39,997
Did you tell the boy the
truth about his father?

1297
02:04:41,201 --> 02:04:43,725
No. Well, that's very good.

1298
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:46,162
So we will let him be for now.

1299
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,162
You should leave him alone.
