3
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:21,681
<i>It's me, Peter Parker.
The helpful neighbor...</i>

4
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:25,731
<i>I have a long way since
I was bitten by a spider...</i>

5
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:33,552
<i>When nothing seemed to go right,
but now... people love me.</i>

6
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:37,962
<i>It starts soon!</i>

7
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,579
<i>Everyone feels safe.
I think I have a part in it.</i>

8
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,987
<i>Uncle Sam would be proud.</i>

9
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,311
<i>- I go to school yet. Top of the class.
- This shows us-</i>

10
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,420
- The energy levels are disturbed
of tension...

11
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:07,836
The shape of this
matrix, we can see...

12
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,951
- Ms. Stacy.
- The only M = 0 quantity has impact.

13
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:17,360
Right! Good job, Ms. Stacy.

14
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:26,483
- Do you have something to add, Parker?
- No, sir.

15
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:32,942
<i>I'm in love with my dream girl.</i>

16
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,115
AVAILABLE FOR INSTALLMENT

17
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,053
Ms. Watson put aside a
ticket for me. Peter Parker.

18
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,283
I'm so nervous.

19
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:34,411
She is my girlfriend.

20
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,925
- I thought she was good.
- Yes.

21
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,904
Harry... Harry!
I have to talk to you.

22
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,392
So that I can explain.

23
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:05,663
Tell that to my father.
Revive him.

24
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:11,850
I am your friend, Harry...
I cared about your father.

25
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:23,507
- MJ Congratulations!
- Peter.

26
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:28,661
- Was I good?
- You were great.

27
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,108
I love flowers.
Those are from Harry. Was he here?

28
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:38,646
- I ran into him.
- What is it with you?

29
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:42,358
- It's complicated.
- Tell me again that I was great.

30
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:47,420
I was so nervous that my knees were shaking.
The applause was not as high.

31
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:53,221
Well, it depends on the acoustics. Diffusion
prevents Ijudvågorna to propagate.

32
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:58,303
- When Ijudvågorna moves forward...
- You're such a dork.

33
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,948
Did you see it?

34
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:11,035
I would like to sing in the rest of
my life with you in the front row.

35
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,620
I will be sitting there.

36
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:18,269
Tell me you love me.

37
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:25,850
I love you.
I love you so much.

38
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,178
I've always done.

39
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,044
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

40
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,278
RETURNED MAIL

41
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:17,414
- You can not hide here, Flint.
- I just want to see my daughter.

42
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:22,014
You are a prisoner on the run.
Police are looking for you.

43
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:27,445
You will not be near her.
You are simply a thief.

44
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,572
- You may have murdered a man.
- It was not so.

45
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,745
I had good reason. It's true.

46
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,019
You and the truth is in prison
and get three meals a day MAI.

47
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:47,302
I live a life of genuine truth.
The truth did you leave behind you.

48
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,471
Inside the bedroom.

49
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,357
- I missed you, Betty.
- I missed you too, Dad.

50
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,349
I promise that I will
to make you healthy.

51
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,426
- I'll get the money.
- Get out of here right away.

52
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,375
I'm not a bad person.

53
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,528
I've just been unlucky.

54
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,913
- What is it, Peter?
- It's MJ

55
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,777
I intend to marry him.

56
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:24,638
I was so scared and excited
When Ben proposed to me.

57
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:30,957
And very young.
But I loved him so much.

58
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:36,774
- You said well yes?
- No. We were not ready.

59
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:46,946
So we took our time. Looked forward to it.
We could not just rely on charity.

60
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:55,561
A man must be understanding.
His wife should come before anything else.

61
00:14:55,676 --> 00:15:01,932
- Can you do that, Peter?
- I think so.

62
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,820
Then you have my blessing.

63
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:12,428
I hope you have found
a good place to free on.

64
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:16,754
Your uncle had planned everything.
He took me to the beach.

65
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:22,706
He was really great in their swimwear.
I did not look so bad yourself.

66
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,889
We were good at swimming.
It was a beautiful day and he said:

67
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:30,745
"If we can not swim to the island?"
When we got there...

68
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:36,256
... We found a perfect location next to
an old tree. We lay us down...

69
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:44,585
Then he said: "Close your eyes, May."
Then he said: "Open them."

70
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:54,177
Then he held in this ring.
It glittered in front of me.

71
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:00,283
I thought it was the sun.

72
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,837
We had been married for 50 years
in August, if not...

73
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:23,466
So... I hope you make it
very special for Mary Jane.

74
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,322
Do something that she will never forget.

75
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,802
Give her this.

76
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:37,148
Come on, take it.

77
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:56,601
- Harry...
- You knew this was waiting, Pete.

78
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:03,107
I did not kill your father.

79
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,796
He tried to kill me but killed himself.

80
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,810
I'm still here, Peter.

81
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,489
I hate those things.

82
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:18,997
Harry?

83
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,675
Harry?

84
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,241
Oh my God...

85
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:42,232
Harry!

86
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,700
- Exceptions.
- No reaction.

87
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:03,175
- We will try again. Away.
- No reaction.

88
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,113
One more time! Move!

89
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:15,789
- Police Commissioner Stacy.
- What is it?

90
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:20,676
Flint Marko who was involved in
the murder of Ben Parker. He has escaped.

91
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:25,042
He is in the research.
I think we have him.

92
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:30,537
There he is!

93
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,489
WARNING!
Testing ground for Particle Physics

94
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:58,232
Where'd he go?

95
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:25,763
- It is uploaded.
- Silicone mass has changed.

96
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,419
It is probably a bird
flying away when we get started it.

97
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:01,678
- How is he.
- He can handle himself.

98
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:06,509
He suffers from memory loss.
Especially short-term memory.

99
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:10,707
He does not remember accident
or something happened to him recently.

100
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,323
- Is it permanent?
- Maybe. Only time will tell.

101
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:19,721
- He is awake, if you want to meet him?
- Maybe I should wait?

102
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:23,597
Was not there a long time only,
he must be rested.

103
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,356
- Hey, buddy.
- Hello.

104
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:52,045
I have been struck in the head.
I was in an accident, the doctor said.

105
00:25:52,451 --> 00:26:01,461
I will hardly remember anything.
My father is dead, right?

106
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,852
Everything feels so strange.

107
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:11,146
Hello. I came as fast as I could.

108
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:14,007
- You know me again.
- How are you?

109
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:24,244
- The last I remember...
- We love you, Harry.

110
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:30,723
It feels like... I have
been gone a very long time.

111
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:37,595
- Now I'm home again.
- It's nice to have you back.

112
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,795
- Excuse me, but you have to go.
- Sure.

113
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:48,194
- We see you tomorrow?
- Of course.

114
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:59,232
I think he will be fine
and you seem to be up again.

115
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:07,576
- You have wonderful friends.
- They are my best friends.

116
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,832
I would sacrifice my life for them.

117
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:17,275
"Restaurant Constellation."
"Monday 19:30."

118
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:23,481
- Yes?
- It's me.

119
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:30,500
- I can not open the door.
- Has it got stuck again?

120
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:33,852
- Come and help me.
- I will.

121
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:44,619
Review. They hated me.

122
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:48,007
- They can not.
- "Young ms Watson" -

123
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:51,373
- "You can rest your eyes on
but not the ears. "

124
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,273
"Her thin voice reached
not past the first line. "

125
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:57,655
- Ridiculous, I was there.
- You sat in the front row.

126
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:02,743
Yes, but... You were great.
It's just a critic.

127
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:07,200
You have to get used to this.
Believe me, I know.

128
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:11,336
- Spider-Man hit by it all the time.
- This is not about you.

129
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:15,829
- It's all about me and my career.
- Yes, I know. You can not just let...

130
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:21,871
... It beat you down. Believe in yourself,
and you're up on the horse's back soon...

131
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:26,205
Do not talk on horseback!
Try to understand how I feel.

132
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,788
It's just that...

133
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:40,882
When I read this...
it seems to be written by my father.

134
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:46,222
<i>All cars near 54th
and Sixth Avenue.</i>

135
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:50,444
<i>Uncontrolled crane.
Draw close with caution.</i>

136
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,795
<i>Take them by storm, tiger?</i>

137
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:58,689
Sorry.

138
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,337
Crane job is bigger than we thought.
We need backup immediately.

139
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:58,009
Gwen, I have a secret.
It's my copier.

140
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:03,297
What makes it there in my background?

141
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:33,212
- They can not stop the crane.
- Call the Edison!

142
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:35,599
Tell them to break
power to the entire block.

143
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:41,028
- Are you all right?
- Here it comes again!

144
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:10,811
- Good God. It's Gwen.
- What?

145
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:20,722
- What is she doing up there?
- She said something yesterday about a modeling job.

146
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:24,197
- Who are you?
- Edward Brock Jr..

147
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:28,655
I work for the Daily Bugle...
and is dating your daughter.

148
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,072
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Just great.

149
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:33,615
Hey, Spidy! Bugle want a picture.
- Thank God you feel good.

150
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,974
- Hello. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?

151
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,266
- Are you okay?
- From now on, I take the cards for you.

152
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,858
Le. Do you smile? I am just kidding.

153
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,427
- Where is the other guy?
- Are you Parker?

154
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:52,612
Between me and you,
he is an amateur.

155
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,192
His stuff made you look a little...
puffy out. A little chubby.

156
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:04,179
You do not
to worry about anymore, buddy!

157
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,978
Dazzle me!

158
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:24,275
A small thing advertising guys
and I came up with.

159
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:28,721
Bugle has had a pretty good edition.
Not as good as the New York Times...

160
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:34,083
... Daily News or The Post or...
- Go on, you idiot!

161
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:38,672
Blood pressure, Mr. Jameson. Your wife
asked me to keep track of your anger.

162
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,657
Tell my wife...!

163
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:44,608
Thank you.

164
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:52,420
So I suggest this campaign,
"Daily Bugle", of course.

165
00:36:52,797 --> 00:36:56,380
"It's hip and relevant."
It occurred to me.

166
00:36:56,668 --> 00:37:01,324
"The 'wow'." It's Eric
after a few cups of coffee...

167
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:04,635
"And how." It was me again.

168
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:07,891
Time for your pills.

169
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,789
Not so. Not so.

170
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,503
Drink plenty of water.

171
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:29,385
Thank you.

172
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,175
Continue.

173
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:38,706
- He is busy.
- I am here for you, big guy.

174
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:42,905
- What's that smell?
- Something called "Nice and easy-trapped"

175
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,273
- What are you wearing?
- It's called "Embark"

176
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:50,181
It was the dumbest idea you've had
and you've had a lot of stupid...

177
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:52,885
You may not go in there!

178
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,740
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week.

179
00:37:57,438 --> 00:38:00,125
- What's that smell?
- Edward Brock Jr..

180
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,806
Nice shirt. A crane accident.
Check Ijussättningen.

181
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,463
- He likes my shirt.
- Hey, Pete. You better go in there.

182
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:11,112
The new guy trying to sell
Spideybilder.

183
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:14,751
Thank you.

184
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:18,181
Parks! You may come too late.
Bruckner, this was faster.

185
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,376
- I have it here.
- But he has this.

186
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:26,920
- How could you take it so high?
- Climbed on a flagpole. Almost fell.

187
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,853
- A flag pole?
- What should we use?

188
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,862
I like Bernstein.
Better and cheaper.

189
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:37,210
- Congratulations! You get $ 50 for the image.
- I'm your guy, JJ.

190
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:42,385
I know more about photography than most.
It's not about - do not be offended-

191
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,195
- Flagpoles, but Ijus,
composition and drama.

192
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:51,427
I want an editorial job.
I'm going to marry a girl-

193
00:38:51,987 --> 00:38:57,489
- I have a dream to work for the
best editor of all time.

194
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,688
J. Jonah Jameson.

195
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,393
We have a vacancy.
Johnson finished course.

196
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,574
- You kicked him.
- Wait a minute. I can shoot-

197
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:13,422
- And have been here long. Is there a
editorial job I deserve it.

198
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:16,041
He's right, Jonah.
Peter has worked for us for years.

199
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,193
- He has done a good job.
- You want the job both.

200
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:22,014
- No one cares about what I want?
- I do it.

201
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:26,800
I want people to see Spiderman
as the villain he is.

202
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:31,152
He is a scam and full of glue.
Take him in the act.

203
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:35,766
With your hand in the cookie jar.
Anyone who takes the picture gets the job.

204
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:38,286
Are you waiting for Chinese New Year?
Get out!

205
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,135
- The image, never.
- We'll see.

206
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:56,856
Spiderman MAY CITY KEY...
Save the life of police chief DAUGHTER

207
00:39:57,987 --> 00:40:02,708
I believe that a human
can mean a lot.

208
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,139
Enough said.

209
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:13,730
Welcome home, Harry.

210
00:40:15,057 --> 00:40:18,289
- Thank God you feel good.
- Thanks, Bernard.

211
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:25,333
I have a welcome home gift.

212
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:29,780
It's your old ball. Thanks, buddy.

213
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:33,597
- We were pretty good in the backyard.
- We were miserable.

214
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:37,693
- We tried to get into mixlaget.
- For cheerleading girls sake.

215
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,431
- Do I have any girlfriends?
- I do not know.

216
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:47,878
- Do I have any girlfriends, Bernard?
- Not that I know of.

217
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:56,838
- Pretty cool house, right?
- That's good enough.

218
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,860
- I seem to have plenty of money.
- Yes.

219
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:04,192
I think I can
change this with a girlfriend.

220
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:16,643
I appreciate how you helped
me through high school.

221
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:20,188
I wish I could remember more about him.

222
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:25,027
He loved you, that's the main thing.

223
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:30,043
We watch the match in the kitchen
and jaws something.

224
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:42,106
- Did you see that?
- You can move around still.

225
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:18,036
Why do you think?

226
00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:24,922
- What is she doing here?
- Gary would have called her agent.

227
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:30,554
Hello, darling. We have tried to reach you.
I am sorry.

228
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:34,875
- Because of a critic?
- No, because of all the papers.

229
00:42:35,027 --> 00:42:40,416
- Mary Jane, sit...
- We can say that you got sick.

230
00:42:50,675 --> 00:42:56,164
- It was so badly managed.
- Yes. Now we repeat.

231
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:50,228
- Sorry MS, I get a beautiful smile.
- Hi, Eddie.

232
00:43:51,146 --> 00:43:54,210
You are so beautiful.
These are the headlines.

233
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:56,980
- I have to practice. See you later.
- Tonight, perhaps.

234
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,637
- No, not tonight.
- Why not?

235
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,951
Think of the amazing night we had.

236
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,349
We drank coffee, Eddie.

237
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,987
Hey hottie! One more.

238
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,976
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just fine.

239
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,940
- You're not mad at me still?
- No, Peter. I'm proud of you.

240
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,762
I'm going to swing me up from there.
How do you know where to look.

241
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:31,610
- Give them a good show.
- Do not worry about that review.

242
00:44:31,644 --> 00:44:35,025
Tomorrow night we laugh about it.

243
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,094
- Is not he the one who ran away?
- The description is correct.

244
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,302
You! Stop!

245
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:15,460
Fire!

246
00:46:39,123 --> 00:46:44,210
Dear New Yorkers, I stand here today
because I fell 62 floors-

247
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:49,266
- And someone caught me.
Someone who never wants anything in return.

248
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:56,193
- Hey, MJ.
- Harry!

249
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,697
Where is Pete?

250
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:04,452
He was shooting, I think. It's so
nice to meet you. You look like you feel good.

251
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:08,403
I have never felt better. It is a
weird feeling not to know about New York.

252
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:13,092
- A slap in the head, one is free.
- Do you want to beat me in the head?

253
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,065
- Pete said that you sing in a musical.
- Yes, you were there. You gave me flowers.

254
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:27,217
- Did I? I am going tonight again.
- It can not. I have stopped.

255
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:29,065
What happened?

256
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:33,047
I was not very good.

257
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:38,063
This is embarrassing, but I
wrote a part for you in High School.

258
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:42,248
Did you? It was urgulligt.

259
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:46,804
I wonder, when the parachute does not
trips or when your business robbed-

260
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:50,876
- Or your house is burning,
who is it that captures your-

261
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:57,012
- Extinguish the fire and rescue your children?
- Spiderman!

262
00:47:57,137 --> 00:48:03,472
- They love me.
- For your friendly neighbor...

263
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:06,150
... Spiderman!

264
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:38,474
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him!

265
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,610
- Come on, kiss me just.
- Really?

266
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:44,976
- Yes, they love it.
- Kiss him!

267
00:48:56,847 --> 00:48:59,096
I hope Pete takes a card this.

268
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:07,871
- Are you okay?
- Yes, okay.

269
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:56,634
There's something on the roof!

270
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:23,753
- End of the fun, buddy.
- I do not want to hurt you. Leave me.

271
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:27,369
You have probably not heard
that I am the sheriff of these parts.

272
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,916
Where will all these guys come from?

273
00:52:28,193 --> 00:52:29,777
<i>Pardon!</i>

274
00:52:34,536 --> 00:52:38,086
<i>Bonsoir.
Le Monsieur Atila un reservation?</i>

275
00:52:39,438 --> 00:52:43,431
- Sorry, but I do not speak...
- Sure, this is a French restaurant?

276
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:46,398
Oui...?

277
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:49,958
- Name, please.
- Peter Parker.

278
00:52:53,277 --> 00:52:57,382
<i>We have you.
A table for two. Perk.</i>

279
00:52:58,684 --> 00:53:00,885
- Parker.
- That's what I said.

280
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:02,876
<i>Perk.</i>

281
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:10,903
I have a önskemåI. My girlfriend
come here and I have a ring.

282
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:21,661
Hello. You intend to ask the question tonight?

283
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:25,782
- Yes, and I want it to be special.
- I love it.

284
00:53:26,262 --> 00:53:28,677
Romance. I am a Frenchman.

285
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:34,853
When I give the sign,
are you with champagne and the ring...

286
00:53:35,036 --> 00:53:38,019
... In the bottom of her glass.
- Perfect!

287
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:43,230
I would also like to
musicians play this song.

288
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:49,952
- Their favorite.
- Take good care of the ring.

289
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,440
<i>I protect it with my life, Monsieur.</i>

290
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,510
<i>- Sil vous plait?
- Oui.</i>

291
00:53:55,764 --> 00:53:57,244
I like you.

292
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:08,197
<i>- Bonne chance.
- Bon chance.</i>

293
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:18,052
Would you like some champagne?

294
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:24,717
How did it there?

295
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:27,844
Do not cry.

296
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:38,000
Look at you. You are so beautiful.

297
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,990
Can we afford this?

298
00:54:45,094 --> 00:54:48,911
There is a special occasion.
You play on Broadway...

299
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:54,166
- I'm not a star tonight.
- You are a star.

300
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:57,789
- You've earned it.
- Peter...

301
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:04,190
- You have no idea how I feel.
- I know exactly how you feel.

302
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:09,079
I've been through this.
It happens all the time.

303
00:55:09,246 --> 00:55:14,150
There are posters of Spiderman in
windows, the kids have me on t-shirts.

304
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:18,429
I am a big seller on Halloween
and has become something of an icon.

305
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:23,644
By yesterday, all shouting:
"Spiderman, Spiderman"

306
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,552
I'm just a geek from Queens.

307
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:32,340
I deserve this?

308
00:55:34,172 --> 00:55:37,271
- Hey, Pete.
- Hello.

309
00:55:44,943 --> 00:55:50,295
I'm here and eat with my parents.
Hello, my name is Gwen Stacy.

310
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:52,806
This is Mary Jane Watson.

311
00:55:54,536 --> 00:55:58,590
So nice to finally meet you.
Peter talks about you all the time.

312
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:04,534
Gwen is my labpartner
in Dr. Connors class.

313
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:08,557
Peter is a genius.
I had not done anything without him.

314
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,838
Speaking of which... Do you have a card on
When I kissed Spiderman?

315
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:17,875
Do you want to take it to school?
It would be really nice.

316
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:23,043
For my folder. I mean,
who receive kiss Spiderman?

317
00:56:23,856 --> 00:56:25,809
I can not imagine it.

318
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,327
It was wonderful to meet you.

319
00:56:30,527 --> 00:56:32,543
- Good night.
- Good night.

320
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:47,978
She goes in my science class.
Not her best subject.

321
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:53,409
- What is it?
- Why have you never mentioned her?

322
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:58,889
She is your labpartner.
You saved her life.

323
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:03,751
She thinks you're a genius
and could not take care of you.

324
00:57:04,641 --> 00:57:06,456
Or did you notice that?

325
00:57:07,713 --> 00:57:10,760
She gave Spiderman punch key.

326
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:14,336
I will never forget.

327
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:21,137
- It's just a girl in my class...
- Can I ask one thing:

328
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:25,295
Who kissed her?

329
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:29,806
- Spider-Man or Peter?
- What do you mean?

330
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:34,108
You know exactly what I mean.
It was our kiss.

331
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:39,255
Why did you do that? You must
have understood how I would feel.

332
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,967
- Do you reject me?
- Repel you?

333
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:49,655
Why? I love you. You are my
girlfriend and she is a girl in my class.

334
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,942
I do not feel good, so I must go.

335
00:57:57,525 --> 00:58:00,650
- Where are you?
- Do not follow me, please.

336
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:05,072
Here you are.

337
00:58:41,797 --> 00:58:45,206
<i>Hey, it's MJ.
Sing a song after the beep. "Piiip"</i>

338
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:53,789
I do not know why you do not respond
or what happens.

339
00:58:54,518 --> 00:58:57,413
<i>I do not know if
You have heard my message.</i>

340
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:02,460
<i>I... would like to talk to you.</i>

341
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:06,764
Okay, call me.

342
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:19,724
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?</i>

343
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,289
<i>This is an assistant Neil Garett
from the 32nd district.</i>

344
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:27,570
<i>I'll call the police chief Stacy. He wants
happy to talk to you here at the station.</i>

345
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:32,956
From the beginning we thought that he is here,
Dennis Carradine, murdered your husband.

346
00:59:33,972 --> 00:59:37,043
- We were wrong.
- What?

347
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:42,643
Carradine was just an assistant...
killer is still at large.

348
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:47,346
- What are you talking about?
- This is your husband's killers.

349
00:59:52,346 --> 00:59:56,746
His name is Flint Marko,
a petty thief has been in and out of jail.

350
00:59:56,865 --> 00:59:59,978
- It is not true.
- Two days ago he escaped.

351
01:00:00,425 --> 01:00:06,273
He admitted to a cell mate.
We have witnesses who support his story.

352
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:22,038
<i>Wait, you do not want to do this.</i>

353
01:00:35,454 --> 01:00:39,019
<i>Jump in! What are you doing?!</i>

354
01:00:57,043 --> 01:01:00,179
- Would you put away these cards.
- I know it's hard, Mrs. Parker

355
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:06,146
- But be patient with us.
We do our job and catch him.

356
01:01:06,297 --> 01:01:10,626
No, you do not handle your job! I saw my
uncle die and we have been chasing the wrong man-

357
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:13,659
- And now you say that you had
suspects and witnesses in two years.

358
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:18,018
Why did we not know?
I'm not going to calm me down!

359
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:21,394
He murdered my uncle
and is still at large!

360
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,239
<i>All police officers nearby
The L-20 Parkway, answer.</i>

361
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:40,103
<i>We have an abandoned vehicle and an older
man in the middle of the street. Sorry, Wabash Avenue.</i>

362
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,648
It's MJ, Peter.

363
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:50,175
I do not want to talk about dinner.
Open only, please.

364
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,480
Aunt May called and told what
has happened. She is worried about you.

365
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,110
- I'm worried about you.
- Do not be.

366
01:02:06,175 --> 01:02:10,398
- You must not do anything stupid.
- Like to find my uncle's murderer?

367
01:02:10,844 --> 01:02:16,869
That you do something you may regret that...
with the other guy.

368
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:20,126
He took aim at me with a gun.
I moved and he fell.

369
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:25,485
I accuse you.
Do you want to shut it down there?

370
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:35,650
I came here because I care about you.

371
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,891
I know you made a mistake
and feel guilty, but...

372
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,748
... I want to be here for you.
- I get it. Thank you.

373
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:51,659
Never mind.
I do not need your help.

374
01:02:59,217 --> 01:03:03,626
Everyone needs help sometimes...
even Spiderman.

375
01:03:18,663 --> 01:03:21,389
<i>... Is on his way to Madison Avenue, 620...</i>

376
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:25,581
<i>Tom reports that he is
in place at East 107540th</i>

377
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:30,335
<i>A man found in apartment B
on the first floor...</i>

378
01:04:37,364 --> 01:04:42,349
- Damage to me! Give me a break!
- You gave my uncle a chance!

379
01:04:56,132 --> 01:04:58,045
Where am I?

380
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:16,516
What is this?

381
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:19,851
It feels...

382
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,394
... Good!

383
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,010
This is awesome!

384
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:03,530
- What do you think?
- I've never seen anything like it.

385
01:06:03,938 --> 01:06:08,065
I'm not a physicist and biologist.
We get some tests tomorrow...

386
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:10,561
Can we do it now?

387
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,028
It looks like you.

388
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:25,014
Get any of that stuff on you.
It seems to be a symbiote-

389
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:27,806
- Who needs a host to survive.

390
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,547
When these kinds of organisms have been implanted-

391
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:35,021
- They can be difficult to get rid of.

392
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:39,494
<i>Current bank robbery in
First Eastern Bank in Bismarck.</i>

393
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:44,219
<i>A sandstorm has been seen nearby.
Draw close gently.</i>

394
01:06:44,253 --> 01:06:46,458
Marko!

395
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:46,940
I love your new style. Just what I
need for a scoop. Run some pretty rick.

396
01:07:49,123 --> 01:07:50,748
See you, dude.

397
01:07:52,722 --> 01:07:54,596
What the hell!

398
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,605
Flint Marko.

399
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:44,201
- What would you like me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

400
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,895
The old man you shot down in cold blood.

401
01:08:48,989 --> 01:08:54,157
- What does that have to do with you?
- Everything!

402
01:09:31,765 --> 01:09:34,349
Time to pay back, Marko!

403
01:10:43,485 --> 01:10:45,905
Nice to get rid of.

404
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,979
- The rent...
- Not now.

405
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:12,291
It's a free country;
but no rent.

406
01:11:12,377 --> 01:11:15,188
- Leave me alone.
- Once I receive the rent.

407
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:19,152
You get it when you have
cook this damn door!

408
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:34,944
- It was not fair.
- He's a good guy.

409
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,398
He must have some kind of problem.

410
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:33,230
The man who killed Uncle Ben,
Flint Marko, was killed yesterday.

411
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,854
- What happened?
- Spider-Man killed him.

412
01:12:41,204 --> 01:12:45,014
Spiderman? Incomprehensible.

413
01:12:45,518 --> 01:12:47,974
Spider-Man do not kill people.

414
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:52,029
What happened?

415
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:59,796
I... He was...

416
01:13:04,109 --> 01:13:07,429
I thought you liked...

417
01:13:10,317 --> 01:13:13,171
... He deserved it.

418
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:19,043
I do not think we can determine if a
person deserves to live or die.

419
01:13:19,564 --> 01:13:24,546
- He killed Uncle Ben.
- Ben meant everything to us...

420
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:30,841
... But he had not wanted
that we live with a vengeance.

421
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:38,761
It's like a poison
that can take over.

422
01:13:41,194 --> 01:13:45,970
Before you know it,
transforms it into something horrible.

423
01:14:49,019 --> 01:14:52,055
<i>- Hey, Harry, it's MJ.
- Hello.</i>

424
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:55,993
I want to have some company. Can I get
past or do anything special?

425
01:14:56,211 --> 01:15:00,704
<i>- No, look over.
- Sure it is OK?</i>

426
01:15:00,841 --> 01:15:05,064
- I have nothing for me. Come here.
- Okay, see you in a while.

427
01:15:08,658 --> 01:15:11,170
- Bernard!
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

428
01:15:11,296 --> 01:15:14,752
- We get a visit. Can you get food?
- Visit?

429
01:15:14,787 --> 01:15:18,198
- Yes, please.
- Fine visits or usual?

430
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:22,150
- Can you just get some grub?
- Immediately, sir.

431
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:42,869
- Mr. Ditkowitch.
- Orange?

432
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:48,518
No thanks. I apologize
for what happened earlier.

433
01:15:48,853 --> 01:15:52,014
I should not be screaming for the door.
There was nothing to get angry.

434
01:15:52,157 --> 01:15:58,252
It does not matter, but if you have bad
conscience, you can bid on the pizza sometime.

435
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:01,805
- Today is going well.
- Okay.

436
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:05,012
- Malfunctioning phone?
- No, I just...

437
01:16:05,195 --> 01:16:08,643
... Wondering what to say.
- If you make a woman-

438
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:14,349
- You say:
"You are a beautiful woman. I am a good man."

439
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:25,055
- He should call a woman.
- The Mary Jane? I think it's...

440
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:28,184
You do not have to do with it! Go now!

441
01:16:30,689 --> 01:16:32,787
- Call her.
- Thanks.

442
01:16:35,222 --> 01:16:37,621
Goodbye.

443
01:16:56,021 --> 01:16:59,158
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

444
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:08,186
- Do you like peppers?
- I love it.

445
01:17:44,644 --> 01:17:46,792
Butter!

446
01:18:02,632 --> 01:18:04,680
Check it here.

447
01:18:12,182 --> 01:18:14,128
This part is useful.

448
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:17,515
"You have been dreaming."

449
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:21,742
"A little self-deception
helps one through the evening. "

450
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,948
- When did you write this?
- The third year in high school.

451
01:18:27,377 --> 01:18:31,538
- Do you want the part?
- I'm happy in your piece.

452
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,778
You do not even have a scar.

453
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,698
Hardly.

454
01:18:57,813 --> 01:18:58,688
- Sorry.
- Forgive me.

455
01:18:58,722 --> 01:19:05,042
- I did not mean.
- Do not worry... Forgive me.

456
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:14,082
Forgive me.

457
01:19:28,176 --> 01:19:31,113
You have lost focus.

458
01:19:52,195 --> 01:19:54,332
What have you done?!

459
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:57,987
Avenge me!

460
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:05,369
- My father died right?
- Yes.

461
01:20:05,497 --> 01:20:10,393
- I wish I could remember more of him.
- He loved you. That's the main thing.

462
01:20:10,497 --> 01:20:13,729
I swear by my father's grave
that Spiderman will have to pay.

463
01:20:17,398 --> 01:20:19,625
Remember me.

464
01:20:21,764 --> 01:20:26,515
- Yes, father. I remember.
- I was right about her.

465
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:29,988
If Peter, of all things.

466
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:38,229
You know what you must do. Get him
to suffer and wish he was dead.

467
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:41,997
First we attack his heart!

468
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:55,073
<i>Hello. It's me.
Sing a song after the beep.</i>

469
01:20:55,537 --> 01:20:58,072
<i>Hey, MJ. It is Peter.</i>

470
01:20:59,592 --> 01:21:03,016
<i>I want to talk to you
about last night.</i>

471
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:08,632
<i>I do not know what I was thinking of.
You came to help me and</i>

472
01:21:09,353 --> 01:21:13,935
<i>- I... want to meet you.</i>

473
01:21:18,554 --> 01:21:23,631
Do you think Peter will live on,
you must do one thing for me.

474
01:21:27,386 --> 01:21:29,905
- It's Ursula.
- Come in.

475
01:21:38,801 --> 01:21:41,081
- Hey, Pete.
- Hello.

476
01:21:41,216 --> 01:21:42,984
You have a telephone.

477
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,520
- The Mary Jane is calling back.
- Really?

478
01:21:50,247 --> 01:21:53,791
- I put the receiver on top of the box.
- Thanks.

479
01:21:57,782 --> 01:22:00,925
<i>- Hello.
- How nice that you called.</i>

480
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:04,149
<i>- I have tried...
- Can we meet?</i>

481
01:22:04,372 --> 01:22:06,628
<i>- Of course.
- Now?</i>

482
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:11,020
- On the bridge in the park.
- I'm on the road.

483
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,612
I love you.

484
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:35,511
You look fantastic.

485
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,966
Peonies.

486
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:43,766
- Are you okay?
- No.

487
01:22:44,453 --> 01:22:48,469
- It's something I have to say.
- Okay.

488
01:22:49,974 --> 01:22:54,029
It does not work... between us.

489
01:22:56,605 --> 01:23:02,132
- I do not see you anymore.
- What are you talking about?

490
01:23:02,326 --> 01:23:04,309
I do not know...

491
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:12,051
I am alone...
You are not there for me.

492
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:19,282
- I can not do it... It's over.
- No... Please.

493
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:23,890
Do not say that. I've been selfish, but-

494
01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:26,771
- I can pull myself together. Change me.
- It's not that simple.

495
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:32,386
We love each other. People have problems,
they talk out and resolve them.

496
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:43,529
Do you see it here. You know what that is?

497
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,680
- Do you know what I want?
- It's someone else!

498
01:23:48,832 --> 01:23:51,552
I'm in love with someone else.

499
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:15,037
Bravo.

500
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:28,523
She said she is alone
and that I am not there for her...

501
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:33,194
... That there is another guy.

502
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:39,618
- How do you feel?
- Not good.

503
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:45,010
I was going to marry him.

504
01:24:49,257 --> 01:24:53,457
She has had it rough lately.
The job...

505
01:24:53,592 --> 01:24:59,152
Singing waitress at a jazz club.
It is not what she imagined.

506
01:24:59,537 --> 01:25:02,752
Singing waitress... What are you talking about?

507
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:07,536
She was fired from the show.
Did she not?

508
01:25:07,872 --> 01:25:09,744
Was she fired?

509
01:25:10,809 --> 01:25:15,743
She told me that she got fired
for you, but not for me?

510
01:25:17,581 --> 01:25:19,988
That's why I asked you to come here.

511
01:25:21,485 --> 01:25:23,421
I'm the other guy.

512
01:25:25,092 --> 01:25:29,627
- What?
- She came to me one night, worried.

513
01:25:30,206 --> 01:25:33,252
She needed someone who cared about her.

514
01:25:34,091 --> 01:25:39,091
You know I always have loved her.
It just...

515
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:40,859
... Began.

516
01:25:48,753 --> 01:25:52,395
I do not think that's true...
I do not believe in you.

517
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:54,563
I am very sorry.

518
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:58,682
I just thought you should know.

519
01:26:06,716 --> 01:26:09,752
- Should I heat up?
- Yes, please.

520
01:26:11,759 --> 01:26:15,654
- How is the pie?
- Almost.

521
01:27:19,202 --> 01:27:21,314
You want something to drink?

522
01:27:23,858 --> 01:27:29,386
Sorry, what was I thinking.
Bad publicity for Mr. "key to the city."

523
01:27:29,474 --> 01:27:30,641
What did you do to her?

524
01:27:30,676 --> 01:27:36,305
What you failed.
I was there when she needed someone.

525
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:40,702
- Mary Jane and I understand each other.
- She does not know what you are.

526
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:47,295
She knows me so well. She kissed me
just like she used to kiss me.

527
01:27:48,488 --> 01:27:53,336
Tasted like... strawberries.

528
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:30,792
What did you think of it, Spidy?

529
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,926
Is that all you have to come up with?

530
01:28:43,862 --> 01:28:47,886
I protected you in High School
and now I'll kick your ass!

531
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:39,208
- Are you going to kill me as my father?
- I can not convince you.

532
01:29:39,826 --> 01:29:43,578
You took him from me. He loved me.

533
01:29:43,777 --> 01:29:47,208
No. He despised you.

534
01:29:47,657 --> 01:29:50,208
He thought you were embarrassing.

535
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,119
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Will you cry?

536
01:30:33,032 --> 01:30:36,264
<i>"THIEF! Spiderman shows his true colors"
- He made \u200b\u200bme feel safe.</i>

537
01:30:36,543 --> 01:30:40,576
- Now I dare not go home from work.
- My son thought he was the world's guy.

538
01:30:40,712 --> 01:30:44,737
My nine year old daughter loves Spiderman.
Who will she look up to now?

539
01:30:44,887 --> 01:30:49,801
- Gave him the city key?
- I'll make you look worse.

540
01:30:54,065 --> 01:30:57,345
- I just got lucky.
- It must be wonderful for you.

541
01:30:57,448 --> 01:31:01,354
Maybe you should ask JJ to arrange
a little more space on the wall.

542
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:09,386
- Good morning.
- A wonderful day, right?

543
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:14,153
What were you saying? I would never
take that card? There you have your hero.

544
01:31:15,953 --> 01:31:21,090
- I did not think he would do it.
- Now, did you do an assessment.

545
01:31:21,466 --> 01:31:24,144
- You must see the truth.
- Funny you said that-

546
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:29,408
- Because I looked through some
old card and they were very similar.

547
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:34,655
I have to work.

548
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:38,600
- You are a sweep, Brock.
- Excuse me?

549
01:31:38,752 --> 01:31:41,087
The card is a forgery.

550
01:31:42,926 --> 01:31:48,103
You are so righteous, Parker.
When should you quit?

551
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:52,301
You want forgiveness? Be religious.

552
01:31:52,337 --> 01:31:56,207
- What's going on?!
- Is it good to you?

553
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:02,936
Do not worry, we're kidding only a little.

554
01:32:03,411 --> 01:32:07,394
I beg you, do not do this
because then I lose everything.

555
01:32:07,546 --> 01:32:12,079
- Not one newspaper in town hire me.
- You should have thought of before.

556
01:32:13,113 --> 01:32:16,912
- What are you, Peter?
- View the editor of this.

557
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:20,032
Tell him to check the source next time.

558
01:32:25,935 --> 01:32:31,010
It is a forgery.
The city's photo department confirms it.

559
01:32:35,234 --> 01:32:39,743
Pack your things and get out.
You've been fired!

560
01:32:41,408 --> 01:32:45,595
- We need to press a denial now.
- I have not done in 20 years!

561
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:49,780
"Sorry, Spidy. Bugle put the case."
"Counterfeiters kicked."

562
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:56,551
- It is Dr. Connors, Mr. Parker.
- Dr. Connors.

563
01:32:56,949 --> 01:33:02,190
- What is it?
- It was not a bad test you did.

564
01:33:02,528 --> 01:33:07,301
The chemistry is similar to meteorites
from the 70's.

565
01:33:13,261 --> 01:33:16,045
- Parks?
- Get some milk.

566
01:33:16,962 --> 01:33:21,573
- It enhances the properties of values.
- Give me a cake.

567
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:27,244
In particular, anger. It may be dangerous.

568
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:32,336
- You kept nothing?
- Do you have the nuts?

569
01:33:32,472 --> 01:33:36,095
- I have nuts, so I can cook.
- Fix some to me.

570
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:39,064
Of course not.

571
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:58,073
- Your photos are so good.
- I plates like you someday.

572
01:33:59,488 --> 01:34:01,112
Parker then...

573
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:06,842
Parks! Ms. Brent!
That employee I am not for you!

574
01:34:06,956 --> 01:34:09,092
Spiderman in the black suit.

575
01:34:09,127 --> 01:34:14,033
These are amazing, Peter.
We must have them, Jonah.

576
01:34:14,068 --> 01:34:16,222
I pay what I usually do.

577
01:34:17,024 --> 01:34:21,574
Do you want the cards, give me
editorial work. With double pay.

578
01:35:54,355 --> 01:35:56,956
You will really
to like this place.

579
01:35:58,226 --> 01:36:01,907
Am I dressed appropriately?
Not too dressy?

580
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:05,363
You are gorgeous, girl.

581
01:36:06,314 --> 01:36:10,400
- Thanks.
- I love it there giggling.

582
01:36:18,362 --> 01:36:20,823
This is so cool.

583
01:36:21,729 --> 01:36:25,224
I have never been
at a jazz club before.

584
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:30,400
I hope we can get a table.

585
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:42,778
- Find some shade for us.
- This way.

586
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:53,682
Thank you very much.

587
01:36:58,889 --> 01:37:01,969
- I love this so much.
- Me too.

588
01:37:08,136 --> 01:37:11,435
- Is not that your old girlfriend?
- Yes.

589
01:37:11,673 --> 01:37:16,143
- Do you want to go somewhere else?
- Oh no. That's fine.

590
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,384
See what you can, Mary Jane.

591
01:37:24,859 --> 01:37:27,439
I'll be right back.

592
01:37:36,525 --> 01:37:38,359
Peter?

593
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:43,551
This is for you.

594
01:38:24,078 --> 01:38:26,328
Check this out.

595
01:39:09,509 --> 01:39:11,934
Was all that for her?

596
01:39:19,015 --> 01:39:21,507
Forgive me.

597
01:39:33,966 --> 01:39:36,542
- Are you all right, Mary Jane?
- Oh, yes.

598
01:39:44,573 --> 01:39:48,524
- What is wrong with you?
- You.

599
01:39:49,132 --> 01:39:52,122
- Can I help you?
- No.

600
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:57,195
- Are you all right, Paul?
- Yes, it's there, Paul?

601
01:39:57,363 --> 01:40:01,427
- Throw him out.
- Hands off.

602
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:10,002
Stop it, Peter!

603
01:40:21,646 --> 01:40:23,804
Who are you really?

604
01:40:25,578 --> 01:40:27,719
I do not know.

605
01:42:00,015 --> 01:42:04,224
Brock here, sir...
Edward Brock Junior.

606
01:42:06,127 --> 01:42:14,951
I stand here before you today...
humble... and humiliated.

607
01:42:18,726 --> 01:42:21,631
I just want to ask you one thing...

608
01:42:26,127 --> 01:42:29,551
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

609
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:21,653
Parks...?

610
01:45:04,557 --> 01:45:06,654
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello.

611
01:45:09,548 --> 01:45:13,197
You do not seem to redecorate often.

612
01:45:14,109 --> 01:45:19,277
Fixed... there's not much
going to change, right?

613
01:45:24,715 --> 01:45:29,948
When we spoke over the phone, I felt
as if something troubled you, so...

614
01:45:30,323 --> 01:45:33,259
... I was going to stop by.

615
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:40,453
- How is Mary-Jane?
- I do not know.

616
01:45:42,974 --> 01:45:47,948
You never heard of you.
It became something of courtship?

617
01:45:52,091 --> 01:45:58,461
You said... that a husband must
put his wife first of all...

618
01:46:03,057 --> 01:46:05,076
I'm not ready.

619
01:46:07,615 --> 01:46:13,025
What happened?
You seemed so sure of your cause.

620
01:46:14,439 --> 01:46:18,399
Yes... I...

621
01:46:29,367 --> 01:46:34,716
I hurt her, Aunt May.
I do not know what to do with myself.

622
01:46:37,176 --> 01:46:40,310
You must start with the hardest...

623
01:46:41,621 --> 01:46:44,189
To forgive yourself.

624
01:46:47,628 --> 01:46:52,627
I believe in you, Peter.
You are a good person.

625
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:58,876
I am sure that you get to find
a way to set things right.

626
01:47:06,684 --> 01:47:08,427
In due course.

627
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:28,953
Sleep well, Spiderman!

628
01:47:33,251 --> 01:47:38,426
I also want to see him dead, Flint.
That is why I looked for you.

629
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:44,082
I know all about you...
As the Spider-

630
01:47:44,395 --> 01:47:49,105
- Do not let you help your daughter.
It sounds very wrong to my ears.

631
01:47:50,693 --> 01:47:56,693
We both wish to kill the spider...
Against both of us, he has no chance.

632
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:03,594
- Sound interesting?
- Yes.

633
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:09,990
Where do you go?

634
01:49:10,914 --> 01:49:15,587
<i>The entire New York holding its breath while
hostage situation continues...</i>

635
01:49:17,173 --> 01:49:21,507
<i>For 30 minutes ago police discovered
This amazing scenario.</i>

636
01:49:21,542 --> 01:49:25,842
<i>A woman held captive in a taxi, which
hanging 80 storeys up in the air-</i>

637
01:49:25,962 --> 01:49:28,722
<i>- In what resembles a large network.</i>

638
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:33,354
<i>All the police attempt to save woman
were stopped by the Sand Man.</i>

639
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:42,216
<i>Another danger appeared,
a man dressed in black, as was believed,</i>

640
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:48,655
<i>- Be the black-clad Spider-Man,
has now proved to be something else entirely.</i>

641
01:49:50,438 --> 01:49:57,020
<i>The hostages have been identified as Mary-Jane
Watson, an actor who appeared on Broadway.</i>

642
01:50:23,641 --> 01:50:28,251
<i>We now broadcast live from the scene
by Jennifer Dugan. - Jennifer?</i>

643
01:50:28,371 --> 01:50:34,819
I'm only a few hundred meters away.
We can see that something happens in the network.

644
01:50:34,994 --> 01:50:38,162
It looks like the giant letters.

645
01:50:41,225 --> 01:50:49,297
<i>They want to confront Spider-Man, but
how can he resist the kind of power...</i>

646
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:01,144
Harry?

647
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:10,132
I need your help.
I can not handle both of them alone.

648
01:51:17,381 --> 01:51:19,796
You do not deserve my help.

649
01:51:22,954 --> 01:51:26,853
She needs our help, Harry.

650
01:51:31,756 --> 01:51:33,957
Get out of here!

651
01:51:50,037 --> 01:51:52,301
If I may, sir...

652
01:51:52,981 --> 01:51:58,326
I have witnessed things in this house
I have never spoken about.

653
01:51:58,868 --> 01:52:04,220
- What is it you would have said?
- The night when your father died...

654
01:52:04,404 --> 01:52:06,780
I cleaned his wounds.

655
01:52:08,372 --> 01:52:14,452
The blade that pierced his body...
came from his hovercraft.

656
01:52:15,731 --> 01:52:20,386
I know you're just trying
defend your father's honor-

657
01:52:20,682 --> 01:52:25,939
- But there is no doubt that
His death was caused by himself.

658
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:31,561
I loved your father...

659
01:52:32,865 --> 01:52:39,001
... Just as I have loved you, Harry.
So that your friends love you.

660
01:53:26,146 --> 01:53:28,136
Look!

661
01:53:57,207 --> 01:54:04,094
He came from nowhere to help
us when all hope seemed lost.

662
01:54:09,748 --> 01:54:14,725
- Peter... They will kill us both.
- I'll help you.

663
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,729
Watch out!

664
01:54:25,765 --> 01:54:28,932
- Hey, Parker.
- Eddie...? Oh my God.

665
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:31,828
It tingles the spider sense...

666
01:54:32,805 --> 01:54:35,533
... If you know what I mean.

667
01:54:54,551 --> 01:55:01,198
- We can make up any other way.
- Sure... Why not through humiliation.

668
01:55:02,396 --> 01:55:06,909
Kind of like when you humiliated me.
Do you remember?

669
01:55:09,269 --> 01:55:11,827
Do you remember what you did to me?

670
01:55:27,203 --> 01:55:31,654
You made me lose my girlfriend,
so now you lose yours.

671
01:55:32,981 --> 01:55:34,981
How does that sound?

672
01:56:18,828 --> 01:56:21,284
No...!

673
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,706
Hold on, Mary-Jane!

674
01:57:06,078 --> 01:57:08,457
Mary-Jane!

675
01:58:09,412 --> 01:58:13,207
It's hard to imagine
what we now witness.

676
01:58:13,317 --> 01:58:15,310
It's so brutal...

677
01:58:15,717 --> 01:58:21,717
- We can not take much more...
- A tragic day for New Yorkers.

678
01:58:22,006 --> 01:58:25,262
It could mean the end of Spiderman.

679
01:59:17,463 --> 01:59:19,926
You came...

680
01:59:26,805 --> 01:59:32,293
- Just in the nick of time, it seems.
- A little earlier had not damaged.

681
01:59:32,328 --> 01:59:34,444
You may have to make do.

682
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:41,109
- I need some help here!
- I'm a little busy now!

683
01:59:42,721 --> 01:59:44,716
Give me your hand!

684
01:59:59,011 --> 02:00:03,610
Parks! I need a photographer.

685
02:00:03,858 --> 02:00:08,770
- Need a job?
- Why? I'm just a kid.

686
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:12,448
- How much do you want for your camera?
- $ 100.

687
02:00:15,256 --> 02:00:17,359
Sure... Here you go.

688
02:00:23,841 --> 02:00:26,527
The film cost extra.

689
02:00:41,466 --> 02:00:43,283
Meet me at the top, Pete!

690
02:01:06,501 --> 02:01:09,118
- Can you increase speed?
- Hold on!

691
02:01:14,091 --> 02:01:15,908
Jump, man!

692
02:01:27,322 --> 02:01:31,139
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

693
02:01:34,625 --> 02:01:37,368
- Good.
- Pete!

694
02:01:39,568 --> 02:01:41,688
Am I disturbing you?

695
02:02:57,483 --> 02:03:01,795
Damage never... what you can not kill.

696
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:12,185
- Your costume... You have to take it off.
- It was you certainly appreciated.

697
02:03:14,396 --> 02:03:21,012
I know the feeling... It feels good.
Forces and everything...

698
02:03:21,389 --> 02:03:25,725
... But you lose yourself.
Drop it.

699
02:03:26,378 --> 02:03:31,332
I like to be mean.
It makes me happy.

700
02:04:19,961 --> 02:04:22,814
Harry!

701
02:05:34,893 --> 02:05:37,457
What are you doing, Peter?

702
02:05:38,046 --> 02:05:40,417
No!

703
02:05:41,605 --> 02:05:43,301
Eddie!

704
02:06:02,667 --> 02:06:06,143
- Mary-Jane.
- I'll get help.

705
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,927
Stay with me.

706
02:06:17,289 --> 02:06:19,945
I did not think this would happen...

707
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:26,096
... But I had no choice.

708
02:06:29,777 --> 02:06:34,591
There is always a choice. You did
a choice when you killed my uncle.

709
02:06:36,712 --> 02:06:38,993
My daughter was dying.

710
02:06:40,863 --> 02:06:43,399
I needed money.

711
02:06:47,238 --> 02:06:50,311
I was scared.

712
02:06:57,167 --> 02:07:01,203
<i>I told your uncle
I was just looking for car...</i>

713
02:07:02,697 --> 02:07:09,136
He asked me to tuck away
revolver and go home.

714
02:07:11,865 --> 02:07:15,510
<i>Now I realize that he
tried to do me a favor.</i>

715
02:07:21,847 --> 02:07:24,849
<i>Then came my partner
running with the money-</i>

716
02:07:25,233 --> 02:07:28,041
<i>- And I held the revolver in my hand.</i>

717
02:07:40,948 --> 02:07:43,957
<i>What I did to you was horrible...</i>

718
02:07:45,091 --> 02:07:49,068
<i>... And many nights I've changed my mind.</i>

719
02:07:53,764 --> 02:07:59,466
I do not pray for forgiveness...
I just want you to understand.

720
02:08:09,362 --> 02:08:12,594
I have also done terrible things.

721
02:08:27,832 --> 02:08:31,289
I chose not to become like this.

722
02:08:39,421 --> 02:08:42,333
The only thing I have left now...

723
02:08:44,405 --> 02:08:46,247
... Is my daughter.

724
02:08:58,484 --> 02:09:00,948
I forgive you.

725
02:09:43,793 --> 02:09:48,369
- Hey, buddy. How are you?
- I have felt better.

726
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:52,801
We will take you through this.

727
02:09:55,448 --> 02:09:57,384
No...

728
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:07,958
I should never have hurt you.

729
02:10:09,095 --> 02:10:11,765
Or put all those things.

730
02:10:13,136 --> 02:10:15,744
It does not matter, Peter.

731
02:10:17,266 --> 02:10:19,463
You are my friend.

732
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:26,971
The best of friends.

733
02:11:32,235 --> 02:11:39,533
<i>Whatever we do, the struggle over
underway in at, we always have a choice.</i>

734
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:47,298
<i>It taught me my friend Harry.
He chose to show his best side.</i>

735
02:11:48,449 --> 02:11:55,123
<i>It is our choices that makes us who
we are and we can always make the right choice.</i>
