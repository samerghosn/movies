that I was going to be testifying

Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist

698
00:47:23,092 --> 00:47:26,094
who defected to the United States
in 1963.

699
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,349
However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.

His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,

701

was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:23,541
He was on to something big,
something so big

998
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,460
that it was gonna make
the nuclear reactor

999
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:27,545
look like a triple-A battery.

1000
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:30,130
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1001
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,300
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

1002
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:35,385
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1003
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,889
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

1004
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:39,891
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

1005
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,476
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1006
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:44,311
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

1007
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,981
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

1008
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,152
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1009
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,903
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1010
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:55,155
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

1011
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,494
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

1012
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,661
to finish what he started.

1013
01:08:01,746 --> 01:08:03,246
- He said that?
- Mmm.

1014
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:06,000
Are you that guy? Hmm? Are you?

1015
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:11,422
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

1016
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,177
I don't know
where you get your information,

1017
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,514
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1018
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,931
What do you remember about your dad?

1019
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:22,766
He was cold, he was calculating.

1020
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,603
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

1021
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,270
so it's a little tough for me to digest

1022
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,774
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

1023
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:32,275
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

1024
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:34,194
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

1025
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:35,779
was when he shipped me off
to boarding school.

1026
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:36,948
That's not true.

1027
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,699
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

1028
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:43,787
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1029
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,038
What?

1030
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,625
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1031
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,292
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

1032
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,127
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

1033
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,046
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

1034
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,384
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

1035
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:59,386
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,346
Oh, and Tony,

1037
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:05,560
remember, I got my eye on you.

1038
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:14,484
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

1039
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,362
Good luck.

1040
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:21,701
Please.

1041
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:25,496
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

1042

down to The Coffee Bean,

or something like that, that'd be nice.

I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by Director Fury

- I think I got it, yeah.

Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

1050

- Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

1054
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:27,390
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday?

1055
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:30,936
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

1056

(SIGHING REVERENTLY) Oh!

1057
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,900
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

1058
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:40,070
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

1059
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:41,738
What am I going to do for you?

1060
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:44,574
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

1061
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,912
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

1062
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,331
I'm talking about firepower.

You know what? You're not a hunter.
What am I talking about?

1070
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,434
I'm getting rid of it.

1071
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:13,020
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

1072
01:11:13,104 --> 01:11:14,854
They do make something
better than waffles.

1073

It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

1074

You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

1077

Don't let anyone tell you different.

1080

This is an M134 7.62 Minigun.

Six individual barrels.

Okay.

These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

1086
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:57,064
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

1088
01:12:02,028 --> 01:12:05,488
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

1089
01:12:05,573 --> 01:12:07,742
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

1090
01:12:07,867 --> 01:12:11,203
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.

1091
01:12:11,871 --> 01:12:13,079
It would read it to you.

1092
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:15,248
This is my Eiffel Tower.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1653
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,451
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1654
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:12,244
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
- Okay. What about the press?

1655
01:53:12,328 --> 01:53:14,204
Because you only had the job for a week.
That's gonna seem...

1656
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:16,082
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1657
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:17,542
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1658
01:53:30,596 --> 01:53:32,765
- Weird.
- (SOFTLY) No, it's not weird.

1659
01:53:32,849 --> 01:53:34,184
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

1660
01:53:34,266 --> 01:53:35,601
Run that by me again.

1661
01:53:35,685 --> 01:53:37,186
RHODES: I think it was weird.

1662
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:40,939
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1663
01:53:41,483 --> 01:53:43,943
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1664
01:53:44,027 --> 01:53:46,529
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1665
01:53:46,613 --> 01:53:49,073
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1666

(TONY CHUCKLES)

1667
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:52,993
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1668
01:53:53,078 --> 01:53:55,704
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1669
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:58,291
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1670
01:53:58,375 --> 01:54:01,543
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1671
01:54:01,627 --> 01:54:03,380
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1672
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,215
It wasn't a question.

1673
01:54:10,804 --> 01:54:12,262
How are you gonna resign

1674
01:54:13,097 --> 01:54:14,224
if I don't accept?

1675
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:16,141
- (PEPPER LAUGHS)
- Hmm?

1676
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,037
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1677
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:39,248
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

1678
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:44,587
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1679
01:54:45,838 --> 01:54:47,966
- Read it.
- Uh...

1680
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:52,845
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark displays
compulsive behavior."

1681
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:55,097
In my own defense, that was last week.

1682
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,978
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1683
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:02,689
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1684
01:55:03,064 --> 01:55:05,899
"Textbook narcissism"?

1685
01:55:07,944 --> 01:55:09,028
Agreed.

1686
01:55:10,113 --> 01:55:11,488
Okay, here it is. Uh...

1687
01:55:11,573 --> 01:55:14,908
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1688
01:55:14,993 --> 01:55:17,537
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1689
01:55:20,081 --> 01:55:21,623
"Tony Stark not...

1690
01:55:21,707 --> 01:55:23,251
"Not recommended"?

1691
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:25,670
That doesn't make any sense.

1692
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:28,672
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1693
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,757
I got a new ticker.

I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1695
01:55:34,429 --> 01:55:37,347
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1697
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:43,313
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1698
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:52,113
You can't afford me.

1699
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:56,701
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1700
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:59,662
in exchange for a small favor.

1701
01:56:00,622 --> 01:56:05,542
Rhodey and I are being honored
in Washington and we need a presenter.

1702
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:08,880
I'll see what I can do.

to present these distinguished awards

1705
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:19,515
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr. Tony Stark,

1706
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:22,935
who is, of course, a national treasure.

1707
01:56:25,104 --> 01:56:26,439
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1708
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:28,899
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1709
01:56:29,192 --> 01:56:31,194
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1710
01:56:32,904 --> 01:56:35,113
Mr. Stark. Thank you

1711
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,368
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1712
01:56:38,451 --> 01:56:40,118
You deserve this.

1713
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:41,496
Ow!

1714
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:43,081
Oh, sorry.

1715
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:47,542
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

1716
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,796
Let's get a photo.
