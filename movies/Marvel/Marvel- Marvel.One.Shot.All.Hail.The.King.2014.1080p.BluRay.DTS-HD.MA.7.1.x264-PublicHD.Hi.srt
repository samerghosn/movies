<i>Thus far, the subject has been evasive</i>

8
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,456
<i>and apparently oblivious
to the point of my work.</i>

Come on, Mr. Slattery,
you know you supposed to wait for me.

23
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:32,218
Lunchtime ain't safe around here
for a celebrity like yourself.

24
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,263
So, Herman, with whom
shall we lunch today?

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,932

HERMAN: Now remember, sir,
you have that 3:00 with Mr. Norris.

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,271
If only my mother could see me
in my very own documentary.

28
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,566
I still think you should've done
that exclusive with 60 Minutes.

29
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,067
I told you. I'll never work for CBS again.

30
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,612
Wait. Herman, where's my choccy milk?

31
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,364
I'm so sorry, sir. I'll be right back.

32
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,700
And while you're there can you see
if they've got any kale?

33

HERMAN: I'm On it.

<i>Au contraire,</i> Dave.

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,088

Do the voice.

58
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,853

Old habit from my stage work.

I can't imagine, starting out,
you'd ever thought

74
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,689
you'd end up in some place like this.

75
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,985
Yeah, not bad, eh?
That whole "rolling on people" thing

76
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,277

But you know,

Okay, look, Trevor,
this is our last day. Okay?

- Last day?
- Yes, finally.

87
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:23,264

Whom I brought to life. Carry on.

90
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,812
The one question that
most people ask me

91
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,524
when I tell them that I know you is that,

92
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,067
"How could he have not known
what was going on?"

93
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,112

- Hmm?

"Lovely. Drugs."

95
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,951
Okay.

96
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,579
To bring this film to a close,

97
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,456
I'd like to know more about
the man behind the mask.

98
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,042
The real Trevor Slattery.

99
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,377
You know, with all the Internet gossip
and tabloid exposÃ©s,

100
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,672
not much is known
about you personally.

101
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:02,386
Well, I think that an actor does better
to keep a shred of mystery,

102
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,057
otherwise, you know, it can color
the audience's perception.

103
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,516
What have you got there?

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,644
I found this in the vaults of
an English newspaper

105
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,353
<i>called The Liverpool Echo.</i>

106
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,105

107

Yeah, it is.

108
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,321
October 12th, 1964.

109
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,699
That was the day I landed my first role.

110
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,870
Boatswain 1, Shakespeare's Tempest.

111
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,831
Obviously, I told her it was the lead.
I always was a bloody great liar.

112
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,750
So, I assume the two of you were close.

113
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:37,963
She was everything to me.

114
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,259
She passed in 1986,
but you weren't there when she died.

115
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,262
No, I wasn't. I was here in America
for my big break.

116
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,641
And this would be the TV pilot
for the CBS network.

Sean Connery made a pass at me once.

Everyone on the set
called him "Mr. Connery."

130
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,670
He called me "Trev."

Was that a monkey drinking vodka?

134
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,262
Yes. Yes! And still those knobs
at the network didn't pick it up.

135
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,973
- I think it was too sophisticated for them.
- Hmm.

Well, right there.

138
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,314
You seem to typify your life
as a series of missed opportunities,

139
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,608
but yet, you don't tend to take
responsibility for many of them.

Officially they're dormant,
but evidence suggests

152

that they're becoming more active.

154
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,855

That is so cool.

156
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,944
Trevor, you told me
that when you got this role

157
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,654
that you'd researched it thoroughly.

158
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,324
Yeah, but when an actor tells you
he's "done the research,"

159
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,951
it means he's switched on
his computer,

160
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,120
Googled his own name
and had a quick wank.

161
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:20,500
So, you mean to tell me

162
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,170
that you don't know the history
of the Mandarin himself.

163
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,048
He was a warrior-king.

00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,513

Blah, blah, blah.
Who bloody cares, mate?

It's a show people want
and I gave them a good one.

It's not the Mandarin they'll remember.

It's the name, "Trevor Slattery."
It's the brand. "Trev."

00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,448
with a hole in your body
for every ring of our faith.

173
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,118
(CHUCKLING) So... Sorry. What?

174
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,619
You heard me.

175
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,125
(GROANS)

176
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,422
Oh! Get up, big lad. Get up.

177
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,634
(GRUNTING)

178
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,225
(HERMAN GROANS)

179
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
You.

180
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,653
You killed my butler.

181
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,822
JACKSON: You're not capable of pulling
that trigger, Mr. Slattery.

182
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,451
I'm an out of work actor, love.

183
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,120
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

184
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,082
And, thanks to the CBS network,
I'm pretty good with a handgun.

185
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,709
Oh...

186
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,838
Consider this a lesson in what's real

187
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,508
and what's not.

188
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,677
Why do people keep pointing
guns at my head?

189
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,179
Please. I don't want to die.

190
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,433
I don't want to die.

191
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,105
Target acquired and in position.
Extraction unit, mobilize.

192
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,606
I'm not the one
that's going to kill you, Mr. Slattery.

193
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm here to break you out.

194
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,528
- That's nice.
-(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

195
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,529
-(GUNS FIRING OUTSIDE)
- Not really.

196
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,990
You see, there's somebody
who wants to meet you.

197
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,616
-(DISTANT CLAMORING)
- Do I know him?

198
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,828
No, but you took his name.

199
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,580
And now he wants it back.

200
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,374
Oh...

201
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,336
(CHUCKLES) No. Sorry.
I still don't get it.

202
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,250
Uh... Mr. Slattery?

203
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,211
Me and the boys was just wondering
if you could, uh...

204
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,880
Do the voice.

205
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,756
JUSTIN: Jackass.

206
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,091
Whatever.

207
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:20,014
Where have you been? I wrote a book
in the time you were gone.

208
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,850
(IN GRUFF VOICE)
And you'll never see me coming.

209
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,687
JUSTIN: Look at this guy.
What is so special about him?

210
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,523
I mean, I had an army of robots.
What's he got?

211
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,066
He's got some dumb accent.

212
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,277
His name's Trevor. What is that?

213
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,405
It's like if bin Laden
and Benny Hill had a baby.

214
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,488
<i>JUSTIN: Then I got to wake up
and look at this chick?</i>

215
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,697
"Pepper Potts stirs up stuff."

216
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,115
"Look at me."

217
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,870
Some second-rate, jumped up,
Amazon secretary.

218
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,373
Tony and I... (STAMMERING)
Tony's cool.

219
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,960
Tony and I, we have an understanding.
We're brothers in arms, you know.

220
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,004
Literally. We were both arms dealers.

221
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,299
We're both good-looking.
We both have nice hair.

222
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,802
We both have boats.

223
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,178
I used to have a boat.

224
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,264
Well, anyway...

225
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,307
Not here, baby. Not here.

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,052
