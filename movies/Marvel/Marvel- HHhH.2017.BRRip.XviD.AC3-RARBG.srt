00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,002
HHhH (2017) (aka The Man with the Iron Heart)

2
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:42,180
<i>Halte! L'attaque touche.
Touche Riehl,</i> 2-zero.

3
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,893
<i>En garde.

4
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,401
<i>Ready?</i>
Fence!

5
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:58,569
<i>Halte! Halte!

6
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,685
L'attaque touche, touche Heydrich, 2-1.

7
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,475
<i>En garde.

8
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:13,793
<i>Ready?
Fence!

9
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,581
Halte! Halte! Halte!

10
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,643
Christina.

11
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm so happy you
asked me to come.

12
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,471
Let me take that.

13
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
- Thanks.
- Good trip?

14
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,459
- Birgitta, give me my dance card.
- Sorry.

15
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,268
It's already full, darling.

16
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,793
No it's not.

17
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,504
<i>Not him, Lina,
he's weird.

18
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:58,305
Steer clear if you
want to stay intact.

19
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,850
Maybe I don't.

20
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,060
My name is Heydrich.

21
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:18,893
Reinhard.

22
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,850
Write it down.

23
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,809
<i>It's so sad, our country
has</i> become so weak.

24
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,638
Yes, well, it's not going
to change any time soon.

25
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:31,066
Don't be so sure, there's one
man who could change everything.

26
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,225
<i>If we have to take this any</i> further,
I'd rather you knew my beliefs.

27
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,268
<i>Does it bother you?

28
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,263
No.

29
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,350
Well, you'd absolutely have
to read Hitler's book.

30
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,804
Which book?

31
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,763
<i> Mein Kampf of...

32
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:08,679
Reinhard, you have so much to learn!

33
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,143
Okay, a lot, a lot to learn.

34
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,684
Do you like the picture?

35
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,475
I love the picture.

36
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,184
You look...

37
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,684
- <i>What?</i>
- Beautiful.

38
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,250
Thank you.

39
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,355
<i>When I was a little girl, I would
imagine that each of these trees

40
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:41,462
<i>was a sentry watching
over me as I passed by.

41
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,184
<i>I wish you could have
seen it in those days.

42
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:48,263
<i>We had a party every weekend.

43
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,513
<i>There were vast buffets,
flowers everywhere.

44
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:54,554
<i>There would be an orchestra
who would play all night.

45
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,638
<i>And when it was
time to go to bed

46
00:10:56,668 --> 00:11:01,059
<i>I would hide under the piano
so my mother couldn't find me.

47
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,559
<i>I wish you could have
seen it in those times.

48
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,855
<i>You've seen my parents.
Well...

49
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,471
<i>No one escapes the crisis.

50
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,096
<i>And they're proud, so they
keep their heads held high.

51
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,225
<i>But I know it grieves them
to think of those lost years.

52
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:22,975
<i>What I want
more than anything...

53
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:26,600
<i>is to live that time again.

54
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:30,268
<i>And one day I will.

55
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,331
<i>Shoulder arms!

56
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,600
To the colors,

57
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:04,690
present arms!

58
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:19,346
I've never seen that
woman before, Sir.

59
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,018
Her name is Christina
Wiegel, she lives in Berlin.

60
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,388
She says she met you at
a dance 18 months ago

61
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:28,518
and that you conducted
intimate relations since.

62
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,346
She says she's visited
you here, several times

63
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,179
where you've taken
advantage of her virtue.

64
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,596
And it was her clear assumption

65
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,471
that you were betrothed to her.

66
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,179
She's a lying bitch, Sir.

67
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,804
- Calm down, Reinhard.
- How can I calm down, Sir?

68
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:46,934
This woman... this woman is
trying to ruin my reputation.

69
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,350
You've been summoned
to appear in court.

70
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,684
With immediate effect.

71
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:04,826
- For a court martial, Sir?
- <i> Yes.

72
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,763
You're a good soldier, Reinhard,

73
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:15,100
but there is nothing more I
can do to help you on this.

74
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,643
This young woman's father is best
friends with Admiral Raeder in Berlin.

75
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,100
Your Honor, this scurrilous
accusation is nothing but lies.

76
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:34,393
Yet this is your
signature, is it not?

77
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:45,018
This young lady did come
and visit you at your request.

78
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,804
But it was never a
serious relationship, Sir.

79
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:52,059
And Miss Wiegel was
always aware of that.

80
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,475
<i>So, you did have sexual relations
with this young woman?

81
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:09,725
<i>I ask you again, did you or did you not
have sexual relations with Miss Wiegel?

82
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:18,684
<i>She was the one who
insisted upon seeing me.

83
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,350
And now, out of nothing but pure
jealousy is trying to ruin my future marriage.

84
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,809
I know you know what I mean.

85
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:34,850
I know you all know what I mean, none of you,
none of you men would marry a woman like this.

86
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,768
<i>This court does not consider such behavior
befitting an officer of the German Navy.

87
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,393
<i>I pity the man who
has to call you "son".

88
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,725
You're relieved.

89
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:46,846
No visitors! I said no visitors!
None! None! None!

90
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,975
<i>Open the door!

91
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,018
We need to think
about our future.

92
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,471
She was nothing to me.
<i>What?

93
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,554
She meant nothing to me!
<i>Nothing!

94
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:32,018
You'll never, ever speak of her, about this again.
Never!

95
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,350
And be a man.

96
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:39,893
Don't cry.

97
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,809
Pull yourself together.

98
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:50,225
You want to be
my husband...

99
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,143
you be my husband.

100
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:56,763
And I mean it.

101
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:01,018
We will never, ever
talk about this again.

102
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,476
Put some clothes on.

103
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:54,471
<i>Your future father-in-law
told me a lot about you.

104
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,387
<i>How long have you
been a Party member?

105
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:01,555
- <i>Two months, Herr Himmler.</i>
- Not long.

106
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:05,601
- <i> I was in the Navy before that, Sir.</i>
- I know.

107
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,849
- You were disgraced.
- Yes.

108
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,059
That's of little concern to me.

109
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:25,846
I'm looking for someone to run
the new SS Intelligence Unit.

110
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:30,518
Its objective is to gain
information on our political enemies.

111
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:36,212
<i>And expose infiltration by
government agencies and foreign powers.

112
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:41,101
Tell me, what is your
philosophy on intelligence gathering.

113
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:47,184
Intelligence is a marriage
of instinct and information, Sir.

114
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,512
Go on.

115
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,721
Intelligence requires
organization and industry.

116
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,309
No one, Herr Himmler, will work harder
than me and no one will be more organized.

117
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,684
Can you prove this?

118
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:04,351
Your chicken farm.

119
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,393
It makes no money,
am I correct?

120
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,505
<i>It's not your fault,
Herr Himmler.

121
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:12,512
You have 6 sheds, 70 chickens
in each, but you have foxes...

122
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:15,971
getting inside, I noticed the holes
along the fence as I arrived.

123
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,512
You're not here enough to insure adequate
maintenance and your farm hand is overweight

124
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:24,101
and unable to perform
physically demanding work.

125
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:27,018
For an efficient farm

126
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,921
<i>you need proper up-keep and economies of
scale vastly in excess of what you have now.

127
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,971
See, I could run this farm for you
and I guarantee within six months,

128
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,471
I would give you a
ten-fold increase in profit

129
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,143
and a complete
eradication of fox attacks.

130
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,351
Or I could run your new
SS Intelligence Division.

131
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,101
You could.

132
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:03,805
<i>So, you're saying he's married to a Nazi
Party member, but he's actually a Communist?

133
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,471
<i>Absolutely, Sir.

134
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,809
- And you can prove this?
-<i> It's confirmed by different sources, Sir.

135
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,096
Excellent, Dormer,
thank you very much.

136
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,976
Right, Sir.

137
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,887
- You're Mueller, yes?
- Yes, Commandant.

138
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,846
I've been assigned to
you by Herr Hitler.

139
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,055
I know. Heydrich. Welcome.

140
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:34,346
Our first objective here, Mueller

141
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,809
is to put an end to
these communist criminals.

142
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:45,221
I no longer want to see their posters
on our streets, or on our nation's walls.

143
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,184
No German should
have to read this filth.

144
00:20:55,835 --> 00:21:02,059
<i>The Communist Party is the only
party that protects the workers!

145
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:06,268
Lies!
Filth!

146
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,887
<i>All power needs men...
in the shadows,

147
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:16,555
taking care of the
most important secrets.

148
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:18,180
Do you agree, Rohm?

149
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:26,809
You tell your comrades there is one party,
one people, one Germany, one Führer!

150
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,434
<i>I've heard a lot about you,

151
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,101
and all about your methods.

152
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,893
They say you have spies and
informants all over the capital.

153
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:43,101
<i>And enemies of the Party
are in terror of you.

154
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,887
<i>You should join the SA, in fact.

155
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:52,262
Aw, come, you have 40,000 soldiers
already, isn't that enough for you?

156
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:58,867
Jealous are you, just because your
little SS is operating out of a shoe box?

157
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,637
<i>I've known Adolf
for a very long time.

158
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:10,018
Yes, you are important to him now, at
least until he gets the Party into power.

159
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,684
Well, we'll see about that.

160
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,934
- This wine is really delicious.
- Yes, it is.

161
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,518
- To Germany!
- To Germany!

162
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:31,018
- ...put him in a shoe box!
- Yes, he's the man with the shoe box.

163
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:34,180
Yes, he's funny, he's a germ.

164
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,884
Yeah, I'm going to mop the SA with it.

165
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:41,851
You know who Hitler is?

166
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:46,180
That's him, see that man<i> in the picture?
That's our leader?

167
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,430
And he's just been named the Chancellor
of Germany. Do you know what that means?

168
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,268
It means that he'll be
able to<i> save our country.

169
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:56,184
That's why mommy and
daddy are so happy today.

170
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:13,809
<i>Mein Führer, I stand by the
principle that only the best of our people...

171
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,180
the racially, most
carefully selected

172
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,137
of excellent character, and pure spirit,

173
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:26,393
are capable of providing a service to combat all
that is negative in returning our Nation to greatness.

174
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:31,268
I am German, Mein Führer,
and I love my Country.

175
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:40,976
<i>Commander Heydrich</i> has assembled elements
confirming the Führer's doubts about Rohm and his men.

176
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:45,393
<i>It is our duty,
as members of the SS,

177
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,809
to eliminate anybody that stands in
the way of the Führer and his great plan.

178
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:57,434
<i>Our time has come to purify the Party
and eliminate all dissident members.

179
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,101
Never leave dirty
glasses on the table.

180
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:58,471
Lina, stop running around
like a headless Chicken.

181
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,018
Come, sit next to
me for a moment.

182
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:08,012
We are so happy that you
made the time to see us today.

183
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,101
But, of course.

184
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,143
- <i>You must be very proud.
- Ah, two boys,</i> it's wonderful.

185
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,268
I mean about Heydrich.

186
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:26,059
You were the one who put him
on the right path to the Party.

187
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:31,309
- He will go far.
- I knew he would.

188
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,018
Reinhard is special.

189
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,768
He's very special.

190
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:47,726
You know what the
Führer calls him?

191
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,101
The man with the iron heart.

192
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,768
Heydrich.

193
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,226
A boy or a girl?

194
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:47,893
You are the elite.

195
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,393
A new political warrior.

196
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,268
Chosen because of your racial quality,

197
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,934
your ideological commitments,

198
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,351
your competence.

199
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:06,101
The Führer has trusted us with
the most important of missions...

200
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:11,288
<i>The Germanization of the newest Reich.

201
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,637
<i>Where the Wehrmacht conquers,

202
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,226
<i>we must cleanse.

203
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,137
<i>All aliens, all sick,

204
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:24,143
<i>all hostiles to the nation,

205
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,934
<i>will be eliminated.

206
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:46,762
<i>This is too much for the
individual. For us, the SS,

207
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:51,768
the Einsatzgruppen,
will be strong!

208
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,987
<i>I'll anoint you
of your sacred oath.

209
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:00,518
<i>Spare neither your own blood
nor the blood of others.

210
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:03,871
<i>When the fate of the
Nation depends upon it,

211
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:07,471
<i>future generations will
thank us when they realize

212
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,101
<i>what we have undertaken.

213
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,805
- I've kept you waiting, General.
- Not at all, Sir.

214
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:15,018
You've had a long journey?

215
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,555
Enjoyable.

216
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,596
You move quickly, General.

217
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,096
The war goes well.

218
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:25,351
It appears your troops have no
equal, they sweep all before them.

219
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,846
I know you're busy so I'll
come straight to the point.

220
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:33,055
My Einsatzgruppen cannot
perform as expected...

221
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:36,309
without the proper support and
co-operation of the Wehrmacht, Sir.

222
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,512
I run a regular army,
General Heydrich.

223
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:43,226
We fight other armies,
your men are thugs.

224
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,518
The Führer, Sir,
is fighting a war unlike any other.

225
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,351
A war?

226
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,971
I'm a general of the Wehrmacht.

227
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,346
I was fighting at Verdun
before you even reached puberty.

228
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,762
<i>Don't try to tell
me about wars.

229
00:32:55,792 --> 00:33:00,351
You are right, you do your
job and I will do mine.

230
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:02,893
And my job, General,

231
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,101
is policing and intelligence.

232
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,226
Yes, I watch, I take notes, and I inform.

233
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:17,143
And I will be informing the Führer's office
of your predilection for young whores.

234
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:19,637
I beg your pardon.

235
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:24,371
<i>Berlin Brothel, 22nd of August.</i>
Ilena Mandel, 21 years of age.

236
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:26,805
22nd of November,

237
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:28,884
Katarina Werkt, 17 years of age.

238
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:31,684
- February 9th...
- Enough!

239
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,762
You are a high ranking
officer of the German Wehrmacht

240
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:39,226
and flaping impure women and
bringing disgrace upon your family.

241
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,893
I doubt any court martial
will look kindly upon you.

242
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,601
You'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

243
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,101
So?

244
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,143
I will send you all the information gathered by
the Wehrmacht on the opponents of the regime.

245
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:10,851
But you can only begin your
cleansing after we have left.

246
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,684
Excellent.

247
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:27,559
Ready? Fire!

248
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,643
Step forward.

249
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:44,846
There a problem?

250
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,976
The guns are jamming
in the heat, General.

251
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,351
Again.

252
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,262
G.

253
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,101
H minor.

254
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:39,471
Okay, from beginning.

255
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,596
It's so nice to spend
a little time together.

256
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:45,268
Well, we're going to be spending more
time together once we get to Prague.

257
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,150
Prague?

258
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,476
Klaus.

259
00:35:55,043 --> 00:36:01,018
The Führer has made your father
High Protector of Bohemia & Moravia.

260
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,643
<i>From the beginning.

261
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,059
Reinhard...

262
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:24,592
No, watch your pedal.

263
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,971
- How long have you known?
- We'll be getting there in a month.

264
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:30,143
Pick it up... again.

265
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,721
Concentrate.

266
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,804
A month?

267
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:37,536
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Klaus.

268
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:42,032
Because it's confidential.
Come on, you can do better than that, okay?

269
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:57,351
We stand at a unique
moment in history.

270
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:05,851
Prague, alongside Berlin and Vienna,

271
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:12,601
has been chosen to become the first
city free of Jewry in the new Reich.

272
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:17,012
My predecessor's
policy of tolerance

273
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:20,900
is no longer enough to
achieve this objective.

274
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,976
All Jews will be required to immediately
report to the nearest police station

275
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:34,101
and are required to wear a
distinctive symbol<i> testifying to their race.

276
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:43,976
All Czech resistance organizations will
be destroyed and dismantled without mercy.

277
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:53,275
<i>At the same time we will increase the salaries
of all Czechs working in the armaments factories.

278
00:38:54,626 --> 00:39:03,226
<i>The Czech people must know</i> that so long
as they are our friends, we will be theirs!

279
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:10,809
Smile.

280
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,268
You're leaving?

281
00:39:57,085 --> 00:39:58,851
Where are you going?

282
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:02,146
- Berlin.
- Berlin?

283
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:07,054
- Why?
- Because it's Berlin, because...

284
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,012
I have a very important meeting.

285
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:12,804
- I see.
- Yes.

286
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,643
Were you going to
tell me about it?

287
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:26,934
<i>Reinhard, the only reason I know you're
going is when I see your cases in the hall.

288
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,827
- <i>I can't take it anymore.
- Take what?

289
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:36,262
I feel you've
abandoned me here.

290
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:40,150
I don't know who I am and I don't...
know who you are.

291
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,038
Yes, well...

292
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,420
<i>You're doing brilliantly, I know.

293
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:49,304
But I go out in the streets
and everybody knows who I am,

294
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:51,195
and I feel like some
sort of strange animal.

295
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:53,385
What is it that you
want, did you want me...

296
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:55,721
did you want to go back
to Germany, is that it?

297
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,351
No.

298
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:00,434
I want to be with you.

299
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,596
You are with me.

300
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,612
But I want to be with you.

301
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:09,101
Yes.
Thirty minutes.

302
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:12,101
Thirty minutes,
is that all I get?

303
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:22,018
Reinhard, you wouldn't even
be here if it wasn't for me.

304
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,762
Have you forgotten
about our past?

305
00:41:24,793 --> 00:41:25,887
Who saved you?

306
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,518
Enough!
Okay! Enough!

307
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,726
You're my wife.

308
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:38,309
<i>One more word and you
won't be much longer.

309
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:51,226
I'm sorry.

310
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:07,286
<i>In addition to the wider issues of
methodology and timescale of the cleansing,

311
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:13,596
<i>there are important clerical and legal
decisions to be made at this meeting.

312
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:16,471
I've itemized them as follows.

313
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:18,434
Please hand them around.

314
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:21,429
Jews with military decoration.

315
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,346
Half Jews, quarter Jews,

316
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:27,351
Jews of mixed marriages.
We shall review them all one by one.

317
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:31,554
Will you please turn to page 5, gentlemen,
this will give you some idea of the task at hand.

318
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:36,976
The figures from our most recent census,
dated the 1st of January 1942.

319
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:39,221
Germany: 700,000.

320
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:42,471
Poland: Two million.
Latvia: 300,000.

321
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:44,846
Lithuania: 150,000.

322
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:47,262
Estonia: Already cleansed.

323
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:49,387
Satellite countries.
Slovakia: 88,000.

324
00:44:49,418 --> 00:44:50,637
<i>Croatia: 40,000.

325
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:53,971
<i>Allies: Italy, including Sardinia: 58,000.

326
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,804
<i>Neutral countries: 18,000.

327
00:44:55,835 --> 00:44:58,637
<i>Sweden: 8,000.
Turkey: 55,000.

328
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:01,054
<i>And so on, down the page.

329
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:05,179
<i>The Einsatzgruppen are already
working at maximum efficiency.

330
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,668
Elimination of between 11 and 12 million
individuals requires a more systematic approach,

331
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:13,184
requires more advance technology.

332
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:16,012
<i>There's much work to be done.

333
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:20,346
<i>The final solution aims to group
our Jews in concentration camps,

334
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:25,304
<i>separated by sex, those that can work will
build roads, et cetera, in these territories.

335
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:28,387
<i>Which should result in the
natural reduction in their number.

336
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:34,059
<i>The rest, we should apply treatment
more conducive to mass extermination.

337
00:46:43,085 --> 00:46:44,768
First!

338
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,726
And in the head, look!

339
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,476
Accept defeat, Private Gabcik.

340
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:27,387
<i>You can come over here
and just whisper in my ear.

341
00:47:27,418 --> 00:47:30,512
<i>- You tell me!
- I'd like to but it's above your pay grade.

342
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:33,554
Slovak to Slovak, you tell me,
you are going to go, right?

343
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,304
You are going to go and
join the Three Kings.

344
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:36,762
You're wasting your breath, Gabcik.

345
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:38,846
- Why, why am I wasting my breath?
- I already tried.

346
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:40,679
- Jan, Jan come, come.
- Guess what?

347
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,012
Soldier to soldier.

348
00:47:43,043 --> 00:47:45,440
<i>Yes, you're going to go and
you're going to join the resistance

349
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,471
you're going to fight
with Moravec, yes?

350
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:48,429
Who knows?

351
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,434
<i>All right, Valcik.

352
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:55,170
If you have to go that badly
<i>we have been given a mission...

353
00:47:55,201 --> 00:48:02,268
Well, Valcik, we've been asked to go in, rescue,
and safely bring back all the President's suits.

354
00:48:05,193 --> 00:48:07,637
<i>Prick.
Prick!

355
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:10,137
- It's true! It's true!
- <i> You lie, liar.

356
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:12,637
Finally! Finally!

357
00:48:12,668 --> 00:48:14,893
Now I understand.

358
00:48:15,418 --> 00:48:17,934
No more commission, Valcik.

359
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:32,268
<i>We're about to prepare for Pilsen!

360
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:35,351
<i>Jan and Jozef come first.

361
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:38,226
<i>The others in 5 minutes..

362
00:51:15,126 --> 00:51:17,268
No, it's still tangled, Jan.

363
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:22,309
God damn it!

364
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:29,637
Do you realize the resistance
dropped two parachutists last night?

365
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:30,432
Yes, Sir.

366
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,992
We are working on it.

367
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:35,554
And where are you
with the Three Kings?

368
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,684
We're still looking.

369
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,887
Do you need my help?

370
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:44,054
No, Obergruppenführer.

371
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:46,304
Let me know when it's done.

372
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:48,170
<i>Of course.

373
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,471
I really thought we'd lost you.

374
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:30,601
The security checks are getting
tighter. Especially going into Prague.

375
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:36,851
We'll have to split up,
<i>blend into the crowd.

376
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,726
Work certificates.

377
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:47,393
Wear this when you arrive.

378
00:53:47,668 --> 00:53:50,059
The contact will know you.

379
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:28,434
Hello, Jozef.

380
00:54:33,168 --> 00:54:36,476
<i>You.
Your papers.

381
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:46,896
- Which department do you work for?
- Lipanska.

382
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:51,851
This is my family.

383
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:55,471
Say hello to your cousin.

384
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:57,693
Hello, Jozef.

385
00:55:57,724 --> 00:55:59,931
- Hello.
- Hello.

386
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,309
We don't talk in
front of them.

387
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:22,487
<i>Actually, don't talk at all,
everyone is a potential enemy.

388
00:56:22,518 --> 00:56:28,387
The Nazis starved us,
then they told us information was priceless.

389
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:31,101
That's how they turn
people against each other.

390
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:34,034
Thank you.

391
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:41,684
Your friend is safe.

392
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:57,976
Tonight you will sleep here,<i> but tomorrow,
both of you will join your new family.

393
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:09,684
Since they spotted the aero plane,
the Nazis have been tailing us constantly.

394
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:12,478
Heydrich wants the heads
of the Three Kings.

395
00:57:12,507 --> 00:57:15,471
- I still need to meet them.
- Yes, of course.

396
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:18,048
I will tell you where and when.

397
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:22,518
<i>First, a contact from your
new family will meet you.

398
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:28,934
- Sorry, we are closed.
- I just wanted a quick shampoo.

399
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:33,762
Don't worry, I'll take care
of him, I'll close up after.

400
00:57:33,793 --> 00:57:35,768
You're Jozef.

401
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,309
I've been waiting for you.

402
00:57:49,626 --> 00:57:53,143
Sit there, we're going to
charge you this shampoo.

403
00:58:45,835 --> 00:58:48,101
You can come in now.

404
00:58:51,751 --> 00:58:55,018
If you need anything
else, just ask.

405
00:58:56,085 --> 00:58:59,268
My wife left some
clothes on the bed for you.

406
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:03,304
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you, Mr. Novak.

407
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,059
Good night.

408
00:59:17,543 --> 00:59:19,713
Go to your room!

409
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:28,309
Pillows.

410
00:59:34,135 --> 00:59:39,809
Normally this is my room, but,
I'm going to sleep with my sister.

411
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:48,012
This is a good cover for you if we
walk through the city together.

412
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,101
This is true, yes.

413
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,143
Don't tell father.

414
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:55,864
Where is he!?

415
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,018
Talk to me! Huh?

416
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:01,226
Where is he!?
Where!?

417
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,726
Reichsprotektor.

418
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:11,643
- Jozef Masin, he can hear me, yes?
- Yes, he can.

419
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:14,601
Jozef.

420
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:18,101
It's Heydrich.

421
01:01:18,376 --> 01:01:20,293
The Reich protector.

422
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:29,476
Vaclav Moravek, where is he?

423
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:34,891
No.

424
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,206
Stand up.

425
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:40,030
<i>- He's paralyzed.
- He's what?

426
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:43,101
- He's paralyzed.
- Then get him up!

427
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,184
Where are the parachutists?

428
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,268
What do they want?

429
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:58,096
What does England want, Jozef?

430
01:01:58,126 --> 01:02:00,393
Vaclav Moravek, where is he?

431
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:06,143
Long live Czechoslovakia!

432
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:13,851
Long live Czechoslovakia.

433
01:02:15,876 --> 01:02:19,851
There are Three Kings, gentlemen.

434
01:02:21,835 --> 01:02:23,893
Find Moravek.

435
01:03:00,835 --> 01:03:02,434
Jan.

436
01:03:06,168 --> 01:03:08,768
- Glad to see you, my friend.
- Oh, yeah?

437
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:12,096
- How are you?
- I'm good and you?

438
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:14,721
I'm okay,
I've been reading books.

439
01:03:14,751 --> 01:03:16,596
- You've been reading?
- Yes.

440
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,846
I don't believe it!

441
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:21,721
I'm with these old people who just
drink tea and play bridge all day.

442
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,679
I'm going out of my mind,
I'm starting to miss England.

443
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,851
You poor thing.

444
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:31,101
What's that face?

445
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:33,554
- What's that face?
- That face?

446
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:36,222
- It's my face.
- You've seen some action already, haven't you?

447
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:38,516
- No.
- Uh-hm.

448
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:41,179
Don't lie to me, Jan.

449
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:44,184
Smell this... smell.

450
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:48,096
- You smell like lavender.
- Lavender!

451
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:49,971
You know there's a war on?

452
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:52,684
Where are you getting
lavender shampoo?

453
01:03:57,085 --> 01:03:59,184
That's Moravek.

454
01:04:16,717 --> 01:04:18,893
Please, sit down.

455
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:26,101
Something serious has happened.

456
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,291
The SS found our hideout.

457
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,346
They killed Balaban.

458
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:33,934
And Masin must be
dead by now, too.

459
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,268
I am the last of the
Three Kings left.

460
01:04:37,876 --> 01:04:41,893
And apparently Heydrich has
heard about the operation.

461
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,054
He's desperately trying to
find out why you're here.

462
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,018
He'll know it
soon enough, Sir.

463
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,184
Listen to me.

464
01:04:51,043 --> 01:04:55,101
This is not just a new mission
London has entrusted you with.

465
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:57,101
<i>Understand me?

466
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,226
Yes Sir.

467
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:05,018
You have one of these?

468
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:16,262
<i>I know someone who can
fill you in about Heydrich.

469
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:19,143
- When can we meet him?
- <i> Tomorrow.

470
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:22,489
Prepare the operation.

471
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:28,476
<i>As soon as you are ready,
I'll tell you about your escape plan.

472
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,045
You can leave now.

473
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:39,512
What do you do at the chateau?

474
01:05:39,543 --> 01:05:41,768
We take care of the house.

475
01:05:42,168 --> 01:05:43,420
And you work there all week?

476
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:48,262
Yes, at dawn until Mrs. Heydrich
tells me to leave, usually quite late.

477
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:51,780
I want you to make a note
of the time that he leaves

478
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:54,668
and the time that
he comes back.

479
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:58,764
<i>He ever take the
paramilitary as an escort or not.

480
01:05:59,018 --> 01:06:03,429
<i>You will pass on the information
to the contact of your own choice.

481
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,304
<i>Think of someone in the
suburbs in the north of the city,

482
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:10,476
<i>Where the soldiers never go
for fear of getting their boots dirty.

483
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:18,393
<i>Jozef will come in person, pick up the information
every afternoon at five at the tram stop on Turska Street.

484
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:30,579
<i>I want to know
every move he makes.

485
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,059
<i>I want to know all
his little habits.

486
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:08,101
I'm fit today.

487
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,184
Give me a sample,
you can have the rest.

488
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:29,143
<i>So, I found the place.

489
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:35,311
It will be on the bend on the road on the
outskirts of town where you pass it every day.

490
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,721
Ten o'clock, every day,
as if clockwork.

491
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:45,012
<i>Ideally we would make a triangle, so somebody
could stand in the top of the van as a look-out.

492
01:07:45,043 --> 01:07:47,346
We need three to make a
triangle, or don't we?

493
01:07:47,376 --> 01:07:50,179
<i>- Well, I'll ask Moravek for another man.
- Moravek?

494
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:52,679
<i>- You heard from him?
- No, but we will.

495
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:56,588
<i>I hope so, Jan, because without him
we're not going to get out of Prague.

496
01:08:00,751 --> 01:08:03,518
- Dance with me.
- Dance?

497
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:16,595
Jozef is Slovakian, isn't he?

498
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:21,935
- How did you two meet?
- In Poland two years ago.

499
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:28,268
I had just escaped across the
border to join the Free Army.

500
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:34,180
Hitched a ride in the back of a farm truck.
Jozef was in the back.

501
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,060
He talked all the
bloody way to Krakow.

502
01:08:43,126 --> 01:08:45,935
Promise me
you'll get out alive.

503
01:09:24,585 --> 01:09:27,180
<i>Moravek's inside,
he has no way out.

504
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,018
<i>Good, get him.

505
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,143
Your Three Kings are dead.

506
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:28,393
The Resistance is finished.

507
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:33,185
Go home, tell your family,
tell your friends, it's over.

508
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:34,268
<i>Valcik.

509
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:37,893
<i>Valcik.

510
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:42,893
<i>Read this.

511
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:47,887
<i>Sweet Jesus!

512
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:50,100
<i>We have a message from London.

513
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,512
We are all Czech here,
so this concerns all of us.

514
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:58,018
If you kill Heydrich,

515
01:11:58,335 --> 01:12:03,518
you're not only putting your own lives in
danger, but the lives of everyone in this room.

516
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:06,225
<i>Think about the people.

517
01:12:06,417 --> 01:12:09,475
<i>You know what the reprisals
will be if you succeed.

518
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:14,305
Forget about orders from
London, this is about our futures.

519
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,475
<i>He's right, Jan.

520
01:12:18,248 --> 01:12:22,650
Think about your loved one,
think about what they will go through.

521
01:12:24,335 --> 01:12:26,768
Think about my loved ones.

522
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:31,225
I do, I do think
about my loved ones.

523
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:36,453
Sometimes I wish they even
chose somebody else to do this.

524
01:12:38,626 --> 01:12:42,400
So, give up the
mission, Jan.

525
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:45,512
Heydrich must die.

526
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:50,850
- At any... at any price?
- You talk about the Resistance, you talk about...

527
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:54,180
All the people in this room, what do
you think we are here for, Opalka?

528
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:56,387
Think about everybody else
who has to live here, too?

529
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,805
<i>- Curda, we are fighting a war.</i>
- I know what we are fighting, Jan.

530
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:03,012
But this won't change the war.
This won't change anything.

531
01:13:03,042 --> 01:13:05,798
Curda, you are wrong. Not one
high ranking Nazi official has

532
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:10,185
ever been assassinated by any
resistance... across Europe.

533
01:13:10,542 --> 01:13:14,845
<i>It is our job, our duty as
men, as soldiers, to do something.

534
01:13:14,876 --> 01:13:17,305
The world has to see that
they are not invincible.

535
01:13:17,335 --> 01:13:19,018
Okay, I agree.

536
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:23,788
And the world has to see that
Czechoslovakia will fight... we did not fight.

537
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:26,512
<i>This is a suicide mission.
There is no way out.

538
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:28,887
<i>This is why I'm asking.

539
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:34,935
If you do this, that you
understand, that you are sure.

540
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:37,685
Our talk is over.

541
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,680
Jan and I are going to kill Heydrich.

542
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,305
Valcik is going to help us.

543
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,810
Are you going to help us,
or are you going to sit by?

544
01:13:49,417 --> 01:13:51,850
I will not sit by.

545
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:58,475
I hope you succeed.

546
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:05,060
<i>For Czechoslovakia.

547
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:09,475
Good luck to all of you.

548
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:15,850
Damn it!

549
01:22:52,085 --> 01:22:53,637
...the bike! I left the bike!

550
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:56,305
- Can you...
- Halfway... Latwas Street, halfway down.

551
01:22:56,335 --> 01:22:58,176
- You need a doctor!
- The bike cannot stay there!

552
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:00,046
- Okay, okay, okay.
- ...please.

553
01:23:10,876 --> 01:23:13,637
How could you let
this happen? How?

554
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:17,975
- I assure you...
- You were supposed protect him, nothing else.

555
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,185
Where is he?

556
01:24:29,042 --> 01:24:33,100
- They're coming.
- What? -<i> They're coming.

557
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:48,100
What are you doing?

558
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,470
- He is my doctor.
- This young woman is asthmatic.

559
01:24:51,501 --> 01:24:54,060
With injured papers?

560
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,350
<i>There's nobody here!
Halt!

561
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:23,387
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

562
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:25,470
- Definitely?
- Yes, it's okay.

563
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:27,350
- Yes and you?
- I'm okay.

564
01:25:48,085 --> 01:25:50,364
- They are everywhere.
- Are you all right?

565
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,893
I'll come back for you.

566
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,967
- Hey - Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

567
01:27:49,501 --> 01:27:52,688
- Mom?
- Yeah.

568
01:27:56,376 --> 01:28:01,225
- What is it?
- What happened to the cousins?

569
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:08,393
Never talk about them.
You hear me?

570
01:28:09,335 --> 01:28:11,100
Never.

571
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,685
I come back in an hour.

572
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:25,643
I'm going to the church.

573
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:31,470
When we get out of here,
you know what I'm gonna do?

574
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:33,100
What?

575
01:28:33,376 --> 01:28:35,643
I'm going to win the war,

576
01:28:35,792 --> 01:28:38,512
marry Libiena
and take her to America.

577
01:28:38,542 --> 01:28:42,725
Well, but I thought that
was just a cover story.

578
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:47,475
I changed my mind.

579
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:51,100
What about you,
what are you going to do?

580
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:54,747
- Come to America!
- No.

581
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:00,143
I want to live here,
in a free country.

582
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:05,350
In a free country.

583
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:26,887
You'll have to leave the
country in these coffins.

584
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:29,595
So, how do you feel?

585
01:29:29,626 --> 01:29:31,475
This will work.

586
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,435
Good.

587
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:36,012
Okay, give me a
hand, will you?

588
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:38,850
We have to move
them down to the crypt.

589
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:51,600
- My children...
- <i>Tell me.

590
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:53,975
Raise...

591
01:29:55,251 --> 01:29:57,600
Raise our children...

592
01:29:59,146 --> 01:30:01,336
Raise...

593
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:04,643
good Aryans.

594
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:09,302
Worthy of the name.

595
01:30:14,001 --> 01:30:16,951
Good Germans.

596
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:23,100
How will I live without you?

597
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:30,720
Just believe...

598
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:33,060
<i>in the Führer.

599
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:37,100
Himmler is here.

600
01:31:19,626 --> 01:31:22,060
For the Führer.

601
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:41,850
<i>My father...

602
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,100
wrote an opera.

<i>There is a line I remember.

605
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:59,752
"is a barrel organ."

606
01:32:01,335 --> 01:32:04,826
"God turns the wheel."

607
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:10,060
"and we all dance to his music."

608
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:21,435
Make them dance.

609
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:29,475
Name?

610
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,935
Names now!

611
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:36,185
Králová.

612
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:38,600
Mucha.

613
01:34:39,376 --> 01:34:40,975
Gross.

614
01:34:42,126 --> 01:34:43,725
Velesý.

615

<i>Jan Mikalas.

617

Fire!

618
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:59,435
<i>There is a village outside
Prague called Lidice.

619
01:34:59,876 --> 01:35:05,537
<i>Some families there had a sons in the Czech
Army who escaped to join England in '38.

them were involved in the assassination.

Now you can make this stop.

01:40:03,376 --> 01:40:05,100
Burn his eyes!

Now!
Burn them!

643
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,268

Do you want him to stop?

01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:27,643
You want this to stop?

651
01:40:33,376 --> 01:40:35,643
For the last time,

652
01:40:36,501 --> 01:40:38,935
tell me where they are.

653
01:40:39,835 --> 01:40:41,725
<i>Tell me.

<i>I want them alive!

- What are you doing?
- There has to be a sewer.

01:48:57,542 --> 01:49:00,520
Under the street, we just
have to dig our way through.

659
01:49:00,551 --> 01:49:02,975
I think there's
one here, come on!

01:50:19,292 --> 01:50:21,393
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!

- Yes.

Come on!

667
01:51:43,376 --> 01:51:45,920
Come on,
what are you doing?

668
01:51:59,835 --> 01:52:01,643
What are you doing?

669
01:52:02,335 --> 01:52:04,143
Look.

670
01:52:06,710 --> 01:52:09,578
It's raising too fast, Jozef.

671
01:52:11,085 --> 01:52:13,310
We have six bullets.

672
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:17,518
What about America?

673
01:52:18,292 --> 01:52:22,435
There's a sewer right there,
there's a flaping sewer, Jan!

674
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,643
Come on!

675
01:53:24,751 --> 01:53:27,893
See you on the other
side, my friend.

676
01:53:32,585 --> 01:53:35,555
Listen now. Okay?

677
01:53:35,585 --> 01:53:37,725
You won't be alone.

678
01:54:48,417 --> 01:54:51,600
To Krakow?
May I?

679
01:55:00,626 --> 01:55:02,806
- Going to Krakow?
- Yes.

680
01:55:03,126 --> 01:55:05,180
- Jozef Gabcek.
- Jan Kubis.

681
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:07,430
Good to meet you Jan Kubis.

682
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,975
- You smoke?
- Yes, I do, much too much.
