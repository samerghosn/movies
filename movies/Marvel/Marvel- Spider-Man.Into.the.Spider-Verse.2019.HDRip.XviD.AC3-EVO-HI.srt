01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:21,503
- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.

2261
01:56:21,506 --> 01:56:24,039
- It's rude to point.
- You're being very rude.

2262
01:56:24,042 --> 01:56:26,076
Which one pointed first?

2263
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:28,043
Spider-Man pointed first.
Obviously.

2264
01:56:28,046 --> 01:56:29,744
- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.

2265
01:56:29,747 --> 01:56:31,480
Look at your finger.

2266
01:56:31,483 --> 01:56:32,782
I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.

2267
01:56:32,783 --> 01:56:34,417
You haven't seen pointing.

2268
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:36,619
You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!
