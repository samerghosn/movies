know about him?

gonna keep him sedated?

709

natural life, if I have to.

I'm your father.

You can trust me to do
what I think is right,
not what you think you want.

712
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:29,841
He is a human being.
He is also something else.

713
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:33,902
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his
little mood swings

714
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,277
in a populated area.

715
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,440
Yes, I'm aware of
the potential danger.

716
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,917
I'm also aware that
he saved my life.

717
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,454
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

718
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,386
I'm indebted to him for that.

719
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,087
He also put three men
in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

720
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,496
What do you want me to do?
I want you to help him!

721
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:55,030
Why is he such
a threat to you?

722
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,296
Because I know
what he comes from.

723
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,398
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

724
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:04,100
He says he doesn't
know his father,

725
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:08,579
but he's workin' in
the same exact goddamn
field his father did.

726
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:14,048
So either he's lyin'
or it's somethin' worse,
and he's...

727
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,246
What?

728
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,150
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

729
01:15:21,516 --> 01:15:23,552

01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,761

But I'm a scientist.

732
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:32,534
As a scientist, I believe
we can figure this out
and he can be helped.

thinks they have a weapon
on their hands.

Otherwise,
he'd be dead by now.

all they want,

But... Well, you know...

1226
02:09:31,462 --> 02:09:34,000
What is it?
Well, you know.

1227
02:09:34,065 --> 02:09:37,307
The usual loonies,
seein' things.

Right.

Look...

1231
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:49,015
If by some chance
he did survive,

1232
02:09:50,215 --> 02:09:53,923
and he should try to
contact you,
try to get in touch,

1233
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,592
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1234
02:09:58,657 --> 02:10:01,194
No, I wouldn't.

1235
02:10:02,728 --> 02:10:05,935
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1236
02:10:06,164 --> 02:10:09,475
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

I'm under surveillance.

1238
02:10:14,139 --> 02:10:16,050
I'll tell you, though,

1239
02:10:16,742 --> 02:10:18,585
that if he were alive,

1240
02:10:18,644 --> 02:10:21,851
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to

1241
02:10:21,947 --> 02:10:25,985
because as much as
I miss him, I...

1242
02:10:28,119 --> 02:10:30,155
I loved him. I...

1243
02:10:33,192 --> 02:10:34,328
Yeah.

1244
02:10:37,662 --> 02:10:39,335
I'm sorry, Betty.

1245
02:10:41,233 --> 02:10:42,768
I am so sorry.

1246
02:10:46,070 --> 02:10:47,640
