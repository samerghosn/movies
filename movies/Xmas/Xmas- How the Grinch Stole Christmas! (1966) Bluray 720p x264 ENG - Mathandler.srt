NARRATOR: Every Who down in Who-ville
liked Christmas a lot.

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,679
But the Grinch...

22
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:24,227
...who lived just north of Who-ville,
did not.

23
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:30,483
The Grinch hated Christmas,
the whole Christmas season.

24
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,154
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

25
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,825
It could be perhaps
that his shoes were too tight.

26
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,162
It could be his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

27
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,791
But I think that
the most likely reason of all...

28
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,880
...may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,050
But whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...

30
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:01,848
...he stood there on Christmas Eve
hating the Whos.

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:07,270
Staring down from his cave
with a sour Grinchy frown...

32
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,440
...at the warm lighted windows
below in their town.

33
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,986
For he knew every Who
down in Who-ville beneath...

34
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,198
...was busy now
hanging a holly Who-wreath.

35
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,701
And they're hanging their stockings.

36
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,662
He snarled with a sneer.

37
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,208
Tomorrow is Christmas.
It's practically here.

38
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:34,547
Then he growled,
with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming:

39
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:40,428
I must find some way
to keep Christmas from coming.

40
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:44,348
Or tomorrow, I know,
all those Who girls and boys...

41
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,561
...will wake bright and early,
they'll rush for their toys.

42
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:54,483
And then-- Oh, the noise. Oh, the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.

43
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,325
There's one thing I hate. All the noise.
Noise, noise, noise.

44
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:09,081
And they'll shriek squeaks and squeals,
racing round on their wheels.

45
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,004
They'll dance with Jing-Tinglers
tied onto their heels.

46
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,342
They'll blow their Floo-Floobers.
They'll bang their Tah-Tinkers.

47
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,934
They'll blow their Who-Hoobers.
They'll bang their Gah-Ginkers.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,485
They'll beat their Trum-Tookers.
They'll slam their Sloo-Slonkers.

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:44,367
They'll beat their Blum-Blookers.
They'll wham their Who-Wonkers.

50
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,371
And they'll play noisy games
like Zoo Zitta Ka Zay...

51
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:53,668
...a roller-skate type of lacrosse
and croquet.

52
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,384
And then they'll make
earsplitting noises deluxe...

53
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:06,389
...on their great big
Electro Who-Cardio Shluxe.

54
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,986
Then the Whos, young and old,
will sit down to a feast.

55
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:27,076
And they'll feast, and they'll feast.
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast.

56
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:33,082
They'll feast on Who-pudding
and rare Who-roast-beast.

57
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,420
Oh, roast beast is a feast
I can't stand in the least.

58
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:05,072
And then they'll do something
I hate most of all.

59
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,827
Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small...

60
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:15,958
...will stand close together
with Christmas bells ringing.

61
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:23,132
They'll stand hand in hand,
and those Whos will start singing.

NARRATOR: And the more the Grinch
thought of this Who-Christmas sing...

74
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,018
...the more the Grinch thought:

75
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,021
I must stop this whole thing.

76
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,025
Why, for 53 years,
I've put up with it now.

00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:28,239
I must stop Christmas from coming.

But how?

79
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,790
Then he got an idea. An awful idea.

80
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:44,213
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea.

81
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,678
GRINCH:
I know just what to do.

82
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,721
The Grinch laughed in his throat.

83
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,060
GRINCH: I'll make a quick Santy Claus
hat and a coat.

84
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,271
Then he chuckled and clucked:

85
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:04,066
GRINCH:
What a great Grinchy trick.

86
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:08,872

98

The Grinch looked around.

99
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,430
But since reindeer are scarce,
there was none to be found.

100
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,476
Did that stop the Grinch? Ha.
The Grinch simply said:

101
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:25,397
GRINCH: If I can't find a reindeer,
I'll make one instead.

102
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,694
So he took his dog, Max,
and he took some black thread...

103
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,240
...and he tied a big horn
on the top of his head.

104
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,263
Then he loaded some bags
and some old empty sacks...

105
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,059
...on a ramshackle sleigh,
and he whistled for Max.

[WHISTLES]

107
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,628
Then the Grinch said:
GRINCH: Giddap.

108
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,632
And the sleigh started down...

109
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,304
...toward the homes where the Whos lay
a-snooze in their town.

110
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,435
All their windows were dark.
No one knew he was there.

111
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:13,774
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...

112
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:20,531
...when he came to the first little house
on the square.

113
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,450
This is stop number one.

114
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:29,665
The old Grinchy Claus hissed as he climbed
to the roof, empty bags in his fist.

115
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,339
Then he slid down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.

116
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,676
But if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

117
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,513
He got stuck only once,
for a minute or two.

118
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,516
Then he stuck his head out
of the fireplace flue...

119
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:52,312
...where the little Who stockings
hung all in a row.

120
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,522
These stockings--

121
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,690
He Grinched.

00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,693
--are the first things to go.

123
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,118
Then he slithered and slunk
with a smile most unpleasant...

124
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,997
...around the whole room
and he took every present.

125
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,292
Pop guns, pampoonas,
pantookas and drums...

126
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,628
...checkerboards, bizzel-binks,
popcorn and plums.

127
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,756
Then he stuffed them in bags.
Then the Grinch, very nimbly...

128
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:25,012
...stuffed all the bags, one by one,
up the chimbly.

...little Cindy-Lou Who,
who was no more than 2.

151
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,789

-- there's a light on this tree
that won't light on one side.

159

Then he patted her head.

00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,674
And when Cindy-Lou Who
was in bed with her cup...

164
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,928
...he crupt to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

165
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,139
Then he went up the chimney himself,
the old liar.

166
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:01,603
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

167
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:07,275
On their walls, he left nothing
but hooks and some wire.

168
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,363
And the one speck of food
that he left in the house...

169
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:16,827
...was a crumb
that was even too small for a mouse.

170
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,832
Then he did the same thing
to the other Whos' houses...

171
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:27,045
...leaving crumbs much too small
for the other Whos' mouses.

172
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:33,446
♫ You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch

173
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:38,147
♫ With a nauseous supernaus

174
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:45,848
♫ You’re a crooked jerky jockey and,
♫ you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch

175
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:51,249
Your soul is an appalling dump heap.

176
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,450
Overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of rubbish imaginable

177
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:57,951
Mangled up,...

178
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:00,552
♫ ...in tangled up knots ♫

179
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:14,053
♫ You’re a foul one Mr. Grinch

180
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:18,654
♫ You’re a nasty wasty skunk

181
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:26,755
♫ Your heart is full of unwashed socks,
♫ Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch ♫

182
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:32,856
The 3 words that best describe you,
are as follows, and I quote...

183
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:34,057
"Stink,

184
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,057
Stank,

185
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,157
Stunk!"

186
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,501
It was a quarter of dawn,
all the Whos still abed...

187
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,961
...all the Whos still a-snooze...

188
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,255
...when he packed up his sled.

189
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:56,635
Packed it up with their presents,
their ribbons, their wrappings...

190
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:01,306
...their snoof and their fuzzels,
their tringlers and trappings.

191
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:27,165
Ten thousand feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit...

192
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,670
...he rode with his load to the tiptop
to dump it.

193
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,695
Pooh-pooh to the Whos.

194
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,864
NARRATOR:
He was Grinch-ily humming.

195
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,200
They're finding out now
that no Christmas is coming.

196
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,495
They're just waking up.
I know just what they'll do.

197
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,998
Their mouths will hang open
a minute or two.

198
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:13,879
Then the Whos down in Who-ville
will all cry boohoo.

199
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,797
-That's a noise--
-Grinned the Grinch.

200
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,884
--that I simply must hear.

201
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:24,306
He paused.
And the Grinch put a hand to his ear.

202
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,727
And he did hear a sound
rising over the snow.

203
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,147
It started in low...

204
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,983
...then it started to grow.

205
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:38,952
[WHOS HUMMING]

206
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,346
♫ Fah who for-aze
♫ Dah who dor-aze

207
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:54,347
♫ Welcome Christmas,
♫ Come this way

208
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:58,948
♫ Fah who for-aze
♫ Dah who dor-aze

209
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:03,149
♫ Welcome Christmas,
♫ Christmas Day.

210
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,450
♫ Welcome, Welcome
♫ Fah who rah-moose

211
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,851
♫ Welcome, Welcome
♫ Dah who dah-moose

212
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:16,052
♫ Christmas day is in our grasp

213
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:21,853
♫ - So long as we have hands to clasp ♫
- But this... this sound wasn't sad.

214
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:26,785
Why... this sound sounded glad.

215
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:33,416
Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small...

216
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:38,380
...was singing without any presents at all.

217
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,843
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming,
it came.

218
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:50,558
Somehow or other, it came just the same.

219
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,730
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...

220
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,234
...stood puzzling and puzzling.

221
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:03,989
How could it be so?
It came without ribbons.

222
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,076
It came without tags.

223
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,957
It came without packages, boxes or bags.

224
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,170
He puzzled and puzzed
till his puzzler was sore.

225
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,799
Then the Grinch thought of something
he hadn't before.

226
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:28,513
"Maybe Christmas," he thought,
"doesn't come from a store.

227
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:34,769
Maybe Christmas, perhaps,
means a little bit more."

228
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:24,360
And what happened then?
Well, in Who-ville they say...

229
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:30,742
...that the Grinch's small heart
grew three sizes that day.

230
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,706
And then the true meaning of Christmas
came through.

231
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:42,504
And the Grinch found the strength
of 10 Grinches plus two.

232
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,883
And now that his heart
didn't feel quite so tight...

233
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,261
...he whizzed with his load
through the bright morning light.

234
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,765
With a smile in his soul,
he descended Mount Crumpit...

235
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,268
...cheerily blowing Who-Who
on his trumpet.

236
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,232
He rode into Who-ville,
he brought back their toys.

237
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,069
He brought back their floof
to the Who girls and boys.

238
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:10,281
He brought back their snoof
and their tringlers and fuzzels.

239
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,160
He brought back their pantookas,
their dafflers and wuzzels.

240
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,373
He brought everything back,
all the food for the feast.

241
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:23,378
And he...
...he himself, The Grinch...

242
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:27,048
...carved the roast beast.

243
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:34,305
Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer.
Cheer to all Whos far and near.

244
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,727
Christmas day is in our grasp,
so long as we have hands to clasp.

245
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:45,233
Christmas day will always be
just as long as we have we.

246
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:52,407
Welcome Christmas while we stand,
heart to heart and hand in hand.
