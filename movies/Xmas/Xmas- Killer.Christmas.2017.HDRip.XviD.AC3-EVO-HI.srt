00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,086
It's cool, guys,
doesn't bother me.

180
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,369
[coughs]

181
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,210
[all laughing]

182
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,947
That's how you do it.

183
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,447
Bella, catch.

184
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,855
- Why not, right?
- There you go, Kate.

185
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,961
Take it all in, baby.

186
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,296
Game, game.

187
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,500
Game!

188
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,100
Frolic.

189
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,104
Sounds naughty.

190
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:29,039
So pair up, go into the forest,

191
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,543
and do ever your dirty
little mind's desire.

192
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,846
I've got Cutler, obviously.

193
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,447
Obviously.

194
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,918
Okay.

195
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:42,855
Well, we have already played,
so...

196
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:45,423
Let's go newbies.

197
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,859
Okay.

198
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:48,826
Margo.

199
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,065
So, I didn't really know we were
taking on when I signed up.

200
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,034
It's cool, don't worry.

201
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,940
We don't have to do anything,
I'm down to just chill.

202
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,508
Awesome, okay.

203
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,510
Or we could keep drinking.

204
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,344
I think I'm going
to take a pass.

205
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm already feeling
pretty light-headed.

206
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,951
Do you? No worries.

207
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:18,086
You know, I think most of these
games are stupid anyway.

208
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:21,360
What's the point of frolic
when Cutler always gets Bella?

209
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,028
We're not spinning
a bottle or anything random.

210
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,600
- So you're into Bella?
- I mean...

211
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,369
We had a thing once in college,
but like...

212
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,338
she wasn't feeling me.

213
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,008
She was more into Cutler.

214
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,044
And that doesn't make things
awkward between you guys?

215
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,883
Those two do whatever they want.

216
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,918
They don't give a flap, so...

217
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,325
You know, screw it,
give me that.

218
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,429
That's a stiff drink.

219
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,206
So, what do you say
if we play that game after all?

220
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,076
Let's play.

221
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:24,352
- I flaping love Christmas.
- flap you, you should love me.

222
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:27,022
Of course I do,
but I get my fat Christmas bonus

223
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,961
so I'm buying some shiny rocks
for my arm candy.

224
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:30,929
Asshole.

225
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,599
- The shiniest rocks.
- They better be.

226
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:39,004
Now let's go find
the perfect Christmas tree.

227
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:40,438
Let's go.

228
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,115
Margo!

229
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,092
Hey!

230
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,327
Looks like you had fun.

231
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,032
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

232
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,100
- Like your games, Bella.
- Thank you.

233
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,299
Where are Kate and Art?

234
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,768
flaping weirdo probably told her

235
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,770
he loves her,
she probably ran off.

236
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,240
Ok, that's mean.

237
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:20,644
Oh, look, there they are.

238
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,294
[Bella] Having fun?

239
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,196
Yeah, Art was telling me
some stories

240
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,668
from your college glory days.

241
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,501
Oh, yeah, which ones?

242
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,238
All of them.

243
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,207
Wow, and she didn't run away?

244
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,143
That bodes well.

245
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,143
Guys, it's getting dark.

246
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,548
Let's chop some trees down
before it closes.

247
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:58,649
[Kate] Right!

248
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,200
Is that all? No trees?

249
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,567
I couldn't found
those brats anywhere.

250
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,374
We drove the path, hit the back
lot, and all the side areas.

251
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:26,345
flap man, there's the SUV
they're still around here.

252
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,646
The old lady is cooking up
a stew, I gotta get out of here.

253
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,682
flap, I'm not waiting around
for those little shits.

254
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,487
Screw this shooot!

255
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,887
flap.

256
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,721
- You got this, Ruddy?
- Yeah, I got it.

257
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,394
Just do another lap here,
you don't find them, flap them.

258
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:46,131
- I'm getting out of here.
- Give me a ride to the bus.

259
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,232
- Hey, can I get a ride too?
- Hop on.

260
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,271
I got it, don't worry about it.

261
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,573
Have a nice flaping evening.

262
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:59,242
- Take it easy, Rud.
- Yeah, you too, buddy.

263
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,278
flaping assholes.

264
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,852
flap these kids, dude.

265
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,595
flap out of here, I'm leaving.

266
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,165
[child whispering]
Oh, Christmas tree.

267
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,269
Cutler!

268
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:29,539
- What's up?
- I love it.

269
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,442
So I can leave this one?

270
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,211
Yeah, [unintelligible]

271
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,181
I love when you talk shooot.

272
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,118
Yeah, flap the Colorado,
let's get this, we are set.

273
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:42,886
You got it, babe.

274
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,660
Where is everyone?

275
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:56,401
So pretty.

276
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,336
- You two are not getting a tree?
- No.

277
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:03,705
- No, our apartment is too small.
- Yeah, we live in a shoebox.

278
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,278
My room is literally the size
of the walking closet.

279
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:08,747
Timber!

280
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:14,684
- There you guys are.
- Hey, you guys see that truck?

281
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,488
- No.
- No.

282
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:20,323
Need any help with that, Cutler?
I'm a good helper.

283
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,625
I'm good, thanks though.

284
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,796
Looks like everything's
shut down.

285
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:26,961
[Cutler]
Damn, we missed it.

286
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,231
[Bella]
Free trees, bitches.

287
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,865
It'll be a bitch
trying to strap these on.

288
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:32,836
I think I got rope in my bag.

289
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,806
You always figure it out, babe.

290
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:37,275
[Margo] Look at the stars!

291
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:52,223
We're playing a different game.

292
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:56,326
- All right, moving along.
- My bad.

293
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,628
Have you ever been inside?

294
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,730
That hotel over there.

295
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,836
[child whispering]
Deck the halls.

296
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,704
Oh, no, not for me.

297
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:09,775
I'd go.

298
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,843
I'd go and see what kind
of shooot is in there.

299
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,409
Yeah.

300
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,810
Wow, looks great, guys.

301
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,645
Thanks.

302
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,650
Ladies and gentlemen,
this calls for a celebration.

303
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,688
- Game?
- Game!

304
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:24,588
How about a new game?

305
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:27,491
I don't know if you will.

306
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:28,826
Call it, kid.

307
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,662
Exploration.

308
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:32,997
We're going to the hotel.

309
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:38,401
- Yes.
- Nice.

310
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,270
I'm not playing that game.

311
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:42,906
You have to play,
that's how game works.

312
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:45,074
- No.
- Come on, Bella, it'll be fun.

313
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,778
It'll be so spooky.

314
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,878
You're not actually scared,
are you?

315
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,915
Bella.

316
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:59,289
I... you better stay beside me
the entire flaping time.

317
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,959
Babe, don't worry,
I'll protect you, I promise.

318
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:07,298
Look, in fact, I think mom
got some lights in the back.

319
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,433
Great.

320
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,843
Boom, check it out.

321
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,478
Always prepared.

322
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,778
Yeah, aren't you?

323
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,346
Actually,
I bought some flashlights

324
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:26,715
since were up in the boonies.

325
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,615
- Look at you.
- On top of it.

326
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:30,422
These are
quick up there, right?

327
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:34,623
Ok, guys, now this is a party.

328
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,326
Yeah!

329
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,599
Wow.

330
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:50,075
Here we go.

331
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,313
Oh my god, this is so exciting.

332
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,548
I don't know, it is literally
in the middle of nowhere.

333
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,681
This is not
the middle of nowhere.

334
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:02,385
- You should go to New Mexico.
- Or Iowa.

335
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,689
I drink to that.

336
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,858
Hey, don't worry,
you'll be fine, Bella.

337
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:10,528
There's a clearing over there.

338
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,364
Come on, let's go.

339
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,403
Ah, this place is so scary,
I love it.

340
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:23,939
So sick, I wonder how many
bodies are in there.

341
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:24,942
That's not funny.

342
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,977
I think four, what do you think?

343
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,513
I think maybe at least ten.

344
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,515
You guys suck.

345
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,083
They're just kidding,
there are no bodies in there.

346
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:36,121
- I bet there's one body.
- Cutler!

347
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:39,520
Hey, you think we can just walk

348
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:40,790
straight through
that front door?

349
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,692
I don't know,
looks pretty boarded up.

350
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,429
We could probably open it.

351
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,431
Onward, hoe.

352
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,667
Who are you calling a hoe?

353
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:53,572
- Oh, I just...
- I'm just flaping with you.

354
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,039
Why are you being such a dick?

355
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,144
Not being a dick,
just having some fun.

356
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,726
[child whispering]
Deck the halls.

357
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,673
[man groaning]

358
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:34,613
[laughter]

359
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:38,717
Oh, flap.

360
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,587
Looks like they're definitely
trying to keep people out.

361
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:48,057
So, how do we get in?

362
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,179
It's like one of those
urban explore things.

363
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,080
Let's look for loose boards
or nails that we can pull out.

364
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:12,717
This isn't a good idea.

365
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:17,454
- Thanks.
- Are you having fun?

366
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,757
Oh, my God, yes,
I'm having tons of fun.

367
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,759
I haven't let loose
like this in...

368
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:23,727
maybe ever.

369
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:25,994
You know your friends
are completely insane.

370
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,798
I mean, these games are crazy.

371
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:28,932
They get crazier.

372
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,900
Wait, crazier than this?

373
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,769
Yeah, they love
to flap with people's heads.

374
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,677
Come on,
let's go around the side.

375
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,516
Look at this place.

376
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,250
They are assholes.

377
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:51,786
Hey, why are you being
so uptight?

378
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:53,555
I'm not being uptight, Margo.

379
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,824
I don't want to be here,
this place creeps me out.

380
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,792
Yeah, that's why
it's so fun, Bella.

381
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:59,631
Come on, stop being so paranoid.

382
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,233
- So we didn't find any-
- Oh, shooot!

383
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:03,699
Sorry.

384
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,871
Jesus, it's not funny.

385
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,770
I'm so, so sorry.

386
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:09,973
You should've seen
the look on your face.

387
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,873
I hate you.

388
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,175
No you don't, you don't hate me,
you love me.

389
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:16,577
You love me, that's why
you wear that ugly sweater.

390
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:19,748
- Your games are stupid.
- My games are fun and funky, ok?

391
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,050
Who doesn't like
wearing festive sweaters?

392
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,686
Girls, I hate to ruin your
little menstruation session,

393
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,791
but we're not finding any way
in here so we gotta go round.

394
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:31,359
Can we get the hell out of here?
This isn't fun.

395
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:32,864
[Art] Stop being such a baby.

396
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:34,597
flap you, Art!

397
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,601
You're gonna
speak to me like that?

398
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,269
Guys, come on, chill out.

399
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:42,173
Geez, sorry, everyone, let's go.

400
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:44,973
Whatever Bella wants,
come on, game over.

401
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,677
Whatever, Art.

402
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,288
Babe, I got you, ok?

403
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,220
So that's how you treat me now?

404
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,390
Why don't you just
calm the flap down?

405
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,392
Don't talk to me like that.

406
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,294
- I'm just...
- I don't like this game.

407
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:07,729
I don't like all the games
you play either.

408
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,832
That's how this shooot works,
you know this.

409
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,932
This place just freaks me
the flap out.

410
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,737
That's the point, isn't it?

411
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,207
Come on, let's just go.

412
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,619
I bet there's someone in here.

413
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,686
Yeah and he's going
to come after you,

414
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,721
it'll be like freak vs. weirdo.

415
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,791
Which one is Art?

416
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:39,631
That farmer said
there's the occasional squatter.

417
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:42,930
Oh my God, imagine,

418
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:44,333
we could get
two of them to fight

419
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,903
and then live stream it.

420
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:48,204
We are out of service up here.

421
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:51,172
No, no, no, wait, we can make
them fight until they're dead

422
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:52,807
and then we can hang them
on the bridge

423
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:55,209
and wait for birds to eat them.

424
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:57,211
Ok, Margo,
this place is scary enough.

425
00:26:57,212 --> 00:27:00,882
I mean, I'm down,
I'd crush a hobo, let's do it.

426
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:03,788
You guys are fucked, like,
seriously fucked in the head.

427
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,625
You don't really think there's
a squatter there, do you?

428
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,894
I don't know, only way
to find out is if we go in.

429
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,098
Let's go.

430
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,132
Let's look for a thick piece
of wood or a branch

431
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:19,336
and we can pry this off.

432
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:21,373
So smart.

433
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:23,375
[Art] All brains that guy.

434
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,108
Don't forget the looks
and muscle.

435
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:27,278
I'm the total package over here.

436
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,045
Ok, total package,

437
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:31,782
why don't you find us
a way to get in?

438
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:34,986
Hey, guys!

439
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,355
Think I found a way in.

440
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:40,157
Nice find, man!

441
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:44,759
Here we go.

442
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,797
[Bella] This is stupid

443
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,666
[Cutler] Come on,
just get used to it.

444
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,355
Holy shooot!

445
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,824
What the flap happened here?

446
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,161
Oh, shooot.

447
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,038
Oh my flaping god.

448
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:32,076
Oh my god it's an oven.

449
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,711
[Bella] Stop.

450
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:38,214
[Margo] Oh my god,
look at this place.

451
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,487
[Bella] Guys, this is so stupid.

452
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:48,022
Stop, stop, this is such
a bad idea.

453
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:50,228
Bella, relax, come on,
it's not that bad.

454
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:53,197
[Bella] It's that bad.
[Cutler] Really?

455
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,296
[Bella] Yes, we need to get out.

456
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,431
Looks like someone did
a real number in here.

457
00:28:57,432 --> 00:28:59,104
Where's the flaping hobo?

458
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:01,969
Hello?

459
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:03,339
[Robbie] Hello?

460
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:04,843
[Margo] Anybody home?

461
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:09,078
Oh my god, there's a ball room
in here!

462
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,949
Onward, hoe!

463
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,154
Got another bottle?

464
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,788
I got you.

465
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,392
Let's do it.

466
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:27,096
You are coming or what?

467
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:35,240
Oh my god.

468
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,904
[Cutler] Great game, Art.

469
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,809
[Bella] Yeah, great
flaping good, Art.

470
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:42,980
Now that I think of it,

471
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:45,048
you haven't said anything

472
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:48,150
Wait, I thought we were playing
find the hobo.

473
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:50,121
I'm always playing
find the hobo.

474
00:29:50,385 --> 00:29:51,853
Wait, what? Why?

475
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:53,289
I want to play a new game.

476
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,160
So, don't want to play frolic?

477
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,162
The kid's horny as flap.

478
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,998
Uhm... how about...

479
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:02,964
hide and seek?

480
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,402
Yes, I love that game!

481
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,836
Throwback, I like it.

482
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:10,074
All right, kid.

483
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,576
You called it, you're up.

484
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,444
Go somewhere and count
I don't know, like a 100 or so.

485
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:18,282
Let's go.

486
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:19,951
One...

487
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:23,288
Close your eyes, no cheating.

488
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:27,125
Two... three... four...

489
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,826
five.

490
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,328
[child whispering]
Tis the season to be jolly.

491
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,615
[bells jingling]

492
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,027
Game on, bitches.

493
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:06,329
Stop.

494
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,528
Oh, this place is flaping dope.

495
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,431
It's creepy as shooot.

496
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:12,267
We don't even know
the half of it.

497
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,335
Looks like
it's been abandoned forever.

498
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:17,106
Looks like homeless people
took a shooot here, disgusting.

499
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:18,474
Oh, man.

500
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,212
Look at the graffiti
on the walls.

501
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,211
I just want to get out of here.

502
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:27,084
Babe, just relax, it's fine.

503
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,154
I'm going upstairs.

504
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:34,590
- No.
- This will calm the nerves.

505
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,326
I'm not really in the mood,
Cutler.

506
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:39,393
They don't like how you let Art
push you around,

507
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,199
you're supposed to be the alpha.

508
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,634
Art doesn't push shooot,
all right?

509
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:46,304
I've been dying to come
since we found this place.

510
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,171
And you're right, I'm the alpha.

511
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,910
Yeah, well, you're acting
like a flaping lap dog.

512
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:53,976
Really, Bella?

513
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,509
And who the flap is this new
flaping tweep?

514
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,179
What the flap is his deal?

515
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,615
Why do you always
have to be such a...

516
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,020
- Robbie is fine.
- Are we fine?

517
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:06,290
Of course we're fine.

518
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,026
We're flaping perfect.

519
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:09,928
You're my <i>número uno.</i>

520
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:16,933
Well, doesn't feel that way...
and I'm not going upstairs.

521
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:19,502
Then you can roll solo.

522
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,940
Because nobody pushes me around.

523
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:23,173
Nobody.

524
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:29,678
Are you flaping serious?

525
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,982
God dammit, Cutler.

526
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,126
What an asshole.

527
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:54,305
Let's go down here.

528
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:57,473
Are you even listening?

529
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:02,712
I am, I just think
you need to let go.

530
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,749
Have a little fun.

531
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,265
[Bella] Cutler, don't!

532
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,535
- Don't.
- Wow.

533
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,537
Look at this place.

534
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,106
flaping disgusting.

535
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,615
Stop, Cutler.

536
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:41,682
Oh my god

537
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:44,317
Oh my god, lighten up, Bella.

538
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,288
This is so stupid, Cutler.

539
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,355
Get the flap out of here.

540
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,161
[Cutler] Bella, relax.

541
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:52,362
People fucked in these rooms.

542
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:02,105
Oh, man.

543
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:14,217
You know, I hope I find Robbie
somewhere in a dark corner.

544
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,418
I'm going to make that boy
blush so hard.

545
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,454
Aren't you seeing
that guy from work?

546
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,759
Yeah, but come on,
Kate it's nothing serious.

547
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,527
Robbie is so cute,
he's like a little puppy dog.

548
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,695
Better hope he finds you
and not the hobo.

549
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:29,231
God, imagine.

550
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,565
Yeah, but seriously,

551
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,199
how fucked up would it be

552
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:33,336
if there really was
a hobo in here?

553
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,570
Watching us from the shadows.

554
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,641
He'd be pissed that we've been
creeping around.

555
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:41,141
Unless I made him blush too.

556
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:43,514
Margo, you are not hooking up
with a hobo tonight.

557
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:46,679
Sorry, it's just something
about this place

558
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:49,119
- that just makes me feel so...
- Horny?

559
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,786
And I thought my head was off.

560
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,356
Who said that it wasn't, huh?

561
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,398
Oh my god, look at these stairs!

562
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,434
Oh my god, I'm going to go
to the top floor!

563
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:08,172
If you see Robbie, send him up.

564
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,275
God.

565
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,813
How do this place make you feel?

566
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,686
I feel on edge, but...

567
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,889
in a good way, you know?
I want to keep going.

568
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:28,458
Shall we?

569
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:31,262
Game on.

570
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:34,465
Game... come on, let's not
give away our positions.

571
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,300
Let's go upstairs.

572
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,309
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

573
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,518
Ninety seven, ninety eight,

574
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:56,487
Ninety nine.

575
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,356
One hundred.

576
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:39,697
Game on.

577
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,730
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

578
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm not going to hurt you.

579
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,380
[bells jingling]

580
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:51,434
Brilliant.

581
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:57,275
This place.

582
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:07,451
flaping cool.

583
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:19,563
This floor?

584
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:21,465
No, let's keep going.

585
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,543
Never seen anything
like this before.

586
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,911
Don't they have like creepy
caves in New Mexico?

587
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:40,914
Wouldn't know, my friends back
home are not out of their minds

588
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,786
like you guys
with all these games.

589
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:44,755
We're pretty wild.

590
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:48,858
I mean, between that, this,

591
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,992
and the booze, I feel like
a completely different person.

592
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,931
- This floor?
- Ah...

593
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:56,666
One more.

594
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,536
Cool, I'm going to jump off here
and make things interesting.

595
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:01,806
I'll catch up with you later?

596
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,809
- You bet.
- See you.

597
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,025
Perfect.

598
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:36,873
Oh my god.

599
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:43,981
Hey, Kate.

600
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:46,550
Oh, hey, friend.

601
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,686
This place is so crazy.

602
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,853
I know, it's like
out of a nightmare.

603
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:54,525
I know, I wonder what's taking
Robbie so long.

604
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,190
You do know he's never
going to find you, right?

605
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,827
This place is huge.

606
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,563
Yeah, you have a point.

607
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,231
You'd probably go and start
looking for him.

608
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:06,971
I think I'm going to explore
more on my own first.

609
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,739
- All right, have fun.
- You too.

610
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,920
You better buy me
the nicest Christmas present

611
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:02,523
for putting me through this.

612
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:03,726
Oh, nothing but the best.

613
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,963
Cutler, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

614
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,532
- God.
- Oh, baby, let's go in here.

615
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:14,170
The flaping death room?

616
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,476
Let's get the hell out of here,
Cutler, it's so creepy.

617
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:23,710
[Bella] Oh my god.
[Cutler] Look at all these TVs.

618
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,815
[Bella] I don't care,
we need to go, please.

619
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,956
I'd hate to have to clean
this place up.

620
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,791
What a dump.

621
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:19,737
What the fu...

622
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:23,907
[sniffing]

623
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:51,034
[bells jingling]

624
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,639
Oh my god!

625
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,780
Oh my flaping god,
oh my god, are you all right?

626
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:40,818
Oh my god.

627
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,355
Help, somebody help!

628
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,954
Oh my god!

629
00:43:46,255 --> 00:43:48,891
Cutler! Art!

630
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:52,996
I'm going to help you!
Bella, Bella!

631
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,132
I promise.

632
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:57,934
[screams for help]

633
00:43:58,434 --> 00:43:59,702
Margo?

634
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,750
[footsteps]

635
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,862
[screams for help]

636
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,797
Margo?

637
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:38,139
Hey, babe,

638
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:39,407
how about a dirty movie to get
the party going?

639
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:42,275
Of course not.

640
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:45,014
Can you imagine this place
during its heyday?

641
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,347
Ew.

642
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:47,882
[screams for help]

643
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,349
- What was that?
- What the flap?

644
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:50,219
Did you hear that?

645
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,056
I think that was Margo.

646
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:55,025
- Where does it come from?
- I don't know, upstairs?

647
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:57,157
That's not good.

648
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,730
Cutler, let's just get the flap
out of here.

649
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:03,231
- Holy flap!
- [Bella] Oh my god!

650
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:09,237
OK, all right, Art,
you're funny.

651
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:10,907
What the flap?

652
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:14,710
Robbie?

653
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:19,181
Okay, you got us.

654
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,853
Oh my god!

655
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:25,221
[high-pitched screams]

656
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:40,237
[bells jingling]

657
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:45,442
[high-pitched screams]

658
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:49,010
[high-pitched screams]

659
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,349
Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella!

660
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:58,820
I'm losing you, I gotta go
and find... I'm so sorry.

661
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,155
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,
I will come back for you.

662
00:46:02,157 --> 00:46:03,492
I promise, I promise.

663
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:07,396
I promise I will come back
for you, I'm so sorry.

664
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:10,467
[high-pitched screams]

665
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:15,072
[loud screams]

666
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:18,106
Stop, stop!

667
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,791
[bells jingling]

668
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,110
My god.

669
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:56,313
Are you okay?

670
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:58,512
Did you hear Bella scream?

671
00:46:58,514 --> 00:46:59,981
Yeah, I heard a couple.

672
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,382
I thought
I heard you scream, too.

673
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:04,188
There's a girl upstairs,
she's chained to the bed.

674
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:06,621
Is this another game?

675
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,487
No, no, no, no!

676
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,489
There's a girl upstairs,
she's chained, her throat slit

677
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:12,260
and she said there's somebody
in here!

678
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:15,396
Ok, in that case,
we have to go and find her.

679
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:18,335
No, no, no, we need to go
find Bella, she was screaming.

680
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:20,137
Bella is with Cutler,

681
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:23,005
and to be honest, she's kind of
sensitive anyway.

682
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:27,141
Look, if there's a girl upstairs
we have to get her.

683
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:30,313
No, we need to go
and find Bella!

684
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:32,179
I'm going up, you do you.

685
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:34,351
No, flap you,
we need to find Bella!

686
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:37,353
Oh, flap!

687
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,123
[screams]

688
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:42,358
Bella?

689
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:43,626
What is happening?

690
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:48,030
Oh, God, please don't
let this be happening.

691
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:52,333
I should've
never left New Mexico.

692
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:53,335
Oh my god!

693
00:47:55,605 --> 00:47:57,007
Who's there?

694
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:00,206
[Art] Kate?

695
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,577
Oh my god, Art, it's you!

696
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:07,384
I'm scared,
did you hear those screams?

697
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,085
I don't know
where they come from.

698
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,523
There is a killer flaping hobo
right here.

699
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:15,322
There's somebody living here,

700
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:18,094
I saw cans of open
fresh food in the kitchen.

701
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,427
That's fucked.

702
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:25,067
We have to find Margo and Bella
and make sure everyone's ok.

703
00:48:25,534 --> 00:48:26,536
I got it, all right?

704
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:31,106
They're not gonna flap
with us, all right?

705
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:32,608
Okay.

706
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:35,177
[Art] Come on.
[Kate] Ok.

707
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:43,186
Which way is the girl?

708
00:48:44,518 --> 00:48:45,521
She's down there.

709
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:02,306
Wait, wait.

710
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:04,708
That room there.

711
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:16,052
Holy shooot.

712
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:22,358
Wait, no, this isn't the room.

713
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:25,559
Are you seeing this?

714
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:28,231
There's something seriously
fucked up here.

715
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,333
Who draw this shooot?

716
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,467
The girl that was chained
to the bed

717
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:36,172
said that there was
somebody here.

718
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,143
That's another one
of your games.

719
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:44,213
Who the flap would make
something like this up?

720
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:47,016
Know what, Robbie?
I'm done with you.

721
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:51,320
Look, you can't leave me.

722
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,786
Why not? You obviously
don't believe me.

723
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:55,324
Just in case this is real.

724
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,458
Who would make up
something like this?

725
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,331
All I'm saying is between all
this stuff, my mind is a haze.

726
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,137
- We need to find that girl.
- Wait.

727
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:12,141
No, no, no, this wasn't
the right graffiti.

728
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:16,277
- It's an upper floor?
- Yeah, yeah.

729
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,016
Yeah, the stairs, yeah.

730
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:33,693
You said you saw
open cans of food,

731
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:35,829
that can give us an idea
of who's in here.

732
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:37,597
Ok, I saw, I saw...

733
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,632
I saw two cans of food
a spoon, and a table.

734
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:41,538
[loud bang]

735
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:45,041
Someone's coming,
someone's coming, Art!

736
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:46,576
Who's there?

737
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,681
Hey, I don't know
who that is, but...

738
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,521
there's a lot of us,
so don't try anything stupid.

739
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,556
shooot, it's Bella!

740
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:04,891
What happened? Are you ok?

741
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:05,891
He killed him, killed him!

742
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:07,695
What are you talking about?

743
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,396
Santa killed Cutler.

744
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:11,197
What are you saying?

745
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:13,268
A guy in a flaping Santa's mask
killed Cutler.

746
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:16,469
- You're kidding, right?
- Where did it happen?

747
00:51:16,472 --> 00:51:18,838
On the second floor,
he killed him.

748
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,777
We must get the flap out
of here.

749
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,744
Ok, just breathe, Bella,
calm down.

750
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:25,215
I can't calm down.

751
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:27,217
No way, this has to be a trick.

752
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,516
No, we need to get
the flap out of here now.

753
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:32,652
And leave Cutler behind,
especially if he's hurt?

754
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:34,188
He's dead!

755
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,588
There's nothing we can do,

756
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,791
if we don't get out
we'll be the next ones.

757
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:40,293
flap that, I'm gonna find him,
I won't leave my friend behind.

758
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:41,463
I'm coming with you.

759
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,300
- Are you coming?
- You wanna show us where?

760
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,869
I can't.

761
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:49,806
Wow, that's fucked, Bella,
real fucked.

762
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:52,275
I gotta go find him myself.

763
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:55,574
Don't leave me, please,
don't leave me.

764
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:57,114
I'm sorry, Bella.

765
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,748
flap!

766
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:02,885
flap, flap!

767
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:24,739
I think this is the floor.

768
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:44,293
I think it's this way.

769
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:47,496
Right behind you.

770
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:11,221
[child whispering]
Deck the halls.

771
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,896
[child whispering]
Tis the season to be jolly.

772
00:54:35,804 --> 00:54:36,838
That's the room.

773
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,875
- That's the room right there.
- Stay behind me.

774
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:01,498
There's no one in here.

775
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,097
Wait, no, she was there!

776
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:07,065
No, no, no,
there was someone right here!

777
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:09,436
There was a girl right here
and blood.

778
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:11,675
And I dropped
my lantern right there!

779
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:13,639
This is one of your...

780
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:15,141
No, I swear, Robbie,
this is not a game.

781
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:18,547
Look, there's chains on the bed!

782
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,916
I don't know it's probably,
this is an old place

783
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,815
No, no, I'm telling you, Robbie,

784
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:26,489
there is seriously something
fucked up going on here.

785
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,987
Let's find the others
and get out of here.

786
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:31,927
No, no, no, I am telling you
the truth.

787
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,465
I'm done with this.

788
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,422
[door squeaking]

789
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,735
No, this just doesn't
make any sense.

790
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:16,737
I don't know how she could've
gone out that room.

791
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,539
Where the flap
is everybody else?

792
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,440
The same place as
your imaginary friend.

793
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,710
My god, this is so crazy.

794
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:24,110
Oh, by the way,

795
00:56:24,112 --> 00:56:25,612
good idea to play hide and seek
in a place like this.

796
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:27,179
Are you kidding me?

797
00:56:27,181 --> 00:56:28,648
I'm not the one who decides
to come in here to play

798
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,983
the adventurer or explorer

799
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,818
or whatever
this stupid game's called.

800
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,155
Oh, now you decide
to say no to something.

801
00:56:33,621 --> 00:56:35,121
What's that supposed to mean?

802
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:36,889
Know what?
Whatever, I don't care.

803
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:40,528
Help me find my friends,
and get the hell out of here.

804
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,570
[bells jingling]

805
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:54,943
Seems like some kind of joke.

806
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,244
A kind of Cutler mind flap.

807
00:56:57,246 --> 00:57:00,150
I know what I saw, Art, I'll
never forget that flaping mask.

808
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,081
- Clear.
- God, I can't even...

809
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,949
I need to see it for myself.

810
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:06,623
Call me skeptical, but a guy
in a flaping Santa mask?

811
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,556
Why the hell
did you make us come in here?

812
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,728
Clear.
I didn't make you do shooot.

813
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:13,463
I don't have to play the game.

814
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:16,431
flap you, Art, you're a real
piece of work, you know?

815
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:18,835
Yeah, takes one to know one,
right?

816
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:21,068
Can we stop fighting?

817
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,969
Kate, I wouldn't get
in the middle of this.

818
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,541
Art and I have history
of hating each other.

819
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,143
Yes, better to be a by-stand
than it is to be in the way.

820
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:30,275
Yeah, Art likes
to manipulate things because

821
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:31,847
he's the flaping king.

822
00:57:32,648 --> 00:57:34,050
I learned it
from a bitch or two.

823
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:36,117
God, just make it out of here.

824
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:39,454
- Once we find Cutler.
- And everyone else.

825
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,128
Oh, man.

to get out of here.

We can't go back out there,

Bella, shut the flap up,
find something to fight with.

00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:19,219
There's two of us and one of him
and we are not going down

without a fight, now go!

00:59:25,793 --> 00:59:26,728

It's coming from this floor.

to fight with.

01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:37,132
I think he was down there.

866

He's got us here.

It's Margo, it's Margo!

883
01:02:05,186 --> 01:02:08,188
Do not let her in!

884
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,291
What?

885
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,960
[Margo]
Guys, this is us, let us in!

886
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:16,027
- Bella, we have to...
- He could be using her, Kate.

887
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,329
Do not let her in.

888
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:19,101
[Robbie]
Guys, are you in there?

889
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:20,900
Are you ok?

890
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:22,235
Robbie is out there too.

891
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:25,237
Robbie could be flaping Santa!

892
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:28,242
- Do not let her in.
- Bella, I'm opening the door.

893
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:33,081
flap, yeah, sure, just kill us.
That's flaping great!

894
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:36,349
- Oh my god!
- Come here, come here!

895
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:38,121
What happened?

896
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,088
He flaping killed Cutler!

897
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:45,257
- Who, me?
- Art, too, Art's dead too.

898
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,561
What the flap are you saying?
I didn't kill anybody.

899
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:49,965
Cutler and Art are dead?

900
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:53,101
Oh my god!
No, no he was with me.

901
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:55,505
Bella, he was with me
the whole time.

902
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,840
Who the flap killed Cutler
and who killed Art?

903
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,306
Some flaping freak
with a Santa mask.

904
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:03,108
A Santa mask, really?

905
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,012
There was a girl
on the fifth floor,

906
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,914
she was chained,
blood all over the bed

907
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,547
and she said somebody
is in here.

908
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:13,253
That explains the cans of food
I found in the kitchen.

909
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:17,360
I'm telling you there was a hobo
serial killer rapist in here!

910
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,262
So, so fucked.

911
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,262
We have to phone the police.

912
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:24,362
We can't call the police, Margo.

913
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:26,998
There's no flaping service
in this hick town.

914
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:29,304
We need to get the flap
out of here, then!

915
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:32,007
Where are the car keys?

916
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,309
Where are the car keys?

917
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:37,980
Cutler.

918
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:42,818
I am not going back there!

919
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:46,855
Ok, someone has to or we are not
getting out of here.

920
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:52,594
flap, you three stay together.

921
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:55,297
I'll go get the keys,
where's Cutler?

922
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,335
Down the hall,
in one of the last rooms.

923
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:02,635
I'm going with you,

924
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:04,402
there's a killer on the loose,
you can't go alone.

925
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:06,208
You can't leave us in here,
it's a death trap.

926
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,275
Why don't you meet us in
the kitchen, where we came in.

927
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:11,411
We'll get the keys
and meet you there.

928
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:13,947
We're coming down with you and
we'll split in the staircase.

929
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:15,179
Ok, let's go.

930
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,451
[panting]

931
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,994
[child whispering]
Deck the halls.

932
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:34,003
[door squeaking]

933
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:49,416
[Robbie]
What the flap?

934
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:56,192
[keys rattling]

935
01:05:41,135 --> 01:05:42,266
It's clear.

936
01:05:42,268 --> 01:05:43,972
[Kate] Come on, stay close.

937
01:05:44,438 --> 01:05:46,539
It's just at the end
of this hallway, ok?

938
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,577
Ok, let's go.

939
01:05:57,418 --> 01:05:58,987
Wait, wait, wait.

940
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:00,686
We'll see you downstairs, ok?

941
01:06:00,688 --> 01:06:02,322
You're going to be ok?

942
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:04,224
I think so,
just please be quick.

943
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,295
[Kate] As quick as we can be.
Please, do.

944
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:13,501
Does this seem strange?

945
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:16,235
How do you know this is not
a fucked-up game?

946
01:06:16,237 --> 01:06:17,536
Why would they do that?

947
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:19,204
Are you kidding?

948
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:21,106
These people
are completely narcissistic.

949
01:06:21,108 --> 01:06:22,507
All they do is get fucked up
and play these stupid games.

950
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,476
I thought you liked them
as roommates!

951
01:06:24,478 --> 01:06:26,646
Better than being alone,
but doesn't mean I like this.

952
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:29,351
Ok, this isn't a game, Robbie.

953
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:30,717
How do you know that?

954
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:32,418
I saw Art get killed!

955
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,619
Yeah, how he died?

956
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:35,990
I mean... I don't know.

957
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,525
So you never actually
saw him die?

958
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:42,061
No, but...

959
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,695
And you never saw
Cutler die either?

960
01:06:43,697 --> 01:06:45,164
You just took Bella's word.

961
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,833
Yeah, but did you see the look...

962
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:48,367
Are you kidding me?

963
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:50,570
This is to flap
with the newbies!

964
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:53,773
What about the cans?
I saw them with my own eyes.

965
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:55,708
Oh, yeah?
Maybe there was a hobo around,

966
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,746
that doesn't mean there's
some flaping psycho killer!

967
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:01,547
Until I see flaping evidence,
I don't believe shooot.

968
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,719
We're about to find out,
we're here.

969
01:07:04,552 --> 01:07:05,721
Moment of truth.

970
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,724
Oh my god.

971
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:11,327
Oh, shooot.

972
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:14,126
- See?
- Oh my god, this isn't a game.

973
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:16,632
Of course not, people
don't die playing games!

974
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:20,302
We need to find the keys
and get the flap out of here.

975
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:23,672
- So, so fucked.
- I'm not finding anything.

976
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:26,271
There's no keys,
no wallet, nothing.

977
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:29,574
Oh, god, I'm sorry,
I'm so, so sorry.

978
01:07:29,577 --> 01:07:31,610
I'm so, so sorry.

979
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:32,614
Where is his backpack?

980
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:34,847
I don't see it.

981
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:36,418
God dammit,
the killer probably took it!

982
01:07:37,518 --> 01:07:39,518
What do we do?

983
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:42,425
Ok, we need to calm, focus,
and come up with another plan.

984
01:07:43,324 --> 01:07:45,092
[heavy footsteps]

985
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:00,407
The kitchen's
through there, wait.

986
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:02,909
Can we wait in the hallway?

987
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:05,280
I don't want to get trapped,
it'll be easy to find us.

988
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:08,715
And the killer, we should just
get the flap out of here.

989
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,449
What about Kate and Robbie?

990
01:08:10,452 --> 01:08:12,188
It's not safe in here, Margo.

991
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:14,320
We can't just leave them.

992
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:15,724
flap them, I don't know them.

993
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:17,626
Are you for real right now?

994
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:19,557
Margo, there's a killer
on the loose,

995
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,627
we need
to get the flap out of here.

996
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,596
And go where?

997
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,300
Anywhere.

998
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,402
No, that's not right.

999
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,634
It wasn't right to come here.

1000
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,206
Yeah, we're here now, ok?

1001
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,505
We're not just leaving them,
we're in the middle of nowhere,

1002
01:08:33,506 --> 01:08:36,412
- it's pitch black and freezing.
- Shush.

1003
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,510
Where are you gonna go?

1004
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:41,117
Who the flap cares?
Just get the flap out of here.

1005
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,759
The kitchen's there.

1006
01:08:52,225 --> 01:08:55,162
No, Bella, I've told you,
I'm not leaving them.

1007
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:57,195
I can't go alone

1008
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,564
You're stuck here, doesn't it?

1009
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,703
Oh my god, don't do this to me.

1010
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,171
You know what, Bella?
You do you.

1011
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:06,306
I hate you.

1012
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:09,912
Oh my god, why?

1013
01:09:12,212 --> 01:09:13,679
Why is this happening?

1014
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,881
Why they killed Cutler?
What the flap is going on?

1015
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:16,850
Hey.

1016
01:09:17,685 --> 01:09:19,319
Everything is going to be ok.

1017
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,355
We're gonna get out of here,
I promise.

1018
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:23,425
Okay.

1019
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:29,163
[loud screams]

1020
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:31,332
You hear that?

1021
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:35,537
We need to find Bella and Margo
and get out of here.

1022
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,337
Hurry!

1023
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:40,309
[loud screams]

1024
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:49,484
[indistinct yelling]

1025
01:09:51,519 --> 01:09:53,322
This way, this way!

1026
01:10:03,796 --> 01:10:05,201
[Bella] This way.

1027
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,306
[Bella] Check in there.

1028
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:20,315
[panting]

1029
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:33,394
[sobbing]

1030
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:40,402
Bella, Bella?

1031
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:42,938
Bella!

1032
01:10:44,671 --> 01:10:46,838
I can't open the door!

1033
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:50,377
Stop, I can't!

1034
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:53,782
Bella!

1035
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,385
[screams]

1036
01:10:56,818 --> 01:10:58,420
Stop, stop it!

1037
01:10:59,621 --> 01:11:01,555
I can't, I can't, stop!

1038
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:05,560
Stop, my god, stop!
I can't, I can't.

1039
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:08,264
Please, please!

1040
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,600
[screams]

1041
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,534
[Margo yelling]
Bella!

1042
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:16,939
Oh my god, he's here!

1043
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:18,372
Stop!

1044
01:11:19,506 --> 01:11:21,309
[loud screams]

1045
01:11:22,743 --> 01:11:23,911
flap you!

1046
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:27,282
flap you!

1047
01:11:27,881 --> 01:11:29,484
No, no!

1048
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:31,717
flap you!

1049
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,587
[panting]

1050
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:36,390
No, no!

1051
01:11:37,056 --> 01:11:39,328
Please, please, please!

1052
01:11:41,662 --> 01:11:42,764
[gasping for air]

1053
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:02,948
Where are they?

1054
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,353
What the flap?

1055
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:14,693
Ok, the screams came
from that way.

1056
01:12:14,694 --> 01:12:16,528
No, I'm done with this.

1057
01:12:16,529 --> 01:12:18,600
