2
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:54,475
Oh, hurry up, Mr. Dickens!

3
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:56,878
Hey, I paid 50 cents for this!

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,246
- Come on, Dickens!
- Come on, Charley!

5
00:01:01,283 --> 00:01:04,284
We want Charles!

6
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:06,022
I want to see Charles!

7
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:09,388
Where is Dickens?

8
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:32,879
<i>My dear Forster,</i>

9
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:34,847
<i>how can I give you
the faintest notion</i>

10
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:36,918
<i>of my reception
here in America?</i>

11
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,819
Five minutes. Five minutes.

12
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:43,189
<i>Of the crowds that pour
in and out the whole day,</i>

13
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:45,793
<i>of the people that line the
streets when I go out.</i>

14
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:56,003
Places, please. Places!

15
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,103
Hello, Charley.

16
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:59,841
<i>Of the balls, dinners,</i>

17
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:03,343
<i>speeches, parties,
assemblies without end.</i>

18
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:07,248
<i>There never was a king or emperor
upon the earth so cheered.</i>

19
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:12,887
Tonight, live on stage...

20
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,188
Ready?

21
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:17,424
- the great magician of our time...
- Ready.

22
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:19,828
whose wand is a book!

23
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,962
The Shakespeare
of the novel.

24
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:24,164
The people's author.

25
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:27,868
The great and marvelous Boz!

26
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,371
Ladies and gentlemen,

27
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:34,474
Mr. Charles Dickens!

28
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,014
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

29
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,615
Thank you! Thank you!

30
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:45,453
Look, it's him!
It's really him!

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,926
- Hey there, Boz!
- Whoo!

32
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:56,030
Dear friends! Dear friends!

33
00:02:56,031 --> 00:03:00,067
You have welcomed me to your country
with such open arms that I fear I...

34
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,002
Ohh!

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,513
<i>Americans are friendly,</i>

36
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:16,250
<i>earnest, hospitable,</i>

37
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:18,521
<i>kind, frank, accomplished,</i>

38
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:22,155
<i>warm-hearted, fervent,</i>

39
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:24,561
<i>and... enthusiastic.</i>

40
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,031
<i>I can't wait to get home.</i>

41
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,550
Mrs. Fisk,
I have told you repeatedly

42
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,519
not to disturb me
when I am working.

43
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,425
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
Only, Mr. Forster is here.

44
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:07,060
Forster.
Yes, of course.

45
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:09,230
As you can see,
Mr. Forster,

46
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,598
we're having all-new
wallpaper put in, French,

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,634
new doors,
new door knocker,

48
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:15,701
new roller blinds
for the windows,

49
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:20,007
new bookcases in the
library, a new chandelier,

50
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,242
all chosen by Charles,
of course.

51
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,610
And the staircase is
to be painted green.

52
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,548
- Though not too dull a green, Signor Mazzini.
- <i>Ma certo. SÃ¬, capisce.</i>

53
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,516
You know how Charles is.

54
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,156
- Only the best for Mr. Dickens.
- Yes.

55
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:37,257
Mr. Forster,
if you'll allow me,

56
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,259
how do things stand between
you and Miss Wigmore?

57
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,762
Oh, splendid,
Mrs. Dickens.

58
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:43,798
In fact, I intend
to ask her to bestow upon me

59
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,702
the greatest happiness
a man can ever know.

60
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:49,569
Well, to marry me.

61
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:51,406
Oh!

62
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:53,439
Oh, I'm very glad
to hear that.

63
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:56,475
Forster! Forster, Forster, Forster.
So sorry!

64
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,579
I completely lost track
of the time.

65
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,048
- Shall we?
- Charles.

66
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,615
- You need to pay Signor Mazzini.
- Hmm?

67
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,584
For the parlor mantle.

68
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,752
- How much?
- Seventy-five pounds.

69
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:09,156
Seventy-five?
What's it made of, gold?

70
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:12,360
Carrara marble, Signor.
Finest quality.

71
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,394
No gentleman
would accept less.

72
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:16,629
No? Well, quite.

73
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:19,468
Well, I will have the money for you
when I return, Signor Mazzini.

74
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,238
Good day, Mrs. Dickens.

75
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,605
Good day, Mr. Forster.

76
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,079
Ah! Come in!

77
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,081
Good-bye,
little strangers!

78
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,314
Bye!

79
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,721
- Say good-bye to Mr. Forster, children!
- Bye!

80
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:43,091
- I'll hail us a cab.
- What? No, it's a waste of money. We'll walk.

81
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:45,093
It's damned expensive
being a gentleman.

82
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:46,526
Forster,
this meeting...

83
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,295
- Aye! I know my job.
- Good.

84
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:50,564
- And the money?
- Leave the publishers to me.

85
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,432
Good.

86
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:54,637
Slow down!
What's the hurry?

87
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:00,875
Charles
Bloody Dickens, huh?

88
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:04,545
The best-selling bloody author in the
history of English bloody literature.

89
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:08,314
Three of his books you have published
in the last year and a half. Three!

90
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,182
So where's the money?

91
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:13,653
Mr. Forster, like you, we are as
puzzled as the Egyptians in their fog.

92
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:15,723
- How's that?
<i>- Martin Chuzzlewit.</i>

93
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:19,459
A masterpiece of the
picaresque genre, and yet...

94
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,795
<i>Barnaby Rudge.</i> A fine book.
An important subject.

95
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:23,764
But, alas...

96
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:26,233
And the travel book,
<i>American Notes.</i>

97
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,668
Perhaps a little too candid
for our American cousins.

98
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,170
No joke. I heard they were burning
copies of it in the streets.

99
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,307
Well, they're mad as snakes,
the Yanks.

100
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,612
But what about this 50 pound a month
you're withholding from his royalties?

101
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,581
What is the explanation
for that?

102
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:43,884
You may remember that when Mr. Dickens
approached us about the tour to America,

103
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,521
we were pleased to provide him
with an interest-free loan.

104
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:49,490
With the provision that, in
the unlikely case of profits

105
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,858
being inadequate
to certain repayments...

106
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,396
What? So he's had a couple of flops?
Well, who hasn't? Huh?

107
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,264
Your publishing house
wouldn't exist without this man.

108
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,834
What about an advance?

109
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,735
- On?
- A new book.

110
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,439
You have a new book
in mind?

111
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:09,343
Yes.
Of course he does.

112
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:12,646
Well, in that case, I mean we'd
obviously love to consider it.

113
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,451
- Consider?
- That is to say, if we like it.

114
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:19,322
- If?
- I'm sure that we will.

115
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,591
Gentlemen,
I bid you good day.

116
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:27,228
Mr. Forster, please, we had no
intention of causing offense.

117
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,663
Well,
he's in a fettle now.

118
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:30,865
I'll give him a day
to calm down.

119
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,700
And then...
It's most awkward.

120
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,336
<i>He</i> was in last week,

121
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:38,238
in some difficulty.

122
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,573
Again.

123
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:41,875
No, that's not possible.
He's in the countryside.

124
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:44,213
He's under strict
instructions to remain there.

125
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:47,750
What is it this time?

126
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,961
"I need money immediately or
productive of fatal consequences,

127
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,797
I beseech you
to do the needful..."

128
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:07,802
He's been offering Mr. Dickens's
autographs for sale in the newspapers.

129
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:16,476
- How much did you give him?
- Forty-five, all told.

130
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,479
Forty-five?

131
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,316
Well,
I'll pay it all back.

132
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,520
But not a word of this
to Charles, do you hear?

133
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,701
"What's the secret?"
they say.

134
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,206
There is no secret.
I sit down...

135
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:49,909
- Charles. What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from Thackeray.

136
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:52,345
They absolutely
come pouring out of me.

137
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,780
He'll no doubt want to commiserate
me on my <i>Chuzzlewit</i> reviews,

138
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,783
which he will quote
by heart.

139
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,287
Come on.

140
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:12,698
I am clammin' for some scran.
Where's Robertson?

141
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,601
Why do we come here,
hmm?

142
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:18,338
The service is terrible. The food is
inedible. The fees keep going up.

143
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,344
It's full of...

144
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:25,945
Gentlemen.

145
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:27,713
You're not Robertson.

146
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:29,586
The name is Marley, sir.

147
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:33,753
- Marley? Marley with an "E"?
- Yes, sir.

148
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,822
Hmm.

149
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,658
Uh, oh, don't worry.
He collects names.

150
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,894
We'll have some oysters
and a bottle of champagne.

151
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:42,466
Very good, sir.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,633
- Champagne?
- We're celebrating.

153
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:49,369
- Celebrating?
- Hello, Thackeray.

154
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,571
- How are you?
- Tolerable.

155
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,073
I thank ye.

156
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:55,775
Charles, I must say I am relieved
to see you out and about.

157
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,777
Relieved?

158
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:00,780
You know, after those vile things
they wrote about <i>Chuzzlewit.</i>

159
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:03,583
I won't even
call them reviews.

160
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,684
- No matter. I never read them.
- Quite right.

161
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,456
Scandalous what one is
allowed to print nowadays.

162
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,530
Go on.
What did they say?

163
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:21,900
"Dull, vapid, and vulgar.

164
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:26,806
Not a single character capable of
exciting the reader's sympathies."

165
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:29,775
I certainly didn't think
it was vulgar.

166
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:32,078
Oh, look.
There's Macready.

167
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:35,582
Poor thing. His <i>Macbeth</i> was
absolutely shredded in the <i>Times.</i>

168
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,921
I must go and give him
my condolences.

169
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,690
I'm sick of London.

170
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,424
It's overcrowded,
overpriced...

171
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,794
- You love this town.
- No place for a man without money.

172
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:49,929
Not to mention
the bloody fog.

173
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:52,836
But it's your inspiration, your
what-do-you-call-it... your magic lamp.

174
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:01,441
I tell you, Forster,
my lamp's gone out.

175
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,510
I've run out of ideas.

176
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,044
I feel old.

177
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:08,951
Old?
You're a puppy.

178
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,820
You're exhausted, that's all.
Too many speeches.

179
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:16,456
I've got another one tomorrow
for the Children's Refuge.

180
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:18,591
Well, you have to learn
to say no.

181
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:22,162
How can I say no if I can be useful, if
I can lighten the burden of another?

182
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:25,030
Well, you have to, what with your
new commission to think about.

183
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,801
Forster, I just told you that...
Sorry. New commission?

184
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:30,904
It's from Chapman and Hall,
for your new book.

185
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,472
I've told them you'll have the first
chapter done by the end of the year.

186
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:36,109
You like a deadline.

187
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,880
- Do you mind telling me what it's about?
- I'll leave that up to you.

188
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,734
And on Christmas
Eve, they say,

189
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,870
the fairy mounds open wide

190
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:39,838
and the fire spirits
pour into the night.

191
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,674
And then
the Lord of the Dead

192
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,812
leads all of the spirits
into a wild hunt.

193
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,213
And he calls to them...

194
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:13,640
- Do we have a new housemaid?
- What?

195
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:16,075
Uh, yes. Tara.

196
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:19,081
She's Irish.
Charley adores her.

197
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:24,921
What are you doing?

198
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:29,289
- It was only a stub.
- Another hour in that.

199
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:32,659
- Oh, really, Charles.
- If you carry on like this, we'll end up in the poor house.

200
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,327
- You're funny.
- I'm not joking.

201
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,095
Charles!

202
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,232
You give money to every and
any beggar in the street.

203
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:43,036
You insist we move to a bigger house
and order in all new fixtures,

204
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,138
and then you complain
about a new candle.

205
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,876
Debt is an ogre, Kate. If you're
not careful, it can eat you up.

206
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:52,779
Are we in trouble?

207
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,048
No, of course not.

208
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,686
Then what?

209
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:59,886
Nothing.

210
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,125
I'm just sick of writing tooth
and nail for bread, that's all.

211
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:05,993
Hmm.

212
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,895
- Should've become a journalist.
- You hate the press.

213
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:11,197
- Or a lawyer.
- "The law is an ass."

214
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,267
I believe you wrote that.

215
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,904
A hairdresser, then,
in the Burlington Arcade.

216
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,606
Do you know what
I should have liked to be?

217
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:21,642
An explorer,

218
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:24,876
paddling a canoe somewhere
in the wilds of Canada

219
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,713
in a pair
of buckskin breeches,

220
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:29,782
all on my own.

221
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:31,288
No nappies to change.

222
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:38,726
By the way, dear,

223
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,932
I-I saw the doctor today.

224
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,636
Not another...
little stranger.

225
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,738
Are you pleased?

226
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,706
Well, of course.

227
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,748
- Well, that's splendid.
- Yes.

228
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,764
I am a necromancer.

229
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,868
Behold.

230
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,750
And now...

231
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:53,099
Charley.

232
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,969
Charley,
it's all right.

233
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,904
I'm here.

234
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:18,191
Mistress Chickenstalker!

235
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:20,728
Mistress Chickenstalker, what
has happened to your pinnie?

236
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,729
You look as if you've
been caught in a cyclone.

237
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,330
That's much better.

238
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,136
Master Corporal Skittles, sir.
On your feet, sir!

239
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,413
Ah, Lucifer Box.

240
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,317
Would you do me the honor?

241
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,116
Good.

242
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:48,221
Ah, the Snodgering Blee.
We meet at last.

243
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,056
What's this?

244
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:53,026
You have forgotten
to wash behind your ear.

245
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,362
Cor!

246
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:58,201
Now you must be...
Don't... Don't tell me.

247
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,034
- Who is that?
- Tara.

248
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,237
Tara. Of course.

249
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,439
I see you've made a conquest.

250
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,940
What was that wonderful story
I overheard you telling

251
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:11,411
about fairy mounds
and the fire spirits?

252
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:15,882
Only a story my gran used to tell
us, sir, back home in Ireland.

253
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,984
She used to say
that on Christmas Eve

254
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:21,220
the veils between this world
and the next thin out,

255
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:24,894
and that's when the spirits
cross over and walk among us.

256
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:27,797
Do they indeed?

257
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,364
Well, well, well.

258
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,000
Christmas Eve.

259
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:43,942
Thank you so much
for coming.

260
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:46,815
- It was such an interesting speech.
- Thank you very much.

261
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:50,083
- Your hat, sir.
- Thank you.

262
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,884
Oh, Mr. Dickens, it's such
an honor to meet you.

263
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:55,388
- We just adore your books.
- No, we don't.

264
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:59,026
- Well, <i>I</i> love them.
- Nonsense. You just like a good cry.

265
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:02,061
What is it you particularly
object to in my books?

266
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:05,096
Pickpockets, streetwalkers,
charity boys.

267
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,099
Those people
don't belong in books.

268
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,134
"Those people"?
You mean, the poor?

269
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:12,005
Look here, Mr. Dickens.
I'm a self-made man.

270
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,273
Pulled myself up
by my own bootstraps.

271
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:17,844
Never asked for anything from anyone
that I wasn't willing to pay for.

272
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,913
- Really? No help from anyone?
- None.

273
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:24,788
Well, Papa did give us a very small
cotton mill when we were married.

274
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:29,922
What do you suggest we do
with "those people"? Hmm?

275
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:31,125
Are there no workhouses?

276
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:36,262
Do you know how many people
would rather die than go there?

277
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:38,065
Then they'd
better do it

278
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:40,302
and reduce
the surplus population.

279
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:47,576
Can you spare
a bob, please?

280
00:19:57,353 --> 00:20:00,557
Care to buy, sir?
Hard workers.

281
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,124
Fit any chimney.

282
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,195
You f...

283
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:16,337
Quick!
Come on! In here!

284
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,845
Down here now!

285
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:25,459
- Come on!
- No!

286
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,224
I lift mine eyes
unto the hills

287
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:41,094
from whence cometh
my help.

288
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:44,297
My help cometh
even from the Lord,

289
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:46,532
who hath made
heaven and earth...

290
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:50,436
All right, all right. I'm not paying
you by the hour. Skip to the end.

291
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:53,205
Rest eternal, grant to him, O
Lord. Let light perpetual shine upon him.

292
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,106
- Amen. Amen.
- Amen.

293
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:57,009
Shame, innit?

294
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,247
All that money and no one here to
mourn him except Old Scratch there.

295
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:03,150
- Who's that?
- His business partner.

296
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:05,951
The meanest cur on two legs,
so they say.

297
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:07,890
Aye, right.
Come on.

298
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:48,463
Ah... humbug.

299
00:21:58,507 --> 00:21:59,642
"Humbug."

300
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:06,012
"Are there no workhouses?

301
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,446
Well, then they'd
better do it

302
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,648
and decrease
the surplus population."

303
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:13,423
"Old Scratch.
All that money. Shame."

304
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,789
Good evening, sir.

305
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,126
Yes, it is,
Mrs. Fisk.

306
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:22,528
- Charles?
- Humbug! Humbug!

307
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,134
Humbug! Ha-ha!

308
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:35,074
<i>It's about a businessman.
Or a factory owner. A miser.</i>

309
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:39,179
<i>His partner dies. He doesn't shed a tear.
Thinks only of the money.</i>

310
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,712
<i>And on
Christmas Eve...</i>

311
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:44,351
On Christmas Eve,
he meets some kind of... of...

312
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:48,153
of supernatural guides,
or spirits, possibly,

313
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:50,257
who in the course
of one night

314
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:53,794
teach him what a miserable,
loathsome, selfish toad he is.

315
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,065
It's a short book.
Short and sharp.

316
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,498
A hammer blow
to the heart

317
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,068
of this smug,
self-satisfied age.

318
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,375
It's a comedy.

319
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:12,311
Brilliant.

320
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:14,779
- Does it have a title?
- Yes.

321
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,352
<i>Humbug: A Miser's Lament.</i>

322
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:23,190
<i>A Christmas Ghost Story...
Christmas Song...</i>

323
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,824
<i>Christmas Ballad.</i>
Something like that.

324
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:28,827
Intriguing, really.
Ah, just one question.

325
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:30,198
Why Christmas?

326
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:34,534
- Well, why not?
- Does anybody really celebrate it anymore?

327
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:37,170
Apart from our clerk, who
never misses an opportunity

328
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:39,638
to take a day off...
with pay.

329
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:43,776
More or less an opportunity for picking
a man's pocket every 25th of December.

330
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:47,212
What we mean to say, Mr. Dickens, is,

331
00:23:47,214 --> 00:23:49,750
not much of a market
for Christmas books, what?

332
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,625
It is a Christmas book because Christmas
is, or ought to be, the one time of year

333
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:03,563
when men and women
open their shut-up hearts

334
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:07,467
and think of people below them as if they
really were fellow passengers to the grave

335
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:09,567
and not another race
of creatures altogether.

336
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:11,836
We are already
halfway through October.

337
00:24:11,838 --> 00:24:15,173
Even if you had already written it, we
couldn't possibly get it illustrated,

338
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:18,344
typeset, printed and bound,
advertised and distributed to shops

339
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:19,816
in only six weeks.

340
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:23,586
Well...

341
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,585
thank you
for your opinion.

342
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:27,690
Mr. Dickens!

343
00:24:31,593 --> 00:24:34,527
Tie it off now.
That's it.

344
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:38,864
Scaly-headed vultures.
Money-grubbing, scum-sucking...

345
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:41,567
- But, Charles...
- I'll do it myself.

346
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:44,503
- What?
- I'll pay for it myself... all of it.

347
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:46,672
Illustrations, everything.
I'll distribute it myself.

348
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:50,209
But, Charles, this is madness.
Think of your finances, huh?

349
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,378
Come on. We'll go back.
We'll renegotiate.

350
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:54,279
No shame in it.
It's just business.

351
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:57,449
Why throw everything away
for a minor holiday?

352
00:24:57,451 --> 00:25:00,353
No, I've never felt so strongly
about anything in my life, John.

353
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:02,454
You can help me or not,
as you wish.

354
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:04,824
- Where are you off to?
- Going to raise some capital.

355
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,593
One thing I've learned
from my father...

356
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:08,961
people will believe anything
if you're properly dressed.

357
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:11,698
Mr. Trabb!
Your finest cravats!

358
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:21,673
Ah.

359
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,776
Nothing like the air
of the metropolis

360
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:26,313
to put color in your cheeks,
eh, Mother?

361
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:40,993
There you are, sir. Best quality.
A-1 condition.

362
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:43,262
And look inside.

363
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,334
Autographed
by the author.

364
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:50,538
"To Papa. Love, Charles."

365
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,644
Five bob.

366
00:25:56,644 --> 00:26:00,546
Hello, old dog.

367
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:04,017
Perhaps we could,
um, strike a bargain.

368
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,923
- Hello.
- Good with children, is it?

369
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:16,565
Too much?

370
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:21,933
Aha! Mr. Dickens
and Mr. Forster.

371
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:24,269
How do you?

372
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:26,407
Very well, thank you,
Mr. Haddock.

373
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:28,874
Mittens.

374
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:33,380
You are a bad boy.

375
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:44,990
Now, how may I be
of service to you?

376
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:47,459
Well, sir,
it's about the loan.

377
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,397
There was something I wanted to tell you.
What was it?

378
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,035
It was some rather good news,
if I recall correctly.

379
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:56,670
What, uh...

380
00:26:56,672 --> 00:26:57,838
Ah.

381
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:01,673
Biscuit?

382
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:04,712
Well... thank you.

383
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:10,019
Mmm.

384
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,988
Ah! Uh, yes.

385
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,589
Now, what was I, uh...
What...

386
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:21,026
Uh, you said something
about good news?

387
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:23,063
Possibly
about the lawsuit?

388
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:25,730
Ah, the lawsuit.

389
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:27,901
Yes, the copyright
infringement.

390
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:30,635
<i>Oliver Twisted.</i> "As re-originated
from the original."

391
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:33,038
Yes! Ha!
I have it here.

392
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,644
Uh... Ah, yes.

393
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:39,978
Good news indeed.
We won.

394
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,882
The fine was set
at Â£2,200.

395
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:45,116
2,200!

396
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,720
The bad news is,
the defendants have no money.

397
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:49,625
- Ah.
- Bankrupt.

398
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:52,728
Disappointing, I know.

399
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:58,029
But we'll have them arrested,
throw them into debtor's prison.

400
00:27:58,031 --> 00:27:59,598
No. No, no.

401
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,803
No?

402
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:03,806
As you wish.

403
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:06,940
In the meantime,

404
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:09,076
if you would be
so good...

405
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:18,320
here's my bill.

406
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:27,426
No rush.
Next week will be fine.

407
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:28,994
Hmm.

408
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:33,599
Tell you what. Why don't we
defer this until... January?

409
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:36,469
And while we're at it, perhaps
you might add a little bit more.

410
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:38,171
I'll make it
worth your while.

411
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:39,673
More?

412
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:44,413
You wish to borrow more?

413
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:48,682
Not very much.
Just...

414
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:53,486
Â£300...
till January.

415
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:55,888
I think we can
increase your loan

416
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:59,159
at, shall we say,
25 percent?

417
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:00,695
God's teeth!

418
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:03,464
Thank you.

419
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:09,739
Charles.
Charles.

420
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:12,837
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

421
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,605
Never better.

422
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:16,744
Now find me
an illustrator.

423
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:27,786
He was a tight-fisted,
hand to the grindstone

424
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:31,557
old... Scratch.

425
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:35,596
Scrounger.

426
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:37,731
He was a...

427
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:42,136
covetous old sinner.

428
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:45,604
Name!

429
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,006
Shh.

430
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:49,642
Screwpull! Scrabbly.

431
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,978
Name! Ah!

432
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,846
Well, go on.
He won't bite.

433
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:56,148
Screwpull.

434
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:00,689
Aah!

435
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:17,871
Scrimple!

436
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:19,137
Aah!

437
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,273
You're... What are you
doing in here?

438
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:23,575
I've just come to see
to the fire, sir.

439
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:26,577
I'm not to be interrupted under
<i>any</i> circumstances! Do you hear?

440
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:29,681
I beg your pardon, sir.
It won't happen again.

441
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:31,618
Wait. What's that
in your pocket?

442
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:42,094
<i>Varney the Vampire,
or The Feast of Blood.</i>

443
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:45,998
You won't tell Mrs. Fisk, will ya?
She'll think I was shirkin'.

444
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,635
- Where did you learn to read?
- My mum taught me.

445
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:51,068
But then she died

446
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,074
and I had to go
to the Grubber.

447
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:56,811
The workhouse?

448
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:03,550
- Is it any good?
- Well, yes, sir. Thrilling.

449
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,990
Tell you what.
I'll make you a trade.

450
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:15,161
<i>Varney the Vampire</i>
for...

451
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,894
Uh, where is it?

452
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:19,567
Ah!

453
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:24,170
<i>Aladdin
and His Magic Lamp.</i>

454
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:26,038
Oh, my.

455
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,240
Read it.
Let me know what you think.

456
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,144
Thank you, sir.

457
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:35,282
Hmm.

458
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:41,621
Who is Scrimple?

459
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:43,020
Hmm? Scrimple?

460
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:45,923
- When I come in, you were saying...
- Oh!

461
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:49,760
It's just a name
for a story I'm concocting.

462
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:53,269
Get the name right and then, if you're
lucky, the character will appear.

463
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:56,736
Hmm.

464
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:57,971
He's not here yet.

465
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,876
Scrantish?

466
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:07,147
Scrarmer.

467
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,382
Come on.

468
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:13,685
Scrunge.

469
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:15,622
Aw, come on!

470
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:17,026
Come on,
you old sinner!

471
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:20,996
Scrooge!

472
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:26,132
Shut the window! Do you
think I'm made of money?

473
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,634
Mr. Scrooge.

474
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:32,037
- How delightful to meet you, sir.
- Sorry I can't say the same.

475
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,773
Come now. Don't be standoffish.
We ought to be friends.

476
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,741
- Don't have friends. Don't need 'em.
- Ah.

477
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:38,877
Naturally.

478
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,747
- I know. Let's play a game.
- Don't like games.

479
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,748
Well, humor me.

480
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,919
What do you think of when I
say the word... "darkness"?

481
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,190
Cheap.

482
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:51,125
- Love.
- Swindle.

483
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,829
- Money.
- Security.

484
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,964
- Children.
- Useless.

485
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:01,069
- Workhouse.
- Useful.

486
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:05,307
Christmas.

487
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,111
Christmas?

488
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:12,846
That's right.

489
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:19,786
Help! Help! Get it away!

490
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,753
Away!

491
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:25,090
What is going on?

492
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:26,991
Get it away,
the filthy thing.

493
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:29,193
Come on, Grip, old chap.
Back in the cage.

494
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:31,130
- Father?
- Ah. Charles.

495
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:32,998
- Good day.
- What are you doing here?

496
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,101
Well, we were
in the neighborhood

497
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:38,202
and we thought we'd drop by with
a present for the children.

498
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:40,272
His name is Grip.
He talks!

499
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:42,807
- Can we keep him?
- Hello, old girl.

500
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:45,076
It's bad luck, a bird in the house.
It means death.

501
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:46,813
- Hello!
- Father, in here.

502
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:48,717
Of course.

503
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:54,318
Charles? Charles?

504
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,988
What are you doing
back in London?

505
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,490
My dear Charles.

506
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:02,394
I will not disguise from you
that this is not the ardor

507
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:04,395
with which a loving father
might be expected...

508
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:07,099
You are supposed to be in Devon.

509
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:08,333
Banishment!

510
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:11,503
Be merciful
and say "death,"

511
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:14,143
for exile has more
terror in its look.

512
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:18,244
Father,
we had an agreement.

513
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,945
Hmm?

514
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:21,780
I bought you a house.

515
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:24,016
I gave you an allowance.

516
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,818
For which
I am very grateful.

517
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,889
As for me, I'm happy
wherever the weather.

518
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:33,762
But your mother is of
a more delicate sensibility.

519
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:37,963
Charles,
the mere sight of cows

520
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:40,233
causes her
actual physical pain.

521
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,436
Father.

522
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:46,340
And I have research to do
in the London Library.

523
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,713
- Research?
- Oh, yes.

524
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:53,945
Yeah.

525
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:56,815
I have a commission
from <i>The Spectator</i>

526
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:59,420
to write a feature
on the Bank Charter Act.

527
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,487
The editor
was very impressed

528
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,391
with my series
on marine insurance.

529
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:09,929
Good for you, Father. I do hope that
you and Mother will stay here with us.

530
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:13,068
The children and I will so enjoy
having some company in the evenings.

531
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:22,277
<i>The Spectator.</i>
Well, that's, um...

532
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:25,481
That's most impressive.

533
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:29,817
Thank you, dear boy.

534
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:32,150
Oh, by the way,

535
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:34,420
you couldn't lend me
a tenner, could you?

536
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:37,123
That blighter took my last
farthing for the cage.

537
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:45,331
It was the bird, sir. It flew upstairs.

538
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:50,302
Oh, um, I'll see
that it's all cleared up.

539
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:53,005
Please, can we keep him?

540
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:54,842
Well, I, um...

541
00:35:57,512 --> 00:35:59,481
Come on, Walter.

542
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:07,523
"This is not the ardor
with which a loving father..."

543
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:12,994
Humbug!

544
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:16,496
- What is?
- Christmas.

545
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,032
What about it?

546
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,101
Well, what is it
but an excuse

547
00:36:23,103 --> 00:36:26,541
for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December?

548
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,242
Yes. Keep going.

549
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:33,445
A time for paying bills
without money.

550
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:36,481
A time for finding yourself a year
older and not an hour richer.

551
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:40,552
If I could work my will,

552
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:43,121
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

553
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:45,291
should be boiled
in his own plum pudding

554
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:49,061
and <i>buried</i> with a stake of holly
through his heart, he should.

555
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:53,998
Oh, Mr. Scrooge, you and I are
going to do wonderful things together.

556
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:58,670
Oh, but he was a tight-fisted
hand at the grindstone, Scrooge.

557
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:01,574
A squeezing, wrenching,

558
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:05,210
grasping, scraping,

559
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:08,014
clutching,
covetous old sinner.

560
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:11,353
Charles?

561
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:16,389
Hard at work?

562
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:18,556
What can I help
you with, Father?

563
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,460
Well, I was wondering if we might have
an extra candlestick for our room.

564
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:24,429
- Of course.
- Oh!

565
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:27,367
Cigars. Oh, yes.

566
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,402
I must confess,

567
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:35,273
I have acquired an irrepressible
habit of smoking whilst I write.

568
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:36,708
Dreadful habit, I know,
but...

569
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,612
Oh, yes.

570
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,215
Thank you.

571
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:46,485
Hmm. Going well?

572
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:48,989
Oh.

573
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:52,326
I won't detain you.

574
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,507
Don't do that.
D-Don't.

575
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,543
Why not?

576
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:13,112
Too late.

577
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:16,614
Who is it?

578
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:18,119
Who is it?

579
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:20,987
Bunsby?

580
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:23,692
Clennam?

581
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:28,427
Heep? Hexam?

582
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:30,195
- Oh, stop, stop!
- Magwitch?

583
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:31,298
No.

584
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,701
Marley.

585
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:45,577
Is that you, Jacob?

586
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,746
- You know him?
- My business partner.

587
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:50,516
Last time I saw him
he was dead as a doornail.

588
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:53,219
How do you, Jacob?

589
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,755
Business, business.

590
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:58,724
Mankind was my business.

591
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:01,295
The common welfare
was my business.

592
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:04,132
Charity...

593
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,568
mercy...

594
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:10,135
forbearance,
and benevolence

595
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:12,371
were all my business.

596
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:15,239
He was never one
for a straight answer.

597
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:17,309
And yet I practiced
none of them!

598
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,077
Come in.

599
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,414
Come in, please.

600
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,175
You are fettered.
Why?

601
00:39:48,643 --> 00:39:51,612
I wear the chain
I forged in life.

602
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:56,284
I made it...

603
00:39:58,286 --> 00:39:59,652
link by link,

604
00:40:01,222 --> 00:40:03,190
yard by yard.

605
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:08,463
And of my own free will,
I girded it about me.

606
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,530
Of my own free will,

607
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:14,431
I wore it.

608
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,414
Do you know the weight and length
of the chain you bear yourself?

609
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,818
You mean him,
surely.

610
00:40:33,353 --> 00:40:35,155
Mm-mmm.

611
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:37,659
You, Charley.

612
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,130
Your chains,
all around you.

613
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:47,335
Past and present...

614
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,572
and what is to come.

615
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:58,775
Hail to thee,
blithe turkey,

616
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:01,246
whose exquisite odors

617
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:04,349
now perfume
the circumambient air.

618
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,719
And let this day
be fragrant

619
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:12,257
with the love
we bear one another.

620
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,360
And may God bless us,
every one.

621
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:17,396
Every one.

622
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,402
Mr. John Dickens.

623
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:27,373
You're under arrest
for a debt of 42 pounds.

624
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,606
- Father!
- Charley.

625
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:30,744
Father,
tell them to stop!

626
00:41:31,878 --> 00:41:33,445
Take everything
that shines, boys.

627
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:35,748
It's all right, Charley.

628
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,617
- Tell them to stop, Father!
- It's all right.

629
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,822
Please, Charley,
don't worry.

630
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:57,936
What about Leech
for the illustrations?

631
00:41:57,938 --> 00:41:59,637
Leech?
He's so prickly.

632
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:02,541
- And he's by no means the cheapest.
- I don't want the cheapest.

633
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:05,777
Oh, Charles, for God's sake, slow down.
You move at railway speed.

634
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,746
I don't want the cheapest.
I want the best.

635
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:09,347
- It's going well then?
- What?

636
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:11,748
- The book.
- It's brilliant. Best thing I've ever written.

637
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,385
- What, so you...
- I've got 11 pages.

638
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:15,786
- Eleven?
- Well, if it weren't for constant interruptions.

639
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,989
We've got my father staying with us. He
could not have come at a worse time.

640
00:42:18,992 --> 00:42:20,492
Oh.

641
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:21,896
Miss Wigmore.

642
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,764
Ah.

643
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:28,434
Come.

644
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:29,668
Come along.

645
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:36,809
Who was that?

646
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:38,811
- Charlotte.
- Who?

647
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:40,777
My fiancÃ©e.
I told you.

648
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,947
FiancÃ©e?

649
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:46,318
- She's a canny lass, is she not?
- Indeed. Most amiable.

650
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,286
Amiable?

651
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:51,257
Why, man, she's an
angel, a sylph.

652
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:53,726
She's a goddess on a...

653
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:56,527
Whatever is the matter?

654
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,597
Charlotte and I have come
to a parting of the ways.

655
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,034
- I thought you said you were engaged.
- We were.

656
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:05,273
But then her father had no intention
for her to marry the son of a butcher.

657
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:08,643
Here.

658
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,947
Perhaps
it's for the best, eh?

659
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:17,686
The life matrimonial, it's
not for everyone, old stick.

660
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:21,222
Aye. Aye, no doubt.

661
00:43:22,422 --> 00:43:23,824
So... Leech.

662
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,358
That's the ticket.

663
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,824
Four wood cuts,
four etchings.

664
00:43:27,827 --> 00:43:29,393
The cover in red.
Hand-colored.

665
00:43:29,396 --> 00:43:32,297
The title in rustic,
spectral writing.

666
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,431
The end papers to be green and
all three edges to be gilded.

667
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:37,536
Gilded?
It'll cost you.

668
00:43:37,538 --> 00:43:40,539
Well, it must be exquisite.
That's why we came to you.

669
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,976
You'll have to sell every
copy to make your money back.

670
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:46,344
That is my intention.

671
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:48,780
You brought
the manuscript?

672
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:50,648
I'll have
something for you in a week.

673
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,449
- A week?
- Mmm.

674
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:54,820
That leaves only four weeks
to do all the illustrations

675
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:56,891
and get it to the printer
in time for Christmas.

676
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:02,927
- Can you do it?
- Mr. Dickens, I'm not a hired hand.

677
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,465
I am an artist.

678
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:08,601
What you are asking
is impossible.

679
00:44:09,835 --> 00:44:12,338
Impossible
for an ordinary man.

680
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,742
But you are no ordinary man,
Mr. Leech.

681
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,878
You are a genius.

682
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:21,715
Fifty pounds.

683
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,483
Paid in advance.

684
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:27,021
Plus more
for the plates.

685
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:35,061
Done.
Thank you, Mr. Leech.

686
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:40,565
Look, Charles, I don't want
to be the voice of doom,

687
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:42,934
but before we lay out
money for illustrations,

688
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:46,373
we should consider what happens
if you don't finish on time.

689
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:49,010
I <i>will</i> finish on time.

690
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:51,846
Quite.

691
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:58,516
Mr. Dickens. I fix the chandelier.
See?

692
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:01,487
Yes. Good.
<i>Grazie,</i> Signor Mazzini.

693
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:03,021
Is no problem.

694
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:06,023
Only 12 guineas extra.

695
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:08,494
Wh... Tw...

696
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:11,829
I thought my father was off
to the British Library.

697
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:14,833
Your sister's here, sir. Come from
Manchester with her little boy.

698
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:15,936
Ah.

699
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:19,938
- My dear sister! Ha-ha!
- Charley.

700
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:23,742
Henry, how are you?

701
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:25,878
Very well,
grace be to God.

702
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,914
This cannot be young Master Henry.
I barely recognize you.

703
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:31,483
- How old are you now?
- Nine, if you please, sir.

704
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:33,918
Nine? I shall soon
run out of fingers.

705
00:45:39,793 --> 00:45:41,693
Excuse me, sir.

706
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:44,829
The children are having their
tea in the dining room.

707
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,701
Come on then, young 'un.
Up!

708
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:53,574
Mind your head.

709
00:45:54,842 --> 00:45:56,873
There goes my heart.

710
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:59,010
What did
the doctor say?

711
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:00,847
He says we have to
wait and see.

712
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:03,715
Won't you
let us help?

713
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:06,552
- We'll manage.
- At least until Henry finds a new position.

714
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:08,853
Something will come up.
I'm sure of it.

715
00:46:08,856 --> 00:46:11,190
You sound
just like Father.

716
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:13,925
How is the old reprobate?

717
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:17,661
"This morning I had 25 shillings in my
hand. And now, observe the vacancy."

718
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:19,630
He means no harm.

719
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:23,501
It's not enough. He bobs around
like a cork on the surface of life.

720
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:25,670
- Not a thought for the future.
- Oh, Charley.

721
00:46:25,672 --> 00:46:28,507
Let it go, can't you?

722
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:32,478
Come on, me army!
Me landlubbers, me lovelies!

723
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,248
Oh! Up we go.
Ha-ha! Me landlubbers!

724
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,585
Come aboard my ship!
Here we go! Let's set sail!

725
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:43,920
Brail your capstan bar!
Come here, Walter.

726
00:46:43,922 --> 00:46:46,824
- Brail your capstan bar!
- No one is useless in this world...

727
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:49,960
Who lightens the burden
of another. I know.

728
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:54,199
For all his faults,
you won't find a kinder man.

729
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:56,934
How long he is
growing up to be one.

730
00:47:00,172 --> 00:47:02,811
Here we go!
Full sail ahead!

731
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:13,719
Why are you here?

732
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:17,224
You'd better come and see
who's just turned up.

733
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:24,931
Charles?

734
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:29,967
Just a bit of indigestion.
Go back to sleep.

735
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:31,472
Mmm.

736
00:47:49,722 --> 00:47:52,123
Tell him who you are.

737
00:47:52,126 --> 00:47:54,963
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Past.

738
00:47:58,097 --> 00:47:59,831
Follow.

739
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,833
Not bloody likely.

740
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:06,137
- Why not?
- Mucking around in the past? What's the point?

741
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:07,905
You might learn something.

742
00:48:07,907 --> 00:48:10,775
Well, I already know
everything I need to know.

743
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:13,744
- Uh, take him, why don't you?
- Me?

744
00:48:13,746 --> 00:48:16,315
- Yes, if you're so keen.
- It's not about me!

745
00:48:16,317 --> 00:48:19,253
Well, you're the author,
aren't you?

746
00:48:23,657 --> 00:48:24,992
Follow.

747
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:30,996
Don't cry. We'll be back
when the debt's paid.

748
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:35,099
- Why can't I stay with you?
- You're a big boy, Charley.

749
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:37,034
You're the breadwinner now.

750
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:40,737
You'll see.
It'll be an adventure.

751
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:42,911
You'll hardly think of us at all.

752
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:47,179
Time to go!

753
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:49,213
Now, sir,
enough of that.

754
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:51,083
Stand up tall.

755
00:48:51,085 --> 00:48:53,050
Blood of iron,
heart of ice.

756
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:55,085
Huh?

757
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:57,025
And remember!

758
00:48:58,257 --> 00:49:00,358
You're the son
of John Dickens!

759
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,159
A gentleman!

760
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:04,164
You be sure
and tell them that!

761
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:16,777
Well, come on then!

762
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:20,777
Blood of iron,

763
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,181
heart of ice.

764
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:32,157
- Good morning.
- What? Oh.

765
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,391
You were tossing and turning
all night, you know.

766
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:36,130
Yes. Bad dreams.

767
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,331
What about?

768
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,202
I don't know. Shadows.

769
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:45,268
Well...

770
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:47,371
a little daylight
will cure you.

771
00:49:47,373 --> 00:49:49,206
Now, Constable,

772
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,043
shall we ask Mr. Punch where
the baby's daddy's gone?

773
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:53,844
I bet he knows.

774
00:49:53,847 --> 00:49:57,349
- Oh! Where's the baby's daddy gone?
- Where's he gone, Mr. Punch?

775
00:49:57,351 --> 00:49:59,885
Daddy's off to prison!

776
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,018
Off to prison? Oh-ho!

777
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:05,056
Come on. We're wasting time.
Let's get to work.

778
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:06,891
I <i>am</i> working.

779
00:50:06,893 --> 00:50:09,927
- Here?
- Yes. Gathering inspiration.

780
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,097
Gathering what?

781
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:16,199
- What do you see when you look around?
- Well, it's a market, you idiot.

782
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,969
What else?

783
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:21,237
Hot pies!
Eel, beef or mutton pies!

784
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,378
- Buyers and sellers.
- What else?

785
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:27,445
Never say die.
Have a look, sir.

786
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:29,045
Thieves and ruffians.

787
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,748
Highly interesting murder,
gentlemen!

788
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:34,286
Hold! Hold!

789
00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:36,987
Clear the way!
Clear the way, lads!

790
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:38,989
Mr. Fezziwig!

791
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:47,797
Life, Mr. Scrooge.

792
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,168
It's London. The great
theater of the world.

793
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,436
- It's all here.
- Bah. Humbug!

794
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:55,507
I'm a man of facts,
of calculations.

795
00:50:55,509 --> 00:50:57,943
Realities, not fancy.

796
00:50:57,945 --> 00:50:59,447
What the devil is that?

797
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,016
Here you go, sir.

798
00:51:11,492 --> 00:51:13,992
- Must go.
- Where to?

799
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:15,228
It's time to write.

800
00:51:24,204 --> 00:51:26,469
- Come along.
- Good night, children!

801
00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:29,143
Bye! Shoo!

802
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:38,550
Well, looks as though Charles
won't be joining us. Again.

803
00:51:38,552 --> 00:51:40,518
- We may as well start.
- Oh.

804
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:42,786
Ah, the parties.

805
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:44,922
We used to keep such hours.

806
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:47,858
Balls, dinners, champagne.

807
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,027
First-rate capon,
Mrs. Fisk.

808
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,797
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'll let the cook know.

809
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,333
And the chairs
had turned legs,

810
00:51:55,335 --> 00:51:58,135
with green squabs
to match the curtains.

811
00:51:58,137 --> 00:52:00,005
What was that story,
Mother?

812
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:04,074
Oh, I was just telling Kate about the
dining room set we used to have.

813
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:07,512
Rosewood.
In the most approved taste.

814
00:52:07,514 --> 00:52:09,914
You mean the one
we pawned?

815
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,449
Oh!

816
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:16,085
Charles!
You are a satirical monster.

817
00:52:16,088 --> 00:52:18,255
- Is that a joke, Charles?
- Not a very amusing one.

818
00:52:18,257 --> 00:52:20,025
Is that a new waistcoat,
Father?

819
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:25,228
What? Oh, yes. It's Persian crimson.
A little more expensive.

820
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:28,532
But as I always say, people
will believe anything

821
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:30,467
if you are properly dressed.

822
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:33,905
Kate, will you ask Tara to bring
a tray up with something on it?

823
00:52:33,907 --> 00:52:36,842
- I'll bring it up.
- No. I need Tara to do it.

824
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:39,577
I'll get her, sir.
Tara!

825
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:42,414
That's the
spirit, my boy. Hmm?

826
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:45,983
Procrastination is the thief of
time, eh, Charles?

827
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:47,954
Collar him!

828
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,291
We must not
disturb the poet

829
00:52:54,293 --> 00:52:56,628
when the divine frenzy
is upon him.

830
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,534
Hmm.

831
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,146
Know the place?

832
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:17,018
Was I apprenticed here?

833
00:53:18,652 --> 00:53:22,518
Clear the way, lads! Clear the way.
It's Friday night.

834
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:25,989
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

835
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:39,271
Who is it?

836
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:41,309
It's Tara, sir,
with your dinner.

837
00:53:48,315 --> 00:53:50,050
Tara.
Come in. Come in.

838
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:53,621
Close the door.

839
00:53:56,123 --> 00:53:57,987
Sit. I want to
read you something.

840
00:53:57,989 --> 00:53:59,989
Oh... Oh, I... I don't think Mrs.
Fisk would...

841
00:53:59,992 --> 00:54:02,693
Ah! Skittleshins
to Mrs. Fisk.

842
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:04,628
Come. Sit.

843
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:09,699
Now, since you
like ghost stories,

844
00:54:09,702 --> 00:54:12,505
see if this can rival
<i>Varney the Vampire.</i>

845
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:17,409
"With cherry-cheeked apples,

846
00:54:17,411 --> 00:54:20,679
juicy oranges,
luscious pears,

847
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:23,715
immense Twelfth cakes
and seething bowls of punch

848
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:27,184
that made the chamber dim
with their delicious steam.

849
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:31,322
In easy state, upon this couch,
there sat a jolly giant..."

850
00:54:31,324 --> 00:54:33,590
- The second ghost.
- The second ghost.

851
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:42,032
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

852
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:46,737
These are the gifts
of abundance, goodwill,

853
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:48,405
and of generosity.

854
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:50,239
Uh-huh.

855
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:53,344
Of course, you wouldn't understand
much about that, would you?

856
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,081
Unlike these good people.

857
00:54:57,617 --> 00:55:00,719
My dear Mrs. Cratchit, you have
outdone yourself this year.

858
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:03,054
Oh, everyone pitched in.
Even Tim.

859
00:55:03,056 --> 00:55:05,358
- I set the table.
- Yes, you did.

860
00:55:08,027 --> 00:55:10,661
I didn't know Cratchit
had a crippled son.

861
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:12,362
Didn't you ever think
to ask?

862
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:15,266
A merry Christmas
to us all, my dears.

863
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:18,139
- And may God bless us.
- God bless us, every one.

864
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:23,239
He's my clerk. I don't pay him to
tell me about his personal life.

865
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:25,641
- You hardly pay him at all.
- Fifteen shillings a week.

866
00:55:25,643 --> 00:55:28,545
For a man with a family,
not to mention a sick child?

867
00:55:32,485 --> 00:55:34,454
That's the market rate.

868
00:55:36,123 --> 00:55:39,090
Do you really believe
that every inch of existence

869
00:55:39,092 --> 00:55:41,492
is a bargain
across the counter?

870
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:43,494
Observe this family.

871
00:55:43,496 --> 00:55:48,099
They don't have much, but they're happy,
grateful, contented with their lot.

872
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:52,237
Whereas you are miserable
and content with nothing.

873
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:54,737
Never heard such folly.

874
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:01,315
Heed well what I've said.

875
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:04,181
Farewell.

876
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:06,186
And... intermission!

877
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,789
- Thrilling performance.
- That's very kind. Thank you.

878
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,994
And that is as far
as I've got.

879
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:20,831
- Tara.
- Hmm?

880
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:25,402
- How do you do that, sir?
- Do what?

881
00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:27,572
Make a world come alive.

882
00:56:27,574 --> 00:56:30,210
I could almost see
and hear them people.

883
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:34,311
Especially that Tiny Tim.

884
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:35,782
Poor mite.

885
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:48,492
Um...
A word in your ear.

886
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:52,130
- About what?
- The scene.

887
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:55,867
- It's very one-sided.
- What? One-sided?

888
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:58,505
Well, my character doesn't get
to explain his side of things.

889
00:57:00,773 --> 00:57:03,708
- So I've taken the liberty of writing a short speech.
- No.

890
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,777
Something about the
rational self-interest...

891
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,780
and the natural tendencies
of free markets...

892
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:11,318
No. No. And no.

893
00:57:13,286 --> 00:57:15,152
Well, what sort of book
is this anyway?

894
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:19,623
No! It's too... Ew.
It's too gloomy.

895
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:21,793
The Ghost of Christmas
Present should be wonderful.

896
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,862
Warm, jolly!

897
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:25,795
- Jolly?
- Yes!

898
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:27,632
A jolly ghost?

899
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,135
That's it.

900
00:57:39,846 --> 00:57:42,313
- What's this?
- Find another artist.

901
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:44,315
We don't want
another artist.

902
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:48,585
A jolly Christmas ghost?
What's that mean?

903
00:57:48,588 --> 00:57:52,489
I can't draw
what I don't understand.

904
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:56,360
Well, it is everything
that's best about Christmas.

905
00:57:56,362 --> 00:58:01,166
He's the soul of kindness
and generosity. He's...

906
00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:04,369
Well, he's Forster.

907
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:05,936
Eh?

908
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:08,208
With a beard.

909
00:58:12,512 --> 00:58:13,847
Come on. Jolly.

910
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:58,856
In shops by Christmas?

911
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,657
That'll be a miracle.

912
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:02,594
Go away.

913
00:59:02,596 --> 00:59:06,766
Three flops in a row.
Up to your eyeballs in debt.

914
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:10,534
I'd think you'd be glad
of some advice.

915
00:59:10,536 --> 00:59:13,237
So, you've had a few flops.
What of it?

916
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:16,340
You're still young. It's not
as if you're an old man.

917
00:59:16,342 --> 00:59:18,378
You've still got lots of time to be...

918
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:48,539
Are we in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?

919
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:53,280
- Why doesn't he speak?
- Shh!

920
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:01,985
You are here to show us the shadows
of the things that have not been,

921
01:00:01,987 --> 01:00:04,389
but will happen,
in the time before us.

922
01:00:04,391 --> 01:00:05,693
Is that so?

923
01:00:17,603 --> 01:00:19,335
Where does
it want us to go?

924
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:21,240
I think I know.

925
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,981
I have a bad feeling
about this. I...

926
01:00:34,788 --> 01:00:38,389
And then they entered
poor Bob Cratchit's house

927
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:40,791
and found the mother and the
children round the fire.

928
01:00:45,532 --> 01:00:46,831
It's okay.
It's okay.

929
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,735
Then Bob came in the door.

930
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,809
You went today then,
Robert?

931
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:01,047
To the cemetery?

932
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:04,449
Yes, my dear.

933
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:09,820
I wish you could have gone
to see how green a place it is.

934
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:11,987
But you'll see it often.

935
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:16,764
I promised him that I would
take a walk there on a Sunday.

936
01:01:22,469 --> 01:01:24,371
My little child.

937
01:01:28,474 --> 01:01:30,007
- My little, little child.
- "...little child."

938
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:32,007
- No!
- Uh, rude!

939
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:34,748
- Is Tiny Tim dead?
- Well, of course he is. Imbecile.

940
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,114
He was very ill.

941
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:39,882
You can't save
every child in London.

942
01:01:39,885 --> 01:01:42,518
And the family
has no money for a doctor.

943
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:44,554
Then Scrooge must save him!

944
01:01:44,556 --> 01:01:45,590
Me?

945
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:48,793
- But he wouldn't...
- Why?

946
01:01:48,795 --> 01:01:51,460
- Well, he's too selfish.
- He can change.

947
01:01:51,463 --> 01:01:53,530
There's good in him somewhere,
I know it!

948
01:01:53,532 --> 01:01:55,768
People don't change.

949
01:01:57,737 --> 01:02:00,103
He's been this way
for a long time.

950
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:02,407
I'm not sure
he can change.

951
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:05,112
Of course he can.
He's not a monster.

952
01:02:07,012 --> 01:02:09,478
I thought this was a ghost
story, not a fairy tale.

953
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:13,016
He wouldn't let Tiny Tim die,
Mr. Dickens.

954
01:02:13,018 --> 01:02:15,853
He has a heart,
doesn't he?

955
01:02:15,855 --> 01:02:18,056
It would be
too wicked...

956
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:21,960
even for him.

957
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:09,739
'Tis now the
very witching time of night...

958
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:10,940
Hush!

959
01:03:10,943 --> 01:03:13,143
when graveyards
yawn and hell...

960
01:03:13,146 --> 01:03:15,947
Aha, Shakespeare.

961
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:18,081
There's a man
who could write.

962
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:21,650
I doubt he ever
had a blockage.

963
01:03:21,652 --> 01:03:24,722
Self-preservation...
first law of nature.

964
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:26,025
And that's
just a fact.

965
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:30,728
Oh, hush.

966
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:33,164
Oh, Charles! Good evening.

967
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,199
We'll get him straight
into bed, Charles.

968
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:39,036
We were up the river to Kew, and I
think perhaps it was too long a day.

969
01:03:39,038 --> 01:03:42,005
- Kew.
- Kew?

970
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:44,608
- What about your newspaper article?
- Article?

971
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,177
Yes, the one you're writing.
It's been over a month.

972
01:03:47,179 --> 01:03:49,579
Oh!

973
01:03:49,581 --> 01:03:51,516
Oh, ho! Oh!

974
01:03:51,518 --> 01:03:53,818
No, the, um...

975
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,588
The editor felt that due
to pecuniary complications

976
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,791
of a most complicated
nature,

977
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:03,793
he felt he could not proceed
with the commission.

978
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:05,594
So, no newspaper article.

979
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:09,233
No. However,
I rejoice in saying

980
01:04:09,235 --> 01:04:12,637
I have every hope
something will turn up.

981
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:15,541
I think it's time you went
back to Devon, Father.

982
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:19,213
- Indeed.
- As soon as possible.

983
01:04:23,181 --> 01:04:25,748
Of course, dear boy.

984
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:28,188
We shall catch the
afternoon train tomorrow.

985
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,623
No, sweet.

986
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:35,496
I can manage
from here.

987
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:37,864
Thank you.

988
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:41,201
Good night, Charles.

989
01:04:44,804 --> 01:04:48,204
Ride on, ride on,

990
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:50,574
over all obstacles

991
01:04:50,577 --> 01:04:52,842
and win the race.

992
01:04:52,844 --> 01:04:55,210
Don't be unkind,
Charley.

993
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:57,280
You don't know
what he's been through.

994
01:04:57,282 --> 01:05:00,184
He feels it all,
you know.

995
01:05:00,186 --> 01:05:04,123
He would never tell you,
but he feels it all.

996
01:05:23,742 --> 01:05:28,179
That's it. Blood of
iron, heart of ice.

997
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:30,717
Now perhaps we can finish
this little book.

998
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:39,289
"Are these the shadows
of the things that will be,

999
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:42,327
or are they shadows of the
things that may be only?"

1000
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:47,900
That is as far
as I've got.

1001
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:52,003
It's brilliant.

1002
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:54,737
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No. No, of course not.

1003
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:58,177
Well, now...
that's encouraging.

1004
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:02,880
My... My one criticism...

1005
01:06:02,882 --> 01:06:04,414
Yes?

1006
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:07,150
- Tiny Tim.
- Go on.

1007
01:06:07,152 --> 01:06:10,021
- Are you really going to let him die?
- Aw, not you as well.

1008
01:06:10,023 --> 01:06:13,190
It's a Christmas book.
Shouldn't it be hopeful?

1009
01:06:13,192 --> 01:06:15,324
I mean, isn't that what... what...
what Christmas is all about?

1010
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:19,429
The hope that in the end, our
better natures will prevail?

1011
01:06:19,431 --> 01:06:22,132
You were the one who persuaded
me to kill off Little Nell.

1012
01:06:22,135 --> 01:06:23,766
Yeah. Well, I stand by
that decision.

1013
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:25,369
John, my readers
implored me...

1014
01:06:25,371 --> 01:06:29,242
But this is different. If Tiny
Tim dies, then what's the point?

1015
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,842
- Thank you, John.
- You're welcome.

1016
01:06:32,844 --> 01:06:35,679
For reminding me why I never
ask your opinion on my work.

1017
01:06:35,681 --> 01:06:38,014
Your services
are no longer required.

1018
01:06:38,016 --> 01:06:39,949
- You cannot sack me.
- Why not?

1019
01:06:39,952 --> 01:06:43,018
Because I don't work for you.
I do what I do as a friend.

1020
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:47,123
John, please leave.

1021
01:06:47,126 --> 01:06:50,760
See you on Friday.

1022
01:06:50,762 --> 01:06:53,365
Last chapter's due
at the printers.

1023
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:05,976
Right. Let's run it again from the
scene with Scrooge's debtors.

1024
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:07,878
- Oh, what's the point?
- The point?

1025
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,713
We keep stopping
at the same place.

1026
01:07:09,715 --> 01:07:12,181
Yes, because
I'm working out the ending.

1027
01:07:12,184 --> 01:07:14,851
- Admit it, you're blocked!
- I'm not blocked.

1028
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:16,121
Now, if you take
my advice...

1029
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:19,989
- I'm the author here.
- Allegedly.

1030
01:07:22,494 --> 01:07:24,197
I'm going out.

1031
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,103
- Alone!
- Aw.

1032
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:40,744
Forster.
I need your help.

1033
01:07:40,746 --> 01:07:43,416
- What is it? The children?
- No. The children are fine.

1034
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:46,248
What's this?

1035
01:07:46,251 --> 01:07:50,186
"Candle-scandal, flirt-hurt,
Charlotte-poor heart."

1036
01:07:50,188 --> 01:07:53,025
Is that a poem? That's atrocious.
What has got into you?

1037
01:07:54,827 --> 01:07:57,327
You look terrible.
What's the matter?

1038
01:07:57,329 --> 01:07:59,829
It's the book. I'm struggling
with one of the characters.

1039
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:02,768
Whoo-hoo! Ah!

1040
01:08:06,873 --> 01:08:09,773
- Quite a few of them, actually.
- What exactly is the problem?

1041
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:15,146
The problem is, could a man as mean-spirited
as Scrooge, as evil as Scrooge...

1042
01:08:15,148 --> 01:08:18,347
Could he become a different
person overnight?

1043
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:21,152
What is so evil about him?

1044
01:08:21,154 --> 01:08:23,253
- Well, he's a miser.
- Well, that doesn't make him evil.

1045
01:08:23,256 --> 01:08:25,789
- It just makes him cheap.
- He worships money.

1046
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,894
- It's the only thing that matters to him.
- Why?

1047
01:08:30,328 --> 01:08:32,896
He has nothing else.

1048
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:34,801
No friends? No family?

1049
01:08:37,837 --> 01:08:39,869
No one he trusts.

1050
01:08:39,872 --> 01:08:41,471
Why?

1051
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:44,211
Because he's afraid.

1052
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:47,010
Of?

1053
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:53,216
Being found out.

1054
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:57,253
- Hello, chaps.
- Thackeray.

1055
01:08:57,256 --> 01:09:01,356
Charles, I haven't seen anything
of yours in print for ages.

1056
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,592
Don't tell me
you've had a blockage.

1057
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:06,996
Not in the least. I'm neck and
heels into a Christmas book.

1058
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:10,967
- What the deuce is that?
- A story about Christmas.

1059
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:12,569
For Christmas.

1060
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:15,872
A story... about...?

1061
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:18,007
How amusing.

1062
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,342
Well, best of luck with it.

1063
01:09:20,345 --> 01:09:25,148
Oh, dear, my last book has
come out in a Railway edition.

1064
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:27,483
Sold 10,000 copies,
in a week.

1065
01:09:27,484 --> 01:09:30,019
"There's gold
in them thar hills,"

1066
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,524
as your American friends
would say.

1067
01:09:36,362 --> 01:09:39,864
Come on. Let's go somewhere
else, get a real drink.

1068
01:09:48,006 --> 01:09:52,408
She's a big lass, and a bonny
lass, and she likes her beer.

1069
01:09:52,411 --> 01:09:57,646
And I call her Cushie Butterfield,
and I wish she was here.

1070
01:09:57,649 --> 01:09:59,949
What language is that?

1071
01:09:59,952 --> 01:10:02,055
That's Geordie, man.
We're gods.

1072
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:07,390
- Where are we?
- Oh, it's Hungerford Stairs.

1073
01:10:07,393 --> 01:10:08,895
Oi, I smell the river.

1074
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:14,931
What's that?

1075
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:16,599
It's a graveyard.

1076
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,336
Ah, it's the old Warren's Factory.
They moved from there years ago.

1077
01:10:20,337 --> 01:10:22,338
I wonder they've not
pulled it down yet.

1078
01:10:22,341 --> 01:10:25,141
Yeah.
Or burnt it down.

1079
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:27,110
Might do it myself
one day.

1080
01:10:27,113 --> 01:10:29,381
Why? What have you got
against boot blacking?

1081
01:10:30,114 --> 01:10:31,451
Charles.

1082
01:10:32,283 --> 01:10:33,586
What is it?

1083
01:10:35,154 --> 01:10:37,587
I just have
this recurring nightmare.

1084
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:40,088
Oh, nightmares, aye.

1085
01:10:40,091 --> 01:10:42,659
I've got one where I'm being
chased by a giant badger.

1086
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,931
What's yours?

1087
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,001
Never mind.

1088
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,337
Well, come on.
It's time to go home.

1089
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,539
I'll see you at the printers.
Friday morning, nine o'clock.

1090
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:58,411
- I can't.
- Well, why not?

1091
01:11:00,947 --> 01:11:04,213
It's the book.

1092
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:07,252
I can't... The characters
won't do what I want.

1093
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:12,689
And I'm afraid.

1094
01:11:12,692 --> 01:11:15,158
Of what?

1095
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:18,360
If I can't finish it,
I'll never write again.

1096
01:11:18,363 --> 01:11:21,597
Oh, come on, man, come on.
Have some sleep, hear?

1097
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,136
I can't.

1098
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:28,271
The wrong fire
is burning in my head.

1099
01:11:28,274 --> 01:11:31,039
Oh, don't be daft. Now, come on,
your wife will be worried sick.

1100
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:32,976
Who? Kate?
She doesn't understand me.

1101
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:36,244
I've got news for you, Charles.
None of us understand you.

1102
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:38,548
You're...
You're a freak of nature.

1103
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:41,652
I'm exhausted spending
two hours in your company.

1104
01:11:41,654 --> 01:11:44,220
Come on, go home.
It's cold tonight, yeah?

1105
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:47,056
I'll see you Friday.

1106
01:11:47,059 --> 01:11:50,760
<i>âª Oh, she's a big lass And a bonny
lass And she likes her beer âª</i>

1107
01:12:03,175 --> 01:12:05,278
Here. Bye.

1108
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:14,453
Put that one over there!

1109
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,159
Boys!

1110
01:12:23,162 --> 01:12:26,561
This here
is Charley Dickens.

1111
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:29,201
And what was you just telling me, lad?
About your dad?

1112
01:12:36,341 --> 01:12:38,106
My father
is a gentleman.

1113
01:12:38,109 --> 01:12:41,177
Where is he then?

1114
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,380
- Dining with the queen?
- I heard he's been sent to prison.

1115
01:12:44,381 --> 01:12:46,382
Hush, you lot.
Get back to work!

1116
01:12:46,385 --> 01:12:47,385
Master Dickens.

1117
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:50,756
No shirkin' here.

1118
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:57,229
You're no better than us, cocker,
and you'd best learn that.

1119
01:13:31,162 --> 01:13:33,563
You.
What are you doing?

1120
01:13:33,564 --> 01:13:35,798
Hello, Charley, old boy.

1121
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:38,201
Father?
What are you doing here?

1122
01:13:38,203 --> 01:13:41,871
Oh, I had some business that I had
to attend to, so I thought...

1123
01:13:41,872 --> 01:13:44,740
You just left town. What business
could you possibly have?

1124
01:13:44,743 --> 01:13:46,578
- Oh, I...
- What's that?

1125
01:13:49,613 --> 01:13:51,117
You're going
to sell this?

1126
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:54,518
Well, it's no good to you,
is it?

1127
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,819
Is that what
you've been doing?

1128
01:13:56,822 --> 01:13:59,755
Going through the rubbish like a
tramp, selling bits and pieces of me.

1129
01:13:59,756 --> 01:14:02,692
Is this your business?

1130
01:14:02,694 --> 01:14:06,195
- Aren't you ashamed?
- What?

1131
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:09,731
I bought you a house.
I gave you an allowance.

1132
01:14:09,734 --> 01:14:11,835
What more can you
possibly need?

1133
01:14:11,837 --> 01:14:16,239
Need?
Oh, reason not the need.

1134
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:19,175
- You see me here, you gods?
- No. No. Shh. No.

1135
01:14:19,176 --> 01:14:21,711
- A poor old man!
- No! Shh! Stop it.

1136
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:27,617
Charley, you don't know what it's
like to be poor, to be nothing.

1137
01:14:27,618 --> 01:14:30,319
At 11 years old
I was made to know.

1138
01:14:30,322 --> 01:14:32,889
Working 12 hours a day,

1139
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,426
going hungry,
alone and afraid

1140
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:40,463
because your father, who is
supposed to care for you,

1141
01:14:40,466 --> 01:14:42,532
is so utterly
thriftless!

1142
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:44,634
No, please.
I beg you.

1143
01:14:44,636 --> 01:14:46,702
No, you are not
the victim here.

1144
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:48,738
This is about me and your
family and all of us

1145
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:52,208
who've lived our whole lives in
the shadow of your recklessness.

1146
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:55,311
Charley...

1147
01:14:55,314 --> 01:14:59,548
Go away. I am sickened
at the sight of you.

1148
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:03,219
You are nothing but a drag
and chain upon my life.

1149
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,588
I owe you nothing. Go!

1150
01:15:05,591 --> 01:15:06,893
Ah, Charley.

1151
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:38,454
- Who's that then?
- Nobody.

1152
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:40,256
- The author.
- Huh.

1153
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:42,261
No wonder he looks
so depressed.

1154
01:15:47,698 --> 01:15:49,899
Right. That's enough.
Back to work.

1155
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:52,001
God bless us,
every one.

1156
01:15:52,002 --> 01:15:54,337
Why are you so miserable?

1157
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,273
What else can I be, when I live
in such a world of fools as this?

1158
01:15:57,274 --> 01:15:59,542
- You mean-spirited, cynical...
- Oh, yes?

1159
01:15:59,545 --> 01:16:01,543
Well, you look
in the mirror sometime.

1160
01:16:01,546 --> 01:16:03,378
"Is that a new candle, Kate?"

1161
01:16:03,381 --> 01:16:05,414
"Your services
are no longer required."

1162
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:08,684
Ah, a hypocrite.

1163
01:16:10,622 --> 01:16:12,421
- What?
- Pardon me, sir.

1164
01:16:12,422 --> 01:16:14,390
- Mrs. Dickens just wanted me to ask...
- This is intolerable.

1165
01:16:14,393 --> 01:16:18,894
- Mrs. Fisk! Mrs. Fisk!
- Yes, sir?

1166
01:16:18,895 --> 01:16:22,734
Take this child away from here and see that she
never disturbs me ever again. Do you hear?

1167
01:16:23,969 --> 01:16:26,470
Yes, sir.
Come with me, girl.

1168
01:16:27,904 --> 01:16:30,905
Oh, yes. Banish her.
Banish them all.

1169
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:33,643
- Quiet!
- Humanity's great benefactor.

1170
01:16:33,645 --> 01:16:35,378
- Humbug!
- Shut it.

1171
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:37,847
Or I'll make you bald,
with bad teeth.

1172
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:40,615
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
It won't change a thing.

1173
01:16:40,618 --> 01:16:42,688
You still won't have an ending.

1174
01:16:48,426 --> 01:16:50,693
This is ridiculous.

1175
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:52,966
You're all being ridiculous.

1176
01:17:00,506 --> 01:17:03,972
If you be a man!

1177
01:17:03,975 --> 01:17:06,676
Come on then, coward!

1178
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:08,511
Fight me!

1179
01:17:08,514 --> 01:17:10,713
You miserable old fool!

1180
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:13,619
Fight me! Come on!

1181
01:18:01,698 --> 01:18:03,099
Tara.

1182
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,305
Tara!

1183
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:09,805
Has anybody seen Tara?

1184
01:18:09,806 --> 01:18:12,807
- She's gone.
- You asked Mrs. Fisk to send her away.

1185
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:15,911
Well, go and search for her.
Find her.

1186
01:18:15,912 --> 01:18:18,481
Rehire her at once.

1187
01:18:18,484 --> 01:18:23,786
An Irish orphan in London? That would be
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

1188
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:27,523
Come on, out. Come on,
children, off you go.

1189
01:18:27,524 --> 01:18:29,560
Quick sticks.
That's it.

1190
01:18:31,462 --> 01:18:33,128
Why didn't you
stop her?

1191
01:18:33,131 --> 01:18:35,765
How was I to know you didn't mean it?
You said...

1192
01:18:35,768 --> 01:18:39,402
I say a lot of things that are
nonsense when I'm working.

1193
01:18:39,404 --> 01:18:43,172
- Charles...
- You know how ideas take possession of me.

1194
01:18:43,175 --> 01:18:47,578
- You knew what I was like when you married me.
- Yes. I did.

1195
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:52,818
But you have no idea
what it's like to live with you.

1196
01:18:54,118 --> 01:18:55,951
Always walking
on eggshells,

1197
01:18:55,953 --> 01:18:57,853
trying to guess your mood,

1198
01:18:57,854 --> 01:19:00,859
to know which of your commands are
a whim and which are in earnest.

1199
01:19:02,859 --> 01:19:04,729
You know, sometimes I...

1200
01:19:06,564 --> 01:19:09,597
I feel your characters
matter more to you

1201
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,703
than your own flesh and blood.

1202
01:19:19,778 --> 01:19:21,113
I am who I am.

1203
01:19:23,046 --> 01:19:25,581
And who is that?

1204
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:28,018
It's as if
there are two of you.

1205
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:30,920
One who's kind and gentle,

1206
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:33,189
and a secret self

1207
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:35,926
that no one is allowed
to know or question.

1208
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:58,140
<i>This here
is Charley Dickens.</i>

1209
01:20:58,143 --> 01:21:01,680
<i>What was it you was telling me,
lad, about your dad?</i>

1210
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,015
<i>My father is a gentleman.</i>

1211
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,619
<i>Where is he then?
Dining with the queen?</i>

1212
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:12,621
<i>I heard he's
been sent to prison!</i>

1213
01:21:12,622 --> 01:21:15,824
<i>Hush, you lot! Where's your manners?
Get back to work.</i>

1214
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:17,760
<i>Master Dickens.</i>

1215
01:21:17,761 --> 01:21:20,229
<i>Got a present
for the young gentleman,</i>

1216
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:22,935
<i>seeing as it's Christmas.</i>

1217
01:21:33,145 --> 01:21:35,677
Blood of iron,
heart of ice.

1218
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,282
<i>You're no better
than us, cocker!</i>

1219
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,889
Hello, Charley.

1220
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:51,060
So, this is
your miserable secret.

1221
01:21:51,063 --> 01:21:55,364
The famous author,
the inimitable Charles Dickens,

1222
01:21:55,367 --> 01:21:59,969
was once a scabby
little factory boy.

1223
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,704
Leave me be.

1224
01:22:01,707 --> 01:22:05,641
A common bit of riffraff,
a squalid wretch.

1225
01:22:05,644 --> 01:22:08,247
No use to anyone!

1226
01:22:20,024 --> 01:22:23,893
Look for yourself.
What do you see, huh?

1227
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:27,963
A nothing. A nobody.
A debtor's son.

1228
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:30,202
Who could ever care
for you?

1229
01:22:32,871 --> 01:22:36,805
Certainly not your father.
He abandoned you.

1230
01:22:36,806 --> 01:22:39,775
Enough of that.
Stand up tall.

1231
01:22:39,778 --> 01:22:41,314
Blood of iron,
heart of ice.

1232
01:22:42,846 --> 01:22:44,750
He failed you again and again.

1233
01:22:47,019 --> 01:22:48,019
Oh!

1234
01:22:51,055 --> 01:22:52,887
You said so yourself.

1235
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:56,795
Nothing but a drag and chain
upon your life.

1236
01:22:58,162 --> 01:22:59,764
Who are you? Huh?

1237
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,336
You know me, Charley.

1238
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:08,837
I'm hunger. I'm cold.

1239
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,774
I'm darkness.

1240
01:23:12,444 --> 01:23:17,350
I'm the shadow on your thoughts,
the crack in your heart,

1241
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:22,154
and the stain upon your soul.

1242
01:23:23,755 --> 01:23:26,890
And I will never,
ever leave you.

1243
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:30,859
Go away.

1244
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:32,965
Why? We're having such fun.

1245
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:35,831
People don't change, Charley.

1246
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:40,034
Look around you. You're
still the same scabby boy.

1247
01:23:40,037 --> 01:23:42,707
Useless,
just like your father.

1248
01:23:45,341 --> 01:23:46,877
No.

1249
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:52,850
"No one is useless in this world who
lightens the burden of another."

1250
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:57,154
My father
taught me that.

1251
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:10,135
Which grave is that?

1252
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:15,273
- There's no name on it.
- Well, why should there be?

1253
01:24:17,175 --> 01:24:19,307
The man to whom
this grave belongs

1254
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,279
never made himself useful
to anyone but himself.

1255
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:24,512
No friends.

1256
01:24:24,515 --> 01:24:26,051
No family.

1257
01:24:27,752 --> 01:24:30,689
Never felt love or joy.

1258
01:24:32,224 --> 01:24:34,694
Never took any kind
of pleasure in life.

1259
01:24:43,033 --> 01:24:45,304
And now it's too late.

1260
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,207
It's time, Mr. Scrooge.

1261
01:24:50,306 --> 01:24:52,310
We've come to the end.

1262
01:25:20,372 --> 01:25:23,109
I don't want to die.

1263
01:25:24,376 --> 01:25:26,375
Not like this...

1264
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:29,177
alone,

1265
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,082
unloved, forgotten.

1266
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,349
It's too late.

1267
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,418
No, it's never too late.

1268
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:39,291
It's never...
It's never too late.

1269
01:25:46,264 --> 01:25:49,463
I will honor Christmas
in my heart

1270
01:25:49,466 --> 01:25:51,934
and try to keep it
all the year.

1271
01:25:51,935 --> 01:25:55,204
I will live in the past,
the present, and the future.

1272
01:25:55,207 --> 01:25:58,974
The spirits of all three
will strive within me.

1273
01:25:58,975 --> 01:26:03,247
I will not shut out
the lessons that they teach.

1274
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:07,484
Oh, please. I beg you.

1275
01:26:10,854 --> 01:26:13,957
Let me do some good...

1276
01:26:15,961 --> 01:26:18,360
before I die.

1277
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:26,537
So we come
to the final chapter.

1278
01:26:30,942 --> 01:26:33,912
Oh, I told you we'd do great
things together, Mr. Scrooge.

1279
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:02,006
<i>Stave five.</i>

1280
01:27:03,408 --> 01:27:05,211
<i>"The End of It."</i>

1281
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:10,679
<i>Yes. And the bedpost
was his own,</i>

1282
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:15,117
<i>the bed was his own,
the room was his own.</i>

1283
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:18,858
<i>Best and happiest of all, the time before
him was his own to make amends in.</i>

1284
01:27:20,926 --> 01:27:22,557
<i>Scrooge was better
than his word.</i>

1285
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,293
<i>He did it all
and infinitely more.</i>

1286
01:27:25,296 --> 01:27:28,262
<i>And to Tiny Tim,
who did not die,</i>

1287
01:27:28,265 --> 01:27:30,666
<i>he was a second father.</i>

1288
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:33,435
<i>And so,
as Tiny Tim observed,</i>

1289
01:27:33,438 --> 01:27:36,207
<i>"God bless us, every one."</i>

1290
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:40,944
<i>The end.</i>

1291
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:44,617
The end.

1292
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:54,389
- Charles?
- What?

1293
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:56,557
- There is someone here to see you.
- Not now, Kate, please.

1294
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,229
I have to get this to the
printer by nine o'clock.

1295
01:28:07,706 --> 01:28:09,239
Tara.

1296
01:28:10,274 --> 01:28:11,643
Thank you for the loan.

1297
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:16,547
Well, thank you.

1298
01:28:18,716 --> 01:28:20,184
It's good, isn't it?

1299
01:28:22,051 --> 01:28:26,521
Oh, yes, sir.
It was fizzing.

1300
01:28:26,524 --> 01:28:29,662
Fizzing?
That's delightful.

1301
01:28:32,261 --> 01:28:33,631
Tara.

1302
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:39,534
I am very sorry that I sent you away.
That was a mistake.

1303
01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:41,105
And I was...

1304
01:28:44,309 --> 01:28:46,208
And you were right
about Tiny Tim.

1305
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:48,076
He doesn't die.

1306
01:28:48,078 --> 01:28:50,679
Scrooge helps him
to get better.

1307
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,318
And does he help Scrooge
get better too?

1308
01:28:56,453 --> 01:28:58,619
Yes.

1309
01:28:58,622 --> 01:29:01,326
Yes, he does.

1310
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:08,563
- Where did that come from?
- A gift.

1311
01:29:08,564 --> 01:29:11,701
For the children.
From your father.

1312
01:29:11,703 --> 01:29:13,635
My father was here?

1313
01:29:13,636 --> 01:29:17,172
You can still catch him, if...

1314
01:29:17,175 --> 01:29:18,510
Oh!

1315
01:29:21,345 --> 01:29:23,146
Kate.

1316
01:29:26,384 --> 01:29:28,682
I know.
You don't deserve me.

1317
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:31,055
Go. Go.

1318
01:29:36,261 --> 01:29:38,197
- Cab!
- Whoa!

1319
01:29:39,662 --> 01:29:41,630
- Paddington Station!
- Right-o, governor.

1320
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:44,002
- As fast as you can!
- Oi! Oi!

1321
01:29:48,104 --> 01:29:49,503
Whoa!

1322
01:29:49,506 --> 01:29:52,375
Turn it around.
And wait for me here!

1323
01:29:52,377 --> 01:29:54,342
Oi! Stop!

1324
01:29:54,345 --> 01:29:56,144
- Hey!
- Stop! Police!

1325
01:29:56,145 --> 01:29:58,079
Wait!

1326
01:29:58,082 --> 01:30:00,481
Wait, wait, please! Where
do you think you're going?

1327
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:02,652
- What?
- Oh, please, dear.

1328
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:06,822
- Don't make a scene. We're going away.
- No, you're not. Please.

1329
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:09,692
Police! Get out of my way! Clear the way!
Let me through!

1330
01:30:09,694 --> 01:30:12,159
Oh.
What have I done now?

1331
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:14,596
No, it's...
it's what you haven't done.

1332
01:30:14,599 --> 01:30:18,701
- What do you mean?
- Well, who's going to carve the turkey?

1333
01:30:18,703 --> 01:30:21,403
And who's going to make
the Christmas pudding?

1334
01:30:21,404 --> 01:30:23,438
It won't be the same
without you.

1335
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:27,643
The pudding! The secret is
to warm the treacle first.

1336
01:30:27,645 --> 01:30:29,811
There, you...
You see, my dear?

1337
01:30:29,814 --> 01:30:32,581
I told you something
would turn up.

1338
01:30:32,582 --> 01:30:35,118
Oh, my son. Oh.

1339
01:30:36,453 --> 01:30:37,788
Gotcha!

1340
01:30:39,323 --> 01:30:41,256
You're that Charles
Dickens, aren't you?

1341
01:30:41,259 --> 01:30:42,457
Uh, guilty.

1342
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:45,159
That last one.
<i>Chuzzlewit.</i>

1343
01:30:45,162 --> 01:30:47,796
Wept like a baby, I did.

1344
01:30:47,797 --> 01:30:50,432
Well, that's... That's very kind.
What's your name, Constable?

1345
01:30:50,435 --> 01:30:52,805
My name?
Copperfield, sir.

1346
01:30:53,837 --> 01:30:55,737
Copperfield.

1347
01:30:55,738 --> 01:30:57,806
Any chance
of a new book soon?

1348
01:30:57,809 --> 01:30:59,676
New book. New book!

1349
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:03,811
Wait. New book.

1350
01:31:03,814 --> 01:31:05,317
Merry Christmas!

1351
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:09,188
I'm his father.

1352
01:31:10,622 --> 01:31:12,354
Santa bells for sale!

1353
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:15,327
Shoe Lane!
As fast as you can go.

1354
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:24,634
- Charles, where have you been?
- It's all right. I've got it!

1355
01:31:24,636 --> 01:31:28,403
Mr. Grub!
Mr. Grub. We're here.

1356
01:31:28,404 --> 01:31:31,810
I have it. I have the ending.
You can finish it now.

1357
01:31:33,444 --> 01:31:35,577
- It's too late.
- What?

1358
01:31:35,578 --> 01:31:38,747
Oh, come on. You've already printed the other
four chapters, and it's just one more.

1359
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:41,185
Get the whole book
finished today.

1360
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:49,490
- I can't guarantee anything.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Grub!

1361
01:31:49,493 --> 01:31:51,295
Thank you.

1362
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:54,233
I didn't say
I could do it.

1363
01:32:08,246 --> 01:32:10,582
Well, I'll see
what I can do.

1364
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:23,628
Oh, come on, man.
Don't prolong the agony.

1365
01:33:13,011 --> 01:33:14,712
It's exactly
as I'd imagined it.

1366
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:23,652
Hello, gents. Extraordinary
weather, isn't it?

1367
01:33:23,654 --> 01:33:25,587
Looks like snow.

1368
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:28,957
- Hello, Thackeray.
- Oh, what's this I have?

1369
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,860
Yes. It's a proof copy
of your new book.

1370
01:33:31,863 --> 01:33:35,497
I'm going to review it
for <i>The Spectator.</i>

1371
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,833
I'm told you wrote it
in only six weeks, Charles.

1372
01:33:38,836 --> 01:33:40,837
What a prodigy you are.

1373
01:33:46,377 --> 01:33:48,643
Did you bring that
all the way from Italy?

1374
01:33:48,645 --> 01:33:49,980
<i>SÃ¬. Venezia.</i>

1375
01:33:51,047 --> 01:33:52,947
And now...

1376
01:33:52,948 --> 01:33:58,086
And now the beautiful mermaid
floats through the sea.

1377
01:33:58,087 --> 01:34:01,859
Wooo!

1378
01:34:11,469 --> 01:34:13,639
Hello, old girl!

1379
01:34:15,372 --> 01:34:17,939
Oh, my goodness.
That is beautiful.

1380
01:34:17,942 --> 01:34:20,576
Isn't it? The Germans
call it a Tannenbaum.

1381
01:34:20,578 --> 01:34:23,445
It's a tree for Christmas.
A Christmas tree, I suppose.

1382
01:34:23,448 --> 01:34:26,081
Now the royal family have got
one, it'll be all the rage.

1383
01:34:28,953 --> 01:34:31,386
- Hello.
- Miss Wigmore!

1384
01:34:31,389 --> 01:34:32,989
Papa had
a change of heart.

1385
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:37,893
So he did. Oh, I'm so pleased!
Congratulations.

1386
01:34:37,895 --> 01:34:40,395
Charles, uh, I think you're
going to want to hear this.

1387
01:34:40,398 --> 01:34:41,896
- It's by Thackeray.
- Not now.

1388
01:34:41,899 --> 01:34:44,036
No, please.
Everyone, gather round.

1389
01:34:53,676 --> 01:34:56,010
"It was a blessed inspiration

1390
01:34:56,011 --> 01:35:00,914
that put such a book into
the head of Charles Dickens.

1391
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:04,386
A happy inspiration
of the heart

1392
01:35:04,389 --> 01:35:07,889
that warms every page.

1393
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:13,728
It is impossible to read without a
glowing bosom and burning cheeks,

1394
01:35:13,729 --> 01:35:18,701
between love and shame
of our kind."

1395
01:35:18,703 --> 01:35:20,462
- Aw.
- Bravo, Charles.

1396
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:25,774
Well, uh...

1397
01:35:25,777 --> 01:35:29,081
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

1398
01:35:31,716 --> 01:35:33,952
And those on the way.

1399
01:35:35,752 --> 01:35:37,552
A toast.

1400
01:35:37,555 --> 01:35:42,524
I wish you all many,
many happy Christmases

1401
01:35:42,527 --> 01:35:47,862
and friendships, and great
accumulation of cheerful recollections

1402
01:35:47,863 --> 01:35:50,498
and heaven at last
for all of us.

1403
01:35:50,501 --> 01:35:54,573
In the season of hope, we will shut
out nothing from our firesides

1404
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,842
and everyone
will be welcome.

1405
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:10,154
Welcome what has been
and what is

1406
01:36:11,756 --> 01:36:13,922
and what we hope may be,

1407
01:36:13,925 --> 01:36:15,923
to this shelter
underneath the holly.

1408
01:36:22,934 --> 01:36:26,234
Merry, merry Christmas
to one and all.

1409
01:36:26,237 --> 01:36:28,738
Merry Christmas!

1410
01:36:57,268 --> 01:36:58,804
Thank you.

1411
01:37:54,246 --> 01:37:59,246
