Easy there, Blitzen.

36
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,835
My old friend, Comet.

37
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,159
It's time.

38
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:07,681
Who's there?

39
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:33,367
<i>Merry Christmas, Bailey Downs!</i>

00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,856

<i>And I'll tell you what, listeners.</i>

43
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,367
"Dangerous Dan"
is gonna tell you a secret.

44
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:50,670
I love Christmas!

45
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,437
There, I said it.

46
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:55,042
And I don't care who knows it
'cause I love tinsel,

47
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:58,975
I love Rudolph, I love cranberries,
I love baby Jesus!

48
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:02,555
Before he went all hippy
with the sandals and long hair.

49
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,781
What?

50
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,348
No, no, no, no, no, Susan,
I'm gonna talk about Jesus on the radio.

51
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,083
And you know why? Because it's his birthday
tomorrow, am I right, folks?

52
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:17,252
Speaking of reminders, it's almost time
for the big charity food drive

53
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:18,920
at the mall this afternoon.

54
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:22,643
Our very own weatherman of action,
Stormin' Norman

55
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:27,437
is gonna be down there helping out
like the true Christmas angel he is.

56
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,836
Norman, is there any truth to the rumor
that a very special guest

57
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,957
is gonna be making an appearance
at the food drive?

58
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,737
Norman?

59
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:48,641
Oh, hey Norman, he's writing me
a little Christmas card.

60
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,797
This is exciting.

61
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,466
What's it gonna say?

62
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:01,742
Norman. Susan, did you see that?
You know who saw that?

63
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,586
Jesus saw that!
And his dad. He saw that.

64
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,687
All right, folks, looks like...

65
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:11,949
Norman's hitting the trail, so...

66
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,625
we'll just get this Christmas party
started without him!

67
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,826
Yes, sir! We're gonna share the spirit.

68
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:21,295
We're gonna deck some halls!

69
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:26,466
I'm gonna get Susan under the mistletoe
and you, my little elves,

70
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:29,033
you're gonna listen to one
of my favorite songs.

71
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:31,500
So here's to the season!

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,832
Here's to you...

73
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:36,742
Bailey Downs.

74
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:46,283
Let's get this Christmas party
started right.

75
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:59,343
- Girlfriend's late.
- Impossible, we use protection.

76
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,858
Made the mistake of watching this
alone last night,

77
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,314
but nobody can know I have this, okay?

78
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,930
<i>December 25th. Time, 13:26 hours.</i>

79
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,766
<i>Constable Scott Peters,
conducting a preliminary walkthrough.</i>

80
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,067
I used to babysit his son, Will.

81
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,355
<i>Handprints on the wall.
Make sure you get that.</i>

82
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,160
<i>A lot of blood in here.</i>

83
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,776
<i>Victim's a male, Caucasian, late teens.</i>

84
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:39,946
- <i>Possibly a student here.</i>
- Oh, boy.

85
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:44,882
<i>Body showing signs of obvious staging
suggesting a ritualistic killing.</i>

86
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,987
<i>Time and cause of death
to be determined by autopsy.</i>

87
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,308
<i>Got some writing on the wall over here.</i>

88
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:56,545
<i>"For unto us a child is born.</i>

89
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:59,492
<i>Unto us a son is given."</i>

90
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,894
Look at that.

91
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:03,427
<i>Possible bible passage?</i>

92
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,517
I don't know.

93
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,019
<i>Me either.</i>

94
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,353
What do you hear?

95
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,194
Scott, what are you hearing?

96
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:23,223
<i>Poor baby... wakes</i>

97
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:26,485
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

98
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:29,233
<i>No crying he makes...</i>

99
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:34,102
- flap!
- <i>Christ!</i>

100
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,485
Okay.

101
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:39,650
Why was that cop singing that song?

102
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,053
No one knows, he went on stress leave
after this and doesn't talk about it.

103
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:49,456
Okay, and you still wanna go down there
just for some stupid school assignment?

104
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:54,538
Man up, Dylan. We obviously
can't use the police video, so...

105
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,515
we have to get our own footage.

106
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,518
Hey, babies.

107
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:10,749
- You're late, bitch.
- Sorry.

108
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:14,496
Dad pulled this family trip
out of his ass like an hour ago.

109
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,601
Merry Christmas. It'll get you through
any door in the school.

110
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:25,482
- I love you so much right now.
- Caprice, I can't believe you actually got them.

111
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:29,307
That's my honey.
Stickiest fingers in Bailey Downs.

112
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,895
Gotta go.

113
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,086
Don't get busted.

114
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,903
Come on, we got a long drive.

115
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:01,958
Christmas Eve and you wanna drive
to see your old aunt,

116
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:05,014
- who as far as I know, doesn't even like you.
- She doesn't like anyone.

117
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,383
Fine, but you're dragging us
along with you.

118
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,306
You know what, and I expect everyone
to be on their best behavior.

119
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:18,090
We're not in Saint Barth's for Christmas,
that's fine, or even Aspen, that's...

120
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,546
Okay, look, I just wanted
to have some bonding time.

121
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:25,777
You hear that, I want this
to be a happy, loving family.

122
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,620
So you want a Christmas miracle.

123
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:40,620
All right, son, let's get that tree.

124
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,629
It's cold out here?

125
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,109
I want the new Morph Machine.

126
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,911
The Morph Machine with the motorcycle
and the guy has a green vest.

127
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,801
Not the blue one, the other guy
with the Morph Machine.

128
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,085
You okay? We can go back if you want.

129
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:08,109
- I'm okay.
- He'll be fine, he'll be fine.

130
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,960
Not here.

131
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,062
What do you mean not here?
Baby, look at those.

132
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,466
Tell me you will find
the perfect Christmas tree.

133
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:26,235
- We can go right through here.
- Great, nice example for a cop, Scott.

134
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,102
We're in the middle of nowhere.
No one's gonna even know we're here.

135
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:31,958
Come on.

136
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,793
Come on!

137
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:37,645
Right behind you, son.

138
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,154
Come on, don't be scared.

139
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:51,687
Quit groping her, let's get on with it.

140
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:55,342
Thanks.

141
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:59,588
Five, four, three...

142
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:05,360
Christmas, usually a time
of joy and celebration,

143
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,495
but for Saint Joseph's Academy,
a time of mourning.

144
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:12,500
Exactly one year ago last Christmas Eve
this school was the scene

145
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,461
of an unimaginable crime
when two of its students,

146
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:21,125
Connor and Jenna, seen here,
were found murdered in cold blood.

147
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:24,309
With the killer still at large,
the atmosphere here in Bailey Downs

148
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,937
is truly grim this holiday season.

149
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:31,580
I'm Molly Simon, and this
is <i>Horror in the Hallways.</i>

150
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,702
- Wait, cut.
- What?

151
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:36,084
Are we really going
with that cheesy title?

152
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:39,325
Your opinion would mean a lot more to me
if you weren't failing Media Arts.

153
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:42,149
Hold on guys, I think I hear something.

154
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:49,759
- I'm fine!
- shooot.

155
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,543
It's Principal Harod.

156
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,528
We just need to be careful.

157
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,621
Yes, I... I know!

158
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,572
Lis... listen to me!

159
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,392
Go, go, go, go!
No, not that one, the other one.

160
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,192
Molly, hurry up.

161
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,716
Wait.

162
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:20,588
Never mind, now I'm getting jumpy.

163
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,081
Principal Harod.

164
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:26,217
What the hell is he doing here
on Christmas Eve?

165
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,972
Keep it down!

166
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,793
- Great.
- I've got flashlights.

167
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:42,317
- Oh, nice.
- Come on, it's this way.

168
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:17,713
She better remember us in the will.
It's about time she invited us here.

169
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:22,196
- She did invite us, right?
- Think of it as a Christmas surprise.

170
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,653
- Taylor!
- 'tis the season. She'll be thrilled.

171
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:42,500
You see, the thing is...

172
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:47,381
To be honest, Aunt Etta,
I know you and mom had difficulties

173
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:52,126
and I just thought we could, you know,
get it out there and deal with it.

174
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:56,187
- Dear, maybe now's not a good time.
- It's Christmas, what could be a better time?

175
00:14:56,488 --> 00:15:00,691
Christmas is all about forgiveness
and family and tradition.

176
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,908
If you just believe, if you let
that spirit in, it just... it fills you.

177
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:07,267
Don't touch that!

178
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:12,120
It's very old.

179
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Is there some place more private
you and I could talk?

180
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:21,960
I wanna show you something
I think you might be interested in.

181
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,495
Come.

182
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:34,966
Four hours in the car and the old bat
doesn't even offer me a drink.

183
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,536
I'll help myself, thank you.

184
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,522
Look at this place,

185
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:43,097
it's like Paul Bunyan and Count Dracula
gayed up and built a dream home.

186
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:47,308
That is not a toy.

187
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:51,379
- Oh, hi there, we're the...
- I know who you are.

188
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,990
Okay.

189
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,058
- This is Krampus, right?
- What's a Krampus?

190
00:15:57,158 --> 00:16:00,878
He's like an anti-Santa Claus,
a demon who punishes the naughty.

191
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:05,118
He whips them, chains them up,
throws them in a sack, stuff like that.

192
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:10,821
When Krampus knocked, the demon
hunts the wicked from sunset to sunrise.

193
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,322
That's fun.

194
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:17,024
He comes for little boys
who touch things they shouldn't.

195
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,813
Oops.

196
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,663
- Duncan!
- That was very unwise.

197
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:28,032
We will pay for it, of course.
Pick it up.

198
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:31,518
- Gerhart, what have you done?
- I did nothing.

199
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:35,793
The boy had... an unfortunate accident.

200
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:41,942
- Take your family and leave now.
- No, let's not be hasty here.

201
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,039
No, my son,
I feel one of my spells coming

202
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:50,365
and I cannot entertain guests. Goodbye.

203
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,959
Bicycle parts to Sector Five!
Organs sets to arrive!

204
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,048
Video games...

205
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:11,147
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

206
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:21,367
Have to take it out again this year.

207
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:26,159
- Talk to the Mrs., Sparkles.
- Santa, I need your signature.

208
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:28,640
Thank you.

209
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,008
So what are we up against
this year, Jingles?

210
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:33,442
Blizzard warning along
the Eastern seaboard.

211
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:36,144
Never met a blizzard that troubled me.

212
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:38,566
- It's bad, it's really bad.
- Another signature here.

213
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,313
- I'm worried about the trade winds.
- Trade winds.

214
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,749
- Safety first, Santa.
- Right here on the left.

215
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:47,838
Lots of kids are depending
on tonight going off without a hitch.

216
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,875
Shiny?

217
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:56,457
- Take a break, everyone!
- Yay, Mrs. Claus!

218
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,023
Even Christmas magic
needs a little fuel.

219
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:00,926
- Oh, cookies!
- Smells good.

220
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:03,316
- Cookies!
- What is this?

221
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:07,050
- Have a cookie, Shiny.
- No, I...

222
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:10,798
I don't know. No thank you.

223
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,230
It'll keep your strength up
for the long shift.

224
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,355
I'm not hungry.

225
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:17,946
Not hungry? They're cookies!

226
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,393
You're being silly, Shiny, you know
how much you love my cookies.

227
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:26,108
I said I don't want a goddamn cookie!

228
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:29,199
You reindeer flaping snow whore!

229
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:32,335
Shiny!

230
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:53,219
He...

231
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,397
He's dead.

232
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:57,633
Dead? But elves...

233
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:02,211
Can't die.
Santa, elves can't die, right?

234
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:07,125
No. They cannot.

235
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,176
Yeah, he's gonna help
his pop put this up too.

236
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:18,145
This tree is way better
than the ones at the mall.

237
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:21,614
- We did it.
- Stop, we can't do this again.

238
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:23,247
Oh, no way.

239
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:27,537
They won't even miss it.
They got enough trees around here.

240
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:37,192
Look at this, babe, this is a perfect tree.
Smells like pine, you love pine.

241
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think
it's gonna fit up the stairs.

242
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:43,101
Of course it will,
it'll be fine, trust me.

243
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:52,057
- Where's Will?
- He was right here with us. Will?

244
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,738
- Will?
- Will!

245
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:57,307
- Baby!
- Come on, we gotta go!

246
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,050
- This ain't time to play hide and seek now!
- Where are you, babe?

247
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:06,916
- We gotta go, come on, son!
- Will!

248
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:16,170
- Come on, boy, stop playing, we gotta go!
- Where are you, baby?

249
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:18,125
Mom?

250
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,257
- Come on, honey, let's go!
- William, where are you?

251
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:23,246
Dad!

252
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,096
- William!
- Where are you?

253
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,751
Will!

254
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,832
Where'd he go?

255
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,020
Couldn't have gone far.

256
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:43,490
- Over here.
- Oh, God.

257
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,858
Will!

258
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:49,311
Baby?

259
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:52,112
This way, through here.

260
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,048
Son!

261
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,766
Will!

262
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,934
Will!

263
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:02,269
Will!

264
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:05,538
William!

265
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,708
Will!

266
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,277
Oh, God. Oh, God.

267
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:18,114
Will!

268
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,233
Will?

269
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,557
Come here, buddy!

270
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,230
Scott!

271
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:45,400
Will. Will!

272
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:49,802
Come on, baby? Will, are you okay?

273
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:54,006
What the hell happened?
Why'd you take off like that? Why?

274
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:58,608
Don't yell at him!
It was your idea to come out here!

275
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:40,727
Oh, boy, real palace of fun down here.

276
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,406
Saint Joseph's used to be
a convent a long time ago,

277
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:46,300
this is part of the original building.

278
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,667
You could be a bride of Christ too, Molly,
you've got the whole virgin thing going on.

279
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:55,436
Actually, this is where they kept
the unmarried girls who got pregnant.

280
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:59,306
It was a big deal back then if they weren't
married, you had to keep them out of sight.

281
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,592
Didn't they shut this place down
before it became a school?

282
00:23:02,692 --> 00:23:06,210
Yeah, yeah, there were a lot of
weird stories going around

283
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:09,592
like this 15 year old girl
claimed she was a virgin,

284
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:13,082
said it was a miracle
like the Virgin Mary, but...

285
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:14,637
no one believed her.

286
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:28,929
So what happened to her?

287
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,304
Don't you know, Ben? It was your mom.

288
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:36,355
No, actually, she died
trying to abort her baby.

289
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,907
Let's go.

290
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,703
This is it.

291
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:20,239
This is where Connor
and Jenna were killed.

292
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:22,429
Are you getting this?

293
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,999
You guys hear that?

294
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,144
What?

295
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:30,468
Stay focused.

296
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,528
- This is where...
- We know. We saw the video.

297
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,246
I wanna make sure
I don't forget anything.

298
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:11,281
- Yeah? Let's see.
- Yeah.

299
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:14,134
Stick to camera work, Dylan.
Words aren't really your thing.

300
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:17,076
I just wanna make sure
there's no more horror in the hallways...

301
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,503
You okay? What's wrong?

302
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:51,688
Nothing.

303
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:03,123
Five minutes.

304
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:06,625
You guys couldn't act like a normal
goddamn family for five minutes.

305
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,192
I think we're pretty normal
compared to those two.

306
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,136
That creep deliberately baited Duncan.

307
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:13,846
Sweetheart, it wasn't your fault.

308
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:17,730
I don't know why your aunt got so mad
over some stupid piece of kitsch.

309
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,332
She wasn't mad. She was scared.

310
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:24,136
I can't believe you dragged us here
on Christmas Eve

311
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:27,603
so that you could hustle your own aunt,
that is a new low, Taylor, even for you.

312
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:28,787
It's not a hustle,

313
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:32,953
the Bioplex is a means of integrating
technology into a sustainable future,

314
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:37,410
where scientific innovation
is a shared experience.

315
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:41,547
Fine, yeah, it's all good when it pays
for the house and the vacations

316
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:46,739
and the school and the orthodontist,
but, otherwise, no, it's a big joke!

317
00:26:57,023 --> 00:26:58,846
Come on!

318
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,115
Come on, come on.

319
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,586
Damn, damn, damn!

320
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,557
Seriously?

321
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:25,047
I'm standing at the very spot
where Connor was found crucified

322
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:28,682
exactly one year ago today
on Christmas Eve.

323
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:32,653
Connor's neck was broken.
And over here...

324
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:38,288
Jenna's mutilated body was found
hanging off some metal piping in the ceiling.

325
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:40,822
Why would somebody go to so much effort?

326
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:45,347
That is just one of the many unanswered
questions in this baffling case.

327
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:49,662
How's it look?

328
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,596
You guys...

329
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:53,885
it's still here.

330
00:27:57,768 --> 00:28:00,569
Unto us a child is born.

331
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,337
Unto us a son is given.

332
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,238
That is flaping creepy.

333
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:11,211
It's from Isaiah, Chapter 9,
Verse 6 about the birth of Jesus.

334
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,278
Okay, this place is creeping me out.

335
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:20,012
I think we've got everything
we need, let's go.

336
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:22,586
Yeah, won't argue with you there.

337
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,854
What the hell?

338
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:44,133
What's wrong?

339
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:46,736
What the flap?
I could've sworn it was this one.

340
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,290
Molly, come on, hurry up.

341
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,259
Move.

342
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,373
I tried them all three times,
none of them fit.

343
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:58,163
Crap.

344
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:03,511
Okay.

345
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,336
Hello?

346
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,770
Principal Harod!

347
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:13,041
Principal Harod? Hello?

348
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,087
Principal Harod!

349
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,023
flap!

350
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,813
Of course now, he isn't around.

351
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:25,662
Can't see anything.

352
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:28,625
I've got full bars and some service,
it should be ringing.

353
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:30,734
Really?

354
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,622
Guys, what if Principal Harod
locked us in?

355
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,801
Why would he do that?

356
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,741
For all we know,
he could be down here with us.

357
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:43,362
I got nothing, too.

358
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:55,416
Come on, baby.

359
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:57,405
Smile.

360
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:01,997
Will... you okay?

361
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:06,657
Sport, don't just sit there. Look like
you've never seen a Christmas tree before.

362
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:09,147
Why don't you help
your old man, all right?

363
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:23,477
I like that one. Okay, I'll do it.

364
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:29,397
Right there.

365
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:41,575
I wasn't around much
last Christmas, I know.

366
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:45,444
This year we're having fun, right?

367
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,227
Slow down, Will.

368
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:27,878
Looks like someone's
worked up an appetite.

369
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,230
That's his second serving.

370
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,288
It must be good.
It's making me hungry, let's eat.

371
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:41,626
You're eating too fast,
you're gonna get a tummy ache.

372
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,508
Hey.

373
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,231
Will, you hear your mother
talking to you?

374
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,369
All right, I think that's enough.

375
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,039
- Damn it! What the flap?
- Scott, no!

376
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,625
I'll handle it.

377
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,005
Yeah, you handle it.
What's wrong with that kid?

378
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,753
Why'd you do that?

379
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,626
Answer me!

380
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:26,294
Go to your room right now!

381
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,523
Christmas, the most
magical time of year,

382
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:48,122
but in Bailey Downs this Christmas...

383
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:50,309
it's different.

384
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:54,628
It's gotta be. It's true,
my friends, and you know it is.

385
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:57,699
So before I put another jingle
in your stocking,

386
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:01,604
I want you to think about
the little ones in your life

387
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:05,858
and give a thought to the little ones
who aren't with us anymore.

388
00:33:07,704 --> 00:33:11,641
Yeah, this next one's for them.
For Jenna.

389
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,698
And Connor.

390
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:20,435
From Saint Joseph's Academy
taken from us last year cruelly.

391
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,048
I know they're listening.

392
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:26,644
Somewhere out there.

393
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,896
Martha, thank God!

394
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:01,710
What's going on?

395
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,835
It's the elves, I fear
they may all become infected.

396
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,902
Infected? What do you mean?

397
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:14,070
- Others are sick?
- It's worse than that.

398
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:18,853
- What happened?
- Shiny's body is gone.

399
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:24,007
He was laid to rest, but now...
it may already be too late.

400
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,190
But this doesn't make any sense.

401
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:31,617
Elves becoming the walking dead?
No, it does not make any sense.

402
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:34,920
Unless he is behind it.

403
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:38,356
Stand back, Martha!

404
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:46,262
You need to hide!

405
00:34:46,673 --> 00:34:50,597
Open up, you fat flaping piece of shooot!

406
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:53,277
Here's Shiny!

407
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:55,503
- Shiny risen from the dead!
- What?

408
00:34:55,603 --> 00:35:00,103
- Quick, go, hide!
- Where's my flaping cookie?

409
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,824
Stay back, Jingles!

410
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:13,914
Yeah. Yeah, I got you, you cocksucker!

411
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,614
Motherfucker, oh, shooot!

412
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,143
- I didn't find any windows without bars.
- Same here.

413
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:39,418
Guys, I can't be here,

414
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:42,514
I'm supposed to be at the mall helping
with the food drive or mom's gonna kill me.

415
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:45,215
We've all got places to be,
it's Christmas Eve, bro.

416
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:47,838
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

417
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:00,617
Oh, God.

418
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,467
A little jumpy, Dylan?

419
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,452
This is a nativity scene.
The school didn't put it up this year.

420
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,353
You can't openly display
a nativity scene anymore.

421
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:32,858
It's the war on Christmas.

422
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,347
Damn it, more bars.

423
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,246
flap, it's freezing down here.

424
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:44,215
I can hear it.

425
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:49,119
Damn thing is on.

426
00:36:58,405 --> 00:37:00,239
It won't...

427
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:01,905
heat up.

428
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:06,539
Look, if we just sit around and wait it out,
I'm sure that somebody is gonna notice.

429
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,309
Only Caprice knows we're down here
and she's out of town.

430
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,711
The school's not gonna reopen
for another week and a half.

431
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:16,382
Look... if there was ever a time
to notice three missing kids,

432
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:19,172
tonight would be it, right?

433
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,907
We always open one gift.

434
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,510
Every Christmas Eve.

435
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,746
We eat pizza with champagne.

436
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,822
Watch The Sound of Music.

437
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:38,483
Before we go to bed...

438
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,253
we each open one gift.

439
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,621
Not this year.

440
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:51,393
Hell of a Christmas?

441
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,309
Hey.

442
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,065
It's not pizza and champagne, but...

443
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:05,778
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks, Dylan.

444
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:08,702
I didn't realize how starving I am.

445
00:38:09,114 --> 00:38:10,603
Yeah.

446
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:13,472
What if he comes back?

447
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,018
Who?

448
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:19,355
The guy who killed Jenna and Connor,
what if he comes back tonight?

449
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:21,722
I mean, we're trapped down here.

450
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:25,884
- And there's a psychopath on the loose.
- Psycho's already here.

451
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:29,463
Principal Harod. I'm sure he locked
the door on us, who else could it be?

452
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:33,961
I get that he's creepy, okay?
But that doesn't mean he's a killer.

453
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,153
Then what's he doing here?
On Christmas Eve?

454
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:42,505
What makes matters worse, I gotta piss.

455
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:56,170
I'm sure Joe won't mind...

456
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,572
if I borrow this.

457
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:14,891
What is this place?

458
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:43,713
Caprice will know something's up
when Dylan doesn't call her tonight.

459
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:51,452
What is that flaping smell?

460
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,701
Do you hear that?

461
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,427
What is it?

462
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:50,235
What is it?

463
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:53,621
I don't know.

464
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:18,958
It stopped.

465
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:29,246
Molly, Molly, come on!

466
00:41:29,346 --> 00:41:30,518
What's going on?

467
00:41:30,617 --> 00:41:33,148
I don't know. I don't know.
She started freaking and twitching!

468
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:35,789
Molly!

469
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,713
Will! Get out!

470
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:34,724
Hey.

471
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,360
Hey.

472
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:41,456
- How's your hand?
- I'll live.

473
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:44,342
Have you noticed Will
hasn't had to use his inhaler?

474
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,764
Really? That's a good thing, right?

475
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,889
Yeah.

476
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:53,202
Something seems wrong.

477
00:42:53,547 --> 00:42:58,217
- Maybe we should take him to the doctor?
- The doctor? On Christmas Eve?

478
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,306
Maybe we should just keep an eye on him.

479
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:02,675
Come here.

480
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:07,702
You know...

481
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:10,461
they say you're allowed to open
one gift before Christmas.

482
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:18,722
Scott...

483
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,503
Not right now.

484
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:27,460
All right, I just figured,
you know, it's...

485
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,139
- it's been awhile.
- What's going on?

486
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:32,309
What's going on with me?
What are you saying?

487
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,844
I mean with Will.
The way he's been acting.

488
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:37,878
Yeah, sure, whatever.
You know what, forget it.

489
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:39,900
No, wait.

490
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:57,998
<i>Yes!</i>

491
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:00,329
<i>"Dangerous" Dan!</i>

492
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,355
<i>Let's listen to this Christmas classic.</i>

493
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,215
We should have stayed on the road.

494
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:16,684
Didn't exactly wear my "trudging
through the woods" boots.

495
00:46:16,784 --> 00:46:19,586
Look, this will help us shave
a half hour off our walk back to Etta's,

496
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:22,289
plus I gave you all the option
of staying in the car.

497
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:26,324
Yeah, where mom and I would be easy prey
for drunk hillbilly rapists, no thanks, Dad.

498
00:46:26,423 --> 00:46:28,927
- We should make weapons.
- What?

499
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:32,594
In case whatever dad nearly hit
comes and hunts us. The sun has set,

500
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:36,431
it is officially Krampusnacht,
the night of Krampus.

501
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,389
Son, that Krampus
is a load of old German bull...

502
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:42,875
Dad!

503
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,710
Oh, my God, what happened?

504
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:48,096
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!

505
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,831
- Am I shot?
- I don't know!

506
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,668
Oh, my God. Duncan, get back here!

507
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:07,141
Duncan!

508
00:47:15,193 --> 00:47:16,583
I got it!

509
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,793
- Oh, my God! Duncan!
- Oh, my God, Duncan!

510
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:24,940
Duncan!

511
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:28,809
- Duncan!
- Duncan!

512
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,505
Duncan, where are you?

513
00:47:33,606 --> 00:47:36,023
- Duncan!
- Answer me!

514
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:38,864
Duncan?

515
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:44,268
Duncan?

516
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:53,108
Duncan?

517
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:07,876
- Oh, my God!
- Where is he?

518
00:48:07,976 --> 00:48:10,266
I don't know. I don't know.

519
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:13,490
- We need the police.
- Mom, there's no service out here.

520
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:18,304
- What is that?
- Come on.

521
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,175
Run!

522
00:48:22,072 --> 00:48:24,128
We have to run.

523
00:48:25,342 --> 00:48:27,032
Duncan?

524
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,289
Sparkles!

525
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:57,057
Sparkles!

526
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,304
I'm gonna eat your flaping brains out,
you Christmas cunt.

527
00:49:35,403 --> 00:49:37,659
flap you!

528
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:42,762
I'll break that flaping staff
in your rosy-cheeked ass, you fucker!

529
00:49:44,974 --> 00:49:47,465
I'm sorry, Shiny.

530
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:50,346
I know it isn't your fault.

531
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,369
You don't have
the Christmas balls, you...

532
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:02,688
Bailey Downs, it's getting close there
and we're counting down to Christmas

533
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:06,550
and "Dangerous" Dan
is pulling his annual double shift

534
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,126
to stay with you until the end.

535
00:50:09,226 --> 00:50:10,949
What?

536
00:50:11,661 --> 00:50:14,862
What, we're... Okay,
well we're gonna check in

537
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:18,530
with good ol' Stormin' Norman
down at the charity food drive.

538
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,755
Hey, Norman! Normey, you're a little...

539
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,416
little scratchy there, buddy.

540
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:29,025
What, I did press the button, Susan.
Why don't you press your own button?

541
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:37,177
Sorry, folks, looks like we got some of
those winter weather technical difficulties,

542
00:50:37,277 --> 00:50:40,315
too many reindeer in the atmosphere.

543
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:46,737
That's my bet, so let's...
throw another eggnog on the fire.

544
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:51,994
No, wait a minute, let's...
let's throw another log on the fire

545
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:53,922
and pour yourself another eggnog.

546
00:50:54,322 --> 00:50:57,690
You know, get some good Christmas vibes.

547
00:50:57,791 --> 00:51:02,394
Out to Susan who is seriously
harshing my buzz right now.

548
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:08,288
<i>And listen to this holly jolly classic.</i>

549
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,903
Little shooot.

550
00:51:27,248 --> 00:51:28,949
Will.

551
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,873
Will!

552
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,251
Will, where are you?

553
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:36,175
- What is it?
- Where is he?

554
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,253
Where is he? Will?

555
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:42,376
- There you are.
- Baby, don't... don't!

556
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:46,123
Did you open those presents? Did you?

557
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:48,447
- Say something!
- Scott!

558
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:53,094
- You think this is a game?
- What are you doing?

559
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,650
Say something. Look at him,
think it's all one big flaping joke!

560
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:58,224
- Scott!
- You think this is funny?

561
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,333
- No!
- Move!

562
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:03,572
No! No! No! Don't! Stop!

563
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:05,170
I knew this would happen!

564
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:07,771
You refused to see a doctor,
you said you could handle it!

565
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:10,190
I... did you not see what he did?

566
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:11,945
Get out!

567
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:38,818
Will, you all right?

568
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:53,340
- Hello?
- <i>Is this the Peters household?</i>

569
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,108
Yes.

570
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,577
<i>Got yourself a nice
Christmas tree, did you?</i>

571
00:52:58,677 --> 00:52:59,746
Who is this?

572
00:52:59,947 --> 00:53:03,081
You don't know me, just consider me
a concerned neighbor.

573
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:06,418
<i>You were on my land,
took one of my trees,</i>

574
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:09,041
<i>and I saw your license plate.</i>

575
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,621
What do you want?

576
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:15,445
Your boy, how is he? Did something
happen to him in the grove?

577
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,635
- Look, I don't know...
- <i>I said...</i>

578
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:25,052
<i>did something happen to your boy.</i>

579
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,353
He got lost, but we found him later.

580
00:53:29,365 --> 00:53:32,532
No, you didn't. He's still lost.

581
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:36,085
<i>Now we haven't got much time,
so you're gonna have to do as I say.</i>

582
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:40,326
Bring the changeling back to the forest
where you lost your son.

583
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:44,677
Changeling? What the hell is that?

584
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:48,507
Ma'am... that ain't your son.

585
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,871
- Don't call again.
- <i>Wait, wait!</i>

586
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,976
Molly?

587
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:48,326
We... were worried about you.

588
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:52,094
- What is it? You okay?
- Just come.

589
00:54:52,195 --> 00:54:54,550
I have to show you something.

590
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,356
Should I wake Ben?

591
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,661
Where are you going?

592
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,648
Molly?

593
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:14,166
Okay.

594
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:37,778
You kidding me?

595
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,096
Molly.

596
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:51,534
Wait.

597
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:55,137
You're serious?

598
00:55:58,644 --> 00:56:00,474
Okay.

599
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:04,378
Molly. Molly, Molly, Molly.

600
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:09,380
Hey, this isn't gonna happen, Molly,
I have a girlfriend.

601
00:56:11,777 --> 00:56:14,509
I think you're in shock or something.

602
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:23,081
Will?

603
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:30,121
Will?

604
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:36,427
Will, is that you?

605
00:57:58,326 --> 00:58:00,550
I shouldn't have lost my head
like that, I'm sorry.

606
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:08,393
Dad's just...

607
00:58:08,494 --> 00:58:10,998
been a little stressed lately.

608
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:17,561
But I'm trying. I'm trying to be better.

609
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:02,235
Scott?

610
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,043
Hurry!

611
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,269
Hurry!

612
01:00:02,996 --> 01:00:05,302
Get in. In, in.

613
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:18,889
Pull him here, get him here. Okay.

614
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:20,659
Okay.

615
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,652
Do you think that you could walk?

616
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,753
We have to find Duncan.

617
01:00:32,853 --> 01:00:35,489
- Yeah, I can go, I can go.
- Dad, no, you can't.

618
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:38,257
Mom, we have to stay here,
something's still out there.

619
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:40,914
He is out there by himself.

620
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:44,315
Mom, what if it really is Krampus?

621
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,862
We have to stay in this church
until sunrise.

622
01:00:46,963 --> 01:00:49,266
- That is insane, let's go.
- Yeah, it is.

623
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:53,389
Church, church,
we have to confess our sins.

624
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:57,853
I'm not gonna make it to sunrise,
I've lost too much blood.

625
01:00:57,952 --> 01:01:01,389
We have to get past that thing.
They say it comes for the wicked.

626
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:06,190
Maybe if we confess in a church,
we can absolve ourselves of our sins.

627
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,442
That is ridiculous.

628
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,675
I stole this.

629
01:01:10,777 --> 01:01:12,567
You what?

630
01:01:13,144 --> 01:01:15,168
From Aunt Etta's.

631
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,615
I don't know why,
I can't really help myself.

632
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:23,405
But honest, I'm not as bad as those
other kids with the sex and the drugs

633
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:25,775
and the cutting and...

634
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:29,527
Mom, I don't do that. I...

635
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:33,780
I just steal stuff. Stupid stuff.

636
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:36,228
I'm sorry.

637
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:39,983
Even if this is that Krampus thing,
none of this is gonna help, okay?

638
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:43,701
That monster took Duncan
and Duncan was innocent.

639
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,090
No, he wasn't.

640
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:49,786
I mean, what do you think
happened to all our pets?

641
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,306
I'm going out there myself.

642
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:56,599
Mom, the day our cat disappeared I found
Duncan in the garage with a garbage bag.

643
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:01,536
He had blood all over his hands.

644
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:06,572
- He was smiling.
- No! No!

645
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:12,454
This is your fault! If you had just spent
more time with him, but all you care about

646
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:15,925
- is your stupid precious business...
- There is no business.

647
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:19,726
- What?
- Bioplex has been dead for years.

648
01:02:19,826 --> 01:02:22,949
I just raise money to pay debts
to keep things going.

649
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:27,083
It's all gonna come crashing down.

650
01:02:27,731 --> 01:02:31,833
Etta was my last hope
and she thinks I'm a swindler.

651
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:34,324
She's probably right.

652
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:38,994
I'm so sorry.
We're gonna lose everything.

653
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,079
And I'm going to jail.

654
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:47,932
- Why would you...
- It was the only way I could keep you.

655
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:51,001
I mean, come on.

656
01:02:51,414 --> 01:02:53,748
A guy like me with a woman like you?

657
01:02:54,148 --> 01:02:56,150
I wanted to give you nice things.

658
01:02:56,449 --> 01:03:02,235
A nice home, make you happy,
give you the life you deserve.

659
01:03:02,788 --> 01:03:06,045
I just thought that you weren't
interested anymore.

660
01:03:06,322 --> 01:03:08,346
Oh, no.

661
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:11,181
I did it all for you.

662
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:21,333
Merry Christmas.

663
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:22,789
I'm sorry.

664
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,027
Taylor!

665
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:32,762
- Taylor! Taylor!
- Dad!

666
01:03:37,811 --> 01:03:41,001
Go. Get in, get in!

667
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:23,304
It's okay, it's okay.

668
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:29,851
It's okay, it's okay.

669
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:33,777
Mom...

670
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:38,847
There's some...
there's something on my leg.

671
01:04:38,947 --> 01:04:43,184
- What?
- There's something on my leg.

672
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:09,731
I love you. I love you. Run, go, run!

673
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:15,842
Right here, you son of a bitch!

674
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:19,144
Mom!

675
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,791
What are you doing?

676
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,759
Can you move the light?

677
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:02,349
What happened? We...
We couldn't wake you up.

678
01:06:18,677 --> 01:06:21,034
Aren't you cold like that?

679
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:26,036
Where's Dylan?

680
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,733
In the room.

681
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:31,873
That room?

682
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:36,021
What's he doing there?

683
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:38,945
He wanted me to join him, but...

684
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:42,771
I wanted to stay here with you.

685
01:06:45,393 --> 01:06:46,916
Right.

686
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,375
Molly...

687
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:17,978
- Are you sure?
- This is what you want, isn't it?

688
01:08:32,993 --> 01:08:34,716
Ben...

689
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:41,346
What the flap? What the flap?
What the flap did you do to me?

690
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:43,900
What did I do to you?

691
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:45,757
flap.

692
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:48,926
Who's there?

693
01:08:51,872 --> 01:08:54,141
Dylan, is that you?

694
01:08:54,242 --> 01:08:55,898
Dylan?

695
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,703
Dylan?

696
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:08,274
Ben, no.

697
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:14,028
Don't.

698
01:09:21,362 --> 01:09:24,096
<i>I guess you're ready to listen now.</i>

699
01:09:24,197 --> 01:09:26,030
What do I do?

700
01:09:26,131 --> 01:09:27,618
<i>Listen good.</i>

701
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:31,158
<i>You gotta bring the creature
back to the grove.</i>

702
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:35,273
<i>But you gotta be careful,
it won't come willingly.</i>

703
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,534
<i>It's tasted human pleasures.</i>

704
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:41,211
What about Will?

705
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,279
<i>The only way is to bring
the changeling back,</i>

706
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,470
<i>but don't let it sense your intention,
it senses things.</i>

707
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:51,550
<i>It cannot feel threatened.</i>

708
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:53,751
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

709
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,685
Hello?

710
01:09:55,784 --> 01:09:57,541
Hello?

711
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,356
Will.

712
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:54,650
Do you wanna go for a ride?

713
01:11:10,252 --> 01:11:11,875
Hey, Will.

714
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:19,814
You wanna put your boots on?

715
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,560
Come on, baby.

716
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:26,618
You and mommy can go
have some fun outside.

717
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:29,284
Yeah.

718
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,577
Come on, buddy.

719
01:14:01,064 --> 01:14:03,541
Come on, you little devils!

720
01:14:19,849 --> 01:14:22,435
Come on, you jolly fu...

721
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,548
I got ya! Come here, Santa,
you fat bastard!

722
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:46,792
You again!

723
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:23,137
It's complete and utter chaos
down at the mall,

724
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:26,735
police and emergency cruiser
on the scene. We don't really know...

725
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:30,739
what's going on, still no word
from Stormin' Norman.

726
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,042
But I'm sure a crusty ol' bird
like Norman will be fine.

727
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:40,011
We give Norman a hard time around here,
but he's the weatherman, so...

728
01:15:40,112 --> 01:15:44,081
I think he has a Master's Degree from
Colombia or something depressing like that.

729
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,248
But we love him...

730
01:15:47,349 --> 01:15:49,650
so check in as soon as you can, Normey.

731
01:15:49,751 --> 01:15:53,154
In the meantime, it's my job
to keep the Christmas spirit alive

732
01:15:53,253 --> 01:15:56,520
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Let's give this...

733
01:15:56,621 --> 01:16:00,648
next yuletide tune a spin.

734
01:16:02,194 --> 01:16:04,516
Oh, man.

735
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:26,367
Hello?

736
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:38,181
Don't point that thing at me, honey.

737
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:41,512
Put it down, it's okay.

738
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,954
- I brought it.
- Thanks.

739
01:16:45,055 --> 01:16:47,481
What's the matter with you?

740
01:16:48,627 --> 01:16:50,395
There's so many of them.

741
01:16:50,494 --> 01:16:54,197
It's all right, they're not gonna touch you
as long as I'm here. They're afraid of me.

742
01:16:54,296 --> 01:16:56,632
I know how to herd them, herd them good.

743
01:16:56,733 --> 01:16:59,667
The trolls have been
on our land for generations.

744
01:16:59,766 --> 01:17:02,101
I guess you could say I watch over them.

745
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:05,872
Thanks for bringing this one back, it would've
sensed me coming from a mile away.

746
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:08,609
I brought it like you said.

747
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,962
Now where's my son?

748
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:13,841
I don't know.

749
01:17:13,942 --> 01:17:15,176
What'd you do?

750
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:18,706
You keep running off and now look what
you've done. Now look what you've done!

751
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,284
- What are you doing, where's my son?
- The little devils never listen.

752
01:17:21,385 --> 01:17:24,153
They never listen no matter
how many times I tell them.

753
01:17:33,255 --> 01:17:34,911
What?

754
01:17:37,425 --> 01:17:39,958
Where is he? I want my son back!

755
01:17:40,059 --> 01:17:42,694
I wish I could help, but I can't,
it's not up to me.

756
01:17:42,795 --> 01:17:45,851
You lied to me! It killed my husband!

757
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:49,055
Don't hurt it! Put the gun...

758
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,557
No!

759
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:10,337
My baby boy, please.

760
01:18:16,755 --> 01:18:18,411
My son.

761
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:24,716
Oh, Will...

762
01:18:47,747 --> 01:18:49,537
Mommy?

763
01:18:51,117 --> 01:18:52,939
Come here!

764
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:55,074
Is that really you?

765
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:59,211
Oh, look at you, oh, God, oh, baby.

766
01:18:59,407 --> 01:19:00,989
Oh, baby.

767
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,912
- I got lost.
- Oh, it's okay, baby.

768
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:08,761
It's okay, it's okay, baby.
It's okay, sweetheart.

769
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:11,082
It's okay, baby.

770
01:19:12,462 --> 01:19:14,484
Let's go home.

771
01:19:28,108 --> 01:19:29,764
Dylan?

772
01:19:55,162 --> 01:19:56,953
Molly!

773
01:19:57,998 --> 01:19:59,025
Oh, God.

774
01:19:59,126 --> 01:20:01,507
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

775
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:04,056
Dylan.

776
01:20:08,038 --> 01:20:09,494
No.

777
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:14,966
Dylan.

778
01:20:41,335 --> 01:20:43,324
Oh, God.

779
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:52,948
Grace wants me to carry her son.

780
01:20:55,512 --> 01:20:57,014
Who?

781
01:20:57,213 --> 01:21:02,359
That 15 year old girl who tried
to get rid of her baby, this is her room.

782
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:07,117
Molly, where are you getting this from?

783
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:13,012
Connor and Jenna wouldn't help her,
but you and I did.

784
01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:17,751
I'm going to have her child.

785
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:21,219
You brought us down here!

786
01:21:22,398 --> 01:21:24,887
You fucked me.

787
01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:29,024
And you killed Dylan!

788
01:21:54,104 --> 01:21:56,065
Molly! Molly!

789
01:21:57,757 --> 01:22:00,149
Help me, Molly!

790
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:45,342
Aunt Etta!

791
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:52,127
Etta!

792
01:23:52,226 --> 01:23:54,581
Etta, let me in!

793
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:01,221
Aunt Etta!

794
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:11,931
Etta!

795
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:15,720
Don't leave me out here!

796
01:24:24,421 --> 01:24:26,345
Etta!

797
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:29,630
Etta, help me!

798
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,051
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

799
01:25:37,185 --> 01:25:39,587
It is almost dawn.

800
01:25:39,686 --> 01:25:41,577
We will be safe.

801
01:25:42,188 --> 01:25:45,422
Shouldn't we try and fix this
to trap him again?

802
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:47,157
Whatever do you mean?

803
01:25:47,256 --> 01:25:51,716
Wasn't that how he got out?
When Duncan broke it?

804
01:25:51,817 --> 01:25:56,029
Oh, no, dear, this is just an ornament.

805
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:58,497
Then how did Gerhart turn into it?

806
01:25:58,797 --> 01:26:01,733
Krampus is a Christmas spirit.

807
01:26:01,832 --> 01:26:04,489
And like your father said...

808
01:26:04,902 --> 01:26:08,193
The Christmas spirit can fill anyone.

809
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:14,319
But if your heart is blackened
with anger and vindictiveness,

810
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:19,412
then this spirit will fill it
until you become a hellish beast.

811
01:26:19,613 --> 01:26:22,404
A hunter of the wicked.

812
01:26:22,716 --> 01:26:25,712
Gerhart's anger let it in and...

813
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:27,273
He came after us.

814
01:26:30,387 --> 01:26:34,292
So you kicked Gerhart out
after you kicked us out.

815
01:26:35,341 --> 01:26:38,949
Then you put the cross on the door
to protect yourself from Krampus, right?

816
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:41,962
Yes.

817
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:44,896
- That's why you sent us away.
- What?

818
01:26:44,997 --> 01:26:48,899
You knew my fucked up family would be shark
bait for that thing, so you got rid of us.

819
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,400
- Wait, it isn't like that at all...
- Sure it is!

820
01:26:51,701 --> 01:26:55,853
You thought Gerhart was gonna turn so you
sent us away knowing that he'd come after us.

821
01:26:55,953 --> 01:26:59,340
You sacrificed us for Krampus
to save your selfish old ass!

822
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:02,109
Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.

823
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:06,011
You don't know the forces
that you are playing with.

824
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,132
Yes, I do.

825
01:27:10,962 --> 01:27:13,086
And I know something else.

826
01:27:15,181 --> 01:27:16,750
You've been a bad girl.

827
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,859
Mother of God!

828
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:35,963
Police are telling...
people just to stay away.

829
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:39,824
All right, just keep clear of the mall.

830
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,801
I know a lot of you are worried
about your friends and family, well...

831
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:48,391
the best thing you can do is just...

832
01:27:48,492 --> 01:27:50,475
stay put.

833
01:27:50,806 --> 01:27:53,373
And pray for a Christmas miracle.

834
01:27:56,877 --> 01:28:01,564
Still no word on how many hostages
there may be down there, but...

835
01:28:01,814 --> 01:28:05,605
But just... just stay at home.

836
01:28:06,484 --> 01:28:08,774
For the love of God.

837
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,850
Is that you, dear?

838
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:27,715
Who's there?

839
01:29:31,395 --> 01:29:34,520
Martha... is that you?

840
01:29:40,537 --> 01:29:42,827
Leave me alone.

841
01:29:43,405 --> 01:29:45,640
It's safe now.

842
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:47,296
It's over.

843
01:29:48,076 --> 01:29:50,164
It's not over!

844
01:30:03,488 --> 01:30:05,717
Oh, my darling.

845
01:30:52,163 --> 01:30:54,386
Who's there?

846
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:22,621
I knew it. Krampus!

847
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,677
Vile enemy of Christmas.

848
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:39,421
We end this tonight.

849
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,957
Norman, stop!

850
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:26,006
Please don't kill me, Norman.

851
01:32:26,106 --> 01:32:27,873
Norman?

852
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:29,942
Who's Norman?

853
01:32:30,042 --> 01:32:32,332
What the flap is wrong with you, Norman?

854
01:33:08,778 --> 01:33:11,667
<i>Martha, is that you?</i>

855
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:16,204
- <i>Leave me alone.</i>
- <i>It's only me.</i>

856
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,595
flap, flap, flap, flap!

857
01:33:32,695 --> 01:33:34,452
flap!

858
01:34:03,622 --> 01:34:04,890
It's time.

859
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:08,280
Freeze! Put your hands up now!

860
01:34:44,926 --> 01:34:47,996
<i>What the hell is it about Christmas
in Bailey Downs?</i>

861
01:34:48,095 --> 01:34:50,162
<i>Are we cursed or something?</i>

862
01:34:50,262 --> 01:34:54,716
<i>Why does this season of love
and peace and goodwill</i>

863
01:34:54,817 --> 01:34:58,403
<i>keep ending in blood
and death and horror?</i>

864
01:34:58,502 --> 01:35:01,038
<i>You keep the spirit in your hearts,
you hear me, people.</i>

865
01:35:01,139 --> 01:35:03,087
<i>You hug your loved ones
and you keep them close</i>

866
01:35:03,188 --> 01:35:06,530
<i>and you treat them every Christmas
like it might be your last.</i>

867
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:18,050
<i>Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

Laughing all the way</i>

Making spirits bright</i>

01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:30,130
<i>What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight</i>

871
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:34,210
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

872
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:38,170
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

875
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:45,237
<i>Hey, look, if they just had more
police training, then stuff like this...</i>

876
01:35:45,337 --> 01:35:50,474
You think more police can do anything?
Are you... it's Christmas!

877
01:35:50,573 --> 01:35:54,944
There are magical dark forces
out there. People, wake up!

878
01:35:55,045 --> 01:36:01,082
It's a beautiful season, it's light
and it's dark and it's ying and it's yang.

879
01:36:01,182 --> 01:36:03,951
For our Asian friends out there,
you know who you are.

880
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:07,319
I said Asian, right?
I didn't say Oriental, right?

881
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,587
Well, I don't know!

882
01:36:09,688 --> 01:36:12,969
You tell me which is offensive.
I'm a Christmas expert.

01:36:13,069 --> 01:36:17,726
It's 11 Lords a-leapin' and ten mai...
ten maids a-milkin'.

No, no, no, don't go to the...
Don't you Google that!

885
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,729
I hate it!

886
01:36:22,829 --> 01:36:24,721
We as a society...

887
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:27,729
can't go five minutes without...

888
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,769
looking... looking up a...

889
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:32,692
No, wait a minute,
somebody's texting me.

890
01:36:34,305 --> 01:36:38,029
It's 11 pipers piping,
I'm way off, I'm sorry.

891
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:41,890
