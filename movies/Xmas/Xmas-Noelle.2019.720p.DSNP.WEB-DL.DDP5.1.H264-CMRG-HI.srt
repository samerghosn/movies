00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,972
You need to do your job and give
your brother some Christmas spirit,

175
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,764
or else we're not gonna be ready
for Christmas.

176
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,519
NOELLE: Oh, this is heavy.

177
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,687
The Book of Santa.
I've read it. I've memorized it.

178
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,235
I've listened to it on tape.
I just don't get it.

179
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,990
Okay. Well, we are gonna read it together
and we're gonna figure this out.

180
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,743
Let's start at the top.

181
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,995
(CHUCKLES) The top is chimney access,
that's funny.

182
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,168
"The chimney will expand when you tap
three times with the magical candy cane

183
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,669
"and sing the first line
of We Wish You A Merry Christmas,

184
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,341
"assuming that you stay in key."

185
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,801
- NICK: Hold your reindeer.
- Yeah.

186
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,640
How am I supposed to know which is
the right present to give each child?

187
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,009
If I haven't determined
who's naughty or nice,

188
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,635
how can I pick their present?

189
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,432
You see, it's kind of a vicious circle.

190
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:07,903
Okay.

191
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,518
This is the list. It's filled with names.
Some are nice and some are naughty.

192
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,527
Some of the names
haven't been filled in yet,

193
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,489
and that's gonna be your job, okay?

194
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,109
Dad said, "It's not about
what the kid looks like.

195
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,986
"It's what's on the inside
that's important.

196
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,832
"You need to connect with their heart."

197
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,328
Oh, I love that. (CHUCKLES)
How's that done?

198
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,831
I have no idea.
Just focus really hard, I guess?

199
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,784
Okay.

200
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,284
Uh... Nice.

201
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,378
She cheated on every math test
she ever took.

202
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,177
That's a... stocking full of coal
if ever I've seen one. (LAUGHS)

203
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,139
Yeah. He saved a kitten from a tree,

204
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,850
after visiting his grandmother
in the nursing home.

205
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,231
So, nice?

206
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,097
Okay, we need to figure out what people
want for Christmas. Here we go.

207
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,234
- Football tickets.
- iPad.

208
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,899
Really think about this next one.
Take your time.

209
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,570
NICK: She looks like
she likes playing guitar,

210
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,196
and that looks like, uh, an old guitar.

211
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,793
So, I'm gonna say, um...

212
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,373
- New guitar?
- iPad.

213
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,956
(GROANS)

214
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,211
You can do this.

215
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,003
- iPad?
- Polly!

216
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,456
- Okay, let's say I'm in Germany.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,548
A child wakes up, wants to talk to me,
I don't speak their language.

218
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,604
Yeah, but, um,
Santa understands all languages.

219
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,769
And so do you.
I saw you speaking Arabic to Elf Tippy.

220
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,889
Yeah, but that's because Gabe showed me

221
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,436
how to use this thing
called Google Translate.

222
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,355
NOELLE: Okay, Nick, I know
you're scared of the reindeer,

223
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,822
but you need to Santa up.
You've gotta show them who's boss.

You're almost in.
Look how good you're doing!

229
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,712
I don't wanna do this. No!

230
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,713
- This is great! Let it happen!
- No!

236
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:18,144
- Two double hot chocolates.
- Great.

237

One with extra whipped cream.

238
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,409
And... peppermint.

239

Thank garland for hot chocolate
and peppermint.

240
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,746
NOELLE: Mmm.

241
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,671
I feel like I've been shivering
my whole life, you know?

242
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,125
Sometimes, I... I dream about getting out
and finding someplace warm,

243
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,474
where I can stretch and relax
and just breathe, you know?

244
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,259
- Then you should.
- How?

245
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,433
I'm Santa. I don't get a vacation.
I don't even get Christmas off.

246
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,014
You can't be Santa
if you're having a nervous breakdown.

247
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,940
Nobody wants you sliding into
their fireplace crying and weeping.

248
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,190
Nothing merry about that.

249
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,400
Can't go down chimneys.
I'm claustrophobic.

250
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,530
You remember those magazines
Dad used to bring me on Christmas?

251
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,399
Yeah, like People? That's how I found out
Jennifer Aniston's nice.

252
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,658
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Travel And Leisure had those sections

253
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,370
about the perfect Christmas getaway.

254
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,000
Warm weather, swimming pools,
sun-kissed mountains.

255
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,041
You need to look in that magazine,
pick a place, get away for the weekend.

256

while you're down there.

Ah! Cousin Gabe.

259
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:32,849
Hello.

260
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,523
I wanted to install GPS
and USB-C portals on the sleigh,

261
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,613
and was wondering if you knew
where Cousin... Santa, you know, was.

262
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:44,360
I think he probably took the sleigh
for a practice flight.

263
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,202
Well, the sleigh came back,
and all the reindeer are here,

264
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,080
but there's no Santa.

265
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,211
Well, it's not like him to just leave.

266
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,500
What's with all these magazines?

267
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:03,264
"InStyle, Travel and Leisure,
Martha Stewart's Living."

268
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,142
Um, I was helping Santa train,

269
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,427
and he seemed a little overwhelmed.
So I mentioned, almost as a joke...

270
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,102
(CHUCKLES) Ho, ho, ho.

271
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,601
That he should go somewhere
and relax for the weekend.

272
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,014
And maybe bring back some new magazines.
That's probably what that's about.

273
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,934
But they're for all of us to enjoy.

274
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,729

Wait. What about a rescue mission?

00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,836
My brother could be hurt.
He might've fallen out of the sleigh.

And we have no idea where Santa is.

301

00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,423
You get "stocking half empty"
pretty quick.

511
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,010
- Do you have a picture of this brother?
- Yes. His name is Nick Kringle.

512
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,798
- Nick Kringle?
- Mmm-hmm.

513
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,506
- You're Noelle Kringle?
- That's me.

514
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,972
- You're pretty deep into Christmas.
- Best day of the year, right?

515
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,714
Yeah, well, it's definitely
a day of the year.

516
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,936
I'm on the way out, but I'll see
what I can do for $150 a day.

517
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,813
Money, yes. You cannot put a price
on what this is worth to me.

518
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,355
- Up front.
- (MOUTHS) Okay.

519
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:48,122
"In Santa We Trust"?

520
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,829
That's real gold on the outside.
And chocolate in the middle.

521
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:55,332
Look, lady, um, with all due respect...

522
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,125
Get some sunblock fast.

523
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:02,972
NOELLE: Uh...

524
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,178
- Jake, you don't understand, see...
- My phone died. Can I borrow yours?

525
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,640
I don't have a phone.

526
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,509
Oh, of course, probably hard to dial
with mittens on.

527
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,426
Only get two days with him before
Christmas, and now I'm late.

528
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:14,936
- With who?
- My son, my boy,

529
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,897
I'm supposed to take him
to a basketball game

530
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,769
and now my ex-wife's...

531
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,435
Let's find you a phone.
I'm sure somebody will let us...

532
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:23,934
No, people don't just let people
borrow phones.

533
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,817
- It doesn't work that way.
- It's Christmas.

534
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,413
Oh, I forgot it's Christmas.

535
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,659
Okay, excuse me, ma'am,
may I please borrow your phone?

536
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,041
Like I want your germs.

537
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,413
- Okay.
- See what I mean?

538
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,915
Excuse me, sir,
may I please borrow your...

539
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:37,999
Um...

540
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,626
See what I mean? Kringle?

541
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,336
Kringle?

542
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,258
Kringle?

543
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,555
Ask him.

544
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:55,311
- Who?
- That man, he's nice.

545
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,852
- He's nice?
- Yeah.

546
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:57,934
How do you know?

547
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,557
I don't know, I just know.

548
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Excuse me.

549
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,236
- Sir, hi.
- MAN: Hi.

550
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,740
My friend has an important call
to make, his phone died.

551
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,622
Is there any way he could borrow yours?

552
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,869
Sure, no problem.

553
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:14,999
Oh.

554
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,661
- Oh, thanks.
- It's okay.

555
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,327
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

556
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,454
Noelle Kringle. I hope you get
what you want for Christmas.

557
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,375
- Matt Bautista. I'm actually a Buddhist.
- Oh, jolly!

558
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,546
My dad always said,
"Christmas is like sushi,

559
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,884
"the Japanese invented it,
but now everybody loves it."

560
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,060
Well, I do love sushi.

561
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,386
Thank you, I really appreciate that.

562
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:39,685
My pleasure. You guys have a great day.

563
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,099
- Bye, Matt.
- MATT: Bye.

564
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,227
Thank you, Kringle. Uh, I gotta run.

565
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,202
Give me that picture of your brother.

566
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:58,035
Come by the office tomorrow at 9:00.
Bring non-edible money.

567
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,290
Do they make that?
I'm kidding. I know they do.

568
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,794
And I'll find some. I will bring some.

569
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,296
Thank you for helping me,
you're being so nice.

570
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,381
It's a big day for nice.

571
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,722
Yeah. Big day for nice.

572
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
GABE OVER SPEAKERS: Merry Christmas,
Elf-folk, it's Santa. Santa Gabe.

573
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,268
As you may know, my cousin Nick,
the ex-Santa,

574
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:24,733
never completed the Nice or Naughty list,
but that's jolly.

575
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:26,855
Because it allowed us to develop...

576
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,282
FALALA.

577
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,610
Forensic Algorithm for Lateral Analysis
of Latent Altruism.

578
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,117
It's a digitized metric

579
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,369
which allows us to determine
a child's Nice or Naughty quotient.

580
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,581
For instance...

581
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,211
MRS. CLAUS: Holy night.

582
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,458
This is Kali from Brooklyn.

583
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,541
Using his internet activity,
school records,

584
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,085
and satellite surveillance,

585
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,260
FALALA was able to ascertain that
he is Nice. And he wants a PlayStation.

586
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:54,682
We're now standardizing
all packages in green, red,

587
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,510
or the best of both, swirl.

588

(CROWD CHEERING)

589
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,574
- Oh, what's this?
- HELEN: Uh, guacamole?

590
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,463
- Guaca-what? Gua...
- Guacamole?

591
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,460
Guacamole? What is it made from?

592
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,753
Hi, Helen.

593
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,086
- Can I have $150 a day, please?
- (CHOKES)

594
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,342
Hey, Helen. We're all out of bird food.

595
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:37,096
They seem to
really be enjoying the churros.

596
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,889
Uh, you could buy some churros,
cut them into little pieces

597
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,393
and sell them as reindeer treats,
like you said, Helen?

598
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,936
Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well... (GIGGLES)

599
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,820
Don't keep these little nuggets
of brilliance all to yourself.

600
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,938
How many great ideas
have you been sitting on?

601
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,612
Three.

602
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:57,114
Let's get together. I'd love to hear
anything else you have to say.

603
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,989
You're full of surprises. Mmm.

604
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,538
- (INHALING DEEPLY)
- DAN: Oh.

605
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:04,621
HELEN: Mmm-hmm.

606
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:05,996
- You're the best.
- Oh, yeah.

607
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
- Helen.
- (GIGGLING) Yes.

608
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,588
I wouldn't... Um...

609
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:17,684
I can't give you $150 in cash.

610
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,931
But I can give you $150
in retail merchandise.

611
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:24,643
What would you like?
Bath Bar, Cinnabon, Chrysler Pacifica?

612
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,726
I don't know what those things are,
but I will take all of them.

613
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:29,402
Also, can we stay here tonight?

614
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,161

ELDER ELF ABE:
Santa, we're still not clear

619
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:15,184
how you plan to deliver billions
of presents with no sleigh or reindeer.

620
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:19,317
First of all, there aren't actually
billions of presents, Elder Elf Abe.

621
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,326
Our research indicates

622
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:27,367
that there are only 2,837 nice children
in the world.

What?

625
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,538
Gabe, how is that possible?

626
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,257
Nearly every child fibbed,

627
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,050
refused to eat their vegetables,

628
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:42,052
or failed to practice
proper dental hygiene.

Oh, no, you can't measure
a child like that.

632
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,445
Everyone makes mistakes.

633
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:04,028
Which is why each naughty child
will be receiving an evaluation notice

634
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,697
explaining the decision

635
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,286
and encouraging them
to do better next year.

639
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,880
Was just lookin' at your case.

640
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:17,974
Oh.

641
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,217
Oh, hi! Who are you?

642
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,425
Oh, this is my son. Alex, this is Noelle.

643
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,637
- Hi.
- Hi!

644
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,556
Oh, I totally see the resemblance.

645
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:34,894
I couldn't find any money,
but I did bring all this stuff.

646
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:39,025
- Did you steal this stuff?
- Of course not. Stealing's naughty.

647
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,907
- Is that the new Madden?
- I don't know, maybe.

648
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,740
And also, I had all these
extra Christmas decorations

649
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:51,788
in the sleeve... of my jacket.

650
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:54,423
And I thought they might
brighten the place up a little.

651
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:57,501
Oh, thanks, that's kind. I haven't
come up with much on your brother.

652
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,677
I'm gonna need some more time, not today,
'cause Alex and I are going to laser tag.

653
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,217
- I'd rather go to work with you, Dad.
- Me too!

654
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:07,012
I never get to go to work.
Unless it's at the workshop.

655
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,016
But we're not going to a workshop. Are we?

656
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:13,230
I never get to see what you do.
It'll be interesting.

657
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:14,731
So interesting.

658
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:15,813
Um...

659
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:20,436
I don't know about that. But, uh...
Sure, if that's what you want to do.

660
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,146
Let me get your other file, Kringle.

661
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:29,036
So, Alex, are you excited about Christmas?

662
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,458
I have mixed feelings, honestly.

663
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:34,077
About Christmas? How's that possible?

664
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,916
It's complicated.

665
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,840
Maybe you're just not eating enough.

666
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,378
I can't. It's terrible.

667
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:41,844
The eggs are rubbery,

668
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:44,594
the bacon is burnt on the outside,
and raw in the middle.

669
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:48,346
Pancakes bounce, I don't even know
what that is, and there's no seasoning.

670
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,769
Would you like a candy cane?

671
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,228
No, I have to eat this.

672
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:54,849
I don't wanna hurt my dad's feelings,
he worked hard on it.

673
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,936
Oh, well, maybe I can help.

674
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,193
Just get a couple pancake...

675
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:02,646
- Oh!
- JAKE: Kringle!

00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,998
So, Kringle, I called the police,
the hospitals,

679
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,869
the morgue,
the bureau of records, nothing.

680
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,706
Only place left to check are the shelters.

681
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,541
Shelters like igloos?

682
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,052
WOMAN: Good morning,
welcome to Phoenix shelter.

683
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,175
How can I help you?

684
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:32,431
Morning, my name's Jake Hapman.
I'm a licensed private detective.

685
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,226
We're looking for a Nick Kringle.

686
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,438
WOMAN: A Nick Kringle?

687
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:38,398
JAKE: He's about 6'2",
he's dressed in a red suit,

688
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,940
he's got a beard, pom-pom.

689
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:42,034
I have a picture.

690
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,648
And, yes. I know how strange that sounds.

691
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,782
- That's so beautiful.
- She can't hear you.

692
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,865
- Oh. (LOUDLY) That's...
- She's deaf.

693
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:52,869
Sorry.

694
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,168
It's really a lovely picture, though.

695
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,210
(MOUTHING)

696
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,009
My daughter says thank you,
and she wants to know what your name is.

697
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:13,806
My name is Noelle.

698
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:17,434
Do you know sign?

699
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:22,318
No. Not that I'm aware of, no.

700
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:31,202
It's nice to meet you too, Michelle.
What do you want for Christmas?

701
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,626
I need to go get her lunch,
but it was nice to meet you.

702
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,425
An iPad. You got it.

703
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,021
How did you just do that?

704
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:59,771
I don't know. I don't.

705
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:02,402
- Did you study it in school?
- No, I majored in calligraphy,

706
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,481
I had a minor in popcorn stringing.

707
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,565
(PANTING) And I...
None of this make sense.

708
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,952
What kind of world is this? This is awful.

709
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:12,949
You have people without homes
and food, and I'm so hot. God!

710
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:15,413
Uh, do you have any ice in this town?

711
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,878
Kringle, two minutes.

712
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,849
Hello. Merry Christmas.

713
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:37,847
- Can I get some fruit pops?
- Sure.

714
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:39,893
Ooh, fruit pops. There you go.

715
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:42,146
Do you want anything else?
Any gelato or...

716
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,268
No, I think I'm good. Thanks.

717
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:46,356
I like your pants, they're jolly.

718
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,900
Yeah. They're yoga pants. Like yours.

719
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,744
Yes. And these are my yogurt pants.

720
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:58,577
No. Yoga... pants.

721
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:02,291
Oh, yeah. I love yogurt pants.

722
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:07,206
- Never mind.
- (GIGGLING) Okay. Bye.

723
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:08,706
She was weird, right?

724
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,795
ALEX: Where are you from?

725
00:43:10,882 --> 00:43:12,382
A little town up north.

726
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,219
- You mean Canada?
- Canada wishes.

727
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:18,927
Mmm, instant hot chocolate?
Is this for real?

728
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:22,686
It's a powder. You pour hot water in it
and it becomes hot chocolate, instantly.

729
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:24,478
Mmm, sounds naughty.

730
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:27,273
It's way better when you make it
with real melted chocolate.

731
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,068
Yeah, I agree.

732
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,860
- That's how we used to make it.
- With your mom and dad?

733
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:34,235
We tried to keep my dad
out of the kitchen,

734
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:36,413
but he was in charge of
putting lights in the tree

735
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,701
and we'd hang stockings together.

736
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,543
This toy is messy.

737
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:42,460
I don't think
we're gonna be doing that this year.

738
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:44,750
'Cause it's complicated?

739
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,920
Yeah. Well, it's still Christmas,
you know?

740
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,673
And you still get a present from Santa.

741
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:52,338
Oh...

742
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:53,594
It's kind of offensive.

743
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,096
- I don't think I still believe in Santa.
- Santa's real.

744
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,719
He's under a lot of pressure right now,
but he's very real.

745
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:03,135
In fact, if you tell me what you want,
put in a good word for ya. Hmm?

746
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,304
Come on, give me a shot.

747
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,230
Try me, come on.

748
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,396
- Okay. I think I want...
- Hey, Kringle.

749
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:14,356
- I found your brother.
- What?

750
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:15,655
- Yep.
- How?

751
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:16,869
The yoga pants.

752
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,869
- Why do people keep saying that to me?
- Yoga.

753
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,121
You said Nick wanted to breathe,
stretch and relax? I did some googling,

754
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:26,003
and I found a Christmas Yoga Class
taught by a Nick K.

755
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,543
Nick K? Nick K! That's him! Ah!

756
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:32,206
Let's go find him.
Ready, and one, two, three...

757
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,507
- I'm gonna drop Alex at my sister's...
- Okay.

758
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,471
- ...and I'll drive you up there.
- Um, sir...

759
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,887
This says Santy Claus.

760
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,521
You know it's Santa Claus. I...

761
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:45,188
These'll just get sent back if you
don't fix that. Okay, thank you, bye.

762
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:52,148
You know what you need to do? You need to
get Alex the perfect Christmas present.

763
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:57,074
What about a cheese grater for Alex.
Or a George Foreman Grill?

764
00:44:57,155 --> 00:44:58,485
Alex doesn't cook.

765
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,032
Oh.

766
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,737
Are you sure?

767
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:05,206
He analyzed the breakfast you gave him
this morning in great detail.

768
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,668
He really warmed up to you.

769
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,840
- He's a great kid, isn't he?
- Yeah. Oh, steak knives.

770
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:16,878
Sometimes, I feel like a hyped-up
camp counselor when he's around.

771
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,507
I have to make sure
he's havin' a good time

772
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:21,925
since we don't get to
see each other as much.

773
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:24,103
And I feel guilty and...

774
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:26,103
And then I overcompensate and...

775
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,054
I don't know.

776
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,070
That must be hard.

777
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,818
Anyway, here we are.

778
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:45,503
Oh, hey, there it is.

779
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:47,746
Okay.

780
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:51,751
You were so great with Alex,
I wanted to give you this.

781
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,420
NOELLE: This, thank you.

782
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:57,835
Wow. Um, it's, uh...

783
00:45:58,382 --> 00:45:59,893
Oh, mmm...

784
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,097
Yeah, it's... Oh, okay.

785
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,759
(GIGGLING)

786
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:06,677
Oh, my gosh, it's magical. Look at that.

787
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:10,097
- Uh...
- Ugh. (COUGHS)

788
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,152
Stuffed chimneys!

789
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:16,032
It smells like it should taste good,
but it doesn't.

790
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:19,568
You're supposed to put in on your face.
Haven't you ever used sunblock before?

791
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,282
Yeah, sunblock. No, I love sunblock.

792
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:25,786
It's for blocking the sun.
It's great. Is that good?

793
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,659
You might wanna spread it around.

794
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:30,746
Oh, no, yeah, I forgot to
spread it around. Just like that.

795
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,541
It's burning. Oh, my God, it's in my eye.

796
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,126
- Well, you wanna...
- It's in my eye.

797
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,760
- What do you like about this product?
- Stay still. Let me...

798
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:38,798
- Stop. Just gotta rub it in.
- Okay, yep!

799
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:42,431
- Just stay still.
- Worse than getting hit with a slush ball.

800
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,101
Just gotta... You got a couple of
extra coats, but...

801
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,648
Never know when you're gonna need
an extra coat. It is winter.

802
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:55,356
- Thanks!
- No problem.

803
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,030
All right. Good luck in there.

804
00:46:58,025 --> 00:46:59,565
Say hello to your brother for me.

805
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,822
Will do. Merry Christmas.

806
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:14,289
MAN: Breathe in through your nose,
out your mouth.

807
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:19,505
Now assume... downward facing reindeer.

808
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,389
Very good, Cindy. Pete?

809
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,101
- (SCREAMS)
- STUDENTS: Ow!

810
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:32,353
Hey, hey! (LAUGHING)

811
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,556
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

812
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:38,606
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here? This is crazy.

813
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:42,152
- What's on your face?
- Oh! Oh, it's sunblock.

814
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:43,777
Yeah, the heat here, right?

815
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:47,494
It's like being locked in the cookie
cottage during toll-house season, right?

816
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:49,576
- Oh, by the way... You scared me so much.
- Shh!

817
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,251
- Come on.
- Yoga voice.

818
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:53,329
- You had me worried sick.
- Yoga voice.

819
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:56,585
- Mom's been beside herself.
- Yoga voice. Stop. Wait. Ellie, I'm sorry.

820
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:59,507
I'm sorry, okay. Just hold on.
Can't let anybody hear.

821
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:04,425
Listen, I like it here. Okay?

822
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,929
I like the weather. I like yoga, I mean,
I donated all my thermals to charity.

823
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,233
Weird, you can tell me about it
in the sleigh.

824
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:12,887
No, listen. I'm...

825
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:15,849
I'm not going back.

826
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:19,481
I'm sorry, I must have
cotton candy in my ears.

827
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:24,606
I know. I can't pretend to be
someone I'm not anymore.

828
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:28,076
I could, but I start to break out
in a rash, and my hair starts to...

829
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:30,197
Okay, Nick, I understand.

830
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:33,494
You're under a lot of pressure and I know
what it's like to be a Kringle,

831
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:36,329
- this family legacy we have to live up to.
- Not the same thing.

832
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,246
Well, I am Santa's daughter, so...

833
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:40,994
Well, no one's ever expected anything
of you, Noelle.

834
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:46,052
I mean, I've been training
to be Santa my whole life.

835
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,514
While you've been... What?
Cutting ribbon,

836
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:51,465
and making your silly cards?

837
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:53,927
- Thought you liked my cards.
- I do.

838
00:48:54,016 --> 00:48:55,847
I'm sorry I said that.
I do like your cards.

839
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:58,146
They're very creative.
I admire your shakti.

840
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,519
- My what?
- Your female energy.

841
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:03,737
Besides, you're the one
that told me to go.

842
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,778
You said, you, you said,
"Go! Take some time."

00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:24,708
Oh, why didn't you tell me
you were into cooking?

1012
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:27,336
I thought maybe you wouldn't like it.

1013
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:30,594
Hey, man, I like everything you do.

1014
00:58:31,427 --> 00:58:33,557
Hey, maybe you could give me some lessons.

1015
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:39,731
MAN ON PA: Guess who's coming
to the marketplace. Santa!

1016
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:41,731
Hope you've been nice this year.

1017
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:43,322
WOMAN: Let's go over there.

1018
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:53,742
Supercuts. How do I look?

1019
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:55,487
Like Prancer.

1020
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:58,998
More like Vixen,
with that tuft of hair up there.

1021
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,958
Santa!

1022
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,632
- Nick. Hey!
- Hey.

1023
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,760
- (SNOWCONE BLEATING)
- I'm so sorry.

1024
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:10,929
Look. What's happening at the Pole
is very naughty.

1025
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,050
But I can't be Santa.

1026
00:59:13,135 --> 00:59:15,175
The Santa that they hired isn't here yet.

1027
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,684
Sit with a couple of kids,
you'll feel The Twinkle.

1028
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:21,596
And if you don't, no more pressure.
I will leave you alone. I almost promise.

1029
00:59:22,436 --> 00:59:24,226
- I can't, Ellie.
- Nick Kringle,

1030
00:59:24,313 --> 00:59:27,693
this is in your blood. It's in your stars.

1031
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,186
It's in your destiny.

1032
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:31,697
I left the suit in the North Pole.

1033
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,780
That's a problem, Nick. Come on.

1034
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:36,027
This costume is ridiculous.

1035
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,327
I don't see any difference
from what you usually wear.

1036
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:39,871
- Excuse me?
- Or...

1037
00:59:39,996 --> 00:59:41,706
You think I look like this all the time?

1038
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:44,460
Worst thing anyone's ever said to me.
You, gather the reindeer.

1039
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:47,672
- We're doing this and going home.
- Well, how is it different?

1040
00:59:47,753 --> 00:59:49,974
Little lower and to the right, please.

1041
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:53,505
NICK: I just don't think
it's that great of an idea.

1042
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:54,603
KIDS: Santa!

1043
00:59:54,677 --> 00:59:56,427
- It'll be great.
- NICK: There's a lot of them.

1044
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:58,313
- I don't know...
- You're gonna be great.

1045
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:00,769
Santa is so excited to meet you guys.

1046
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:02,601
(BLOWS)

1047
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:06,228
You got this. Come on up.

1048
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:07,724
Go ahead. Go on.

1049
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:10,356
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Hi!

1050
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,530
Merry Christmas. What's your name?

1051
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:16,164
(SPEAKING PUNJABI)

1052
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,333
Right back at you.

1053
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,460
(CONTINUES SPEAKING PUNJABI)

1054
01:00:29,003 --> 01:00:32,423
- His name's Ajeet. He's from India.
- Wait, how do you know that?

1055
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:34,429
I don't know. You pick stuff up.

1056
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,429
For Christmas, he wants his cousin
to come live with him

1057
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:39,182
- in Phoenix, Arizona.
- Okay.

1058
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:41,313
(SPEAKING PUNJABI)

1059
01:00:42,016 --> 01:00:43,726
- And an iPad.
- An iPad. I got that.

1060
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,521
That was fun, right? Merry Christmas.

1061
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:49,688
- Do we break for lunch now or is that...
- No!

1062
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:55,985
- Hello!
- Let's not make a meal out of this.

1063
01:00:56,072 --> 01:01:00,583
I'm only doing it so my parents
can practice using Snapchat.

1064
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:06,420
Got it. So, Merry Christmas.
What's your name?

1065
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,090
Tonya. Tonya Cooperman.

1066
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:13,092
Tonya Cooperman.
And have you been a good girl?

1067
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:15,762
I really don't see
how that's your business.

1068
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:17,092
You're right. I'm sorry.

1069
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:19,177
That was over the line, um...

1070
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:22,472
Let's say you were a good girl,

1071
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,139
what do you want for Christmas?

1072
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:27,347
Why? You're gonna get it for me?

1073
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:30,266
A pathetic mall Santa?

1074
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:33,067
You're right.
He's not gonna get it for you.

1075
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,240
Because you were so mean to Jennie Stalts
just 'cause she has a lisp.

1076
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,570
Tonya, Jennie is your best friend.

1077
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:39,907
Get over here.

1078
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:42,541
How'd you know about Jennie Stalts?

1079
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,748
She had a Jennie Stalts vibe,
I don't know.

1080
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:49,039
Usually, it takes people years of yoga
to get that kind of awareness.

1081
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,130
Oh, I see my friend. I'll be back.

1082
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:54,882
- Wait, no!
- You're doing great!

1083
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:58,255
No, I'm not. Please,
I don't know what I'm doing.

1084
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:00,719
Next.

1085
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:05,018
Hi, Merry Christmas. What's your name?

1086
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,309
Why did you write this to me, Santa?

1087
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:12,023
"Dear Roberto, due to your
continuous failure to make your bed,

1088
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:14,646
"you will not be receiving
a present this year.

1089
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:16,735
"We invite you
to correct this naughty flaw

1090
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,360
"and reapply for present status
next Christmas."

1091
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:20,818
Yeah, I didn't write that.

1092
01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:24,699
"Best wishes, Santa." Hmm. Right there.

1093
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:26,456
- BOY 1: I got one too.
- BOY 2: I got one too.

1094
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,617
- GIRL 1: I got one.
- BOY 3: I got one too.

1095
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:32,539
Hey! Oh, my God! I'm so jolly you're here.

1096
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:37,134
Did you tell Alex that I would spend
Christmas with him and my ex-wife?

1097
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:40,971
Yeah. It's his Christmas wish
to go to that Chinese restaurant

1098
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:43,682
you guys always go to
on Christmas day, Sun Ming,

1099
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,974
and have the red and green egg rolls.

1100
01:02:46,057 --> 01:02:48,018
But I told you,
Jessie and I don't get along.

1101
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:52,061
She has a new life with her husband
and Alex, and I can't go over there.

1102
01:02:52,146 --> 01:02:55,436
Yeah. But if you use Christmas
to open up and talk about it...

1103
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:58,106
Me? Open up?

1104
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:00,318
Kringle, you're the one who omits things.

1105
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:03,945
Like how you can speak sign language,
or chocolate money.

1106
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:08,871
No. That's fair, um, yeah.

1107
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:18,340
My dad was Santa Claus, he was great.

1108
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:20,884
Every Christmas Eve,
he would slide down the chimney.

1109
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:24,347
Could've come in the front door, but he
wanted to give us the full treatment.

1110
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:28,349
Nick and I would peek out from our rooms,
I'd say I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus.

1111
01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:30,193
And then Dad would sit with us

1112
01:03:30,268 --> 01:03:33,768
and tell us about his night,
and that was my favorite present.

1113
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:38,065
And then, Elf Polly, now Aunt Polly,

1114
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,780
um, she would take us to bed.

1115
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,240
Six months ago, Dad died,

1116
01:03:43,322 --> 01:03:45,833
so, Nick became Santa
and he was feeling overwhelmed,

1117
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,659
so I told him that he should
take some time off,

1118
01:03:48,744 --> 01:03:50,704
get away for a while and he wound up here,

1119
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:52,789
and now he wants to stay and do yoga,

1120
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,534
and, um, everybody in the North Pole
is really mad at me.

1121
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:59,166
So, I took the sleigh and the reindeer
to bring him back.

1122
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:07,429
All right, thank you
for being so nice to Alex.

1123
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:10,931
Good luck, Kringle. Merry Christmas.

1124
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:17,403

This is my gig. Time to move.

1126
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:21,454

1127
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:22,818
- MALL SANTA: I'm certified.
- Sorry.

01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:25,405

from the Phoenix Santa school.

This is where you belong.

- MALL SANTA: I belong in that chair.
- NOELLE: Excuse me. You sit down.

1131
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,786
You are not even a real Santa.
I need you to show some respect.

1132
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:36,594
- He's the real Santa.
- GUARD: Let's discuss this over here.

- GUARD: You're coming with me.
- Oh, sorry!

1136
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,380
- NICK: Leave her alone.
- This is unnecessary.

1137
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,586
- NICK: Noelle!
- NOELLE: Nick, stay where you are.

1138

- NICK: Sorry!
- These kids need to meet the real Santa.

1139
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,887
- NICK: I'll give you a free yoga class.
- Uh...

1140
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:53,643
Ho, ho, ho! Who is next? You, come on.

1141
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:00,815
Look, my sister didn't mean any harm,
okay? She just...

1142
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,900
She used to beat me up
for fun all the time.

1143
01:05:02,985 --> 01:05:05,655
She's just having fun, okay?
She's fun-loving.

1144
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:07,739
I guess that's why she assaulted a cop.

1145
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,543
She's talkin' about crazy things
like the North Pole and elves.

1146
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:12,039
What's so crazy about elves?

1147
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:14,670
They're holding her
for psychiatric evaluation.

1148
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,958
Wait, tomorrow is Christmas Eve, though.

1149
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:19,092
Thanks for the reminder.
I still gotta shop.

1150
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:23,628
You still need to shop? Well, you know,
I can get you whatever you want.

1151
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:27,092
You know? Straight from the workshop.

1152
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:33,023
You want a My Little Pony Explore
Equestria Crystal Empire Castle playset?

1153

Done.

1154
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,692
I'll get it for you. With accessories.

1155
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,483
I don't have any kids.

1156
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:40,815
What a shock.

till Christmas.

01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,657
Why don't you just eat
the whole gavel, Elder Elf Abe?

1160
01:05:51,742 --> 01:05:56,293
Now, I say we take all 2,837 presents,

Gabe, for the last time,

1165
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:14,353
there're more than 2,837 nice children.

1166
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:15,432
ALL: Yeah!

1167
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:19,646
However many presents there are,
we have no way to deliver them.

1168
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,019
No, listen to me. I can do this.

1169
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:25,856
We just need to do a reboot or maybe
get an appointment at the Genius bar.

Please, I can do it!

Another boy was rejected
because of his failure to floss.

It seems like there's a real shortage
of Christmas spirit this year.

There was a disturbing scene

1180
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:14,619
at the Desert Ridge Marketplace today.

Thanks, Dad. This is great.

you wanted me to come over

and do our traditional Sun Ming
red and green eggroll thing, but I just...

1187

Dad, I never told Noelle that.

1188
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,375
Well, then, how did she know?

1189
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:07,378
She said I'd get what I wanted
for Christmas, but I never told her.

1190

Now, I see she told you,

1200
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,341
and I see that you don't believe her.

1201
01:08:51,422 --> 01:08:52,932
That she lives in the North Pole?

1202
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:58,099
No. I tend to believe what I can see.

1203

Can you see love?

Can you see sorrow?

Can you see joy?

1210
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:24,079
Is there anything realer than that?

1211
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:27,131
Like what you feel for your boy?

1212
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:48,813
How can I help?

1213
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:52,939
Get her out of that hospital,
and I will take care of the rest.

1214
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:57,823
Why do you think
you're here today, Noelle?

1215
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:01,904
Because I kicked a policeman,

1216
01:10:01,993 --> 01:10:05,503
which isn't illegal where I'm from.
Because we don't have policeman.

1217
01:10:06,038 --> 01:10:07,118
I see.

1218
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,501
And where are you from?

she's Mother Nature.

Wow. Some real nuts out there.

1227
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:40,737

he's Frosty the Snowman.

The question is,
what really makes a Santa?

01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:10,817
Ultimately, the one thing all Santas share
is the ability to inspire us

1327

with the Christmas spirit.

1328

What does Christmas mean to you?

1330
01:16:38,431 --> 01:16:41,311
I used to think Christmas
was the best day of the year.

Presents and caroling.

1332
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:48,032
But I met people for whom
it isn't the best day

1333
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:53,528
because it reminds them they don't have
enough food to eat or a place to live.

1334
01:16:53,905 --> 01:16:55,865
Or maybe even someone
to share the day with.

1335
01:16:57,326 --> 01:16:59,235
And it got me thinking.

1336
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,207
For thousands of years,
we've jingled bells and delivered toys,

1337
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:07,420
and the world just gets more awful
and miserable. So what's the point?

1338
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:15,180
But I also met a girl at a shelter
who drew these beautiful pictures,

01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,140
and her Christmas wish wasn't for herself.

1340
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:21,981
It was for her mother
to be able to find a job.

1341
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,847
And I met a woman at a marketplace

1342
01:17:24,936 --> 01:17:28,317
who worked so hard to fill Christmas
with fun and music,

1343
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:31,148
even though she knew she might not have
anyone to spend it with.

1344
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:37,987
And I met this sweet, wonderful boy
who has this big heart.

1345
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:39,484
And his father

1346
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:42,956
who doesn't even believe in Christmas,
but made sure we could be home for it.

1347
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:51,586
We have this list of nice people
from Hong Kong to Houston

1348
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:53,631
doing wonderful, selfless things.

1349
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,430
And I know Christmas
can't solve all our problems.

1350
01:18:01,597 --> 01:18:02,717
But it gives us hope.

1351
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:06,313
It inspires us to be nice.

1352
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:08,856
That might not seem like much, but...

1353
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:13,568
when someone's sad or just lonely,

1354
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,149
it can be the biggest thing in the world.

1355
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:20,238
And presents are part of it.

1356
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:22,788
I like presents as much as anybody.

1357
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:26,497

But now, I think it's not just about
the presents we get.

1361
01:18:34,213 --> 01:18:36,264
It's about the presents we give.

1362

01:31:05,423 --> 01:31:06,684
Just this bone.

1512
01:31:06,757 --> 01:31:08,047
Okay. Keep working.

1513
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:12,135
And as for me,
I mean, I'm Santa. It's great!

1514
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:14,184
- Keep it coming.
- Thanks, Santa.

1515
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:15,765
Thank you very much.

1516
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:17,980
Okay, a letter from
Jake and Alex, everybody.

1517
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,060
Alex is into music now,

1518
01:31:20,146 --> 01:31:22,396
so a slow cooker is out
and drum kit is in.

1519
01:31:22,481 --> 01:31:25,402
And throw in a pair of noise-cancelling
headphones for dad. Great.

1520
01:31:29,573 --> 01:31:30,993
When I was a little girl,

1521
01:31:31,073 --> 01:31:33,293
Christmas Eve was always
the best night of the year.

1522
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:37,292
But this time, it was better than ever.

1523
01:31:38,623 --> 01:31:40,833
Because instead of getting the presents,

1524
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:43,087
I was giving them.
