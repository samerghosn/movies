00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:01,292
Court!

3
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:06,167
As a defense counsel,
I used to help people clear their charges

4
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,167
As a prosecutor,

5
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,209
I can convict real criminals

6
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,001
Winston Zhou

7
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:23,709
Mr Winston Zhou,

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,876
at 18:45

9
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,667
on October 31, 2012,

10
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:31,959
in Rm 3610 on 36/F
of Chinese Liaison Building,

11
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,417
you were suspected of violating Section 122

12
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,042
of Chapter 200 of the Laws of Hong Kong

13
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,459
by indecently assaulting
a 25-year-old piano teacher Jane Li

14
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,084
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

15
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,001
Not guilty

16
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,834
The Reagan Chan
case is as you have expected

17
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,167
He played victim

18
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,876
while duping small shareholders

19
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:25,334
Many employees lost their jobs as a result

20
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:27,376
What about Fortune Bank?

21
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,501
I just investigated for you

22
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,584
They deliberately misled
those small customers

23
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,626
into purchasing structured
investment products,

24
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,084
causing great loss to everybody eventually

25
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,251
I'm not going to take the Reagan Chan case

26
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,876
And I won't settle out of court

27
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,042
with Fortune Bank

28
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,001
How come you never accept certain cases?

29
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,792
I won't accept cases I don't believe in

30
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:50,917
Did you forget

31
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,417
I'm the master of your chambers?

32
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,084
Aren't you supposed to be liable to me?

33
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,959
I'm only liable to my clients

34
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:02,751
I can't think of

35
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,209
any chambers you can fit in

36
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,334
If our destinations differ,
we go separate ways

37
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,417
You should understand that

38
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:17,292
Patient Liu Cheng-on

39
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,959
Please go to Chinese Medication Room
to collect your medicine

40
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,959
Dad, what is it about?

41
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,917
Just leave the stuff here

42
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,792
Every time I called you,

43
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,251
you never replied

44
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,751
You could leave a message

45
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,209
I gave you a tie at your graduation

46
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,751
I wonder if it's still there

47
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,334
If there's nothing else, I better get going

48
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,334
But you only just came

49
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,126
Stay a bit longer

50
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,959
If I don't need to be hospitalized regularly,

51
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,001
would you still come visit me?

52
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,876
Ray Hung, the property developer
suspected of sexual assault,

53
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,542
is in court today

54
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,042
Details of the case
will not be made public till after the trial

55
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,376
Why don't you discuss it with Ms Chan?

56
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,209
If this trial continues,

57
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,251
Ms Chan's personal life

58
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,459
will be exposed

59
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,959
If the charge is changed to molestation,

60
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,834
my client will plead guilty immediately

61
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,876
We lawyers should not make
decisions for our clients anyway

62
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:10,751
Property developer Ray Hung
was in sexual assault again

63
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,376
2 weeks after his release

64
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:15,459
The victim is the plaintiff

65
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,751
in the molestation case

66
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,251
You told me to reduce his sentence

67
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,667
Now he's not scared

68
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,417
Is there a deal between you lawyers?

69
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:24,209
Aren't you obligated to protect me?

70
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,501
An attorney merely proposes

71
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,167
what questions
the defense counsel will ask you

72
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,251
You're well aware of my situation

73
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,084
You know how it would ruin me

74
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:38,001
"Rape Plantiff Commits Suicide"

75
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,959
Don't bring me any fruits next time

76
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:50,292
I can't eat sweet things because of my illness

77
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,042
All right

78
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,584
"Father"

79
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,126
Is your dad alright?

80
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,584
Well...

81
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,667
Where are you going?

82
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,459
To Beijing

83
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,251
Have you forgotten?
Haven't we agreed already?

84
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,959
I'm taking my students
to Beijing this weekend

85
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,876
We're going back to see my parents

86
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,376
Have I said that?

87
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,917
Tell me, have you forgotten?

88
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,709
Since I've forgotten anyway, just stay

89
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:06,584
This song, Christmas Rose, is very difficult

90
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,209
Ms Zhao needs to learn it within a short time?

91
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:11,959
My boyfriend loves the song

92
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,167
I want to give him a surprise at the wedding

93
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:16,709
Congratulations!

94
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,584
Thank you

95
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,584
Ms Li will teach you from now on

96
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,001
Good

97
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,001
Just call me Jane

98
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,084
I'll be much obliged

99
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,876
Thank you

100
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,626
Nurse Lin, sorry for being late today.

101
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,167
Never mind

102
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,001
Jane

103
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:43,751
Doctor Zhou

104
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,917
During my last period,

105
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,001
my tummy hurts

106
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,209
Don't worry. I'll give you a checkup later

107
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,959
The nurse will help you change

108
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,626
Looks like you
prefer this dress to the other one

109
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:05,417
Let's order this one then

110
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,376
But I've decided to lose weight

111
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,834
Still?

112
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,834
You're already very skinny

113
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,501
I just quit Hill's Chambers

114
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:20,959
But don't worry

115
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:35,542
Tim, I know your greatest dream

116
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,334
is to open your own chambers

117
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,292
We have savings anyway

118
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:45,751
Use the cash. We can delay the wedding

119
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,667
If it's not enough, I can borrow from my dad

120
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,084
Opening my chambers or not doesn't matter

121
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,334
I don't want you to worry about my work

122
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,542
Nothing will affect our wedding

123
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,584
I want you to be my happy wife

124
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,542
Jane!

125
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:50,417
What happened to you?

126
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,917
Any prescriptions, Nurse Lin?

127
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,209
It's only a checkup today

128
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:57,834
Thank you

129
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:00,709
Jane?

130
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,751
OK
I have to go

131
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:03,626
Didn't you want to see Tina

132
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,501
at Dr Zhou's place?

133
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,584
I don't want to go

134
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,792
I'm not feeling well.
Let's go back to the shop

135
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:13,667
Dr Zhou
Ms Law

136
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,792
Didn't we say we would leave together?

137
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,667
It seems that Jane is not feeling well

138
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,126
She wants to go back and rest

139
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,917
Oh, I see

140
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,084
Never mind. I'll give you a lift

141
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,376
Thank you

142
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:30,834
You are welcome

143
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:34,459
I've decided to join you
and work for the government

144
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:38,167
Being a court prosecutor just like me?

145
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,209
I went to the Legal Department
to be a prosecutor

146
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,209
As a defense counsel,
I used to help people clear their charges

147
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:50,626
As a prosecutor, I can convict real criminals

148
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:53,334
It suits me better

149
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,209
Hey...

150
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,209
You still have to take the test this year?

151
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,001
Of course

152
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,959
I'm only one step away from being a lawyer

153
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,709
Good luck! Cheers!

154
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,876
Let me...

155
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,292
Sorry, Dr Zhou

156
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,126
Let me help you

157
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:50,584
Come

158
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,626
Stay away!
I'll help you

159
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:02,376
What's with you?

160
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,584
Stay away!

161
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:09,292
Jane, what happened?

162
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,084
What's going on here?

163
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:12,251
Nothing, we're fine here

164
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,167
Miss, are you all right?

165
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,501
Should we call an ambulance?

166
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:15,667
Miss

167
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,417
Hello? Speaking...

168
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:52,959
What's the matter?

169
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,667
I'm Freddy Xue. Just call me Freddy

170
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:09,792
Winston Zhou

171
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,001
Let's cut to the chase

172
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,334
They will take your statement in a moment

173
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,834
But I want you to remain silent

174
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,084
Let's wait till you're released on bail

175
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,542
We'll have a meeting outside

176
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,001
and we'll give it further thought

177
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,751
We'll then give the police

178
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,126
a full statement, OK?

179
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,376
I'm innocent

180
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:46,501
I understand

181
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:50,459
How pretty

182
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,542
Looks better on camera than in real life

183
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:54,876
First,

184
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,126
there's no direct witness in this case

185
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,126
But since you're Jane Li's employer

186
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,292
and doctor

187
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,959
and your clinic was the alleged crime scene,

188
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:07,834
the Prosecution
can find lots of evidence of doubt

189
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,459
You're in breach of trust

190
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,584
This sort of cases is usually prejudicial

191
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:12,542
to men

192
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:17,334
Mrs Zhou, since your husband is a celebrity,

193
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,459
please be prepared psychologically

194
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:22,876
Before the court has passed its judgement,

195
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,709
public opinions will have convicted him

196
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,959
This is the social pressure of public opinion

197
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:30,792
There's one thing that favors you though

198
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,459
In criminal cases,

199
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:34,751
you are presumed innocent by the law

200
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,084
The burden of proof lies on the prosecution

201
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,917
However, besides the girl in this case,

202
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,459
there was no other eye witness

203
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,417
It's a matter of the court

204
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,876
trusting your testimony

205
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,834
or hers

206
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:47,792
Tim!

207
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,459
It's a case of indecent assault.
Can you handle it?

208
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,167
Sure, no problem

209
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:53,792
It's not complicated

210
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:58,792
By the way,

211
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,626
the defense counsel

212
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,376
is from Hill's Chambers

213
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:03,917
Who?

214
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,709
Freddy Xue

215
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:11,042
Do you know
who is the prosecutor for your case?

216
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,292
It's Tim Chen

217
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,334
Freddy Xue

218
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,042
He has a meteoric rise in recent years

219
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,334
He won't take cases that don't make money

220
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,126
He has never lost a single case

221
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,834
His father is some entrepreneur
in the Mainland

222
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,709
So a rich brat like him can be capable too

223
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:42,792
It's weird you guys never met

224
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,626
Maybe because we wish
to protect different folks

225
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,042
Here's the main point

226
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,834
Besides Winston Zhou's information,

227
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,167
I found out that at the age of 6 of 7,

228
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,834
Jane Li was sent to an orphanage
by her mother

229
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,292
She later had an accident
that crippled her legs

230
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,584
Then she started giving kids piano lessons

231
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,126
And now, yet another atrocity

232
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,167
According to psychologists,

233
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,209
desertion and sexual assault

234
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,292
leave the worst scars

235
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,084
Mr Winston Zhou

236
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,792
at 18:45

237
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,667
on October 31, 2012,

238
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:32,334
in Rm 3610 on 36/F
of Chinese Liaison Building,

239
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,792
you were suspected of violating Section 122

240
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,209
of Chapter 200 of the Laws of Hong Kong

241
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:40,042
by indecently assaulting
a 25-year-old piano teacher Jane Li

242
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,126
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

243
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,501
Winston Zhou

244
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:58,834
How do you plead?

245
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,084
Not guilty

246
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,959
Join Tina's birthday party

247
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:19,251
at our place next week

248
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,709
William has swimming lessons on Sundays

249
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:23,709
Oh, I see

250
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,792
Shirley has painting lessons

251
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:30,751
Never mind. I've written the invites anyway

252
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,626
Thank you
I'll give them to you first

253
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,501
Thank you, so beautiful

254
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:38,001
Yes, it's so delicate and beautiful

255
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,459
The show starts now

256
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,917
Tina!

257
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,084
OK! That's it for today's rehearsal

258
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,417
Let's do it again next week!

259
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,292
Say goodbye to your teacher
Bye

260
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,917
Mrs Zhou, there are reporters outside

261
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:06,417
Mrs Zhou,

262
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,542
do you believe Mr Zhou is innocent?

263
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:10,084
Mrs Zhou, do you believe...

264
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:12,751
Say a few words!

265
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,751
Little girl, has your dad and Ms Li

266
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:14,834
done anything irregular?

267
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,376
Hey! You're too much! Get out of our way!

268
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:23,292
Mrs Zhou...
Mrs Zhou, say a few words

269
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,251
Ms Li is here!
Make way please!

270
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,834
First Trial

271
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:10,876
Hi, Tim! I've heard so much about you

272
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,876
I'm Freddy

273
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,209
Nice to meet you

274
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,542
Nice to meet you

275
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,459
I've heard so much about you

276
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,042
I feel as if we've known each other for ages

277
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,251
Yes
Is that so?

278
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,376
I know your dad

279
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,917
was a famous prosecutor too

280
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:29,876
I've studied many of his cases

281
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:32,542
He was my idol at school

282
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:34,876
I'm so glad I can go

283
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,792
to trial against his son today

284
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:38,959
Pleased to meet you

285
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:58,626
Court!

286
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,209
Your Honor,

287
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,126
the Prosecution calls

288
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,001
as witness Sergeant John Li

289
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,917
Sergeant Li,
can you describe the event to us?

290
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,251
According to Ms Jane Li's statement,

291
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,459
at 18:20

292
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,376
on October 31, 2012,

293
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:23,334
she went to the defendant's clinic for checkup

294
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,167
When the defendant conducted the checkup,

295
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,792
he illegally touched her breasts
and lower body

296
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:32,459
On the floor and on the bed
in the crime scene,

297
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,251
we collected
both parties' DNA and finger prints

298
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:38,334
Both parties' statements
and the injury reports

299
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,542
indicate prima facie evidence
can be established

300
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,251
We therefore decided
to prosecute the defendant

301
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:43,626
Sergeant Li

302
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,834
during the entire alleged indecent assault,

303
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,042
were there any eye witnesses?

304
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,209
In most cases of indecent assault,
there are no...

305
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,042
Please just answer "yes" or "no"

306
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:53,209
No

307
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:53,959
In other words,

308
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,251
the police based their judgement entirely

309
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,167
on Ms Li's statement

310
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,626
and some circumstantial evidence.

311
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,334
Is that correct?

312
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,251
You can say so

313
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,292
In fact, the evidence you have mentioned,

314
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:06,709
only suggests that they had physical contacts

315
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,376
It doesn't imply

316
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,209
Dr Zhou has assaulted Ms Li

317
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:11,542
Can I say that?

318
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,292
You can

319
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:14,251
Let me ask another question

320
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,042
Why is the police so certain

321
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,167
the evidence is enough for prosecution?

322
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,001
Is it because...

323
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,417
the plaintiff

324
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,542
is a young girl on a wheelchair?

325
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:27,042
Are you so eager

326
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,334
to protect the underprivileged

327
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,834
that you decide the accused
must have violated Ms Li?

328
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:32,751
Am I correct?

329
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,167
Your Honor,

330
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,042
objection. The question is leading

331
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:36,834
Your Honor,

332
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:38,501
no further questions

333
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:47,709
Ms Law, what happened

334
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,501
on the day of the incident?

335
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,126
That day our class was delayed

336
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,917
So I telephoned Dr Zhou that we'll be late

337
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,751
and I accompanied Jane to the clinic

338
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,376
After Jane Li entered Dr Zhou's room,

339
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:00,459
were you present at the scene?

340
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:02,917
No, I waited for her outside

341
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:04,542
Did you hear any sounds

342
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,709
from the room?

343
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:09,084
I seem to have heard someone cry

344
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,084
How did it sound like?

345
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,834
Did it sound like Ms Li crying for help?

346
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,917
I'm not sure

347
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,917
I watched that drama

348
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,001
you had been watching

349
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:20,209
During the exact time of the alleged incident,

350
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:23,334
the two leads were having a fierce argument

351
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,001
They shouted vehemently

352
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:28,709
Are you sure the sounds came from the room?

353
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:32,542
When Ms Li exited the clinic,

354
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,001
did she mention to you

355
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,417
that Dr Zhou had molested her?

356
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,292
No

357
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,959
But her eyes were red, as if she had cried

358
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:46,126
Could Ms Li have red eyes because

359
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:48,667
she had worked hard and was tired?

360
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,542
Objection!

361
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,792
No more questions, Your Honor

362
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,876
Ms Lin, were you present throughout

363
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:59,667
Ms Li's checkup?

364
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,417
I was there at the beginning

365
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:04,001
Then a patient who just left

366
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:04,876
the clinic called,

367
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,751
saying he had left his meds

368
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:10,251
The meds were for his asthma
and he's an elderly

369
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,876
I thought I ought to give him the meds asap

370
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,667
When you returned to the clinic,

371
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,459
was Dr Zhou still examining Ms Li?

372
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,001
When I returned to the clinic,

373
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,626
I found Ms Li having fallen on the ground

374
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,251
I immediately helped her get up

375
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:24,876
What happened?

376
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,751
If you are a patient now,

377
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,126
and a male doctor is examining your body,

378
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:31,209
and there are just the two of you in the room,

379
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,626
if you feel something wrong,

380
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,167
would you terminate the checkup?

381
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:35,667
I would

382
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:38,001
What if the doctor would not stop?

383
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,126
I would get up

384
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,251
and leave immediately

385
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,334
If, unfortunately,

386
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:43,334
your feet cannot move?

387
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,209
What would you do?

388
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,126
You would struggle desperately,

389
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,584
using your upper body to push him off

390
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:49,876
and flee

391
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,792
But too bad your feet cannot move

392
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:56,209
Eventually, you fall down from the bed

393
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:59,334
Your Honor,
when a doctor examines a patient,

394
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:02,459
he is not legally required
to have a nurse present

395
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,667
I have 38 letters from patients

396
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,251
who have been seeing Dr Zhou

397
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:10,209
over the years,

398
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,542
testifying to his professional

399
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:15,251
and moral integrity

400
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:21,417
Your Honor, according to Exhibit P7 supplied

401
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:24,959
by the Prosecution,
namely Ms Li's medical report,

402
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,792
the sex organs in Ms Li's lower body

403
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:31,126
could be as sensitive
as those of ordinary people.

404
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,417
Ms Jane Li

405
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:39,334
When Dr Zhou's hand approached your breasts,

406
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,876
did you protest?

407
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:49,501
Yes, I did

408
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,042
When he continued the checkup,

409
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,376
did you feel the defandant place his finger

410
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,751
inside your sex organ?

411
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,042
Yes

412
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,334
Did you indicate resistance?

413
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,251
Yes

414
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:22,626
Did he stop in accordance
with your indication?

415
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,459
No

416
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:32,542
The more I struggled,

417
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,876
the harder he grabbed me

418
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:39,667
Then the phone rang

419
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:42,792
And he stopped

420
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,792
Do you know who called him?

421
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:48,334
What else did he say?

422
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,042
Hello?

423
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,834
Yes, we just finished the checkup

424
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,917
Wife, I'll be back for dinner very soon.
Wait for me

425
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,001
OK, bye

426
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,876
And then,

427
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,084
I wanted to take the opportunity to escape

428
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:15,251
but fell down from the bed

429
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,292
The nurse entered the room

430
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,501
She saw me and helped me get up

431
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:23,792
All right

432
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,251
I want to ask you another question

433
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:30,209
Did Dr Zhou employ you?

434
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,376
Or did Mrs Zhou?

435
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,584
They employed me together

436
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,709
Can you elaborate?

437
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:45,584
Eve introduced us

438
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,792
This couple

439
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:52,167
wanted me to give
their kid piano lessons at home

440
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:56,251
Mr Zhou said he could arrange transportation

441
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:59,417
I already explained the problem
with the pedal

442
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:02,459
They think it's all right for a beginner

443
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:06,834
You mean to say that...

444
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,792
Dr Zhou took the initiative to employ you

445
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,167
and even offered you transportation

446
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,042
Is that correct?

447
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:15,417
Yes

448
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:17,167
Your Honor,

449
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,042
I have no further questions

450
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,167
Ms Li

451
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,001
After the nurse left,

452
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,834
did Dr Zhou continue the checkup?

453
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,292
Yes

454
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,959
He said, "Let's continue"

455
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,584
How did he continue the checkup?

456
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,542
He started pressing different parts of my body

457
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:46,042
before putting his hand on my breasts

458
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,126
Breasts?

459
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,876
When you said breasts,

460
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:53,459
did you mean here?

461
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,001
No, a bit lower

462
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,501
So you were referring to the lower chest,
right?

463
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,209
No, yes...

464
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:01,334
Have you had physical checkup before?

465
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:05,542
No

466
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,251
So what criteria did you use to judge...

467
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:09,292
Dr Zhou's checkup?

468
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,167
I could feel being molested

469
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,042
I felt uncomfortable

470
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,626
I knew he was molesting me

471
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:19,959
What had Dr Zhou done

472
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:22,417
to make you uncomfortable?

473
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:26,959
He took my panties...

474
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:29,792
off

475
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:30,459
Wait

476
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:32,626
Because your lower body is paralyzed,

477
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:35,042
you cannot take your panties off yourself

478
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,334
Can I say that?

479
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,376
I cannot when I'm lying down

480
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,167
I understand. Please continue

481
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:44,167
And then,

482
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,376
I saw...

483
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,126
him put his finger...

484
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,292
into my lower body

485
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,376
Saw?

486
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,084
Ms Li

487
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:03,042
You were lying in bed

488
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:05,084
and you were wearing a robe

489
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:07,334
You couldn't have seen that

490
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,917
You mean

491
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,584
you felt it, right?

492
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,584
Yes, I felt it.

493
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:17,709
Since you said you had felt it,

494
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:22,084
can you indicate on this picture

495
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:23,334
which part of your body had that feeling?

496
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:30,042
Here

497
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,626
So what you meant by lower body

498
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:33,626
is actually

499
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:34,876
the sex organ?

500
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:41,042
So what did you feel at the time?

501
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:43,501
I felt...

502
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,084
his finger...

503
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,917
twitching

504
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,584
What kind of feeling was that?

505
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,959
It could be pain or pleasure

506
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,376
Objection

507
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,459
Mr Xue, please pay attention to your question

508
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,501
Excuse me, Your Honor

509
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,459
Ms Li

510
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,334
You said you never

511
00:31:06,376 --> 00:31:08,501
had a lower body checkup?

512
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:10,626
Never

513
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:14,292
Could you have confused lower body checkup

514
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,501
with molestation?

515
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,167
I did not confuse

516
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,042
I was really molested

517
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:22,959
I really felt his finger
twitching in my lower body

518
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,709
Are you a virgin?

519
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:25,876
Your Honor,

520
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:27,542
whether Ms Li is a virgin

521
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:29,501
or not is irrelevant

522
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:30,626
Your Honor,

523
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,292
whether Ms Li is a virgin or not

524
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,959
as well as her sexual experience

525
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,542
are critical to this case

526
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:38,001
Her accusation could cause serious damage to

527
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:41,084
the defendant's d reputation

528
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:42,459
Please let me ask the question

529
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,792
Objection overruled.
Please proceed cautiously

530
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:49,167
Ms Li, please answer my question

531
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,792
Yes

532
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:59,251
Have you ever had a boyfriend

533
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,959
or tried any sexual activities?

534
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:04,959
No

535
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,501
Nothing, right?

536
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:08,584
Right

537
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:12,042
So I think you must have been mistaken

538
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:13,376
Dr Zhou's checkup

539
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:16,042
is just regular checkup

540
00:32:16,376 --> 00:32:19,667
I did feel his finger twitching
in my lower body

541
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,709
How long did the lower body checkup last?

542
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:23,501
I don't remember

543
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,209
You remember the nurse left for 5 minutes...

544
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,042
but not how long the checkup lasted?

545
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:28,167
About one minute then

546
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,834
I'm actually quite curious

547
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:32,376
If Dr Zhou really molested you,

548
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:34,417
why hadn't you told the nurse

549
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,709
or Ms Law at once?

550
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:38,959
I was scared. I didn't dare to say anything

551
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,751
You didn't know how a lower body checkup

552
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,376
should feel like

553
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,542
You couldn't tell body checkup

554
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:47,209
from molestation

555
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:50,417
Your Honor, Ms Li said she could feel it,

556
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,126
but she actually didn't know

557
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:54,167
Dr Zhou was only using a cotton swab

558
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:54,959
No!

559
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,792
He was using his finger!

560
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,501
to extract secretions for laboratory tests

561
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,042
It wasn't his finger as she has claimed

562
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:01,709
No!

563
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:03,751
This is the cotton swab used by the defendant

564
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,126
to extract secretions from her

565
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:08,251
Your Honor,

566
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,584
I have no further questions

567
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:23,459
Ms Li...

568
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,501
Don't push...

569
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,042
Many people are supporting him now.

570
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,417
How do you feel?

571
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,626
Everybody, please calm down...

572
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:32,042
Please get out of my way...

573
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:35,917
Ms Li
Please step aside...

574
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,292
How's the situation outside?

575
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:41,501
The cars of the TV reporters
are still out there

576
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:42,917
Where's Jane Li?

577
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,709
She seems to be shocked by the reporters

578
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,126
Have a word with her

579
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:48,167
It's Tim

580
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:52,751
Hello?

581
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:55,251
Be prepared during this period

582
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,251
Those reporters will come out of nowhere

583
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:01,167
I fear that might affect
the kids taking lessons

584
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:02,709
Don't think too much

585
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,501
You have behaved very bravely

586
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,167
I don't want to press charges anymore

587
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:17,959
Don't worry

588
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,626
I will claim justice for you

589
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,501
So sorry for troubling you

590
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,584
Don't think like that

591
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,667
We shouldn't condone people like that

592
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,126
What's so scary?

593
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,251
Treat the reporters as your students

594
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:36,709
Everyone is striving to ask you questions

595
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,959
But sorry,

596
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,584
the teacher only teaches nice kids

597
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,001
Ms Li, I need to talk to Yan. Thank you

598
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,126
Sure

599
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,001
Is she feeling better?

600
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,959
She's fine. Let's see

601
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,709
Ming Jun

602
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:42,542
I need to pick Tina up at school

603
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,167
This is it

604
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:57,626
Come in

605
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,251
How pretty

606
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,126
Whenever I'm tired,

607
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:15,167
I'll pick a postcard

608
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:17,459
Then I'll close my eyes

609
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,584
and imagine I'm on a trip for a few seconds

610
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,626
I wish I had the chance

611
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,584
to visit every single place

612
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:28,459
Every single place?

613
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:31,792
Isn't it too greedy?

614
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:32,709
No...

615
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:33,917
Please take a seat

616
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,834
It's good to dream

617
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,001
What's your dream?

618
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,667
To see my son grow up healthily

619
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,084
Look

620
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,167
Tim was there too

621
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,167
My wife had a premature labor

622
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,917
I was at court at that time

623
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:00,626
So he drove them to the hospital

624
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:18,876
Ms Li gave you this

625
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:36,959
Good morning

626
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,126
See you at court

627
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:41,959
Good luck!

628
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,501
Second Trial

629
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,751
The Defense calls Dr Mandy Wu,

630
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,042
Senior Lecture of Gynecology

631
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,292
A female full body checkup

632
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:55,292
normally includes the lower body,
unless individual subjects refuse

633
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,417
When examining the lower body,

634
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:00,251
a doctor will

635
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:02,501
extract secretions
from the sex organ for lab tests,

636
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,542
in order to check if there are abnormalities

637
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,542
or granular objects on the sex organ

638
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:12,042
which could be benign or malignant tumors

639
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:13,042
This is very important

640
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,751
So during the checkup as described,

641
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:17,876
the subject could have twitching

642
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,834
sensations in her lower body?

643
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:24,292
Some women,
especially if it's their first checkup,

644
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,334
or if they have no sexual experience,

645
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:29,459
might be oversensitive,
uncomfortable or resistant

646
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,501
So would the subject misunderstand that

647
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:34,959
the doctor is trying to violate her?

648
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:37,876
That's the worst nightmare

649
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,376
of most male doctors

650
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,167
Such misunderstanding

651
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,959
can ruin their reputation

652
00:38:44,126 --> 00:38:45,209
Who would dare to see them again?

653
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:49,292
Mrs Zhou,

654
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,709
what's your opinion of Mr Zhou?

655
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,209
He's a good man

656
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,126
A 100% good man

657
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,209
He is very conscientious at work

658
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:00,709
and he takes good care of the family

659
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,626
He loves me and our daughter

660
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:06,334
On the day of the incident, at 18:38,

661
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:08,251
did you telephone Mr Zhou?

662
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:09,542
I did

663
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:10,584
What did he say?

664
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,292
He said he had just finished the checkup

665
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:16,042
He asked me to wait for him for dinner

666
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:19,209
During your telephone conversation,

667
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:20,292
did you hear

668
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:23,001
or feel anything exceptional?

669
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:26,042
Like the sobbing sounds of a female

670
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:29,292
No! Exactly the same as usual

671
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:34,042
The defendant never lies to you, right?

672
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,417
Right

673
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:39,209
He says frankness is paramount in a marriage

674
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,876
During the ten years
from your first date till now,

675
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:42,959
has the defendant

676
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,667
had affairs with other women?

677
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,876
Certainly not

678
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:48,709
Do you believe he's secretly

679
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,292
dated other women?

680
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:51,876
I don't believe

681
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:54,459
Do you believe he's secretly dated Jane Li?

682
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,334
Certainly not

683
00:39:56,209 --> 00:40:00,459
This is the defendant's SMS record

684
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,584
The items with the stars

685
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,417
are the SMS texts
the defendant sent to Jane Li

686
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:07,584
I'm going to read aloud the content

687
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,501
"It's your birthday next week.

688
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:12,126
Can I take you out for dinner?"

689
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,834
You haven't said a word since the court

690
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:32,376
What's going on?

691
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:34,917
Nothing

692
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:40,001
What's on your mind?

693
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,459
Nothing

694
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:44,709
Something is obviously on your mind

695
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:47,084
Do you doubt me?

696
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:48,376
No

697
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:51,709
Then why are you upset?

698
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:54,209
If you were me, you'd be upset too

699
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,626
Are you bored with me?

700
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:02,834
So leisurely?

701
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,709
The court will start in 30 minutes

702
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,876
You better think of a way to beat me

703
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:19,084
Beating you or not doesn't matter

704
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,251
I only want Winston Zhou to get his dues

705
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,167
Your judgement is a bit premature

706
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,251
You know there are lots of holes

707
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,084
in the evidence

708
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:32,834
If this drags on,

709
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,667
Jane Li will only suffer more

710
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,709
Don't hold me responsible then

711
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,667
You should tell your client

712
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,209
It's only because he wouldn't plead guilty

713
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,542
that Jane Li is suffering so much

714
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:50,334
Everyone has the right to make his own choice

715
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:53,876
See you at court

716
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:00,501
I, Winston Zhou,

717
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:03,959
honestly swear and affirm

718
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:07,376
that the evidence I give shall be the truth,

719
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:10,501
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth

720
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:15,584
Third Trial

721
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:16,667
Dr Zhou,

722
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,751
during Ms Li's body checkup,

723
00:42:21,084 --> 00:42:21,959
did you feel

724
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,667
any exceptional moves on her part?

725
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:25,959
After I finished her body checkup,

726
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,417
she suddenly grabbed my hand

727
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,126
The laboratory report will be ready in 2 days

728
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:36,667
Grabbed your hand? What was your reaction?

729
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,376
It was too sudden

730
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:40,626
So I did not react

731
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:43,042
Meaning her behavior

732
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:44,834
was totally unexpected

733
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:45,292
Correct?

734
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:46,167
Yes

735
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,126
On Ms Li's birthday,

736
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,292
did you send her an SMS asking

737
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:52,876
to take her out?

738
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:55,001
Yes

739
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:56,626
Why did you do that?

740
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,751
She told me she had no company
on her birthday

741
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:04,334
It just happened that I was free that day

742
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,167
I pitied her spending her birthday alone,

743
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,834
so I asked her out

744
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:12,501
But you did not mention this to anyone?

745
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:14,667
Including your wife?

746
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:15,792
No

747
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:18,542
Because it didn't work out in the end

748
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,084
I would have asked my wife

749
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:22,459
and daughter to join

750
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:24,876
I understand

751
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:26,667
That's why you asked her out

752
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,876
It's only out of goodwill

753
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:30,084
Right

754
00:43:31,126 --> 00:43:33,834
And also your compassion for her

755
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:35,417
You can say that

756
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,084
Hmm...

757
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:39,501
Mr Zhou

758
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:43,251
Besides at home
and when giving her rides home,

759
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:44,709
have you met Ms Li

760
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,292
in other occasions?

761
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:49,459
My clinic is closed to her piano store

762
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:52,709
I had lunch with her several times

763
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:54,417
Did you take the initiative?

764
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:55,501
Yes

765
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:56,042
Why?

766
00:43:57,292 --> 00:44:00,417
She's lonely and sad.
I felt like taking care of her

767
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:03,167
So did you have affection for Ms Li?

768
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:03,792
No

769
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:05,376
Then why did you have dates with her alone?

770
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:07,209
You didn't even tell your wife

771
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:09,167
You have dates with someone
you're not fond of?

772
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:11,251
Objection, Your Honor!

773
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:12,834
The adjective "fond"

774
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,459
is too general

775
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,751
Please allow the defendant to explain

776
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,001
Objection sustained

777
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:20,084
The defendant please explain

778
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,042
Because she's an excellent piano teacher

779
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:27,584
and she loved my girl,

780
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,209
so I took care of her

781
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,626
I absolutely had no affection for her

782
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,334
Do you think she had affection for you?

783
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:35,042
I mean the amorous kind

784
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:39,209
I had suspected that, but I wasn't sure

785
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:41,084
because she would give me little gifts

786
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:42,292
What little gifts?

787
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:49,292
Little handicrafts: origami roses

788
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:52,251
She also gave Tina similar gifts

789
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,292
If you said Tina also had these origami gifts,

790
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:56,709
why do you think Ms Li had affection for you?

791
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,042
Could it be...

792
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,209
a subjective projection of your own?

793
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:01,126
No

794
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,417
If as you've said,

795
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:04,001
Ms Li was truly fond of you

796
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,084
Did you ever feel tempted?

797
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:07,251
Objection!

798
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,917
The question calls for speculation

799
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:15,334
Objection overruled

800
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:17,917
The defendant must answer the question

801
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:25,501
No

802
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:26,959
Absolutely no

803
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:30,042
Mr Zhou,
I really don't understand your mentality

804
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:31,876
You said Ms Li had affection for you

805
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,917
and you also knew she trusted you very much

806
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,376
You are a doctor,

807
00:45:35,876 --> 00:45:37,501
but in the absence of any nursing staff,

808
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,042
you gave her a body checkup

809
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,834
and touched her private parts
during the process

810
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:44,417
Even if you did not break the law, I believe

811
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:46,417
you've violated
a doctor's professional conduct

812
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:49,209
Did you intentionally take advantage of her?

813
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:49,917
Objection!

814
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:50,917
I did not.
I did not have ulterior motives for her

815
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:51,834
Objection!
Do you like Jane Li?

816
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:52,542
Objection!

817
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,834
I have never liked Jane Li
Objection!

818
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,376
Your Honor,

819
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:58,001
the prosecutor is imposing
his views on the witness

820
00:45:58,376 --> 00:45:59,834
If he keeps answering his own questions,

821
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,917
the witness will be rendered superfluous

822
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:03,584
Prosecutor,

823
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:05,751
please mind your questioning style

824
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:11,167
Did you ask Ms Li

825
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:14,542
to have a checkup at your clinic?

826
00:46:15,501 --> 00:46:16,542
Mr Winston Zhou,

827
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:18,084
please answer my question

828
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:28,542
She said she did not feel well,

829
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,959
so I asked her to
have a body checkup at my clinic

830
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:33,334
I was just being kind...

831
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:35,084
That's OK, I was only asking
I'm a doctor

832
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,709
if you took the initiative
This is my profession

833
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:37,501
Perhaps you did not intend to

834
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,209
It's my work

835
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,376
molest Jane Li
I did not

836
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:40,626
But you did all these things

837
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:42,376
only to create
an opportunity to get close to her

838
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:44,001
Absolutely not true
Finally you made it

839
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:45,751
I did not. I had no desire for her

840
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:46,751
A last question

841
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,251
If you are innocent,

842
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:50,292
why should Ms Li ruin your reputation?

843
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:02,709
Tim...

844
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:04,626
Oftentimes, we have intuitions

845
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,459
But this time...

846
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:10,626
What's the problem?

847
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:14,459
By going through this trial,

848
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:16,751
the victim has
to constantly revisit the incident,

849
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,626
with much of her private life exposed

850
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:20,667
To the victim,

851
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:22,959
it's almost a mental torture

852
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,917
Many people would have quitted

853
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:26,584
Why do you think Jane Li

854
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,126
can persevere?

855
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,084
Why?

856
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:35,584
I noticed she had a moment of hesitation

857
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:36,751
When?

858
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:37,751
When you asked Winston Zhou

859
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:40,126
why Jane Li would ruin his reputation.

860
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,417
Have you ever doubted
if Zhou could be innocent?

861
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,042
This time you're not like your usual style

862
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,334
Your intuition is totally
biased towards Jane Li

863
00:47:52,876 --> 00:47:53,876
Don't you want to help her also?

864
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:56,417
Don't you want to find out who's guilty?

865
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:59,417
I don't want you to win a case

866
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:01,584
at your own cost

867
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:04,126
I'm very clear what I'm doing

868
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:19,792
I'm back

869
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:23,667
Barrister Chen? Let's have dinner together

870
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:29,292
Why are you back?

871
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:30,667
Why are they here?

872
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:32,709
Didn't you say
you're not coming back tonight?

873
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:34,876
That's why I invited them over for dinner

874
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,084
What's wrong?

875
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:40,959
Ms Li,

876
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,251
we should minimize
our contact during the trial

877
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,459
It's not your problem

878
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:48,292
But as the prosecutor, I need to avoid this

879
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,167
You want me to pack a doggy bag for you?

880
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:53,167
I'll give you a lift

881
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:54,876
Never mind
Thank you

882
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,084
We can go back ourselves

883
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,084
OK...

884
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,209
It's pouring outside

885
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,459
Let Megan drive you back

886
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:02,042
Let me help you

887
00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:03,167
OK

888
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,251
I'll start the car first

889
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:09,626
Wait here a little bit

890
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:11,084
Come down in ten minutes

891
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,042
I'll go first

892
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:13,084
OK

893
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:19,959
I'm sorry to disappoint you...

894
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:21,667
I just want what's best for you

895
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,209
Oh, the car keys!

896
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:28,959
I'll give them to her

897
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,042
Please have a word with her

898
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:35,834
She's under a lot of pressure. Please

899
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:00,501
This is for you

900
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,584
Thanks

901
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:08,792
The one last time...

902
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,209
Is it still here?

903
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,751
It's in my briefcase

904
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,792
Put the two together

905
00:50:17,001 --> 00:50:18,417
They will give you blessings

906
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:20,626
Do you know?

907
00:50:20,626 --> 00:50:23,917
Your perseverance
is very important in this case

908
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:26,209
If we win the case,

909
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:29,334
what will happen to me?

910
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:32,626
The criminal will be punished by law

911
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:36,959
How about me? What will happen?

912
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,251
Of course, you can live the life you want

913
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,959
But in fact,

914
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:49,584
my original life...

915
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:53,417
is not what I want either

916
00:50:57,292 --> 00:51:00,501
I don't want to be stuck
in the room in the shop

917
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,792
I wish I could be like you guys

918
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:09,876
and could see the real world outside

919
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,917
Sergeant Li found me Jane's hospital records

920
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,584
when she broke her legs in an accident

921
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:35,126
I also investigated the orphanage
where she stayed

922
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,084
I suspect she changed her name

923
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:38,167
but I'm not sure

924
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:39,751
What does it have to do with this case?

925
00:51:40,626 --> 00:51:43,001
Jane Li never talks about her past

926
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:46,792
I'm afraid Xue might challenge her integrity

927
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:51,042
I'll take a look

928
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:58,876
There's another thing I want to say

929
00:51:58,876 --> 00:51:59,667
Go ahead

930
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:04,042
I think Jane Li has somehow indicated

931
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:05,501
to Zhou

932
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:09,667
that she totally trusted him

933
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,001
That's why he suggested the checkup

934
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:16,126
Zhou was like you right now,

935
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:18,542
always protecting Jane Li's interests

936
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:25,751
Thank you for your intuition

937
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:28,334
But that's all speculation on your part

938
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,126
Closing Submissions

939
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:58,167
"Are you the light that shines into darkness,

940
00:53:58,251 --> 00:53:59,292
offering rebirth through pain?"

941
00:54:07,084 --> 00:54:09,376
"Will you be my guardian angel?"

942
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:25,959
Your Honor,

943
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:28,334
in this case,

944
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:29,751
Mr Zhou

945
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:32,042
was Ms Li's employer and doctor

946
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:35,126
And yet he still indecently assaulted her

947
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:38,667
He had obviously abused her trust in him

948
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:41,292
During the course of this trial,

949
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:43,042
it's beyond doubt

950
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:45,251
Mr Zhou had affection for Ms Li

951
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,042
Being alone together
under these circumstances,

952
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:51,042
and with the physical
contacts during the checkup,

953
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:53,584
it's quite likely

954
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:56,167
the defendant had violated Ms Li

955
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:58,251
As a result of this trial,

956
00:54:58,542 --> 00:55:01,501
Ms Li had to undergo huge media pressure

957
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:03,459
And yet she persisted in her charges

958
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:06,126
not in search of compensation

959
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:07,042
or profit,

960
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:08,834
but for the sole intention

961
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:11,126
to uphold the integrity

962
00:55:11,126 --> 00:55:12,251
of a disabled woman

963
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:13,459
I hereby

964
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:16,042
request Your Honor

965
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:18,292
to find the defendant guilty as charged

966
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,292
Thank you

967
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:27,917
Your Honor,

968
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:31,251
this case is simply
a case of misunderstanding

969
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:34,792
Ms Jane Li is socially inexperienced

970
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:37,167
and physically impaired

971
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,626
She was unfamiliar with the normal
procedure of a body checkup

972
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:44,001
and mistook the defendant's goodwill...

973
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:46,209
for indecent assault

974
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:47,501
In fact,

975
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:50,251
the defendant is a professional doctor

976
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,917
He was only doing his job

977
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:53,917
However, this case

978
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:56,584
has ruined the defendant's reputation,

979
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:59,292
having brought tremendous blow to his family

980
00:55:59,876 --> 00:56:02,584
I believe Your Honor is crystal clear

981
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:05,542
that throughout the course of this trial,

982
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:09,126
neither police findings
nor witnesses' testimonies

983
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:11,001
can attest to the fact

984
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:12,209
that the defendant

985
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:14,626
did in fact indecently assault Ms Li

986
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:17,167
The defendant
must have the benefit of the doubt

987
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:19,084
I request Your Honor

988
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,792
to find the defendant not guilty

989
00:56:32,459 --> 00:56:33,209
Will the defendant please rise?

990
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:41,209
Upon consideration of the evidence submitted

991
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:42,584
and the closing arguments of both sides

992
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,292
the Court is convinced

993
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:47,917
the defendant's hand
did touch the plaintiff's sensitive area

994
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:50,376
The question boils down to who was active

995
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:51,626
and who was passive

996
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:53,042
The Court agrees that

997
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:55,084
the evidence provided by the Prosecution

998
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:58,709
proves the defendant
indecently assaulted Ms Li

999
00:56:58,876 --> 00:57:01,876
He being her employer and doctor

1000
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,834
still conducted such a vile act

1001
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:07,167
was clearly a breach of her trust

1002
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:10,751
The Court finds
the defendant guilty as charged

1003
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:12,417
He shall be remanded in prison immediately

1004
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:15,626
pending a psychiatric assessment
before sentencing

1005
00:57:15,626 --> 00:57:16,584
Court!

1006
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:50,833
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you,

1007
00:57:51,126 --> 00:58:01,125
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you,

1008
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:05,626
Tina, happy birthday! Make a wish

1009
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:09,209
I wish daddy will come back soon

1010
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:12,376
He will be back soon

1011
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:22,876
The report on Jane Li's name change

1012
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,209
I read it today

1013
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:28,751
You read it after the trial?

1014
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:34,167
Have I made a mistake?

1015
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:38,459
I don't know

1016
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:43,542
The goal of the law
is to protect people, right?

1017
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:45,417
Right

1018
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:47,042
To protect people

1019
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:49,667
Not only to determine who is right

1020
00:58:50,209 --> 00:58:51,292
and who is wrong

1021
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:53,876
Also to protect people from being hurt

1022
00:58:54,126 --> 00:58:56,001
You mean if Jane Li had lost,

1023
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:58,084
she would have been deeply hurt

1024
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:03,792
Dr Zhou might also be seriously hurt

1025
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,542
Have you thought about it?

1026
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:15,292
Did you make all these origami roses?

1027
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:16,667
Yes

1028
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:21,626
Is that your handwriting?

1029
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:25,501
Did you write on the roses

1030
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,334
you gave Zhou?

1031
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:29,667
What did you write?

1032
00:59:34,459 --> 00:59:35,584
Don't touch!

1033
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:41,667
"Dr Zhou,

1034
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:44,084
I've been missing your smiles"

1035
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:51,792
Look at me...

1036
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:53,792
You look at me!

1037
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,209
As a matter of fact,

1038
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:00,251
you're in love with Winston Zhou, right?

1039
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:02,959
Frankly speaking,

1040
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:06,042
did Winston Zhou molest you?

1041
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:16,334
You must believe me

1042
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:21,834
You have to believe me

1043
01:01:18,584 --> 01:01:20,376
Hello?

1044
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,834
Speaking

1045
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:41,917
Dad...

1046
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:45,459
We didn't expect he would depart so suddenly

1047
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:47,626
But it was a peaceful departure

1048
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:50,501
These are his relicts

1049
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:43,709
I really hated your guts

1050
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:49,167
Since I was little,

1051
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:52,292
you'd told me...

1052
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:55,834
a good lawyer...

1053
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:59,459
should uphold justice

1054
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:03,459
I've believed you

1055
01:03:05,459 --> 01:03:07,084
and have taken you as my role model

1056
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:11,126
But did you accomplish that?

1057
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,417
You didn't!

1058
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:20,167
Because of you,

1059
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:23,959
I've been trying all along...

1060
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:27,584
to find the answer for justice,

1061
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,251
to prove to you that

1062
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:35,251
the woman who died because of you

1063
01:03:36,042 --> 01:03:38,001
in that case you had taken...

1064
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:40,751
was your fault!

1065
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:47,626
But at this moment,

1066
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:52,251
I hate myself even more

1067
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,667
I can give other people

1068
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,709
a chance to explain,

1069
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:05,584
but...

1070
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:10,501
I never gave you even a single chance

1071
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:20,417
Did you have any predicaments?

1072
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:25,251
Because now I realize

1073
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:31,459
I'm just how you had been.

1074
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:37,584
Dad,

1075
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:44,209
can you tell me?

1076
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,084
How's Tina?

1077
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:36,917
Not bad

1078
01:05:38,126 --> 01:05:40,709
I'm looking for a new school for her

1079
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:44,292
You think she will know?

1080
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:46,917
From the get-go till now,

1081
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:50,167
she's never asked a single question

1082
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:57,667
Are you really appealing?

1083
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,334
Will you support me?

1084
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:09,501
I will

1085
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:13,126
We will support you

1086
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:16,376
But...

1087
01:06:17,626 --> 01:06:18,959
can the case really be overturned?

1088
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,626
I'm really innocent

1089
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:24,084
Tina and I are innocent too

1090
01:06:33,126 --> 01:06:34,542
You support me

1091
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:36,292
because of this family

1092
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:39,292
or you really believe me?

1093
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:53,417
"Jaywalking Girl

1094
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:54,501
Knocked down by Mini Bus"

1095
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,334
Upon consideration
of the new evidence submitted,

1096
01:07:11,876 --> 01:07:13,334
the Court agrees

1097
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:14,917
to reopen the case

1098
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:17,459
for the interest of justice

1099
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:29,792
What happened?

1100
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:32,584
Your car broke down?

1101
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:34,667
Let me have a look

1102
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:47,334
You haven't tuned your car for a while?

1103
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:50,001
You car is dead

1104
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,667
Better call a tow truck

1105
01:07:58,209 --> 01:07:59,042
Hey

1106
01:08:00,626 --> 01:08:02,626
Are you in a hurry? I can give you a lift

1107
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:04,876
I'm good

1108
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:08,709
By the way,

1109
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,459
do you believe Winston Zhou?

1110
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:19,417
What? You think that matters?

1111
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:22,292
You don't have a conscience?

1112
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:25,167
Why are you so nave?

1113
01:08:25,751 --> 01:08:27,917
You were once a defense counsel too

1114
01:08:28,626 --> 01:08:29,709
You had to believe it every time

1115
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,667
you sought justice for your clients?

1116
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:34,876
I just want to know the truth

1117
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:37,709
Do you really know the rules of the game, huh?

1118
01:08:38,459 --> 01:08:40,167
Who do you think you are?

1119
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:42,959
You think you can save the world
by assuming moral high ground?

1120
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:44,376
Let me tell you

1121
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:46,876
You won last time not because you were good

1122
01:08:47,126 --> 01:08:49,376
You were simply aided by social bias

1123
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:52,167
You know what?

1124
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:56,001
Your biggest error
is not your moral high ground

1125
01:08:57,251 --> 01:08:59,709
but the fact that you're in the wrong field

1126
01:09:03,626 --> 01:09:05,126
You want the truth?

1127
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:08,459
During the course of the trial, you were seen

1128
01:09:08,459 --> 01:09:10,751
maintaining regular private
contacts with Jane Li

1129
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:13,292
On the night before the closing arguments,

1130
01:09:13,501 --> 01:09:15,334
you even visited her in the piano shop

1131
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,251
A prosecutor cannot contact

1132
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:20,292
the victim privately

1133
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:23,334
I don't know how intimate
you are with Jane Li

1134
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:24,542
But it was around midnigh,

1135
01:09:24,584 --> 01:09:26,667
I don't think you went to the piano shop

1136
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:31,001
to take piano lessons!

1137
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:34,501
Take care

1138
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:41,167
Court!

1139
01:09:53,376 --> 01:09:54,626
Your Honor,

1140
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:58,667
over the past year, Ms Li

1141
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:02,126
has been giving origami roses

1142
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:04,209
to the accused, Dr Zhou.

1143
01:10:04,876 --> 01:10:06,292
She even wrote messages

1144
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:08,084
on the folded paper

1145
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:11,542
Please examine Exhibit D16.

1146
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:14,834
It is clearly written on the paper

1147
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,417
"You smiled at me 5 times today"

1148
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,501
Now Exhibit D17

1149
01:10:25,834 --> 01:10:28,084
She wrote on another folder paper

1150
01:10:28,626 --> 01:10:30,626
"Have you used the same water cup

1151
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:33,251
I used at your place?"

1152
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:39,792
Ms Li, please confirm

1153
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:42,459
whether it's your handwriting or not

1154
01:10:43,084 --> 01:10:43,751
Yes

1155
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:48,167
So were you in love with Dr Zhou?

1156
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:49,792
No

1157
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:53,792
So who did

1158
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,126
you take Dr Zhou for?

1159
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:58,584
A student's father

1160
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:00,126
Would you write such sweet

1161
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:02,959
nothings to a student's father?

1162
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:04,334
Would you sent flowers with innuendos

1163
01:11:04,376 --> 01:11:06,626
to a student's father?

1164
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,376
Whether you admit it or not,

1165
01:11:10,584 --> 01:11:11,751
these roses betrayed

1166
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:14,126
your affection for Dr Zhou

1167
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:16,792
But that doesn't mean
the affection was reciprocal

1168
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:18,251
In fact, on the day of the body checkup,

1169
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:21,251
Dr Zhou rejected your manifestation of love

1170
01:11:21,251 --> 01:11:24,626
You were so embarrassed that

1171
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:26,792
you turned around and accused the defendant!

1172
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:27,376
Objection!

1173
01:11:27,459 --> 01:11:27,959
Am I correct?

1174
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:29,709
Objection! The question is leading

1175
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,126
Objection overruled

1176
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:33,917
No

1177
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,209
No further questions

1178
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,209
Ms Li

1179
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:55,876
to like someone

1180
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:59,209
doesn't mean he can molest you, right?

1181
01:12:04,876 --> 01:12:07,167
What is the chance of our appeal?

1182
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:09,334
Depends on how much you could sacrifice

1183
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:11,501
What do you mean?

1184
01:12:16,126 --> 01:12:18,917
The truth about you and Jane Li

1185
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:21,876
Dr Zhou,

1186
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,376
How did you deal with

1187
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:25,792
Ms Li's affection for you?

1188
01:12:26,501 --> 01:12:28,834
Why didn't you tell your wife?

1189
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:33,417
I didn't take it seriously

1190
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,334
I couldn't stop her

1191
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,084
from liking me

1192
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:41,501
I didn't tell my wife

1193
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:43,501
as I did not think

1194
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,542
it would affect our relationship

1195
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:48,417
Mr Zhou,

1196
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,626
does a woman without sexual experience

1197
01:12:50,917 --> 01:12:51,959
need to have lower body checkup

1198
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:53,584
so soon?

1199
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:56,626
Many young women have similar checkup

1200
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,001
There's nothing wrong

1201
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,959
Your Honor,

1202
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,001
there are many kinds of gynecological checkup

1203
01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:07,667
Mr Zhou invited Ms Li

1204
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:08,667
to his clinic for body checkup...

1205
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:09,751
Objection!

1206
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:13,417
There's no specific timing regarding

1207
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:15,042
when a woman should take a body checkup

1208
01:13:15,251 --> 01:13:17,501
The Prosecution's question

1209
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:18,709
is argumentative

1210
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,126
Objection sustained

1211
01:13:21,084 --> 01:13:22,209
Please proceed

1212
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:30,251
Your Honor,

1213
01:13:30,417 --> 01:13:32,542
the Defense calls Qian Liu as its 4th witness

1214
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:35,792
The one subpoenaed, right?

1215
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:37,167
Yes

1216
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:58,084
I, Qian Liu, honestly

1217
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,126
swear and affirm

1218
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:04,167
that the evidence I give shall be the truth,

1219
01:14:04,751 --> 01:14:06,876
the whole truth,

1220
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,959
and nothing but the truth

1221
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:11,751
Ms Liu

1222
01:14:12,376 --> 01:14:14,584
Are you Jane Liu's biological mother?

1223
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,334
Yes

1224
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,959
When did you send her

1225
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:19,626
to the orphanage?

1226
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:21,667
When she was ten

1227
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,376
Why when she was ten?

1228
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,417
Did something happen?

1229
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:28,042
I used to rely on my mother
to take care of her

1230
01:14:28,251 --> 01:14:30,167
Then my mother died

1231
01:14:30,792 --> 01:14:32,334
I tried to take care of her myself

1232
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:34,667
but I simply could not do it

1233
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:36,209
How about Jane Li's father?

1234
01:14:39,084 --> 01:14:40,876
You don't know where he was?

1235
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:43,334
Or you don't know who he was?

1236
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:46,459
When I was pregnant with her, I was but 18

1237
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:49,292
I was too young, too nave

1238
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:52,167
I was reckless, so I wasn't sure

1239
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,292
Do you know she had an accident

1240
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:57,751
after you sent her to the orphanage?

1241
01:14:57,751 --> 01:14:58,792
I do

1242
01:14:59,209 --> 01:15:01,792
Please describe the accident

1243
01:15:02,584 --> 01:15:05,667
The orphanage said she was assaulted

1244
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:09,334
Her legs were hurt during her escape

1245
01:15:09,876 --> 01:15:13,042
You mean sexually assaulted?

1246
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,459
Yes

1247
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,042
Did Jane Li tell you who raped her?

1248
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:20,334
The dean told me

1249
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:23,126
It was a male nurse

1250
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:24,501
Did anyone call the police?

1251
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:29,251
As far as I know, they didn't.

1252
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:34,501
Supposedly the male nurse had left

1253
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:37,459
After this incident,

1254
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:40,126
did you find Jane Li to be any different?

1255
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:42,542
I heard from the orphanage that

1256
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,667
she was scared of men

1257
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:46,334
Your Honor,

1258
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,334
I have a psychiatric report of Jane Li

1259
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,001
conducted after her incident

1260
01:15:52,084 --> 01:15:53,917
The report clearly stated that

1261
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,959
the assault brought fear

1262
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:58,626
and insecurity to Ms Li

1263
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:02,001
It'd create difficulty
when she interacts with the opposite sex

1264
01:16:02,209 --> 01:16:03,626
During intimate contact,

1265
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:06,792
it could trigger her earlier trauma

1266
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,334
and evoke a feeling of sexual assault

1267
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:11,959
This report also mentioned that

1268
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:14,251
Jane Li had a low self-esteem

1269
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:16,084
She lacked confidence

1270
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:19,917
She yearned and feared of intimacy
at the same time

1271
01:16:21,584 --> 01:16:24,126
Therefore, the men she has met

1272
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:25,834
did not actually assault her

1273
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,417
But what once happened to her

1274
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:29,251
would create faux feelings for her

1275
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:32,001
She is unable to determine what is real

1276
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:34,126
and what is not

1277
01:16:34,584 --> 01:16:35,376
Ms Liu...

1278
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:36,876
I'd like to ask you

1279
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,376
After your daughter had been assaulted,

1280
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:40,501
did she receive any checkup

1281
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:42,292
that would alleviate her fear?

1282
01:16:43,584 --> 01:16:46,417
There's none that I know of.

1283
01:16:46,876 --> 01:16:47,959
Never?

1284
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:49,792
Did she still live

1285
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:51,084
in the orphanage afterwards?

1286
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:53,167
When she's 18,

1287
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:54,917
she left the orphanage

1288
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:57,459
I've never heard from her again

1289
01:16:57,626 --> 01:16:58,876
He did not violate me at all

1290
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:06,959
He did not violate me at all

1291
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:10,667
The Prosecution
has no questions for the witness

1292
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,792
The Prosecution wishes to call Ms Jane Li

1293
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:14,376
for supplementary testimony

1294
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:15,334
Objection!

1295
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:17,792
The Prosecution has rested already

1296
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,334
The prosecutor

1297
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:20,834
should be experienced enough

1298
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,042
to know his request is contrary
to normal legal proceedings

1299
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:22,876
I understand

1300
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:24,584
But the testimony provided by Ms Liu

1301
01:17:24,834 --> 01:17:27,084
about Ms Li's experience in the orphanage

1302
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:29,209
and her mental state are all hearsay

1303
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:32,334
Isn't it better to ask Ms Li directly?

1304
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:35,417
I thus request Your Honor
to use your discretion

1305
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:37,667
to let the Prosecution call Ms Jane Li

1306
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:40,417
to shed light on the truth of the events

1307
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:41,417
Your Honor...

1308
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:44,167
All right, I agree for now

1309
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:46,667
Ms Liu, you can step down

1310
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:03,626
Ms Li,

1311
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:07,626
based on Ms Liu's descriptions just now,

1312
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:09,126
I would like to ask

1313
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:11,251
if you were sexually assaulted

1314
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,417
by a male nurse at the orphanage

1315
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:17,959
I'll ask you one more time

1316
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:21,834
Is it true a male nurse sexually
assaulted you

1317
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:23,792
at the orphanage?

1318
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:30,001
Given enough time, doesn't a lie...

1319
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:32,209
become the truth?

1320
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,001
But in reality, is it true

1321
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,792
or not?

1322
01:18:39,084 --> 01:18:41,542
Nurse Yip did not assault me at all

1323
01:18:41,876 --> 01:18:43,709
It's her man who raped me.

1324
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,959
You are referring to?

1325
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:57,459
That night...

1326
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,667
her man

1327
01:19:03,209 --> 01:19:04,876
entered my room

1328
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,334
He whispered in my ears

1329
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:15,001
that he loved me very much

1330
01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:18,209
and began to kiss me

1331
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:23,001
I thought he loved me

1332
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,917
Then he began to touch my breasts

1333
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:32,626
I kept crying

1334
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:36,834
I said no to him

1335
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:41,917
and then I felt an intense pain

1336
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:45,209
I told him it hurt, it hurt...

1337
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:48,917
It hurt so much...no!

1338
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:58,917
I saw my mother standing at the door...

1339
01:19:58,917 --> 01:20:00,334
looking at me

1340
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:17,209
Why didn't you help me?

1341
01:20:21,126 --> 01:20:22,834
Why didn't you help me?

1342
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:25,292
Why could the man stay

1343
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:26,251
after this vile act?

1344
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:28,376
Why should I be punished?

1345
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:32,709
Why?
Sorry...Sorry!

1346
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:35,959
Mom didn't want this happen too
Why?

1347
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:37,209
To protect you,

1348
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:38,292
I sent you to the orphanage

1349
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,626
No more excuses!

1350
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,126
It's true!

1351
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:42,834
Don't say you were protecting me!

1352
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:44,417
Sorry

1353
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:47,292
You simply didn't want me!

1354
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:49,167
I had to face it myself

1355
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,334
while you and that man lived

1356
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:54,042
as if nothing had happened

1357
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:00,667
Also...

1358
01:21:01,376 --> 01:21:03,584
why can't I accuse anyone of sexually assault?

1359
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:05,834
Because you said

1360
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:08,292
I could not feel it!

1361
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:15,626
True

1362
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:21,001
I really couldn't feel anything

1363
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,792
I want to feel it too!

1364
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:29,959
I want to feel it like you all!

1365
01:21:29,959 --> 01:21:32,376
I also want to walk!

1366
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:35,209
Why can't I do that?

1367
01:21:35,751 --> 01:21:38,084
Why can you live a normal life?

1368
01:21:38,084 --> 01:21:39,584
Why can't I?

1369
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,876
Why can you all lie and find excuses?

1370
01:21:42,876 --> 01:21:44,667
Why can't I?

1371
01:21:44,751 --> 01:21:47,959
Why can you find love but not I?

1372
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:51,459
I'm always alone!

1373
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:03,792
Why am I deprived of love?

1374
01:22:17,751 --> 01:22:21,417
This is Ms Li's medical report that year

1375
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:26,584
After the accident,
she's hospitalized for a year

1376
01:22:27,584 --> 01:22:30,251
She was first diagnozed
with general paralysis

1377
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:32,959
But after continuous efforts,

1378
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:35,751
she finally managed to move her upper body

1379
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:42,626
Then she continued to exercise her legs

1380
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,667
But one day

1381
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:47,042
the doctor told her to give up hope

1382
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:52,084
Who could truly understand

1383
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,459
the psychological trauma
she had gone through?

1384
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:58,834
Abandoned by her family, Jane Li

1385
01:22:59,334 --> 01:23:01,459
did not only lose a pair of legs

1386
01:23:02,876 --> 01:23:04,751
but her hope for the future

1387
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:08,501
She has persevered till today

1388
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:11,126
I am very much convinced,

1389
01:23:12,584 --> 01:23:13,667
as long as everybody,

1390
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:14,834
including herself

1391
01:23:14,876 --> 01:23:16,834
who can give herself a chance,

1392
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:20,042
she will definitely see her future

1393
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:34,042
Mr Xue, any further questions?

1394
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:57,167
"Private and Confidential"

1395
01:23:58,251 --> 01:23:59,542
Your Honor,

1396
01:24:05,334 --> 01:24:06,501
I have no further questions

1397
01:24:30,417 --> 01:24:32,251
I'm sorry

1398
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:07,834
It's not common for attorneys to shake hands,

1399
01:25:09,417 --> 01:25:11,376
but I'm glad to have met you in this case

1400
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:13,584
So am I

1401
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:46,959
"Live life without regrets"

1402
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,065
