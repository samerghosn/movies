1
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,919
- Well, it was a fine meal.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

2
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:48,584
Yes, what should we do now?

3
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:52,428
- Let's have lunch.
- Oh, good idea.

4
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,468
Quiet down, you villains.

5
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:57,094
I'm being stolen.
Help me, help me!

6
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,034
Put me down!

7
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,834
Hello.

8
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,811
What about my nose?

9
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,014
Banana peels coming down!

10
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:21,348
Come along, ladies.
Here's a nice Christmas turkey.

11
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:24,192
Turkey.
Get your Christmas turkey.

12
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:27,495
Hey, get back in the box, Martin!

13
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:31,469
Get your boomerang fish.
Guaranteed fresh.

14
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:35,531
Throw the fish away
and it comes back to me.

15
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,372
Get 'em while they're fresh.

16
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,536
- Christmas apples.
- We got Macintosh.

17
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,581
- Christmas apples.
- Red Delicious.

18
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,548
Tuppence apiece, while they last.

19
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,814
We... They won't last long
the way you're eating them.

20
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm creating scarcity.
Drives the prices up.

21
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,657
Rizzo...

22
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:55,626
Hello. Welcome to
the Muppet Christmas Carol.

23
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,424
I am here to tell the story.

24
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,259
And I am here for the food.

25
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:01,129
My name is Charles Dickens.

26
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,192
And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

27
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,967
Wait a second,
you're not Charles Dickens.

28
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,267
I am, too.

29
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,332
A blue furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

30
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,537
Absolutely.

31
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:14,409
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

32
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:15,710
A genius.

33
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,579
You are too kind.

34
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,552
Why should I believe you?

35
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,215
<i>Because I know the story of A Christmas
Carol like the back of my hand.</i>

36
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,486
- Prove it.
- All right.

37
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,925
There's a little mole on my thumb.

38
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:31,486
And a scar on my wrist
from when I fell off my bicycle...

39
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:34,501
No, don't tell us your hand,
tell us the story.

40
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,661
Oh, thank you. Yes.

41
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,864
The Marleys were dead,
to begin with.

42
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,135
The... Pardon me?

43
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,938
That's how the story begins,

44
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,410
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

45
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:47,913
As dead as a doornail.

46
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:51,382
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

47
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:54,147
- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

48
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,986
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

49
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:01,461
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

50
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,623
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

51
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:05,997
- Where?
- There.

52
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:08,161
- When?
- Now.

53
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:13,562
There he is,
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

54
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:20,945
Say, is it getting cold around here?

55
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,218
<i>When a cold wind blows,
it chills you</i>

56
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,280
<i>Chills you to the bone</i>

57
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:33,849
<i>But there's nothing in nature
that freezes your heart</i>

58
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,920
<i>Like years of being alone</i>

59
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:38,795
<i>It paints you with indifference</i>

60
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,199
<i>Like a lady paints with rouge</i>

61
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,704
<i>And the worst of the worst,
the most hated and cursed</i>

62
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:46,104
<i>Is the one that we call Scrooge</i>

63
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:48,608
<i>- Unkind as any
- And the wrath of many</i>

64
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:50,701
<i>This is Ebenezer Scrooge</i>

65
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:55,717
<i>There goes Mr. Humbug
There goes Mr. Grim</i>

66
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,411
<i>If they gave a prize for being mean</i>

67
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,578
<i>The winner would be him</i>

68
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,680
<i>Old Scrooge, he loves his money</i>

69
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:05,522
<i>'Cause he thinks it gives him power</i>

70
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:11,622
<i>If he became a flavor
You can bet he would be sour</i>

71
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,964
Even the vegetables don't like him.

72
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:20,163
<i>There goes Mr. Skinflint
There goes Mr. Greed</i>

73
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:25,305
<i>The undisputed master
of the underhanded deed</i>

74
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,438
<i>He charges folks a fortune</i>

75
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:30,211
<i>For his dark and drafty houses</i>

76
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,616
<i>Us poor folk live in misery</i>

77
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:36,179
<i>It's even worse for mouses</i>

78
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:39,783
Please, sir, I want some cheese.

79
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,421
<i>He must be so lonely</i>

80
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:44,795
<i>He must be so sad</i>

81
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:49,632
<i>He goes to extremes
to convince us he's bad</i>

82
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:52,195
<i>He's really a victim</i>

83
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:54,673
<i>Of fear and of pride</i>

84
00:06:54,742 --> 00:07:00,375
<i>Look close and there must be
a sweet man inside</i>

85
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,673
- Nah.
- Uh-uh.

86
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,185
<i>There goes Mr. Outrage</i>

87
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:07,720
<i>There goes Mr. Sneer</i>

88
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,019
<i>He has no time for friends or fun</i>

89
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:12,219
<i>His anger makes that clear</i>

90
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:17,060
<i>Don't ask him for a favor
'cause his nastiness increases</i>

91
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,693
<i>No crust of bread for those in need</i>

92
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,635
<i>No cheeses for us "meeces"</i>

93
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:24,433
Scrooge liked the cold.

94
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,771
He was hard and sharp as a flint.

95
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,674
Secret and self-contained.

96
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,905
As solitary as an oyster.

97
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,278
<i>There goes Mr. Heartless</i>

98
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,543
<i>There goes Mr. Cruel</i>

99
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,178
<i>He never gives
He only takes</i>

100
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,448
<i>He lets his hunger rule</i>

101
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:45,323
<i>If being mean's a way of life
you practice and rehearse</i>

102
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,863
<i>Then all that work is paying off</i>

103
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,591
<i>'Cause Scrooge is getting worse</i>

104
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:55,329
<i>Every day, in every way
Scrooge is getting worse</i>

105
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:58,197
- Oh, boy.
- How the time flies.

106
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:00,208
Look at this, I've got to move...

107
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,443
Humbug.

108
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:15,419
Phew! What an unpleasant fellow.

109
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,894
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scroo...

110
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:23,430
Boy, this really is a dirty city.

111
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,865
Ha. You tellin' me.

112
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:32,267
Thank you for making me
a part of this.

113
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,277
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scrooge.

114
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:40,440
A squeezing, wrenching,
grasping, clutching...

115
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,813
covetous old sinner.

116
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,482
Bob Cratchit?

117
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,750
Yes, Mr. Scrooge?

118
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:49,553
Who is this?

119
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,251
Mr. Applegate, sir.

120
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,955
He's here to speak to you
about his... mortgage.

121
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,363
Mr. Scrooge,
I know you're very angry about this,

122
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,956
and I didn't mean to
fall behind in the payment.

123
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:01,401
Lord knows,
it being Christmas and all.

124
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,564
Please don't shout at me, sir.

125
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,666
That and, of course, little Gwen.
Her lungs aren't right.

126
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:09,006
The doctor takes his share, don't he?

127
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:11,171
You can yell and scream,
and you're right,

128
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,011
but it won't do no good...

129
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:15,744
because I'm the stone
you can't squeeze blood from.

130
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:18,081
And that's the truth!

131
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:20,452
Thank you for not shouting at me.

132
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:23,390
17... 42...

133
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,918
Let us deal with the eviction notices
for tomorrow, Mr. Cratchit.

134
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:28,827
Uh...

135
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,366
Tomorrow's Christmas, sir.

136
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:34,234
Very well, you may gift wrap them.

137
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:36,795
Let us help you with that,
Mr. Cratchit.

138
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,137
My, there are certainly a lot today.

139
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,198
We'll get it.

140
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,507
I'm okay, okay.

141
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,512
- Here you go.
- Look out on that end...

142
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,615
- Uh...
- Whoa!

143
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,148
Christmas is a very busy time for us,
Mr. Cratchit.

144
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:56,453
People preparing feasts, giving parties.

145
00:09:56,526 --> 00:10:00,055
Spending the mortgage money
on frivolities.

146
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,827
One might say that December
is the foreclosure season.

147
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:08,305
Harvest time for the moneylenders.

148
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,896
- Boss, ask him.
- Tell him.

149
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:13,205
- Come on. Come on.
- Do it now. Do it.

150
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:16,143
If you please, Mr. Scrooge,
it's gotten colder.

151
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:19,944
The bookkeeping staff would like to have
an extra shovel of coal for the fire.

152
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:23,043
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Our pens are like ink-cicles.

153
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,951
Our assets are frozen.

154
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:28,822
How would the bookkeepers
like to be suddenly unemployed?

155
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,724
Heat wave!

156
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:34,250
This is my island in the sun!

157
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:37,665
I, I believe you've convinced them
once again, Mr. Scrooge.

158
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:43,669
At that moment,
who should arrive at the door

159
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:47,836
but Scrooge's nephew, Fred.
His only living relative.

160
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,403
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

161
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,042
Hello? Uncle?

162
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,243
Rizzo?

163
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:59,755
You're very good at that, Mr. Dickens.

164
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:03,088
A merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.
God save you.

165
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,753
Merry Christmas?

166
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,093
Bah. Humbug!

167
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,155
Quick, it'll be warmer in there.

168
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:17,000
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean that, surely.

169
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,100
Actually, I think it's colder in here.

170
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:22,077
Merry Christmas, you say?
What right have you to be merry?

171
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:23,637
You're poor enough.

172
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,876
And you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

173
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,110
He's got him.
The old boy's speechless.

174
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:30,244
If I could work my will,

175
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,484
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

176
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,388
would be cooked with his own turkey

177
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,519
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

178
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,426
Well, not quite speechless.

179
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:41,988
- Uncle...
- Nephew.

180
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,935
You keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

181
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:49,940
Christmas is a loving,
honest and charitable time.

182
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:53,535
And though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,

183
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,342
I believe Christmas has done me good
and will do me good,

184
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,074
and I say, God bless it.

185
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:03,852
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

186
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,094
Now, in these times,
it was customary on Christmas Eve

187
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,856
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses,

188
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:15,627
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

189
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,324
Mr. Scrooge, I presume?

190
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,032
Who are you?

191
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:25,803
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

192
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,675
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

193
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,680
Ah! Welcome!

194
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,342
This jolly old gentleman here
is Mr. Scrooge.

195
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,785
He's very generous to charities.

196
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,377
My dear nephew!

197
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:40,517
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

198
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,891
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

199
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:47,522
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

200
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,862
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

201
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,596
Oh. Excellent.

202
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,466
For a moment, I was worried.

203
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:57,805
Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

204
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,275
What might I put you down for?

205
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,368
Nothing.

206
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,507
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

207
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,642
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

208
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,812
That certainly is true.

209
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,922
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

210
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,545
That is certainly not true.

211
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:15,251
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

212
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,784
Sadly, I do, Uncle.
So I shall make my donation.

213
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,491
And leave you to make yours.

214
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,296
Thank you so very much.

215
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:27,532
Oh, Uncle, come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

216
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,438
Why ever did you get married?

217
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,532
Why? Because I fell in love.

218
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,977
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

219
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,916
It's no use, I shall keep
my Christmas humor to the last.

220
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:43,421
A merry Christmas to you.
And a happy New Year.

221
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,890
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

222
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,289
Humbug!

223
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,290
Ahem.

224
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,534
Now, then, sir, about the...

225
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,302
donation.

226
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,874
Well, now.

227
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:07,672
Let's see.

228
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,905
I know how to treat the poor.

229
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:15,420
My taxes go to pay for the prisons
and the poorhouses.

230
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,250
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

231
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,917
If they'd rather die,
then they'd better do it,

232
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,984
and decrease the surplus population.

233
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,723
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

234
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,700
This is the door, you may use it.

235
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,633
All right, Beaker, come along.

236
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,639
I think we've taken enough
of Mr. Scrooge's time.

237
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,609
Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

238
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,341
17... 24... 58.

239
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,473
<i>Good King Wencelas looked out
on the Feast of Stephen</i>

240
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,749
<i>Though the snow lay round about,
deep and crisp and even</i>

241
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,620
<i>Brightly shone the moon
that... night,</i>

242
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,283
<i>Though... the...</i>

243
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:59,761
- What do you want?
- Uh... Penny for the song, guvnor?

244
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,596
Wh... Ow!

245
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,372
17... 24...

246
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:31,191
Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge,
but it appears to be closing time.

247
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:36,529
Very well. I'll see you
at eight tomorrow morning.

248
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,135
Ask him, ask him.

249
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,003
Um... Tomorrow's Christmas.

250
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,372
8:30, then.

251
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,842
If you please, sir,

252
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,813
half an hour off hardly seems customary
for Christmas Day.

253
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:50,817
- No.
- Hardly customary.

254
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,648
How much time off is customary,
Mr. Cratchit?

255
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,316
Um... Why, um, the, er, whole day.

256
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,255
- Yeah, that's right.
- The whole day.

257
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,691
The entire day?

258
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,785
- No.
- That's the frog's idea.

259
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,957
If you please,
why open the office tomorrow?

260
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,525
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

261
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:13,061
It'll waste a lot of expensive coal
for the fire.

262
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,302
- That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.

263
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,108
It's a poor excuse for picking
a man's pocket every December the 25th.

264
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,181
But as I seem to be
the only person around who knows that...

265
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,184
...take the day off.

266
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,926
Will you stop that?

267
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,323
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

268
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,004
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

269
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,700
- Okay.
- You bet. First thing.

270
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,170
With their employer gone at last,

271
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,874
Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers
immediately began

272
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:59,784
that most pleasant of activities,
the celebration of Christmas.

273
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,822
He's gone!

274
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:05,222
Gentlemen, let's close up for Christmas.

275
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,029
<i>There's magic in the air this evening</i>

276
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,224
<i>Magic in the air</i>

277
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,063
<i>The world is at her best, you know</i>

278
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,570
<i>When people love and care</i>

279
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:22,098
<i>The promise of excitement
is one the night will keep</i>

280
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:27,113
<i>After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas</i>

281
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:39,891
<i>The world has got a smile</i>

282
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,953
<i>Today, the world has got a glow</i>

283
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,829
<i>There's no such thing as strangers</i>

284
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,923
<i>When a stranger says hello</i>

285
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,527
<i>And everyone is family</i>

286
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,903
<i>We're having so much fun</i>

287
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:57,911
<i>After all, there's only one
more sleep till Christmas</i>

288
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,209
Okay, ready. Here we go.

289
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,622
That's it. Ha! Ha!

290
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:20,691
Mm-hm.

291
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,898
Very good, gentlemen.

292
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:31,268
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly and joyous</i>

293
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:35,683
<i>With a burst of pleasure,
we feel it arrive</i>

294
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:41,746
<i>It's a season
when the saints can employ us</i>

295
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:46,694
<i>To spread the news about peace
and to keep love alive</i>

296
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:47,989
What's that?

297
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:51,033
Look, it's the penguins'
Christmas skating party.

298
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:09,811
- Hmm. Ah.
- Look at that!

299
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,418
You did good, boss.

300
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:21,519
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

301
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,002
Wow!

302
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:30,299
- No way.
- Come on, Rizzo.

303
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,300
Boy.

304
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,145
Fun, huh?

305
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,515
Merry Christmas, penguins.

306
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:48,187
<i>There's something in the wind today</i>

307
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:50,850
<i>That's good for everyone</i>

308
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,451
<i>Yes, faith is in our hearts today</i>

309
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,759
<i>We're shining like the sun</i>

310
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,492
<i>And everyone can feel it</i>

311
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,658
<i>The feeling's running deep</i>

312
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:05,729
<i>After all, there's only
one more sleep till Christmas</i>

313
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:09,904
<i>After all, there's only one more sleep</i>

314
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:14,542
<i>Till Christmas Day</i>

315
00:20:14,618 --> 00:20:16,607
Merry Christmas!

316
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:38,333
Scrooge lived in chambers
which had once belonged

317
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:41,503
to his old business partners,
Jacob and Robert Marley.

318
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,602
- Have some bread?
- Not while I'm working.

319
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,647
Suit yourself.

320
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:49,674
The building was a dismal heap of brick
on a dark street.

321
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:53,017
Once again, you must remember
that the Marleys were dead

322
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,852
- and decaying in their graves.
- Yeuch!

323
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,155
That one thing
you must remember,

324
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,662
or nothing that follows
will seem wondrous.

325
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,254
Why are you whispering?

326
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:04,527
- It's for dramatic emphasis.
- Oh.

327
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,033
Shh.

328
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:31,257
Jacob Marley?

329
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,390
You okay?

330
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:50,776
Humbug.

331
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:56,251
Oh. Gonzo, speak to me.

332
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,154
I mean, Mr. Dickens.
Charlie! Are you hurt?

333
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:03,386
To say that Scrooge
was not startled would be untrue.

334
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,896
Still, the moment had passed,
and the world was as it should be.

335
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:09,522
He ain't hurt.
Didn't even break his concentration.

336
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:11,328
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

337
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,802
Come on, Rizzo.
We'll follow him in.

338
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:22,470
In a minute.
I had a bag of jelly beans over here.

339
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,274
Will you just get over here?

340
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:26,508
- All right.
- Sheesh.

341
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,078
Oh-oh.

342
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:32,948
Steady, steady.

343
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:35,492
Scrooge made his way up the stairs,

344
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,549
caring not a button for the darkness.

345
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:40,187
Darkness was cheap,
and Scrooge liked it.

346
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:46,098
<i>But the incident at the door
had made Scrooge wary.</i>

347
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,502
<i>Before he shut himself in for the night,
he searched his rooms.</i>

348
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:53,007
<i>- Okay, that does it.
- Pardon?</i>

349
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:55,341
How do you know
what Scrooge is doing?

350
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,607
We're down here and he's up there.

351
00:22:57,682 --> 00:23:01,449
I keep telling you, storytellers
are omniscient. I know everything.

352
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,419
Hoity-toity, Mr. Godlike Smarty-Pants.

353
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,750
To conduct a proper search,
Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.

354
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:14,225
How does he do that?

355
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:49,056
Agh!

356
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:58,372
Oh.

357
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,842
It's my best dressing gown.

358
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:07,309
No harm done.

359
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:23,388
Look, it's Ebenezer Scrooge.

360
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:26,192
Looking older and more wicked
than ever.

361
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,322
I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.

362
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:34,264
Who are you?

363
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,307
In life, we were your partners,

364
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,640
- Jacob...
- And Robert Marley.

365
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:41,839
It looks like you.

366
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,849
- But I don't believe it.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

367
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:49,044
Because a little thing
can affect them.

368
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,613
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

369
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:56,559
You may be a bit of undigested beef.
A blob of mustard.

370
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:58,424
A crumb of cheese.

371
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:02,126
Yes, there's more of gravy
than of grave about you.

372
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,931
More of gravy than of grave?

373
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:10,033
What a terrible pun.
Where do you get those jokes?

374
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:12,270
Leave comedy to the bears, Ebenezer.

375
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:18,271
Please, Jacob, Robert,
don't criticize me.

376
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,115
You always criticized me.

377
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:22,018
We were always heckling you.

378
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:24,021
It's good to be heckling again.

379
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,251
It's good to be doing anything again.

380
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,990
Why do you come to me?

381
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:34,965
<i>We're Marley and Marley
Avarice and greed</i>

382
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:39,767
<i>We took advantage of the poor,
just ignored the need-y</i>

383
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,242
<i>We specialized in causing pain,
spreading fear and doubt</i>

384
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,610
<i>And if you could not pay the rent,
we simply threw you out</i>

385
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:53,043
There was the year
we evicted the entire orphanage.

386
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,319
I remember the little tykes
all standing in the snowbank.

387
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,223
With their little
frostbitten teddy bears.

388
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:08,335
<i>We're Marley and Marley
Our hearts were painted black</i>

389
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:10,995
<i>We should have known our evil deeds</i>

390
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,664
<i>Would put us both in shack-les</i>

391
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:18,006
<i>Captive, bound, we're double-ironed,
exhausted by the weight</i>

392
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:20,568
<i>As freedom comes from giving love</i>

393
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:22,978
<i>So prison comes with hate</i>

394
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,177
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

395
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,146
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

396
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:35,393
But my friends, you were not unfeeling
towards your fellow men.

397
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:38,727
True, there was something
about mankind we loved.

398
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,563
I think it was their money.

399
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:47,103
<i>Doomed, Scrooge
You're doomed for all time</i>

400
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:51,906
<i>Your future is a horror story
Written by your crime</i>

401
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:56,745
<i>Your chains are forged
by what you say and do</i>

402
00:27:56,816 --> 00:27:59,411
<i>So have your fun
When life is done</i>

403
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:01,317
<i>A nightmare waits for you</i>

404
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,656
Why these terrible chains?

405
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,421
The chains.

406
00:28:07,494 --> 00:28:11,520
We forged these chains in life
by our acts of greed.

407
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,726
You wear such a chain yourself.

408
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:16,563
Humbug. Speak comfort to me, friends.

409
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,105
Comfort!

410
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,838
You will be haunted by three spirits.

411
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,172
Haunted?
I've already had enough of that.

412
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,443
Without these visits, you cannot hope
to avoid the path we tread.

413
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:33,008
Expect the first ghost tonight,
when the bell tolls one.

414
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:35,452
Can't I meet them all at once
and get it over with?

415
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:38,650
When the bell tolls one!

416
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,718
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

417
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,594
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

418
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,527
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

419
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:55,432
Change!

420
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:10,952
And with that, the spirits of Scrooge's
partners vanished into the darkness,

421
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:15,826
leaving him once again
alone in his room.

422
00:29:15,896 --> 00:29:19,993
That's scary stuff. Should we be worried
about the kids in the audience?

423
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:22,501
No, it's all right. This is culture.

424
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,504
Jelly bean? I had them
in my pocket all along.

425
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,031
What?

426
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:41,753
Humbug.

427
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,686
Come on.

428
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:46,386
But I really hate this.

429
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,429
You wanted to know
what was happening.

430
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,932
Scrooge's bedchamber
is on this side of the house. Jump.

431
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,626
There's only two things
in this life I hate.

432
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:56,932
Heights, and jumping from them.

433
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,234
Too late now.
Come on, I'll catch you.

434
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:03,474
God save my little broken body.

435
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,882
Missed.

436
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,649
Wait a second.
I forgot my jelly beans.

437
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:15,781
Um...

438
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:24,725
What?

439
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,631
You can fit through those bars?

440
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:28,225
Yeah.

441
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:29,702
You are such an idiot.

442
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:31,705
What, what? Hey, what?

443
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:33,502
What?

444
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:35,099
What?

445
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:50,548
Oh, dear.

446
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,996
Scrooge slipped into the empty silence
of a dreamless sleep.

447
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,520
You know, a guy could break his tail
falling out of this tree.

448
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,590
Want to see what's going on, don't you?

449
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:02,795
- Yes.
- There's Scrooge's window.

450
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,668
Oh, yeah.

451
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:28,889
Expect the first ghost
when the bell tolls one!

452
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,429
Wow! Ouch.

453
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,189
Are you the spirit
whose coming was foretold to me?

454
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,489
I am.

455
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:04,056
But... you're just a child.

456
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:07,295
I can remember nearly 1,900 years.

457
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:10,534
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

458
00:32:10,608 --> 00:32:12,369
What business has brought you here?

459
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:15,137
- Your welfare.
- Huh.

460
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,874
A night's unbroken rest
might aid my welfare.

461
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:20,141
Your salvation, then.

462
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:22,912
Take heed. Come.

463
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,690
I beg you, spirit, I am mortal.
I'm liable to fall.

464
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,093
A touch of my hand, and you shall fly.

465
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:44,996
- What are we doing?
- Nothing.

466
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:46,701
- What?
- Just hold on.

467
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,940
- Watch out, Rizzo.
- What? Oh!

468
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,043
Whee!

469
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,516
Hello, London!

470
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,614
Goodbye, lunch!

471
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:05,319
Spirit?

472
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:07,221
Yes?

473
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,992
Nothing.

474
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,097
- Look, Rizzo.
- I don't want to look.

475
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:15,967
Spirit? What is that light?

476
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,405
It cannot be dawn.

477
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:21,772
It is the past.

478
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,542
Look, it's beautiful, Rizzo.

479
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,915
Mommy!

480
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:39,051
Hey, we're going down.

481
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:42,096
Hang on, Rizzo.

482
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,861
Sorry, madam.

483
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:46,868
Pardon me, sir.

484
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:48,767
Look out, Rizzo.

485
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,968
Rizzo, this is Louise.

486
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:56,035
Yeah, we've met.

487
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:09,817
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

488
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:12,293
That was the worst trip of my life.

489
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,727
It's over now.

490
00:34:13,797 --> 00:34:16,856
Yeah, safe at last.

491
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:18,690
No.

492
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:21,870
No. No! Oh, no!

493
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,338
Nice kitty, nice kitty.

494
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,433
Ow! I'm from New Jersey.

495
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:30,737
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

496
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:34,112
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

497
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:39,280
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

498
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:41,518
long, long forgotten.

499
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,685
It's my old school.

500
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:48,258
I was a boy here.

501
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,894
That's Henry.

502
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,234
And Edmund, my best friend.

503
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,930
Hello, boys. Hello.

504
00:34:57,006 --> 00:34:59,771
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

505
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,471
They can neither see nor hear you.

506
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,878
Come, let us go inside.

507
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,242
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

508
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,014
Save me, save me!

509
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:34,043
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

510
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:37,239
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

511
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:40,408
I know it all so well, spirit.

512
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:43,114
The desks.

513
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:46,381
The smell of the chalk.

514
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,986
I chose my profession in this room.

515
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,792
And is he, too, familiar?

516
00:35:56,769 --> 00:36:00,430
Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

517
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:02,972
oh, very well indeed.

518
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,504
Good heavens.

519
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,137
It's me.

520
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:12,648
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

521
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:15,014
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

522
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:17,419
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

523
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,551
I was often alone.

524
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,389
More time for reading... and study.

525
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:30,399
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

526
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:34,300
A time for... solitude.

527
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:39,807
Rats don't understand these things.

528
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:42,006
You were never a lonely child?

529
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,515
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

530
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,576
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

531
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:53,181
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

532
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:55,418
They were all very much the same.

533
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,624
Nothing ever changed.

534
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:01,790
You changed.

535
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:25,283
The years performed
their terrible dance.

536
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,521
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

537
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:33,759
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

538
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,663
What the... Hey!

539
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,722
Agh!

540
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:40,669
So, Master Scrooge, graduation day!

541
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:44,937
That's my old headmaster.

542
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,204
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

543
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,736
Stand up. Build your life
as this school was built.

544
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:51,874
Push!

545
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,941
My ear, my ear, my ear.

546
00:37:55,954 --> 00:38:01,052
Yes, work hard, work long,
and be constructive.

547
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:04,060
Ebenezer, life is a golden opportunity.

548
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:07,065
Today you go forth into the real world.

549
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:10,032
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

550
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:12,366
Work hard, lad. And one day,

551
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:15,431
your life will be as solid
as this very building.

552
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:19,936
Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

553
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:21,240
Yes, headmaster.

554
00:38:21,313 --> 00:38:26,376
Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

555
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:30,411
Today, you become a man of business.

556
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,480
I'm looking forward to it, headmaster.

557
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:34,992
You will love business.

558
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:37,324
It is the American way.

559
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:38,386
Sam?

560
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,933
Mmm?

561
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,564
Oh. It is the British way.

562
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:45,626
Good.

563
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:47,569
Yes, headmaster.

564
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,843
Oh, here is your coach, Ebenezer.

565
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:57,246
Come, Scrooge, there is much to see.

566
00:38:58,951 --> 00:39:00,943
Remember, don't tip the driver.

567
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:13,626
A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

568
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:17,796
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

569
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:21,034
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

570
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:24,598
Know it? My first job was here.

571
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:27,339
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

572
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:29,210
Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

573
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:34,345
night was falling, and the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

574
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:37,879
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

575
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,720
- My apologies.
- What are you doing?

576
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:42,024
Put me out, put me out!

577
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,529
- Rizzo!
- What?

578
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:51,165
Oh, oh, Th-th-th-thank you.

579
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:52,967
You're welcome.

580
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:58,072
There he is, old Fozziwig himself.

581
00:39:58,143 --> 00:40:01,806
Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

582
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:04,111
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

583
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:06,152
What an employer he was.

584
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:09,586
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

585
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,920
It's time for the party to begin.

586
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:14,618
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

587
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:16,388
Rizzo, come on.

588
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:19,628
Rizzo, just grab hold of the stick.

589
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,962
Merry Christmas.

590
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:24,028
Thank you, thank you.

591
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,304
Excuse me, everyone.
Can we have some quiet, please?

592
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:32,506
Whoa!

593
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,415
I suppose I should be grateful for that.

594
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:43,353
You're welcome.

595
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,622
Everyone, please,
can I have your attention for a moment?

596
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:50,993
Look, it's the Marley brothers.

597
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,192
My old partners, as they were as lads.

598
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,632
Can I have your attention, please?

599
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:01,205
Quiet!

600
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:04,642
Thank you.

601
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,339
That's better.

602
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:09,713
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

603
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:11,649
At this time in the proceedings,

604
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,551
it is a tradition
for me to make a little speech.

605
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:17,351
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

606
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,887
Uh, pay no attention to them.

607
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,988
My speech,
here is my Christmas speech.

608
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,627
"Thank you all
and merry Christmas."

609
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,795
- That was the speech?
- That was dumb.

610
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,599
- It was obvious.
- It was pointless.

611
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,835
It was short.

612
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,777
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance, Son!

613
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:44,318
Here's Mrs. Fozziwig to start the party.

614
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:46,912
- Way to go, Ma!
- Hit it, boys!

615
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,016
Hello.

616
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:56,391
Look, there's a buffet over here.
I'm kind of hungry.

617
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:04,597
<i>Fa-la la-la la
La-la la la</i>

618
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:08,607
Forget it. Mother always taught me,
never eat singing food.

619
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:13,413
A pleasure having you here.

620
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,075
I'm very pleased,
and please enjoy yourself.

621
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,674
Excuse me, Mr. Fozziwig?

622
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,812
Sir, I've been going over the accounts.

623
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:23,915
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

624
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:27,290
Master Scrooge, this is Christmas.

625
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:29,454
It's a time for generosity.

626
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,027
Stop working, enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people, go ahead.

627
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:36,228
Hello.

628
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:52,286
You dancing fool!

629
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:01,962
I love these annual Christmas parties.

630
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,463
I love them so much,
I think we'll do it twice a year.

631
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:05,829
Excuse me.

632
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,700
- Master Scrooge.
- Excuse me.

633
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:11,830
Belle, I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge,

634
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:14,307
the finest young financial mind
in the city.

635
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,775
Ebenezer, this is Belle,

636
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,835
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

637
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:20,904
I'm pleased to meet you.

638
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:25,681
Well, I'm glad you two finally met.

639
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:28,122
Do you remember this meeting?

640
00:43:29,457 --> 00:43:31,185
Remember?

641
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:34,284
Yes.

642
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:37,122
I remember.

643
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,259
There was, of course, another
Christmas Eve with this young woman,

644
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:43,667
some years later.

645
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:47,937
Oh, please,
do not show me that Christmas.

646
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:11,559
Another year
before our wedding, Ebenezer.

647
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:13,692
It can't be helped, Belle.

648
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,999
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

649
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,338
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

650
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,401
So you said last year.

651
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,175
Business continues to be poor.

652
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:30,545
You're a partner in your own firm now.

653
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,017
Barely clearing expenses.

654
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,491
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

655
00:44:38,861 --> 00:44:41,351
I love you, Belle.

656
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,298
You did, once.

657
00:44:57,999 --> 00:44:59,728
Oh, Rizzo.

658
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,338
Spirit, show me no more.

659
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,673
Why do you delight in torturing me?

660
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:14,269
I told you, these are the shadows
of the things that have been.

661
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:18,045
That they are what they are,
do not blame me.

662
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:20,106
Leave me.

663
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:45,670
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

664
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:50,701
And thus he remained, until the
nearby clock began to strike the hour.

665
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:52,812
Oh.

666
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,908
- Oh. Oh, what was that?
- Two o'clock.

667
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:58,417
- Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

668
00:45:58,486 --> 00:46:00,919
Oh, good, supper time.

669
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:09,886
Scrooge knew
the second of the ghosts was due.

670
00:46:09,962 --> 00:46:13,194
Yet now,
as the clock finished striking...

671
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,291
Nothing.

672
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:22,140
Come in, and know me better, man.

673
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:39,482
Come in, and know me better, man.

674
00:46:39,555 --> 00:46:42,354
- Did I already say that?
- You did.

675
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:45,222
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

676
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:49,698
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas.

677
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,700
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

678
00:46:53,768 --> 00:46:58,535
- You did.
- Come in, know me better, man.

679
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:00,767
You're a little absent-minded, spirit.

680
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:05,277
No, I'm a large
absent-minded spirit.

681
00:47:06,612 --> 00:47:09,549
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

682
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:13,449
And the now is Christmas.

683
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,249
I don't believe I've
ever met anybody like you before, sir.

684
00:47:17,322 --> 00:47:21,656
Really? Over 1,800 of my brothers
have come before me.

685
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:25,057
1,800? Lmagine the grocery bills.

686
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:34,833
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

687
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:41,206
Uh, in all honesty, spirit, no.

688
00:47:42,678 --> 00:47:45,612
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

689
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:49,706
Before this day is done,
you will understand.

690
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,752
Oh.

691
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,649
Oh, no! Oh, no!

692
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:59,288
We shall go out into the world.

693
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,563
I suppose you enjoyed that?

694
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,152
Of course.

695
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:15,797
May I welcome you
to Christmas morning?

696
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:28,319
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

697
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:30,978
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

698
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:34,146
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

699
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:36,714
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

700
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:39,487
<i>A cup of kindness
that we share with another</i>

701
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:42,291
<i>A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother</i>

702
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:45,389
<i>In all the places you find love</i>

703
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:48,332
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

704
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:52,838
<i>It is the season of the heart</i>

705
00:48:52,906 --> 00:48:55,773
<i>A special time of caring</i>

706
00:48:55,842 --> 00:48:59,572
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

707
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:04,446
<i>And it is the season of the spirit</i>

708
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:07,144
<i>The message if we hear it</i>

709
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:11,051
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

710
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:19,124
<i>It's in the giving of a gift
to another</i>

711
00:49:19,196 --> 00:49:21,994
<i>A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother</i>

712
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:25,157
<i>It's all the ways that we show love</i>

713
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:27,667
<i>That feel like Christmas</i>

714
00:49:27,737 --> 00:49:30,364
<i>A part of childhood
we'll always remember</i>

715
00:49:30,439 --> 00:49:33,137
<i>It is the summer
of the soul in December</i>

716
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:36,405
<i>Yes, when you do your best for love</i>

717
00:49:36,478 --> 00:49:39,675
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

718
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:43,773
<i>It is the season of the heart</i>

719
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:46,753
<i>A special time of caring</i>

720
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:50,917
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

721
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,949
<i>It is the season of the spirit</i>

722
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:57,860
<i>The message, if we hear it</i>

723
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:01,798
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

724
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,972
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

725
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,770
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

726
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,039
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

727
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:18,444
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

728
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:25,248
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

729
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,348
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

730
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:38,063
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

731
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:42,534
It feels like Christmas!

732
00:50:44,203 --> 00:50:50,973
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

733
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:55,775
Spirit, I had no idea.

734
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:59,875
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

735
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:06,012
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

736
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:08,023
Having Christmas with friends.

737
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:10,550
Hey, look. Fruit.

738
00:51:10,627 --> 00:51:13,722
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

739
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:15,787
- What now, my lovelies?
- A game, Fred.

740
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:18,026
Yeah, we must have a game at Christmas.

741
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,591
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games.

742
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,334
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

743
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:27,843
Oh, yeah,
I wondered about the texture. Yeuch!

744
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:31,036
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- Oh, wonderful game.

745
00:51:31,111 --> 00:51:34,173
Yah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

746
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,011
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

747
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,483
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

748
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,545
Is it vegetable?

749
00:51:41,622 --> 00:51:43,147
- No.
- Mineral?

750
00:51:43,224 --> 00:51:44,621
- No.
- Animal, then?

751
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,591
- What else?
- What else, indeed.

752
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,888
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

753
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:50,655
- In the city?
- Usually.

754
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,959
Does it pull a hansom cab?

755
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,556
Certainly not.

756
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:56,362
How about a dog?

757
00:51:56,435 --> 00:51:57,425
No.

758
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:58,627
- A cat?
- A cat?

759
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:02,038
- I said it first.
- No.

760
00:52:02,107 --> 00:52:04,665
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

761
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:06,936
- Often.
- A mouse?

762
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,236
- No.
- A rat?

763
00:52:08,311 --> 00:52:10,405
- You called?
- A cockroach.

764
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:11,469
No.

765
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,071
- A leech?
- It's too wonderful.

766
00:52:13,148 --> 00:52:16,141
Wait, I know.
An unwanted creature,

767
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:18,684
but not a rat, a leech,
or a cockroach?

768
00:52:18,753 --> 00:52:19,813
Then what?

769
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,219
- What?
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

770
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,280
Yes.

771
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,622
Wonderful.

772
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:29,391
That's a killer.

773
00:52:36,635 --> 00:52:39,606
Come, there is much to see.

774
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:42,642
No more. I wish to see no more.

775
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:49,447
Here.

776
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:51,812
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

777
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:54,544
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

778
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,316
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

779
00:52:57,389 --> 00:53:00,118
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

780
00:53:00,191 --> 00:53:02,318
and his sympathy for all poor men,

781
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:06,659
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

782
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:11,294
Goose. They're cooking goose down there.

783
00:53:12,868 --> 00:53:15,496
Rizzo, get out of the way.

784
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:17,765
Hey, don't be sweeping
the chimney now.

785
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,865
You're blocking the smell.

786
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:24,476
- This is Bob Cratchit's house?
- How do you know that?

787
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:26,637
You just told me.

788
00:53:26,713 --> 00:53:29,683
Hmm. Well, I'm usually trustworthy.

789
00:53:33,954 --> 00:53:36,922
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Cratchit, of course.

790
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:41,683
Ahh!

791
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:47,255
Peter, do not stop turning that spit.

792
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:50,527
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

793
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:55,005
- It smells so good, Mother.
- It does, doesn't it?

794
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:58,337
Oh. That smells wonderful.

795
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:00,875
Oh, good grief.

796
00:54:00,943 --> 00:54:03,071
Hey, I'm stuck, get me out of here.

797
00:54:03,147 --> 00:54:05,274
I knew you weren't suited
for literature.

798
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:11,985
Oh, at least I landed
on something soft.

799
00:54:12,054 --> 00:54:14,114
And hot! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

800
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:16,487
Hot, hot, hot!

801
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:19,486
Mother, Mother, Mother!

802
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:24,657
You said we couldn't eat the chestnuts
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

803
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:26,823
I wasn't eating them,

804
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,494
I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

805
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:33,540
It's a chef's thing, dear.
And do not shout, Betina.

806
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:36,632
- I'm Belinda.
- I'm Betina.

807
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:39,075
Of course you are, Betina.

808
00:54:39,144 --> 00:54:40,667
Belinda.

809
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:43,543
Whatever.

810
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,284
Huh?

811
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:57,316
<i>'Tis the season
to be jolly and joyous, fa la la</i>

812
00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:02,492
<i>With a burst of pleasure
we feel it arrive, fa la la</i>

813
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:07,367
<i>It's a season when the saints
can employ us, fa la la</i>

814
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:11,065
<i>To spread the news about
peace and to keep love alive</i>

815
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,807
Come on, son.

816
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:19,311
Let's go see if Christmas dinner
is ready yet.

817
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:21,473
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

818
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:27,816
Merry Christmas, everyone.

819
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,014
Daddy!

820
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,622
Merry Christmas, girls.

821
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:35,888
- Merry Christmas, Peter.
- Merry Christmas.

822
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,624
Children, children,
it's time to set the table.

823
00:55:38,697 --> 00:55:41,529
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

824
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,034
- Merry Christmas, Emily.
- Merry Christmas...

825
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:46,433
Crachy.

826
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:48,194
Emmy.

827
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:56,876
I fell down the chimney
and landed on a flaming hot goose.

828
00:55:56,948 --> 00:55:59,778
You have all the fun.

829
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:01,874
What?

830
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:04,577
Peter, the Christmas dinner.

831
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,588
The goose, the goose.

832
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:13,925
Oh, no, now, son,
you've gotten too excited.

833
00:56:13,994 --> 00:56:18,225
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

834
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:22,131
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

835
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:24,364
He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

836
00:56:24,438 --> 00:56:27,963
because it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day

837
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,135
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

838
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,202
A remarkable child.

839
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:38,581
With that,
the Cratchits came to what was surely

840
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:42,745
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

841
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,620
- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

842
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,756
I pay Bob such a small amount.

843
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:53,320
- Mr. Scrooge.
- Bob.

844
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:55,490
Bob Cratchit?

845
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:58,534
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

846
00:56:58,602 --> 00:57:01,398
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

847
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:04,734
The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

848
00:57:04,805 --> 00:57:08,673
If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

849
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:10,675
And I bet he would choke on it.

850
00:57:10,744 --> 00:57:13,213
- Choke!
- My dear, the children.

851
00:57:13,281 --> 00:57:14,508
Christmas Day.

852
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:19,040
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

853
00:57:19,118 --> 00:57:22,747
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

854
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:26,087
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

855
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,958
and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

856
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,485
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

857
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:39,834
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

858
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:40,894
No doubt.

859
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:42,269
Mm. Cheers.

860
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:47,675
God bless us, every one.

861
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:52,849
<i>Life is full of sweet surprises</i>

862
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:55,212
<i>Every day's a gift</i>

00:58:09,264 --> 00:58:12,494

<i>Bless us all</i>

869
00:58:15,301 --> 00:58:18,065
<i>Who gather here</i>

870
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:23,631
<i>The loving family I hold dear</i>

00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,616

00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:40,213
<i>That as we live</i>

876
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:46,127
<i>We always comfort and forgive</i>

877
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:48,459
<i>We have so much</i>

878
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:51,431
<i>That we can share</i>

879
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:56,733
<i>With those in need
we see around us everywhere</i>

880
00:58:56,806 --> 00:59:01,137
<i>Let us always love each other</i>

881
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:05,708
<i>Lead us to the light</i>

882
00:59:08,282 --> 00:59:13,616
<i>Let us hear the voice of reason</i>

883
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:16,713
<i>Singing in the night</i>

884
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:22,559
<i>Let us run from anger</i>

885
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,556
<i>And catch us when we fall</i>

886
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:35,566
<i>Teach us in our dreams
And please, yes, please,</i>

887
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,971
<i>Bless us, one and all</i>

888
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,606
<i>Bless us all</i>

889
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,148
<i>With playful years</i>

890
00:59:47,215 --> 00:59:52,745
<i>With noisy games and joyful tears</i>

891
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,722
<i>We reach for you</i>

892
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,759
<i>And we stand tall</i>

893
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:04,389
<i>And in our prayers and dreams
We ask you, bless us all</i>

894
01:00:04,465 --> 01:00:07,126
<i>We reach for you</i>

895
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,000
<i>And we stand tall</i>

896
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:15,507
<i>And in our prayers and dreams,
we ask you</i>

897
01:00:15,575 --> 01:00:19,600
<i>Bless us all</i>

898
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:29,342
Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

899
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,583
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

900
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:35,716
That is the future.

901
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:37,783
My realm is the present.

902
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:43,231
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

903
01:00:43,297 --> 01:00:45,631
And a crutch without an owner.

904
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:51,196
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

905
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,731
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

906
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:58,074
and decrease the surplus population.

907
01:00:58,147 --> 01:00:59,545
Oh, spirit.

908
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,741
As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

909
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:07,081
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

910
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:10,713
Come. My time grows short.

911
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:19,530
Spirit, do you grow old?

912
01:01:19,598 --> 01:01:22,156
I do.

913
01:01:24,401 --> 01:01:26,667
Are spirits' lives so short?

914
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:29,729
My time upon this globe is very brief.

915
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:36,042
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

916
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:37,978
One.

917
01:01:38,047 --> 01:01:42,812
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

918
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,718
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

919
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:48,984
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

920
01:01:49,056 --> 01:01:51,048
Five!

921
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:53,456
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

922
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:56,325
I think I must, in fact.

923
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:59,490
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

924
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,934
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

925
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:08,406
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

926
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,532
Must I?

927
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:15,376
Go forth, and know him better, man.

928
01:02:57,817 --> 01:03:01,845
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

929
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:12,118
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

930
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:16,694
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

931
01:03:16,766 --> 01:03:20,032
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

932
01:03:20,105 --> 01:03:23,937
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

933
01:03:24,808 --> 01:03:29,541
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

934
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:35,350
Will you not speak to me?

935
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:43,715
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

936
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:45,783
Lead on, spirit.

937
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:11,842
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

938
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,611
I only know he's dead.

939
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,849
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

940
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:21,219
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

941
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,920
I don't know or care why he's gone.

942
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:27,428
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

943
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,020
Wouldn't we all?

944
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,860
He didn't give it to me.

945
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,828
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

946
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:37,735
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

947
01:04:37,806 --> 01:04:40,137
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

948
01:04:40,207 --> 01:04:42,437
If lunch is provided.

949
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:47,044
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

950
01:04:50,382 --> 01:04:53,182
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

951
01:04:53,253 --> 01:04:56,279
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

952
01:05:11,736 --> 01:05:15,763
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

953
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,365
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

954
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:21,568
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

955
01:05:21,644 --> 01:05:23,942
What have you got for old Joe?

956
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:27,813
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

957
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:29,679
Joe, get off.

958
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:33,743
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

959
01:05:34,822 --> 01:05:37,052
Mother of pearl.

960
01:05:37,124 --> 01:05:39,888
No, I got his bed curtains.

961
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:43,020
Very fine damask.

962
01:05:43,096 --> 01:05:46,895
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

963
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:49,195
I've got his blankets.

964
01:05:49,268 --> 01:05:54,796
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

965
01:05:54,873 --> 01:05:58,467
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

966
01:05:58,543 --> 01:06:01,568
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

967
01:06:08,952 --> 01:06:10,578
I understand, spirit.

968
01:06:10,653 --> 01:06:14,020
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

969
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:16,752
My life turns that way now.

970
01:06:16,826 --> 01:06:18,817
Merciful heavens.

971
01:06:19,796 --> 01:06:23,322
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

972
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:26,764
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

973
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:37,208
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

974
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:39,712
Oh, yes, spirit.

975
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:41,770
A place of joy and laughter.

976
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:45,240
Thank you for bringing me here.

977
01:06:50,788 --> 01:06:53,086
It's so quiet.

978
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,827
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

979
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:16,709
Mother, you're crying again.

980
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,214
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

981
01:07:24,752 --> 01:07:26,743
Not Tiny Tim?

982
01:07:28,222 --> 01:07:32,624
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

983
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:36,060
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

984
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,394
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

985
01:07:38,465 --> 01:07:41,296
He should be back now.

986
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:46,201
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

987
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,399
Hello, my dears.

988
01:07:49,474 --> 01:07:50,600
Daddy.

989
01:07:53,045 --> 01:07:54,806
Hello, girls.

990
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:55,938
Hello, Peter.

991
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:59,346
Children, please go set the table.

992
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:01,280
Thank you.

993
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:02,943
How was the churchyard?

994
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,612
It will be lovely, Emily.

995
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:08,782
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

996
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:13,692
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

997
01:08:13,762 --> 01:08:16,596
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

998
01:08:16,665 --> 01:08:19,133
You can see the ducks on the river.

999
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,427
Tiny Tim...

1000
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:24,301
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

1001
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:32,877
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

1002
01:08:34,847 --> 01:08:36,839
How can we endure it?

1003
01:08:39,686 --> 01:08:41,949
It's all right, children.

1004
01:08:43,154 --> 01:08:45,520
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

1005
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,421
That is the way of it.

1006
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:51,721
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

1007
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:54,594
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

1008
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:33,325
Must we return to this place?

1009
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,030
There is something else
that I must know?

1010
01:09:39,103 --> 01:09:41,629
Is that not true?

1011
01:09:43,207 --> 01:09:46,575
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

1012
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:49,079
I fear to, but I must.

1013
01:09:50,381 --> 01:09:52,043
Who was the wretched man

1014
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:54,983
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

1015
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:09,963
Answer me one more question.

1016
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:12,499
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

1017
01:10:12,567 --> 01:10:15,230
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

1018
01:10:24,712 --> 01:10:27,043
These events can be changed.

1019
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,722
A life can be made right.

1020
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:04,739
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1021
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:07,645
Oh, please, spirit, no.

1022
01:11:07,716 --> 01:11:10,241
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

1023
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:15,353
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

1024
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:20,959
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

1025
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:27,931
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1026
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,767
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

1027
01:11:31,837 --> 01:11:35,170
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

1028
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,606
Spirit, please speak to me.

1029
01:11:59,662 --> 01:12:01,323
I'm home.

1030
01:12:04,899 --> 01:12:06,923
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

1031
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:10,300
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

1032
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,601
Hi, guys, we're back.

1033
01:12:12,673 --> 01:12:14,640
We promised we would be.

1034
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:17,199
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

1035
01:12:17,277 --> 01:12:19,267
was that his life lay before him.

1036
01:12:19,346 --> 01:12:21,438
And it could be changed.

1037
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:24,950
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1038
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:27,542
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

1039
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:30,213
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

1040
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:32,449
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

1041
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:33,785
On my knees.

1042
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:37,386
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

1043
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:40,088
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

1044
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:47,828
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

1045
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:51,236
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

1046
01:12:51,307 --> 01:12:54,036
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

1047
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:56,135
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

1048
01:12:56,212 --> 01:12:57,371
Yeah.

1049
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:03,014
You there, boy.

1050
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:04,609
What, me?

1051
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:07,985
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

1052
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,386
- What's today?
- Pardon?

1053
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,515
What's today, my fine fellow?

1054
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:15,289
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

1055
01:13:15,362 --> 01:13:16,886
It's Christmas Day?

1056
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:20,194
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

1057
01:13:20,266 --> 01:13:23,327
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

1058
01:13:23,402 --> 01:13:25,868
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

1059
01:13:25,937 --> 01:13:27,768
Know the poultry shop nearby?

1060
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:30,204
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

1061
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:32,766
A remarkable lad.

1062
01:13:32,844 --> 01:13:35,938
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

1063
01:13:36,014 --> 01:13:39,107
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

1064
01:13:39,182 --> 01:13:41,244
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

1065
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:43,751
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

1066
01:13:43,821 --> 01:13:46,914
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

1067
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,320
No, I'll give you five shillings.

1068
01:13:51,295 --> 01:13:52,522
Wow!

1069
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,392
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

1070
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,827
Um... Sorry.

1071
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:02,128
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

1072
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:06,070
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

1073
01:14:06,139 --> 01:14:09,541
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

1074
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:12,168
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

1075
01:14:12,245 --> 01:14:16,045
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

1076
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:18,208
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1077
01:14:18,282 --> 01:14:20,217
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1078
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:22,583
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1079
01:14:24,456 --> 01:14:26,252
Gee, thanks.

1080
01:14:26,323 --> 01:14:29,920
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

1081
01:14:29,995 --> 01:14:33,362
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

1082
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:36,556
Mr. Scrooge.

1083
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:39,227
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

1084
01:14:39,302 --> 01:14:41,098
you asked me for yesterday?

1085
01:14:41,171 --> 01:14:42,729
Put me down for...

1086
01:14:45,074 --> 01:14:46,200
That much?

1087
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,107
Not a penny less.

1088
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:51,169
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

1089
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:54,079
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

1090
01:14:54,148 --> 01:14:57,140
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

1091
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,652
A gift?

1092
01:15:04,725 --> 01:15:06,817
A gift for me?

1093
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:15,958
Thank you.

1094
01:15:16,668 --> 01:15:17,862
Thank you.

1095
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:22,133
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.
- Here's your turkey, Mr. Scrooge.

1096
01:15:22,206 --> 01:15:24,197
Follow me, lad.

1097
01:15:25,843 --> 01:15:28,334
<i>With a thankful heart,
with an endless joy</i>

1098
01:15:28,413 --> 01:15:30,879
<i>With a growing family
Every girl and boy</i>

1099
01:15:30,947 --> 01:15:33,415
<i>Will be nephew and niece to me</i>

1100
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:35,679
<i>Nephew and niece to me</i>

1101
01:15:35,752 --> 01:15:38,619
<i>Will bring love, hope,
and peace to me</i>

1102
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:40,814
<i>Love, hope, and peace to me</i>

1103
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:43,083
<i>Yes, and every night will end</i>

1104
01:15:43,157 --> 01:15:45,457
<i>And every day will start</i>

1105
01:15:45,527 --> 01:15:50,463
<i>With a grateful prayer
and a thankful heart</i>

1106
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:53,022
<i>With an open smile
and with open doors</i>

1107
01:15:53,099 --> 01:15:55,534
<i>I will bid you welcome
What is mine is yours</i>

1108
01:15:55,603 --> 01:15:58,036
<i>With a glass raised
to toast your health</i>

1109
01:15:58,105 --> 01:16:00,629
<i>With a glass raised
to toast your health</i>

1110
01:16:00,707 --> 01:16:03,140
<i>And a promise to share the wealth</i>

1111
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:05,474
<i>A promise to share the wealth</i>

1112
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:07,704
<i>I will sail a friendly course</i>

1113
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:10,079
<i>Follow a friendly chart</i>

1114
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:14,483
<i>On a sea of love
and a thankful heart</i>

1115
01:16:14,553 --> 01:16:16,952
<i>Life is like a journey</i>

1116
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,487
<i>Who knows when it ends?</i>

1117
01:16:24,894 --> 01:16:27,386
<i>Yes, and if you need to know</i>

1118
01:16:27,464 --> 01:16:29,897
<i>The measure of a man</i>

1119
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:34,097
<i>You simply count his friends</i>

1120
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:37,536
<i>Stop and look around you</i>

1121
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:42,370
<i>The glory that you see</i>

1122
01:16:44,845 --> 01:16:49,577
<i>Is born again each day
Don't let it slip away</i>

1123
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:53,484
<i>How precious life can be</i>

1124
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:42,019
<i>With a thankful heart
that is wide awake</i>

1125
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:44,496
<i>I do make this promise,
every breath I take</i>

1126
01:17:44,565 --> 01:17:47,295
<i>Will be used now to sing your praise</i>

1127
01:17:47,368 --> 01:17:49,562
<i>Used now to sing your praise</i>

1128
01:17:49,636 --> 01:17:52,196
<i>And to beg you to share my days</i>

1129
01:17:52,272 --> 01:17:54,569
<i>Beg you to share my days</i>

1130
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:56,835
<i>With a loving guarantee</i>

1131
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:59,275
<i>That even if we part</i>

1132
01:17:59,344 --> 01:18:02,871
<i>I will hold you close
in a thankful heart</i>

1133
01:18:04,249 --> 01:18:09,585
<i>I will hold you close
in a thankful heart</i>

1134
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,501
Bob Cratchit?

1135
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,577
So, here you are.

1136
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,670
M-M-M-Mr. Scrooge.

1137
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:44,245
You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

1138
01:18:44,318 --> 01:18:47,115
But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

1139
01:18:47,188 --> 01:18:49,450
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1140
01:18:49,522 --> 01:18:50,613
I?

1141
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:53,159
I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

1142
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:55,090
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

1143
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,924
I mean, yes, but you did.

1144
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:58,963
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

1145
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:01,796
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

1146
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:03,425
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

1147
01:19:03,502 --> 01:19:05,902
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

1148
01:19:05,972 --> 01:19:08,334
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

1149
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:12,240
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

1150
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:13,400
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

1151
01:19:13,477 --> 01:19:14,944
Yes, Bob.

1152
01:19:15,012 --> 01:19:16,673
Raise your salary.

1153
01:19:16,746 --> 01:19:19,682
And pay your mortgage
on this house.

1154
01:19:21,518 --> 01:19:23,417
Please, sir, come inside.

1155
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:24,749
Yes, yes.

1156
01:19:24,821 --> 01:19:28,152
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

1157
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:31,852
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1158
01:19:31,926 --> 01:19:33,917
Merry Christmas.

1159
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:46,471
And Scrooge
was better than his word.

1160
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:49,270
He did it all, and infinitely more.

1161
01:19:49,343 --> 01:19:51,242
And, er, Tiny Tim?

1162
01:19:51,309 --> 01:19:52,868
And Tiny Tim,

1163
01:19:52,947 --> 01:19:54,572
who did not die...

1164
01:19:54,646 --> 01:19:56,171
Isn't that swell?

1165
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:59,513
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

1166
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:02,246
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1167
01:20:02,321 --> 01:20:06,085
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

1168
01:20:06,157 --> 01:20:09,216
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

1169
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:11,659
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1170
01:20:11,729 --> 01:20:15,960
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

1171
01:20:16,031 --> 01:20:18,557
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

1172
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:21,603
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

1173
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:23,399
Every one.

1174
01:20:25,008 --> 01:20:28,272
<i>The love we found</i>

1175
01:20:28,342 --> 01:20:31,902
<i>The love we found</i>

1176
01:20:31,978 --> 01:20:34,504
<i>We carry with us</i>

1177
01:20:34,582 --> 01:20:38,678
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1178
01:20:39,688 --> 01:20:43,281
<i>The love we found</i>

1179
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:46,257
<i>The love we found</i>

1180
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,955
<i>The sweetest dream</i>

1181
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:54,327
<i>That we have ever known</i>

1182
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:57,300
Hey, say goodbye!

1183
01:20:58,504 --> 01:21:01,403
<i>The love we found</i>

1184
01:21:02,873 --> 01:21:04,864
Goodbye, goodbye.

1185
01:21:04,941 --> 01:21:09,379
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1186
01:21:10,313 --> 01:21:12,145
Nice story, Mr. Dickens.

1187
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:15,480
Thanks. If you like this,
you should read the book.

1188
01:21:15,552 --> 01:21:18,485
<i>It's in the singing
of a street corner choir</i>

1189
01:21:18,553 --> 01:21:21,148
<i>It's going home
and getting warm by the fire</i>

1190
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:24,317
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

1191
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:26,882
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1192
01:21:26,962 --> 01:21:29,657
<i>A cup of kindness
that we share with another</i>

1193
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:32,458
<i>A sweet reunion
with a friend or a brother</i>

1194
01:21:32,533 --> 01:21:35,559
<i>In all the places you find love</i>

1195
01:21:35,635 --> 01:21:38,934
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1196
01:21:39,004 --> 01:21:42,998
<i>It is the season of the heart</i>

1197
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:45,942
<i>A special time of caring</i>

1198
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:49,742
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

1199
01:21:49,816 --> 01:21:54,615
<i>And it is the season
of the spirit</i>

1200
01:21:54,685 --> 01:21:57,313
<i>The message if we hear it</i>

1201
01:21:57,388 --> 01:22:01,620
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

1202
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:07,254
Oh, Yes! Make it last all year.

1203
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,296
<i>It's in the giving of a gift
to another</i>

1204
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:12,163
<i>A pair of mittens
that were made by your mother</i>

1205
01:22:12,235 --> 01:22:15,329
<i>It's all the ways that we show love</i>

1206
01:22:15,403 --> 01:22:17,838
<i>That feel like Christmas</i>

1207
01:22:17,907 --> 01:22:20,536
<i>A part of childhood
we'll always remember</i>

1208
01:22:20,608 --> 01:22:23,303
<i>It is the summer of the soul
in December</i>

1209
01:22:23,378 --> 01:22:26,575
<i>Yes, when you do your best
for love</i>

1210
01:22:26,648 --> 01:22:28,945
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

1211
01:22:29,015 --> 01:22:33,953
<i>And remember,
it is the season of the heart</i>

1212
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:36,920
<i>A special time of caring</i>

1213
01:22:36,988 --> 01:22:41,085
<i>The ways of love made clear</i>

1214
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:45,324
<i>It is the season of the spirit</i>

1215
01:22:45,398 --> 01:22:48,231
<i>The message, if we hear it</i>

1216
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:52,168
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

1217
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,342
<i>It's in the singing
