00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,762
but I pulled a few strings,
got you and Mr. Davis on the 1 :00 train.

170
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,055
- Tickets are on the way over.
- Good enough.

171
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,057
- Put that on the bulletin board.
- Sign this, Bob.

172
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,726
OK. Say, if you want us
for anything in New York,

173
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,728
we'll be at Radio City.
We'll be rehearsing there

174
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,229
- for the Ed Harrison Television Show.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,064
Too bad you and Mr. Davis
couldn't get a little rest.

176
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,733
Oh, man,
I wasn't about to turn this down.

177
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,152
This is a great big, fat plug
for the show.

178
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,904
- Bring the tickets when they come.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,573
- Edna, the light of my life!
- [Davis] Bob?

180
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,283
Can I see you a minute?

181
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,203
- You know Doris, friend of Rita's.
- Another one, huh?

182
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,581
- How do you do?
- Mutual, I'm sure.

183
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,584
I thought before train time,
we'd get a bite to eat

184
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,212
- and have a few laughs or something.
- No, I can't make it.

185
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,672
I'm afraid you can't either.
We got some business to take care of.

186
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,758
- What kind of business?
- We got to go look at an act.

187
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,802
- Look at an act?
- Some other time, I hope?

188
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,140
Well, I like that! Without so much
as a "Kiss my foot" or "Have an apple!"

189
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,809
That does it. That's the last time
I'm gonna dig up a date for him.

190
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,103
And from now on,
you can do your dirty work yourself.

191
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,773
Yeah, well, excuse me one minute,
will you, kids?

192
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,693
Wallace, I think it's time
you and I had a little talk.

193
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,363
Yeah, it's a good idea, buster.
If you don't mind, I'll lead off.

194
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,114
- Now, wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.

195
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,991
You know something,
for about three months now,

196
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,494
you've been clumsily trying
to entangle me with some female.

197
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,996
- All I'm trying to do...
- Fat ones, tall ones, thin ones.

198
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,290
Doesn't make any difference,
as long as they're wearing skirts,

199
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,126
a little mascara and still breathing,
you ran them at me.

200
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,461
Believe me, it's for your own good.

201
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,630
- For my own good?
- Yeah. Let's face it, Bob,

202
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,049
- you're a lonely, miserable man.
- What?

203
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,636
And you're unhappy, too,
and when you're unhappy, I'm unhappy.

204
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,056
After all, I feel a strong sense
of responsibility to you, Bob,

205
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,977
- ever since the day I...
- Not again with that life-saving bit.

206
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,564
- Well, if you'd rather forget it...
- How can I? You won't let me.

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,483
Since you saved my life,
you decided you had the right to run it.

208
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,902
You've ootzed me along
every step of the way.

209
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,154
You've hammered, drove,
pushed, shoved.

210
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,614
And if that wasn't enough,

211
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,033
you'd look at me
with those great big cow eyes of yours,

212
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,703
point at that phony arm,
and I'd melt and go along!

213
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,746
- I don't expect any gratitude.
- You're gonna get it.

214
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,665
We did great, and I'm grateful.

215
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,085
So, thank you. Thank you, Phil Davis,
from the bottom of my heart.

216
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,670
Now, will you let
the rest of my life alone?

217
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,046
- No, I won't.
- Well, why not?

218
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,299
Because you're a miserable,
lonely, unhappy man.

219
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,342
You're whacky. I'm a very happy man.

220
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,011
Well, then, you're happy
for the wrong reasons.

221
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,806
And that's the same as being lonely
and miserable, except it's worse.

222
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,225
You know something, you're off
your nut about a mile and a half.

223
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,643
I've got everything in life I want.

224
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,562
- I'm off my nut a mile and a half.
- At least.

225
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,772
You've got everything you want
except the most important thing.

226
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,858
- What's this?
- A girl.

227
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,236
Well, I'll get around to that
one of these days.

228
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,780
My dear partner,
when what's left of you

229
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,159
gets around to what's left to be gotten,
what's left to be gotten won't be worth

230
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,244
getting whatever it is you've got left.

231
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,622
When I figure out what that means,
I'll come up with a crushing reply.

232
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,125
- What's back all this, anyway?
- Nothing. Only your happiness.

233
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,210
- My happiness?
- Yeah.

234
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,380
You know, when you get an idea that's
for my sole and ultimate happiness,

235
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,633
there's always lurking behind it
a little angle for you.

236
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,551
- Now, what is it?
- Do you really want to know?

237
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,511
- Yes, I really want to know.
- All right, I'll really tell you.

238
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,721
Then lay it on me, will you?

239
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,098
Ever since the day we became
producers, you were a changed man.

240
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,601
You've gone absolutely berserk
with work.

241
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,229
The strange thing is you liked it.
You like being Rodgers & Hammerstein.

242
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,565
- It was your idea, you know? Yeah.
- Well, sure it was my idea.

243
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,692
But I didn't think
I was going to create a Frankenstein.

244
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,070
From that day on, I haven't had
one minute I could call my own.

245
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,655
What do you want me to do about it?

246
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,908
I want you to get married.
I want you to have nine children.

247
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,912
And if you only spend five minutes
a day with each kid, that's 45 minutes,

248
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,624
and I'd at least have time to go out
and get a massage or something.

249
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,959
You don't expect me to get serious
with the kind of characters

250
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,671
- you and Rita have been throwing at me.
- There've been some nice girls, too.

251
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,132
Yeah, yeah. Like that nuclear scientist
we just met out in the hall.

252
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,262
All right. They didn't go to college.
They didn't go to Smith.

253
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,182
Go to Smith? She couldn't even spell it.

254
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,978
That's very funny. [chuckles]
The crooner is now becoming the comic.

255
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,525
Phil, let me tell you something.

256
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,612
There's a lot of sense in what you say,
and I have to admit it.

257
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,532
But the kind of girls
you and I meet in this business,

258
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,744
they're young and they're ambitious.
They're full of their own careers.

259
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,915
Not interested in getting married,
settling down, raising a family.

260
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,085
That's funny, Bob. I never heard you
open up like that before.

261
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,421
Someday, the right girl
is gonna come along,

262
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,923
and if she'll have me,
we'll get married. We'll settle down.

263
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,134
We'll start having
those nine kids for you.

264
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,511
Forty-five minutes going to be enough?

265
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,805
- If I need any more, I'll tell you.
- [knocking on door]

266
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,014
Come in!

267
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,642
Your railroad tickets, sir.
Drawing Room A, Car 207.

268
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,978
- Thanks. Grab those, will you, Phil?
- Here.

269
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,896
We'll go right over to the station
from Novello's

270
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,607
- after we audition this act.
- What kind of an act is it?

271
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,444
- It's a sister act.
- We don't need any sister act.

272
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,737
What are we wasting time for?

273
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,281
Well, I got a letter from Benny Haynes.
They're his sisters.

274
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,700
Do you remember Benny Haynes,
the old mess sergeant?

275
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,827
Freckle-Face Haynes,
the dog-faced boy?

276
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,495
- That's the kid. Yeah.
- He's got sisters?

277
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,372
- Claims he's got them.
- Come on now.

278
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,916
How can a guy that ugly
have the nerve to have sisters?

279
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,585
Very brave parents, I guess.

280
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,336
- Bob, will you do me one favor?
- What's that?

281
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,464
Give me one reason, one good reason,

282
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,924
why we should spend
our last two hours in Florida

283
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,511
looking at the sisters of Freckle-Face
Haynes, the dog-faced boy.

284
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,347
Let's just say we're doing it
for a pal in the Army.

285
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,225
Well, it's not good, but it's a reason.

286
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,731
- [indistinct chatter]
- [slow jazz plays]

287
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,822
- Hey, Novello.
- Good evening, Mr. Wallace, Mr. Davis.

288
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,449
Say, have the Haynes Sisters
been on yet?

289
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,118
No, sir, not yet.
They'll be on in about 1 5 minutes.

290
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,537
- Tell them we're here, will you?
- Certainly, Mr. Wallace.

291
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,707
Luigi, show these gentlemen
to their table.

292
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,671
This is ridiculous. We could have
been out with Doris and Rita

293
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,881
having some laughs.

294
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,759
Phil, when are you gonna learn
girls like that are a dime a dozen?

295
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,929
Please, don't quote me the price
when I haven't got the time.

296
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,141
- [woman] Who is it?
- It's me. Novello.

297
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,272
Bob Wallace and Phil Davis
are out front to catch your act.

298
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,733
- Wallace and Davis?
- They got a letter from your brother.

299
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,902
He asked them to take a look
and give you some advice.

300
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,071
Come on now. You'd better hurry.

301
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:20,367
Isn't that fabulous?
Wallace and Davis here to see us.

302
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,910
Yeah, fabulous.

303
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,622
Who'd have thought that of Benny, huh?
What a brother!

304
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,251
- What a sweet, wonderful guy!
- Amazing.

305
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,629
I wonder whatever gave him the idea.

306
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,673
Well, he probably knew we were here,
you know,

307
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,883
and that they were in town
with the big show.

308
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,552
He probably figured

309
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,264
we were too shy to take advantage
of an old Army friendship to call...

310
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,891
Judy, did you read Mother's letter
this morning?

311
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,770
- No. Why?
- Benny's got a job in Alaska.

312
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,773
He's been out of the country
for three months.

313
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,775
Oh? Oh...

314
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,111
Well, he could have written from Alaska.

315
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,029
But he didn't, did he?

316
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,285
- Oh, he might have.
- Judy, why did you write the letter?

317
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,954
Oh... Well...

318
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,624
Because it's good business.
You can't leave everything up to fate.

319
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,753
Just like honesty needs a little plus,
fate needs a little push.

320
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,922
Judy, next time,
will you talk to me first

321
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,925
before you push us and plus us
right out of show business?

322
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,927
You needn't sound so patronizing.

323
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,598
You sound just like a mother hen

plenty of looking after.

- Hello.

- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

362
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,596
Uh... Won't you sit there,
and you sit right here?

363
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,724
There, that's cozier, isn't it?
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

364
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,601
Well, I'm Betty,
and this is my sister, Judy.

365
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,312
And you're Phil Davis,
and you're Mr. Wallace.

366
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,106
- Guilty on both counts, I guess.
- Isn't this nice?

367
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,108
Mr. Wallace was just saying
how remarkable it was

368
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,154
that Benny Haynes' sisters
should have eyes... I mean, blue eyes.

369
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:30,200
- That is, eyes... [laughs]
- Nice out.

370
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,743
That's quite an act you kids have there.

371
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,579
It's a funny thing Benny never told us
there's so much talent in the family.

372
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,039
Well, to be perfectly honest...

373
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,334
Benny didn't want to take advantage
of an old Army friendship.

374
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:43,088
You know how shy he is,
so modest and retiring.

375
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,300
- It's a family characteristic.
- I have a recent snapshot here.

376
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,593
Oh?

377
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,309
He always was a good-looking kid.

378
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,687
Uh, speaking of families,

379
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,816
uh, I read an article just the other day
about citrus fruit

380
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,568
and its effect on children's teeth.

381
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,824
Are you interested in families
or children

382
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,201
- or things like that, Miss Haynes?
- Yes, I suppose so.

383
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,703
- Oh, man, nix, nix.
- Isn't that amazing?

384
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,455
Imagine a girl in show business today,

385
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,250
wanting to settle down
and raising a family.

386
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,128
- It's so refreshing, isn't it?
- Pushing, pushing.

387
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,214
- Well, would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

388
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,716
I, for one,
would like a little free advice.

389
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,053
Mr. Wallace, do you have
any suggestions for the act?

390
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,639
No. Just keep plugging away.

391
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,060
Oh. But there must be something.
Should we both be blondes?

392
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,771
Maybe Betty's hair
should go a shade darker?

393
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,942
Or should she maybe change the style?
A little more off the face?

394
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,822
No. I wouldn't change a thing.

395
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,699
[voice cracks] Would you care to dance?

396
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,619
- Don't you think we should discuss...
- Let's say it with music.

397
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,996
All right.

398
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:02,584
Now, promise you won't say anything
important till I get back. Bye, now.

399
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,968
- They look well together, don't they?
- Yes.

400
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,471
Say, I was sure surprised to get
Benny's letter today. I didn't know...

401
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,559
Look, Mr. Wallace, before you
go any further, I must tell you,

402
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,603
you were brought here tonight
under false pretenses.

403
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,189
Benny didn't write the letter,
my sister did.

404
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,356
Judy?

405
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,609
She figured you'd never come
to see us if we asked you,

406
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,195
and you might if Benny did.
As simple as that.

407
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,199
[laughs] How do you like that? Even
little Judy there's got an angle going.

408
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,951
- She didn't mean anything by it...
- You don't have to apologize.

409
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,120
Everybody's got an angle.

410
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,499
- That's a pretty cynical point of view.
- Come, come now, Miss Haynes.

411
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,294
Surely you knew that everybody's got
a little larceny operating in them.

412
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,795
- Didn't you know?
- Just for the record,

413
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,797
I want you to know that
my sister and I don't play angles.

414
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,467
Well, if that letter wasn't an angle,
I'd like to know what it was.

415
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,637
- I don't like your whole inferences.
- I've got no squawks, no beefs.

416
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,597
The kid played a percentage,
it worked and we're here.

417
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,225
Let's not make a whole
big mish-mosh out of it, huh?

418
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,772
- They're getting along just fine.
- And so quickly, too.

419
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Isn't that nice?

420
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,067
All I'm saying is, when you've
been around show business

421
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,570
as long as I have, you just get used
to people working angles, that's all.

422
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,822
Mr. Wallace, as the chance
of our seeing each other again

423
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,327
is extremely remote, I don't think it's
important for us to go on arguing.

424
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,122
- [laughs] Well, I'll drink to that.
- Be my guest.

425
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,003
Hey, if this keeps up, we'll practically
be in-laws before the dance is over.

426
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,047
Well, I don't mind, if you don't.

427
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,424
Yeah, it's too bad
we're leaving town tonight.

428
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,887
That is a shame,
but we're leaving tomorrow, anyway.

429
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,223
- Where are you going?
- Vermont.

430
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,893
- We're booked for the holidays.
- Vermont, huh?

431
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,897
Vermont should be beautiful this time
of the year, with all that snow.

432
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:52,860
- Yeah... You know something?
- What?

433
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,863
Vermont should be beautiful
this time of year.

434
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,826
- All that snow.
- That's what I just said.

435
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,829
We seem to be getting a little mixed up.

436
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:07,333
- Maybe it's the music.
- Maybe it isn't only the music.

- Yeah, she carried me right with her.

460
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,971
I don't weigh very much.

461
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,848
We'd better change for the last number.

462
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,267
- Uh, see you after the show.
- The sheriff's here.

463
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,770
He's in my office with a warrant
to arrest both of you.

464
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,439
- The sheriff?
- What's up? What's the trouble?

465
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,399
The landlord claims
we burnt a hole in the rug,

466
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,777
and he's trying to hold us up for $200.

467
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,779
Oh, no, not that old rug routine.

468
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,490
And on top of that,
we sneaked our bags out of our room.

469
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,200
- Where are they?
- In our dressing room.

470
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,327
Dressing room. Look, I'll tell you what.

471
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,371
You girls go and pack.
Bob and I'll take care of this.

472
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,289
No, no, no, no.
We don't want to cause you any trouble.

- It's no trouble, honey.
- I know, but Mr. Wallace already...

Will you stop worrying
about Mr. Wallace?

475

We like to take care of our friends.

476
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,923
- We're practically strangers.
- We'd like to take care of that, too.

00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,634
But you might get yourself
in an awful jam. Why should you?

478
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,388
- I mean, what's in it for you?
- Forty-five minutes all to myself.

00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,639
- What?
- Now, come on. Will you hurry, girls?

480
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,892
Come on. Come on. Go on. You go back
to the office and stall the sheriff.

481
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,645
- But, Mr. Davis, how will I stall...
- Make up a story. Tell him anything.

Tell him the girls have
to finish the show or something.

Bob. All right, Bob, the girls
are in jam. We'll have to help them.

- What's the beef?
- Come on. They're in big trouble now.

- Somebody is trying to get... Come on.

00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,373
Let me ask you something.
Why don't we pay the fellow the $200?

487
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,584
Are you kidding?
Pay off a chiseling rat like that?

488
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,961
Will you send a cab out back,
and I'll meet you in the dressing room?

489
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,296
I don't know how I get mixed up
in these things.

490
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,047
Why do I listen to you?
Give me one good reason.

491
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,009
Let's just say we're doing it
for an old pal in the Army.

492
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,429
- It's not good, but it's a reason.
- Will you go on?

493
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,724
You kids get down to the station
and hop on a train.

494
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,017
- Here, Phil.
- We can't.

495
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,643
Our tickets aren't good until tomorrow.

496
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,021
But you've got to get out tonight.

497
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,233
Tickets. Wait a minute. Here,
take these. Now, get going. Come on.

498
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,360
We can't take your tickets.
What will Mr. Wallace think?

499
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,654
Well, honey, it was his idea.
Now, will you please get going?

500
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,448
- His idea? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,699
He won't think
it's some kind of an angle?

502
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:36,078
I told you it was his idea.
Now, come on. Upsy-daisy. Here we go!

503
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,496
That's right.

504
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,790
We'll pay you back.
Where can we reach you?

505
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,917
Oh, don't worry.
We'll be in touch. Come on.

506
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,253
Our trunks, our phonograph
and the recording.

507
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,381
Honey, we'll get them to you. Would
you please go? The taxi is coming.

508
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,008
- Don't stop for anything. Bye.
- Bye, Phil.

509
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,593
- Here.
- Here.

510
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,388
- Open the door. Bye.
- Bye, now.

511
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,397
And I can't stall him much longer.

512
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,399
Hey, whatever happened
to paying the $200?

513
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,943
Well, we've got to give the girls
five or ten minutes' start.

514
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,111
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

515
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,197
If you could just stall him
for just a few minutes.

516
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,240
I'll try, but he's eating me
out of business already.

517
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,701
- Well, keep punching, will you?
- OK.

518
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,746
- Come on, Bob, I think this will work.
- I got a feeling I'm not gonna like it.

519
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,164
I got a feeling you're gonna hate it.

520
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,874
- What am I doing it for?
- Let's just say...

521
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,376
[both] We're doing it
for a pal in the Army.

522
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,753
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know. I've heard that...

523
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,675
Listen, Sheriff, I haven't got all night
to wait here while you eat free food.

524
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,260
You got your warrant,
now arrest those girls.

525
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,930
Now, we agreed to let them finish
their show first.

526
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:40,643
- I didn't agree. It was his idea.
- I got some rights, too.

527
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,145
You don't get those girls
till after they've done their number.

528
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,523
Well, how long is it going to take?

529
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,108
- Well, it'll only be...
- [band playing fanfare]

Wait a minute, there's their music.

- How's your coffee holding up? Yeah.
- Warm it up a little.

in Vermont, Bob. All that snow?

- Uh, I don't seem to have any cash.

What did you do with that?
Leave it in your snood? Here.

- $97.24.
- OK. There you are.

00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,654
- Where are you going?
- It's for breakfast.

- Breakfast! Get some peanuts.
- All right.

00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,907
- Club car's straight ahead.
- OK.

and now we've got to sit up all night.

we'd be sitting up all night.

614
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,354
We're not taking a plane.
We're taking a train,

615
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,648
a train on which we had tickets.

Tickets for a drawing room with
two nice, warm, soft comfortable beds,

617

618
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,035
Oh, no, you wouldn't do this to me.

619
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,540
- Wouldn't do what?
- After you dressed me up like a dame,

620
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,833
you get me involved with a sheriff.

621
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:00,004
I almost lose my life
trying to catch a train. I know...

622
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:06,218
I just know on top of all that, you
wouldn't take away my nice warm bed

623
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,680
and let me spend the night
out here in a drafty old club car.

624
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,600
You wouldn't do this to old Bob,
would you?

625
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,561
Whatever are you talking about?

626
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,024
I'm going down there to Drawing
Room A, I'm gonna open up that door,

627
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,360
and if I find those two Haynes sisters
there, I'm gonna take them by the hair

628
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,779
and with these two hands I'm...

629
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,699
Oh, Mr. Wallace,
how can we ever thank you?

630
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,951
It was really so sweet
and generous of you.

631
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,662
Mr. Davis told us you insisted
on giving us the tickets,

632
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,622
and, well, it was just wonderful of you.

633
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,501
Wasn't there something you... [clears
throat] wanted to say to the girls?

634
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,465
Yeah. [clears throat] Won't you have
a drink or a sandwich or something?

635
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,799
- Let's sit down.
- Yeah, sit down.

636
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,176
Can we have some club sandwiches?

637
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,762
- I'd like lemonade, please.
- I'll have a malt, please.

638
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:54,349
- We're emceeing the joint.
- This is cozy, boy, girl, girl, boy.

Tell me, where are you kids
going to stay in New York?

641
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,024
We're not staying in New York.
We're booked for over the holidays.

642
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,235
- Where?
- The Columbia Inn, Pine Tree, Vermont.

643
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,993
Oh, well, that sounds very Vermont-y.

644
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,870
Should be beautiful this time
of the year in Vermont,

00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,227
everything in remodeling this place!

810
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,939
It used to be a gristmill and a barn.
Now, it's a Tyrolean haunted house.

811
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,275
Well, eat hearty!

812
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,070
There ought to be
something we can do about it.

813
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,530
Well, there is. We're going
to New York in the morning.

814
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,574
- New York?
- But you just got here!

815
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,409
We got some connections there,
some good ones.

816
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,911
We can dig him up a spot somewhere.

817
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,830
Yeah, but that takes too long.
The problem is here, now.

818
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,083
We've got to stay up here
and dream up some way

819
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,709
of getting people
to come into this place.

820
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,253
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

821
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,173
It should be something unusual,
some kind of a novelty...

822
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,218
Tell me, brainstorm, what do you think
would be a novelty up here in Vermont?

823
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,137
Who knows?
Maybe we can dig up a Democrat?

824
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,431
- They'd stone him!
- [laughter]

825
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,893
Well, if you ask me, what this place
really needs is a dynamite act.

826
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,938
Now, you're talking.
If we could get something really big.

827
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,399
- Something sock, like...
- Like Wallace and Davis.

828
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,776
No, honey, you couldn't get them.
They're too big.

829
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,487
Wait a minute. Wallace and Davis.
How about that, Bob?

830
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:36,157
We could do our old nightclub act,
fit the girls in here and there.

831
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,868
- Might be wonderful. What do you say?
- I think you got something.

832
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,454
It's a great idea.
It's half a great idea, anyhow.

833
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,125
Will you excuse me? Young lady,
get me the New York operator.

834
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,419
OK, Mr. Wallace. This way.

835
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,966
I don't know what he's up to,
but he's got that

836
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,843
Rodgers & Hammerstein look again.

837
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,513
- Is that bad?
- Not bad, but always expensive.

838
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,849
Excuse me.

839
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,647
[laughs] I know it sounds crazy, Al,
but you're working for crazy people.

840
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,859
Now, get this straight. I want
the whole show up here in three days.

841
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,487
Yeah, the whole show. Sets, costumes
and all the cast you can round up.

842
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,864
Hey, wait a minute.
What's this gonna cost?

843
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,491
Everybody gets an extra week's pay
and you get a bonus, Al.

844
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,161
- What's this gonna cost?
- We open Christmas Eve.

845
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:27,125
- The tab! How much?
- Al, what's this gonna set us back?

846
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,045
- Wow!
- How much is "wow"?

847
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,048
Well, OK, Al, do the best you can.
Good luck.

848
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,093
- How much is "wow"?
- We got a big job, buster, a big job.

849
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,387
Whatever acts we can't get,
we fill in with the Haynes Sisters.

850
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:44,225
- How much is "wow"?
- Right in between "ouch" and "boing."

851
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,978
- Wow! I'm right behind you.
- Come along.

852
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,691
I won't tell the general,
you do it your own way,

853
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,527
but I think bringing your show up here
is just one of the nicest...

854
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,737
How did you know?

855
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,864
Well, like any decent,
self-respecting housekeeper,

856
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,242
I listen in on the other phone.
I just don't know what to say.

857
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,827
Mmm!

858
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,372
- He thought of it.
- Well, it was a lovely thought.

859
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,544
- Wow!
- Let's get hold of yourself. Come on.

860
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,047
- [blowing]
- [indistinct chattering]

861
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,883
Hurry up, kids. Check in the lobby
for your room numbers.

862
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,968
Put your bags backstage.

863
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:24,390
Everybody grab his own suitcases.
Let's not get mixed up now.

864
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,976
The wardrobe trunk's in the hall.

865
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:30,647
Let's go, let's go, we got to get
started hanging those drapes.

866
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,483
All right, kids,
find your rooms, get settled.

867
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,237
Get your rehearsal costumes on. We
start rehearsals right after breakfast.

868
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,660
I still don't understand it. You mean
you brought your whole show up here?

869
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:46,913
- Well, most of it, sir.
- Well, it's still not clear to me. Why?

870
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,666
Well, we have this show. Now,
we have to close down for the holidays,

871
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,376
lay the cast off, and business is bad...

872
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,128
I know about business being bad. Go on.

873
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,382
Well, we figured
since we had a chance to rehearse,

874
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,133
we might as well do
our rehearsing up here.

875
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,426
Why here?

876
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,262
Well, you've got this nice
big empty ski lodge,

877
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,139
and the minute Phil and I saw it, we
decided it was ideal. Didn't we, Phil?

878
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,142
That's right, Bob. Ideal.
That's exactly the word we used, too.

879
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,437
Ideal. We looked at this big ski lodge
and we said, "Isn't it ideal?

880
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,523
- Absolutely ideal." Didn't we?
- Ideal.

881
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,900
We've established the fact
the lodge is ideal.

882
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,945
And it gives us a chance, you see,
sir, to test new material.

883
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,196
- On what?
- On the audience.

884
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,156
We use them like guinea pigs.

885
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,827
Pigs, we can get for you.
I'm not so sure about people.

886
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:27,704
Well, uh, with all due modesty, sir,

887
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,790
Wallace and Davis never had
any trouble packing them in, sir.

888
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,669
- People that is, not pigs.
- Well, go ahead, if you want to.

889
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,797
Apparently, there's quite a bit about
show business I don't understand.

890
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,133
- Oh, it'll come to you, sir.
- Just takes time.

891
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,719
Sure. We wouldn't be
any good as generals.

892
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:45,096
You weren't any good as privates.

893
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,308
[Wallace] All right, kids,
take it from the top once again.

894
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,311
- Bum-de-de-bum-bum, and!
- [up-tempo music plays]

895
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,480
That's right, that's it.
All right, keep it lively.

896
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,197
All right, let's keep it going.
That's good.

897
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,283
Keep it up there, honey.

898
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,869

is about the family.

No place for me.

Bob, it wouldn't be too hard to

1131
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,737
learn this game of horseshoes.
Now, would it?

1132
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,698
It'd be a cinch.

a lot to be said for leisure.

01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,788
Never kid a kidder, son.

1136
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,583
See you later.

1137
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,837
That's a good one!

[piano playing up-tempo music]

1139
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,477
Fine, fine.
All right, kids, take a rest.

1140
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,813
- I'm sure it's a great...
- Bob? Phil?

1141
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,481
Ready to run through
the Choreography number.

1142
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:37,774
I'll be with you in a minute.

1143
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,484
It's the craziest thing I ever heard of!

1144
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,737
How are you gonna get a whole
division up here by Christmas Eve?

1145
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,196
So we don't get a whole division.

1146
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,157
But there must be enough guys
in New England alone

1147
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,117
from the old man's outfit
to fill a town this size.

1148
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,453
At least enough guys
to let him know he's not forgotten.

1149
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,246
Don't you think
putting the show on will do it?

1150
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,998
Phil, if you'd seen the look in his eyes

1151
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,542
when he read that letter
you'd know it wouldn't.

1152
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,294
It's gonna take five days
to put the show on, is it?

1153
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,462
That's right.

1154
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,172
How are we gonna get in touch
with all the fellows?

1155
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,258
Television. Ed Harrison.
I'm gonna go put a call in to him now.

1156
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,761
I'll go on down to New York, and if I
can swing it, I'll get on his show

1157
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,971
and make a pitch to the guys myself.
What do you think of it?

1158
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,807
I think it's impossible,
ridiculous and insane.

1159
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:14,853
- Anything else?
- Yeah. I wish I'd thought of it first.

1160
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,648
You rehearse the number.
I'll put the call in, Bob.

1161
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,233
Hey, Johnny, get the kids
for a dress rehearsal, will you?

1162
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,697
Emma? Could you, uh, put in
a long-distance call for me?

1163
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,741
I want to get Ed Harrison,
New York City.

1164
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,202
- The television Ed Harrison?
- That's the fellow, yeah.

1165
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,787
You'll catch him at Radio City, I think.

1166
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,539
And let's keep it quiet.
This is kind of a personal thing.

1167
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:39,586
Oh, sure, sure. Ed Harrison, television.
Radio City, gee.

but there's no other way
to reach the men in a hurry.

1185
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,790
How does it sound? Huh?

1186
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,585
I love the idea of doing
something for the old man.

1187
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:52,339
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't know
how to peel a potato! [laughs]

1188
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,175
Look, why don't you go all out?
Put the whole show on TV?

1189
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,637
I'll come up there myself,
bring the camera, the crew, the works.

1190
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:03,016
- Thanks, Ed, but that's not the idea.
- Well, it's a great idea.

1191
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,938
Put the show on the network
right from Pine Tree. Play it up big.

1192
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,481

Santa Claus to the old man, you know.

Plenty of schmaltz, lots of heart.

1195
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:18,156
Would be worth over $100,000
in free advertising for you and Phil.

1196
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,158
And, yeah,
we'll put the old boy on himself,

I'm sorry, Ed. Sorry, but that's out.

We're not commercializing
on the old man's hard luck. No chance.

1201
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:38,093
All I want to do is go on your show
and make a little pitch. OK?

1202
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:42,555
Wonderful. Wonderful.
See you Sunday night then. Bye.

1203
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,934
- Take it upstairs, Susan.
- All right.

01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,657
- Oh. Was there a telegram for me?
- What?

1206
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:04,869
Oh, yeah! Just an offer
from the Carousel Club in New York,

- You're quite a pro.

you wish you hadn't.

1213
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,386
Anything specific?

1214
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:24,723
Did you know the boys are planning
to put this whole show on television?

1215
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,725
- Television?
- Right from here, on Christmas Eve.

1216
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,103
I just heard Bob fix it with
Ed Harrison. It's a big deal.

1217
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,188
Real schmaltz, I think they called it.

1218
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,692
- They're even gonna put the general on.
- I just can't believe it.

1219
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,528
That'll make him a pathetic figure
from coast to coast.

1220
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:41,072
What's it gonna do to his pride?

1221
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,075
Of course, you know it means
over $200,000 worth of free publicity

1222
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,746
- for Davis and Wallace.
- Emma, that's a terrible thing to say.

1223
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,540
I didn't say it. Bob Wallace said it.
I just heard him.

1224
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:54,753
No. Bob wouldn't be involved in a thing
like that. I'm sure you're wrong.

[humming] Hi, Betty.
Have you seen Bob?

1229
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,184
Do you know whether he made that
phone call to New York or not, Emma?

1230
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,436
- I understand he did.
- Oh, good.

1231
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,979
I hear that television's
entered the picture.

1232
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,607
- Then he worked it out, huh?
- Beautifully.

1233
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:18,610
- It's a great, little angle, isn't it?
- Brilliant.

1234
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,570
Listen, uh, keep this
under your hat, will you?

1235
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:23,073
We wouldn't want the general
to know about it, because it's...

1236
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,240
I can understand that.

1237
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:28,370
Betty, that was Bob. He's waiting
to rehearse in the dining room.

1238
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,664
- Anything wrong?
- Tell him I'm on the way.

- Hi, hon. How about some lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

1240
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,754
- But Betty...
- I said I'm not hungry.

1241
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:43,843
- What's with her?
- I'm not sure, but I have an idea.

1242
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,095
I want to think about it.

1243
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,972
Yeah, well, let's think about it over
a sandwich, kid. I'm starving to death.

- Change the routine...
- That other rehearsal's

1245
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,643

I don't feel like doing this song.

I'd rather not discuss last night,
if you don't mind.

Come now, I admit I was
a little carried away and everything,

but there's no use getting all upset
with just a simple little kiss.

There's certainly nothing
for you to feel guilty about.

1265
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,463
- Look who's talking about guilt.
- What do you mean by that?

1266
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,717
I mean, you shouldn't mix fairytales
with liverwurst and buttermilk.

1267

- What did you have for lunch today?
- I didn't have lunch.

1268

Well, maybe you ought to eat something.

1269
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,931
Why is everybody suddenly
so concerned about my eating habits?

1270
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:16,478
- Why don't people leave me alone...
- Whoa, whoa! Time, time, cut!

1271
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,230
Let's get off the merry-go-round.
If you got something to say, say it.

1272
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:22,817
Otherwise, let's get to work. I got
a lot of details here to take care of.

1273
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:26,404
Well, then, let's just skip all this.
I certainly wouldn't want to interfere

1274
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,907
with the business plans
of the great Wallace and Davis.

1275
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,702
- That's quite a remark.
- I'm sorry. It's the best I can do.

1276
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,288
Look, Betty,
I've got no time for games today.

1277
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,332
Now, are you gonna
sing this song or not?

1278
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,918
- I don't want to sing the song.
- Well, nobody's twisting your arm.

1279
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,795
- Is that all, Mr. Wallace?
- Yes, that's all, Miss Haynes.

1280
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,102
[Davis] Yours ought to be done by now.

1281
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:24,170
- How do you figure that?
- I'm not sure,

1282

but daylight's beginning to glimmer.

1283

Last night she couldn't sleep.
Today she won't eat.

1284
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,845
- She's in love.
- If that's love, somebody goofed.

1285
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,306
It's love all right, but she's
deliberately putting up barriers.

1286
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:36,808
I'd bet my bottom dollar on it.

1287
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:38,810
- Why?
- Because of me.

1288
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,688
She's always felt that she's mother hen
and I'm her little chick.

1289
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,315
She'll never leave the roost
until I'm taken care of.

1290
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,652
- That's funny. Are you sure?
- Oh, I should've known.

1291
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:50,405
She'll never get involved with anyone
until I'm married

1292
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:55,034
- or engaged or something.
- Well, I guess that's the end of that.

1293
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:59,872
Unless I get myself engaged
or something real fast.

1294
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,125
That's ridiculous.
Even if it made any sense at all,

1295
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:05,003
you're up here in the wilderness.
There's nobody around here.

1296
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,629
Oh, I don't know.

1297
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:10,717
Be realistic. Who could you find up here
to get yourself engaged to?

1298
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:14,137
Well, I suppose it ought
to be someone that I know.

1299
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,597
That always helps.

1300
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,683
- Of course, it's got to be a man.
- That's an absolute must.

1301
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,353
No, no, no. I mean a mature man.
One with talent and experience.

1302
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,022
- Talent, experience...
- One that's witty,

1303
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,524
- gay, charming, attractive.
- Witty, gay, charming, sure.

1304
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,527
Where are you gonna find
such a super man?

1305
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:33,156
- Don't be so modest.
- Honey, fellas like that don't...

1306
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:38,536
- Me?
- Well, you're not exactly Superman,

1307
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:42,373
- but you're awfully available.
- Yeah, now, don't get any ideas, Judy.

1308
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,668
- I'm not the marrying kind.
- It's just an engagement.

1309
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:48,630
Yeah, well,
I'm not the engaging kind, either.

1310
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,048
Well, what kind are you?

1311
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,884
Well, I'm more the "I don't mind
pushing my best friend into it,

1312
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:56,471
but I'm scared stiff when I get
anywhere close to it myself" kind.

1313
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,931
How terrible could it be for a few days?

1314
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:02,727
- You do like me, don't you?
- Sure, I do.

1315
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,021
I mean, I'm not exactly repulsive.

1316
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,273
Of course...
[clears throat] Of course not.

1317
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:12,403
And you do find me gay, amusing,
good company, fun to be with?

1318
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,032
I do, but I feel the same way
about my cocker spaniel.

1319
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:21,371
Well, let's just skip it.
I was only thinking of Betty and Bob.

1320
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,873
Betty and Bob, yeah.

1321
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,251
Look, uh, it would
only be temporary, huh?

1322
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,714
Well, of course. Well,
you don't think I'm the kind of girl

1323
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,258
that goes around throwing myself
at a man, do you?

1324
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,429
Of course not. Nobody thinks that.
Well, look, let me figure this out.

1325
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:42,934
Now, it would only last two or three
weeks at the worst. At the most, I mean.

1326
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,103
Well, of course.

1327
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,272
And, uh, we wouldn't have to
announce our engagement

1328
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:54,278
- till it was absolutely necessary.
- Absolutely necessary.

1329
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,739
Well, OK, it's a deal.

1330
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:04,038
But don't you think
we ought to kiss or something?

1331
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:08,835
Um... Not until
it's absolutely necessary.

this is a tactical error.

01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:05,431
Gee whiz, Bob,
I only did it for your own good.

1449
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,599
Yeah, because I'm a lonely,
miserable, unhappy man.

1450

That's right, and when you're unhappy,
I'm unhappy. After all, Bob, I...

Oh, no. You're not gonna start again
with that life-saving bit.

she's been a kind of a mother hen...

Yeah, we wanted the mother hen
to leave the roost,

so that the little chick could...

1460
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,336
- Well, I guess we laid an egg.
- An egg?
