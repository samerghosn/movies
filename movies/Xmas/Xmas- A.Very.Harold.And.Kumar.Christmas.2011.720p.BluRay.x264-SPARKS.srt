1
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,574
Oh, ha, ha. Well,
I'll definitely be getting you that bicycle.

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,953
And I'll see what I can do about
your parents' ugly divorce, Caren.

3
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,331
All right. Merry Christmas!

4
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,041
- Who's next?
- Santa!

5
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,794
Kumar, no! Merry-

6
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,587
Back of the line, tech support!

7
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,589
- Is this a joke?
Hold the flap on.

8
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,383
Your son can rub his ass
on Santa's cock in a minute.

9
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,555
- What do you want for Christmas?
That's a really good question.

10
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,307
- Snoopy Sno-cone Machine.
- Done.

11
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,558
- And a DeLorean.
- Yes.

12
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,102
Wu-Tang to get back together.

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,686
I'll tell the elves.

14
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,438
This is just for my stockings.

15
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,731
- For my present-
- Hey!

16
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,442
Meet me at my sleigh
in half an hour, okay?

17
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,653
You got it. Merry Christmas, Santa.

18
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,071
- Ooh. Bong.
- Oh!

19
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,449
Right in the sugar plums.

20
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,453
Okay. On the menu today, we have:

21
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,247
Winter Wonder Weed.

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,583
We have Rudolph
the Red-Eyed Reindeer.

23
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,043
Oh, it's a Weederful Life.

24
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,462
God, does everything have
to be about Christmas?

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,339
Hey, some people like the holidays.

26
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,426
I had Hanukkah Hash, but the kids from
Temple Shalom Immanuel cleaned me out.

27
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,762
What is this? "Kwanzaa Cookout. "

28
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,180
A little more expensive.

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,975
This is like Duvalier Dank from October.

30
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,643
- I'll take it.
- Oh. Hello, gentlemen.

31
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,145
Mm.

32
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,563
- shooot.
- What?

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,356
You have anything to smoke out of?

34
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,898
PROTESTERS
Wall Street sucks! Wall Street sucks!

35
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,109
Wall Street sucks! Wall Street sucks!

36
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,903
Ah, Mr. Lee? I'm here.

37
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,115
Wait...

38
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,450
...more protesters?

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,620
Do they really think we care
what poor people think?

40
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,913
Kenneth, it's Christmas.

41
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,540
They're out of work. You'd be upset too.

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,584
Let's see how you did
on your assignment.

43
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,004
I think I found the absolute best gift
for your father-in-law.

44
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,965
And, Mr. Lee, I think you're
gonna be really pleased.

45
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,384
Ow.

46
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,220
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,054
Hi.

48
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,680
This is a Sharp...

49
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,933
...52" Aquos Quattron TV...

50
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,727
...with state-of-the-art 3D technology...

51
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,979
...that makes Avatar look Avatar-ded.

52
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,982
I don't know. Hasn't the 3D thing
jumped the shark by now?

53
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,651
Mr. Lee, you don't understand.

54
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,611
This is the best 3D you've ever seen.

55
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,488
It's gonna be amazing!

56
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,242
Who are you looking at?

57
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,581
Mr. Lee!

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,416
Want me to call you a cab...

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,418
...a town car, a limo? It's not safe...

60
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,420
- ... out there.
- No, thanks, Kenneth.

61
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,464
I got a buddy picking me up.

62
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,592
One more thing!
Merry Christmas to you...

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,219
...Harold, and Happy New Year!

64
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,262
Hey, over there.

65
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,388
We got another one.

66
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,182
Don't worry, Mr. Lee. I'll distract them.

67
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,809
Hey...

68
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,645
...angry protesters!
I just got a huge Christmas bonus...

69
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,730
...so you can suck my rich, yellow...

70
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,606
...dick!

71
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,328
Get him!

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,820
Dude!

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,322
Open the door!

74
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,282
Unh. Thank God you're here.

75
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,076
I thought those hippies
were gonna kill you.

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,288
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo, shoo, shoo!

77
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,831
Just drive. Todd, drive.

78
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,959
No, no, no! No, no, no!

79
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,668
Oh, great.

80
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,253
Now we're getting tinkled on.

81
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,422
- It's just urine. It'll wash out.
- Oh, Harry.

82
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,966
Tinkle on the windshield
is the grossest thing...

83
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,760
...that has ever happened to me.

84
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,763
Ugh.

85
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,689
It smells like shooot in here.

86
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,368
Hey...

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,244
- ... neighbor.
- Hey, man.

88
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:11,953
All right.

89
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,290
Check it. Remember that hot virgin
I met on the internet? Get this:

90
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,875
She wants me...

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,585
...to deflower her.

92
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,295
Tonight. Christmas Eve.

93
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,881
At a party she's throwing
in Manhattan. Best part:

94
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,008
- You're coming with me.
- No can do, man.

95
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,303
I gotta stay here and smoke this weed,
otherwise I won't get high.

96
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,763
Why not ask your roommate?

97
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,391
Because you're the best.
I don't wanna go with him.

98
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,602
I already asked him. He said no.
He's spending Christmas...

99
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,437
...with his stupid girlfriend.

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,524
Mm. This is what happens.
They get a girlfriend...

101
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,567
...then they get married...

102
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,653
...then you never hear from them again.

103
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,073
flap it, I'm in.

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,366
Yes.

105
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,996
Wow, the Jewish neighbors
must hate this.

106
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,791
Well, Harry. Harry.

107
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,251
You have outdone yourself.

108
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,794
If you knew Maria's dad...

109
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,671
...you'd pull out all the stops too.

110
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,840
Has not accepted you
as part of the family?

111
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,052
No, not yet. But he's a huge fan of
Christmas. I'm hoping when he sees...

112
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,846
...all the work, he appreciates it.

113
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,097
Oh, so smart.

114
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,932
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

115
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,475
Oh. Jinx.

116
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,562
You always do that.
You keep doing it. It's crazy.

117
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,022
Okay, I'll Skype you later or text you.

118
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,357
Or both.

119
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,277
Maria!

120
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,029
Oh, hi there.
Somebody's looking...

121
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,782
...uh, very merry today.

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,826
Somebody is also...

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,870
...ovulating.

124
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,663
Um...

125
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,876
Your dad is gonna be here any minute,
though. Honestly, that's-

126
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,879
- Baby. Then let's get to it.
- Oh!

127
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,797
Because when they get here...

128
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:50,010
...we are going to have no private time.

129
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,636
I don't know if we should.

130
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,222
Now, come on and flap a baby into me.

131
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,433
Okay, I will.

132
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,770
Two-hander. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.

133
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,940
If it's a baby I gotta give you,
it's a baby you're gonna get.

134
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,402
shooot.

135
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,406
Go. Go.

136
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,827
Be cool.

137
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,500
Carlos, Merry Christmas.

138
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,461
Hello, Harold.

139
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,714
You made the drive in record time.
Didn't speed, did you?

140
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,094
Empanadas?

141
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,555
Where's Maria?

142
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,515
She's upstairs...

143
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,016
...getting ready.

144
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,434
Can I get you a beer?

145
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,810
What the hell is that?

146
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,941
She caught your eye, huh? Ha, ha.

147
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,526
This is our Christmas tree.

148
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,818
Is it fake?

149
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,779
It's faux, actually.

150
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,489
You celebrating real Christmas...

151
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,282
...or a faux Christmas?

152
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,367
Real Christmas?

153
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,117
Daddy.

154
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,577
Daddy!

155
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,828
God.

156
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,996
I've missed you!

157
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,541
And the whole family...

158
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,625
...is here.

159
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:05,919
Hi...

160
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,128
...everybody!

161
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,965
Oh, God.

162
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,885
Oh. I guess Timo...

163
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,053
...made parole.

164
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,888
Uh, not exactly.

165
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,641
Hey! Let's take a picture. Everybody!

166
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,936
You take it.

167
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,397
You people are real good
with those things.

168
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,858
It's just the weekend.

169
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,611
It's just the weekend.

170
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,533
Has this ever happened to you?

171
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,951
This stupid waffle's stuck.

172
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,037
Oh, my God! Billy!

173
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,414
- Heh-heh-heh.
George, call 911!

174
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,582
This is fucked up.

175
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,666
How about this?

176
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,129
Well, it doesn't have to anymore.

177
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,423
Introducing WaffleBot.

178
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,633
WaffleBot!

179
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,596
Just pop the top, let that batter drop...

180
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,639
...and WaffleBot does the rest.

181
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,600
Make every breakfast a Bot-fast.

182
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,811
Thanks, WaffleBot!

183
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,771
I love you.

184
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,981
Get the Christmas...

185
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,191
...toy of the season while they're hot.

186
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,821
I'm busy, Adrian! Go away!

187
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,532
Kumar! It's Vanessa.

188
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,244
Hey. Looks like somebody missed me.

189
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,121
Come on in.

190
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,624
Since when do you have a beard?

191
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,710
I actually have not shaved since you left.
Pretty romantic.

192
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,212
Kind of like Ryan Gosling
in The Notebook.

193
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,423
When's the last time you cleaned?

194
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,425
Like three months ago.

195
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,676
Less romantic?

196
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,136
Little bit, yeah.

197
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,639
I'm sorry, where are my manners?
Here. Here.

198
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,556
Oh, no, no, no.

199
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,141
No, I shouldn't.

200
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,309
Of course you should.

201
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,186
Kumar, I really need to talk to you.

202
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,564
I'm pregnant.

203
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,108
You're pregnant?

204
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,526
We-

205
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,778
We practiced safe sex.

206
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,906
I mean, I pulled out
and came on your back.

207
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,366
A couple squeaks got by...

208
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,451
- ... but is that all it takes?
- Yes.

209
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,371
That's all. No wonder
you flunked out of med school.

210
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,082
I didn't flunk out of med school.
I failed a drug test.

211
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,375
How do I even know...

212
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,626
...that the baby's mine?

213
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,128
I haven't slept with anyone
since we broke up.

214
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,838
Nice.

215
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,007
What do you want to do about it?

216
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,342
All right, um...

217
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,269
This is the part
where the kid's tongue...

218
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,729
...gets stuck to a pole. Ha, ha.

219
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,190
Oh. Ha, ha. I'm sorry.

220
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,611
Um, are we having a conversation right now,
or are you watching A Christmas Story?

221
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,405
Both. No.

222
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,949
- I mean-
- You know what? I knew you...

223
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,909
- ... couldn't handle this.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,160
I'm really high.

225
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,580
This is not about you being high.
This is about you being immature.

226
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,916
It's why I couldn't stay here anymore.

227
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,210
You are perfectly fine
creating a mess...

228
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,671
...but when it comes
to cleaning one up...

229
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,297
...you're MIA.

230
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,590
Give me a half hour...

231
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,800
...to sober up.

232
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,468
flap.

233
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,351
Dad, you good?
You need a drink or-? No? Okay.

234
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,482
- Maria. I love you.
- Ha, ha.

235
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,900
Glad your family's here.

236
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,152
I'm just wondering...

237
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,114
...how we're gonna deal with the Christmas
party with all these extra guests.

238
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,283
We'll make it work.
We have plenty of room.

239
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,993
Okay.

240
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,994
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,620
I left my wallet upstairs. Thank you.

242
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,206
Harold.

243
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,167
Hey, speaking of guests...

244
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,502
...are you sure you don't
wanna invite Kumar?

245
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,339
Kumar? You kidding me?
I haven't seen that guy in years.

246
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,340
Kumar has been...

247
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,343
- ... your friend for a long time.
- It is perfectly normal.

248
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,221
People lose half their friends
every seven years.

249
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,098
It's not like I don't have friends.

250
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,893
- Todd? Yeah, he's a lot of fun.
- At least he doesn't...

251
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,187
...create a disaster everywhere he goes.

252
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,106
Ah, okay.

253
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,198
Rosetta Stone.

254
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,325
A lifesaver.

255
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:16,753
Be right there!

256
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,098
Harold? He hasn't lived here in so long.

257
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,522
Maybe we can-

258
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,649
Are you sure we have to...

259
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,818
- ... throw it out?
- This tree is a cancer.

260
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,362
We have to get rid of it
before it kills Christmas.

261
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,988
Very intense wording.

262
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,163
Wow! Oh, my God.

263
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,457
I can't believe you brought the tree.
Ha-ha-ha.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,751
Am I missing something?

265
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,087
Every Christmas we use a tree
that Dad grew.

266
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,130
- Oh.
Twelve-foot Fraser fir.

267
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,550
Look at the branch distribution.

268
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,384
Oh, I see.

269
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,635
Hey, hey!

270
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,595
She's very delicate.

271
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,056
I've been growing her for eight years.

272
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,310
Eight years, wow. I never knew
Christmas trees were such a big deal.

273
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,729
Oh, God.

274
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,147
Not a big deal?

275
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,483
Let me tell you a story, Harold.

276
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,318
Growing up in Medellín...

277
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,947
...my family was too poor
to celebrate Christmas properly.

278
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,616
Every year I would pray to God:

279
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:33,246
"Please, let me wake up and find a big,
beautiful Christmas tree. "

280
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,873
And every Christmas...

281
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,333
...I was heartbroken.

282
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,545
When my mother finally
moved me to America...

283
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,505
...she promised me we would have...

284
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,426
...a Christmas tree every Christmas
from then on.

285
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:50,763
But one week before that first Christmas,
while walking home from work...

286
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,765
...she was violently attacked...

287
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,934
...by a gang of Korean punks.

288
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,490
They stabbed her multiple times.
She bled to death.

289
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,783
So I guess...

290
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,621
...you could say, yes,
a Christmas tree is a big deal.

291
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,955
Oh, my God.

292
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,834
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm sorry.

293
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,211
Pepe! Where are the ornaments?

294
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,004
I don't know.

295
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,422
My eyes are all fucked up.

296
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,634
You can't celebrate Christmas
with a naked tree! It's indecent!

297
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,677
Maria, forget about midnight Mass.

298
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,679
Tonight, we're decorating the tree.

299
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,223
Oh, Daddy, I wanted
to spend tonight in the city...

300
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,600
...with you guys.

301
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,893
Wait.

302
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,187
I got this.

303
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,483
I'll take care of the tree.
You have a family night in Manhattan.

304
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,443
No. No, no, no.

305
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,445
We brought the tree all the way down.

306
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,697
It has to look perfect
on Christmas morning.

307
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,369
Carlos, it will. Tell me exactly what
you want and I'll take care of it.

308
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,829
When you come back,
the tree will be decorated.

309
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,291
This house, I promise you,
is gonna be perfect.

310
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,887
Oh, B-T-dub, the girl tonight?
Her name is Mary.

311
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,139
As in the Virgin Mary.
How great is that?

312
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,891
What did Vanessa do to suck...

313
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,476
...the life out of you...

314
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,602
...this afternoon?

315
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,856
I don't have anyone else to confide in.
I might as well tell you. Uh...

316
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,525
Vanessa's pregnan-

317
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,484
A queefer.

318
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,569
- What?
- I knew it.

319
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,240
I used to date this black chick,
she used to queef every time we had sex.

320
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,368
It was ridiculous.
I used to call her Queen Laqueefa.

321
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,162
When was the last time
you saw this guy?

322
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,248
- Two years ago.
- So...

323
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,668
...why are we dropping off this package?
You said this guy was a chode.

324
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,838
He is, all right? I just-
I don't want his shooot in my place.

325
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,093
Sure this is the right address?

326
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,264
Whoa. Looks like your ex-boyf's
moving up in the world. Heh.

327
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,266
I guess.

328
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,102
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna drop this off.

329
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,707
flap!

330
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,630
Kumar?

331
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,800
Hello, Harold.

332
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,137
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,306
- Hey.
- I was-

334
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,683
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Oh, hey.

335
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,144
- How you doing?
- Good to see you too. Good.

336
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,648
You got a package that came for you
at the apartment. So I was dropping it off.

337
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,151
Oh. Okay, cool.

338
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,737
You look terrific. You lose weight?

339
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,449
No. Gained. Quite a bit, actually.
This is a really nice house.

340
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,577
No. You know.

341
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,372
Do you want to come in for a drink...

342
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,707
...or something?

343
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,000
Um...

344
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,545
Christmas, Christmas

345
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,755
Do you not have time?

346
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,923
- Oh.
- Oh.

347
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,511
- Come in, come in. Come in. Come on.
- Sure.

348
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,180
Watch your step, it's icy there.

349
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,767
Eggnog? Empanadas?

350
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,478
Uh... Sure. Yeah.

351
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,689
Hey, this place is, like, not shitty.

352
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,858
Oh. Thank you. Yeah.

353
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:35,238
Bay window is brand-new, actually.
We just put that in last week.

354
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,907
The sconces are new.
Sconces are actually brand-new.

355
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:43,412
Yeah, I was gonna say, it looks like
you guys got some awesome sconces.

356
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,706
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

357
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,209
So, what's up with this package?

358
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,462
My name and your address. That's weird.

359
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,297
I haven't lived there for so long.

360
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,049
I know. That's strange.

361
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,010
Whoa.

362
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,808
Ooh.

363
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,894
What the hell is this?

364
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,105
That's a gigantic joint.
What do you think?

365
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,523
Is this a joke?

366
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,733
- No. I swear.
- Did you do this?

367
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,777
Had I known, I would have smoked it.

368
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,571
Is there a-?

369
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,281
No return address.

370
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,617
I don't even see any stamps on this.

371
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,452
What are you doing?

372
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,412
Getting not low.

373
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,913
No smoking in this house.

374
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,332
What? What douche came up
with that rule?

375
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,293
This douche did.

376
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,926
That was good shooot.

377
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,803
I don't care, okay?

378
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,180
I don't smoke anymore.

379
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,806
- What?
- I just felt...

380
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,892
...that a lot of times when I got high...

381
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,186
...things would go really wrong. So...

382
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,355
But, Harold, weed is so good.

383
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,815
It gets you high.

384
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,567
I got nothing against weed, okay?

385
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,320
Had plenty of fun times with weed.
But I'm an adult now.

386
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,448
And frankly, I'm kind of glad that
the craziness is behind me.

387
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,700
Do you smell something burning?

388
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,119
Oh, shooot!

389
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,871
Oh, shooot.
- shooot.

390
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,289
shooot!

391
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,625
It's spreading. It's spreading!

392
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,126
Here.

393
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,295
Bah, bah, bah!
Not the throw pillows!

394
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,588
Seriously?

395
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,717
I did it anyway!

396
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,135
What the flap?!

397
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,059
shooot!

398
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,393
Maria's dad will kill me!

399
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,353
Stop yelling!

400
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,480
We gotta get rid of this tree!

401
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,190
Okay.

402
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,413
That's why you gotta buy those
faux trees. They last forever.

403
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,751
Calm down.
It's just a Christmas tree.

404
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,002
"Just a Christmas tree"?

405
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,380
Maria's dad grew that tree...

406
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,006
...and now it is dead.

407
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,468
Koreans have killed his mother,
and now this tree. Christmas is ruined.

408
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,844
Christmas isn't ruined.

409
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,888
Yes, it is. You have ruined Christmas.

410
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,641
They're gonna come home from Mass
and expect to see...

411
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,352
...a decorated tree,
but they are gonna see that.

412
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,397
Dude, you're overreacting.
There's plenty of tree lots.

413
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,941
We'll drive around
till we find the right tree.

414
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,442
We're not gonna do anything.

415
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,405
You know what? Um, this is my fault.

416
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,824
I take full responsibility.
Please leave.

417
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,118
I will take care of this. Thank you.

418
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,161
- I don't mind helping out-
- I got it.

419
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,913
- We have a van-
- I got it.

420
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,709
Okay. You got it.

421
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,295
- You need anything, just give me-
- Merry Christmas.

422
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,049
Merry Christmas, Harold.

423
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,847
What the flap took so long?

424
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,557
Nothing. Let's just go.

425
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,227
You never told me Harold was Asian.
I always pictured an old white guy.

426
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,902
Freeze! This is a robbery.
Give me all your friendship.

427
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,487
Oh, wow, look at that.

428
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,781
You know, it's kind of better
than a window.

429
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,950
It's like a stained-glass
window of paper.

430
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,285
Any luck with the tree?

431
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,746
- Oh, you brought Ava.
- Uh, yeah, sorry. I have Ava.

432
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,581
It's "3D."

433
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,290
Hmm?

434
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,458
Daddy-Daughter Day.

435
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,626
You can't back out
of Daddy-Daughter Day...

436
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,421
...because Emma says that
leads to abandonment issues...

437
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,090
...and then stripping and meth
and biker boyfriend.

438
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,425
- All bad things.
- Ah.

439
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,635
- The tree, though.
- Yes, so I called-

440
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,722
Oh, here it goes. Here it goes.

441
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,224
The itsy bitsy spider

442
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,601
Crawled up the water spout

443
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,144
They say that singing is...

444
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,438
...the best way to communicate
with a child.

445
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,898
I guess I haven't found...

446
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,608
...the right song for her yet.

447
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,610
That's too bad. Uh, the tree?

448
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,862
The tree. Right. So I called them.

449
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,447
They had one 12-foot fir left.

450
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,949
- And I reserved it.
- You got it?

451
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,952
- Yeah.
- Yes! You should have led off with that.

452
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,788
I know. I don't know why I didn't.

453
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,790
- Okay, good. Let's go.
- Whoo!

454
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,874
You know.

455
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,292
Okay. Next time.

456
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,673
Now, before this party...

457
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,468
- ... we got to talk about your game.
- Aw, dude, turn in there!

458
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,637
Really? A tree farm?

459
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,142
"Best selection"...

460
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,976
...my ass.

461
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,312
It's Christmas Eve, okay?
What do you expect?

462
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,688
If I was a tree farmer...

463
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,566
...I'd be embarrassed.
These trees are ghetto.

464
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,859
What the flap that mean?

465
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,905
He's just playing.
How you doing? I'm Latrell.

466
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,657
Hello. Kumar.

467
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,450
This is my partner in crime, Lamar.

468
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,411
- So you two own this tree lot?
What?

469
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,248
A couple of brothers can't sell trees?
Only swing from them like monkeys?

470
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,751
What? No! Of course not.
You could do both.

471
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,420
- What?
- What?

472
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,588
My boy here gets cagey
during the holidays.

473
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,674
- You know?
- Word. Word.

474
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,344
If you're looking for trees,
you should know we do custom work.

475
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,431
- Ooh. How much is that?
That tree? Sorry.

476
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,890
Just got reserved.

477
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,892
I really need it. I'll pay double.

478
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,436
Oh, I got you now.

479
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,021
You think you can buy
the black man's soul.

480
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,190
Like we some Wayne Brady-ass
niggers, right?

481
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,191
Triple.

482
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,901
I'll get the rope.

483
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,531
Eh, can we drop this tree off at Sulu's
and head to the city?

484
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,033
Just hold on a second, all right?

485
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,452
I see what you're doing.

486
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,911
Forget about her.

487
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,371
- Think about me.
- All right.

488
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,041
Hold on. We'll drop the tree off
and then we'll go get you your virgin.

489
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,626
Yeah.

490
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,922
We got another customer.

491
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,384
Can I play angry black guy this time?

492
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,261
Aw, come on. You just played it.

493
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,762
And I got triple the money.

494
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,806
Come on, please? Come on!

495
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,974
TODD
Three French hens

496
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,225
Would you stop?

497
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,393
I wish I could stop

498
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,769
Sorry, I'm trying my best

499
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,062
Hi. You guys in charge?

500
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:47,067
Yeah. What the flap is it to you,
motherfucker?

501
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,402
Gat's coming out

502
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,945
That was so good. Ha, ha.

503
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,490
We're just here to pick up a tree
that we reserved.

504
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,782
- We called.
Oh, yeah?

505
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,577
We just sold your little
punk-ass tree, bitch!

506
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,661
What? You sold it?

507
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,412
To who?

508
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,414
Those white boys over there.

509
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,918
flap!

510
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,793
Hey.

511
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,295
Aah! Where are we going?

512
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,507
Maybe if we catch up to them,
they'll sell the tree to us.

513
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,508
Good idea!

514
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,177
I'm sorry.

515
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,304
- You lost your gangsta grill.
- I know.

516
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,765
- How you gonna be a gangsta?
- I'm not one.

517
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,768
- I gotta wear those tomorrow.
- I know.

518
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,270
- You know I love you, right?
- I think you do.

519
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,648
- I don't know why, but I love you.
- Thank you.

520
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,192
Oh-ho-ho. Okay. Slow it down...

521
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,236
...because we got precious cargo...

522
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,363
...and it is very icy out there.

523
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,449
- What? I don't see any ice.
- You've never heard of black ice?

524
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,661
It's like the worst ice there is.
Black ice, it's everywhere.

525
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,955
Relax. I can feel the road.
It's not that bad.

526
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,832
Yo, slow down, man.

527
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,127
- You're going a little fast.
- I gotta get to this party ASAP.

528
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,672
Pussy's not like yogurt.
It has an expiration date.

529
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,465
Yogurt has an expiration date.

530
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,468
Does it? Damn it. Okay.
That explains a lot.

531
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,303
It was really sour.

532
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,472
But yogurt is sour,
so how was I to know?

533
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,975
Are you really hot? I'm, like, hot...

534
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,351
...but I'm cold- Hello?

535
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,852
You're not looking at me.

536
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,105
I should look at the road
and you look at me.

537
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,439
- It's opposite.
- Watch out!

538
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,732
Ow, ow.

539
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,486
Holy shooot!

540
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,320
Black ice!

541
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,530
Black ice! It's real!

542
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,323
Oh, shooot!

543
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,950
Oh, my God!

544
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,743
Don't just scream!

545
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,036
You're just screaming!

546
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,162
That's not helpful!

547
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh, shooot!

548
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,050
Holy shooot!

549
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,176
Oh, Harry, stop!

550
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,847
Aw... Glass is sharp. Glass is sharp.

551
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,852
Oh, my ass.

552
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,023
I am so going to tweet about that.
Heh-heh-heh.

553
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,191
You guys all right?
How are you alive?

554
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,526
Harold?

555
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,028
Kumar?

556
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,614
That was you at the tree farm?
You took my tree?

557
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,700
- So you killed two trees in one night.
Hold on.

558
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,744
That is a perfectly salvageable tree.

559
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,207
That was a perfectly salvageable tree.

560
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,378
That was the only 12-foot Fraser fir
left in the flaping state.

561
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,296
flap your tree!

562
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,547
What about my car?

563
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,882
I got a virgin to flap!

564
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,508
Who is this? Who is Glasses?

565
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,552
Heh. Nice, Harry.

566
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,388
- This is my friend, Adrian.
Oh.

567
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,765
He's young.

568
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,475
- Thank you.
- Don't respond to him.

569
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,101
Why the H...

570
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,895
...did you F-wads...

571
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,066
...take the tree that we had
specifically called and reserved?

572
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,400
Who is this toolbox?

573
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,569
This is my friend, Todd.

574
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,738
Oh, yeah? What kind of friend?
Best friend?

575
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,075
- I wouldn't say best- Yes.
- Yeah. Yep. Besties.

576
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,910
That's awesome.

577
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,161
Buddy.

578
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,537
Homey.

579
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,331
This was fun. But I got...

580
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,916
...a hot date in the city.

581
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,250
You have to take me.

582
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,418
What? No.

583
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,505
- We're not taking you anywhere.
- Not going through any tunnels.

584
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,299
Dude, you are not depriving me of this:

585
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,761
Hey, Adrian.
I can't wait to finally meet you.

586
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,472
I'm going to rock your world.

587
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,307
I promise...

588
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,059
...it will be worth the wait.

589
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,438
Wait, look at this fir.

590
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,482
I'm pretty sure she's completely shaved.

591
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,942
Shut up. The tree.

592
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,527
It's like Maria's dad's tree.

593
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,946
- It's magnificent.
I'll make you a deal.

594
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,198
Take me to the party,
I get you that tree.

595
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,783
No. It's already very late.

596
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,201
Shut the flap up, Todd!

597
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,786
This doesn't concern you!

598
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,955
- Easy.
- He can not- He is not allow-

599
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,832
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

600
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm running out of time.
I gotta be back with a tree by 2 a. m.

601
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,045
Work with me. Listen.

602
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,505
I'm not driving for nothing.

603
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,799
Make sure we can get the tree,
you got a deal.

604
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,633
Done.

605
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,510
Hey, douche?

606
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,261
Yeah?

607
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:42,970
Shotgun.

608
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:43,846
Oh.

609
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,305
Scr-

610
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,974
S you. S you.

611
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,310
"S"?

612
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,979
- "S you"?
- "Screw you. "

613
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,605
- Oh, right.
Screw you!

614
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,818
"Harry"? Gotta be kidding me.

615
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,779
The tree is removable?

616
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,865
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

617
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,784
- Great. Okay, great. Bye. We're good.
- Please hang up-

618
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,910
We can have the tree?

619
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,078
She said it?

620
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,329
She said that, yes.

621
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,707
- Great. Let's go.
- Okay.

622
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,045
What is he doing? What is he doing?

623
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,630
What are you doing?

624
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:19,882
What?

625
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,341
My daughter's in there!

626
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,050
What?

627
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,511
- Oh, shooot!
What the flap, Kumar?

628
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,721
I didn't see her.

629
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,097
You got my baby high!

630
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,057
You got his baby high.

631
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,392
Hold on a second.

632
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,021
Nobody gets high the first time they
smoke weed. Don't you know anything?

633
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,899
Okay, great.

634
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,942
Now she has the giggles.

635
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,986
- Sorry.
If Emma finds out...

636
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,196
...we won't be able...

637
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,572
...to come to the party.

638
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,656
What party?

639
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,575
Oh, it's just a work...

640
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,701
...Christmas party...

641
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,077
...kind of thing.

642
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:49,870
Right, Todd?

643
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,497
Yeah. It's gonna be...

644
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,706
...classic.

645
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,959
Okay, great. Now she's having a bad trip.

646
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,294
Try singing again.

647
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,712
It never works.

648
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,380
- Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?

649
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,382
Hey.

650
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,551
If you want beef, then bring the ruckus

651
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,136
Wu-Tang Clan ain't

652
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,387
Nothin' to flap with

653
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,472
Straight from

654
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,390
The motherfucking slums that's busted

655
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,059
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothin' to flap with

656
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,060
Ahh.

657
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,814
Dude, you baby-whispered her.

658
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,816
I do not care for the language...

659
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,317
...but that was impressive.

660
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,610
What singing group...

661
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,237
- ... is that?
- The Wu-Tang Clan.

662
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,322
The Gu-Ga- The Wu-Gang Band?

663
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,157
Wu-Tang Clan, Todd.

664
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:27,950
Harry.

665
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,577
When did you turn into
Mr. Rap-Hop-Expert?

666
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,246
There's a lot you don't know...

667
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,205
...about Harry, huh?

668
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,581
Excuse me?

669
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,583
- Was that directed to me?
Yeah, douche.

670
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,126
Okay. Taken.

671
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,421
I got the munchies.

672
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,548
Now we have to...

673
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,967
...stop and get some
disgusting food for her.

674
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,011
So she can come down
from her trip. Fantastic.

675
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,828
Oh, by the way, if anybody asks,
I'm Robert Pattinson's acting coach.

676
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,996
- What?
- What?

677
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,207
It's just this lie I sort of got caught in.

678
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,835
Also, I told her you work
for the White House.

679
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,628
Yeah, like anyone's gonna believe that.

680
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,010
It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I

681
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,220
Well, I spy with my little eye...

682
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,307
...three felonies that I can see
in this room right now.

683
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,308
Four.

684
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,519
That's it. That's our tree. It's perfect.

685
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,479
- It's better than the photograph.
- Ha, ha.

686
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,647
It's perfect.

687
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,440
Hey, Glasses.

688
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,693
- Find the girl, get the tree. Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,487
Yo, yo, yo!

690
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,907
What it is, pimp, player...

691
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,866
...et cetera?

692
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,452
- What's up? Where's Mary?
I don't know...

693
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,371
...dude, but if I was you,
I would steer clear.

694
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,498
Does she have a tail
or something? What?

695
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,960
Don't listen to these guys.
It takes balls to do what you're doing.

696
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,128
You're freaking me out.

697
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,880
- What is wrong with her?
Ha-ha-ha.

698
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,673
Oh, my God. Adrian, is that you?

699
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,193
Wow, you look just like...

700
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,361
...your profile pic.

701
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,029
You look better. Hi.

702
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,531
You're hot, girl.

703
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,866
Thank you.

704
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,870
So do you, like, want to see my room?

705
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,538
Hey, hey. What about the tree?

706
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,581
I'll get it.

707
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,709
Just give me a minute,
all right, man? Probably less. Heh.

708
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,086
But hopefully more. Heh.

709
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,545
Probably less.

710
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,922
You owe me a tree, punk.

711
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,301
Ugh. Ugh.

712
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,971
Oh, great. Great. This is just great.

713
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,723
- I've got to find a place to change a diaper.
- Oh, God.

714
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,602
Unless, of course, Mr. Wu-Gang Clams
would like to help with some poopy?

715
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,770
Wu-Tang, dude.

716
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,729
Woo-hoo.

717
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,066
Your little friend better get me a tree.

718
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,235
I'm sorry about him, dude. I-

719
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,780
Hey, grandpa!

720
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,657
- Toss it back.
Who you calling...

721
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,909
...grandpa, dude? I'm barely 30.

722
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,786
Wanna start? I'll kick your ass...

723
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,954
...right now.

724
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,247
Karate Kid style.

725
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,039
Really?

726
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,000
Which Karate Kid are you referring to?

727
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,337
There's only one Karate Kid and it stars
Jackie Chan and my man Jaden Smith.

728
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,505
What?

729
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,257
Generation Z, here's your ball.

730
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,845
Who invited these flaping losers?

731
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,847
Listen, we're friends of Mary, okay?

732
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,808
She promised us we could have that tree.
Okay? Thank you.

733
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,767
What?

734
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,769
flap that! I don't care...

735
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,772
...what my sister said.
I'm not letting you take our tree.

736
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,774
Uh, actually, you are, you fuckstain.

737
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,109
Come on.

738
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,820
We're here to pick up the tree,
then we're out of here.

739
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,280
It's a bit of an emergency.

740
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,532
Tell you what, we'll play you for it.

741
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,783
If you beat us...

742
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,035
...you get the tree.

743
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,456
If we beat you, we kick your asses out and
take all your motherfucking cash. Ha, ha.

744
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,208
I'm sorry, do you want us
to play you in beer pong?

745
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,961
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess you guys
haven't heard of it before.

746
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:08,920
Oh, no, no.

747
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,630
We've heard of it, dude. Yeah.

748
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,300
Except, see, in our day,
it was called Beirut.

749
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,343
And we didn't have the rollback rule...

750
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,970
...like you pussies have today.

751
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,516
I remember the day they announced the rule.
Same day I kicked a little bitch's ass at it.

752
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,769
You remind me a lot of that guy...

753
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,479
...except you're shorter.

754
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,980
And he had pubes.

755
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,523
Oh, my God. I'm so excited.

756
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,525
All my other friends...

757
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,486
...lost their virginity in 7th grade.

758
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,154
I can't believe it's happening.

759
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,657
What's the deal? Why isn't everybody
at school trying to sleep with you?

760
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,494
Are you kidding? No guy at school
will even touch me.

761
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,745
Why won't they?

762
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,580
Probably because they're scared.

763
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,499
Well, I don't get scared.

764
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,834
Scared of-
What are they scared of, though?

765
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,503
Hey! Enough talk.

766
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:53,924
Gonna hit this?

767
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,842
Yes. I will. Hit it.

768
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,013
Aah. It's not a disease, is it? Heh, heh.

769
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,182
- What?
- Never mind. Heh.

770
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,351
Forget it. Heh.

771
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,397
Okay, Daddy's gonna get you changed.
Daddy is gonna get you-

772
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,775
Aah! Okay, I need this room...

773
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,153
...for a serious diaper situation.
So I will ask you to stop...

774
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,031
- ... doing that.
- Smush that pussy! Unh!

775
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:18,949
Smush my pussy!

776
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:19,866
I'm coming!

777
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,701
- Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm coming!

778
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,995
Baby, blow me.

779
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,623
Ugh.

780
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,420
A boom batta, these pockets...

781
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,547
...getting fatter.

782
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,339
You guys...

783
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,799
...got nothing on me.

784
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,885
Dude, I need this tree.

785
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,512
I know.

786
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,306
- We hit this, we win.
No matter. There's no way...

787
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,892
...you sinking this ball.
Not in my house.

788
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,061
Shut this motherfucker up,
would you?

789
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,734
- Time.
- What?

790
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,905
Show him the old "Roldy Roll. "

791
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,491
It's too risky.
I haven't done that in forever.

792
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,244
No, dude, come on. You got this. Feel it.

793
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,962
Hello, old friend.

794
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:16,923
Clear.

795
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,030
We won!

796
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,781
Who are those guys?

797
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,784
I don't know,
but they're flaping studs.

798
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,628
I know this is your first time,
so I'm gonna be extra gentle.

799
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,633
Who's that?

800
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,551
Oh, that's just my dad.

801
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,346
Why does he look...

802
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,555
...so familiar?

803
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,012
That's not good. No.

804
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,181
Hey, are we gonna do this or what?

805
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,517
Yeah, we are, but your dad
is Sergei Katsov? Heh.

806
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,561
Not again. Oh, my God.
This happens every goddamn time.

807
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,562
No, no, no.

808
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,689
Give your dick.

809
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,482
Aah, aah. Hey! Whoa.

810
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,525
Wait, I almost got it.

811
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,194
It really hurts.
You're digging your nails into it! Aah!

812
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,697
Are you going soft on me?

813
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,739
Uh-uh.

814
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,366
You better not go soft on me!

815
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,034
I'm not, it's just hard.

816
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,703
Aah! And it really, really hurts.

817
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,746
Stop, just give me a two-minute break. Aah!

818
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,248
So how do we do this?

819
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,126
There's gotta be
a freight elevator or something.

820
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,170
- We take the ornaments off, or...?
- We could.

821
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,466
Hey, guys. I just wanted to say
that was an epic match.

822
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,385
- Good win.
- Thanks, kid.

823
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,095
I'm sorry I was such a dick...

824
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,723
...to you guys.
I thought you were old assholes.

825
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,558
But real talk...

826
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,227
...you guys are pretty cool. So cheers.

827
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,063
- Thanks.
- No, no. Come on. Don't.

828
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,483
Roldy, the kid is acknowledging
the error of his ways. Respect that.

829
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,571
Come on, man, it's Christmas.

830
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,156
Thanks, kid.

831
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,782
- All right.
- Cheers.

832
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,451
Cheers.
- Cheers.

833
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,495
Mm. It's good.

834
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,458
Why don't you guys just sit down
and I'll get that tree all wrapped up for you.

835
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,917
- Thank you.
- Thanks, man.

836
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,085
Appreciate it.

837
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,006
Diaper emergency! Aah! Cocaine!

838
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,382
Have you kids...

839
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,177
...never seen VH1's Behind the Music?

840
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,511
Do you not know...

841
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,766
...what cocaine can do to the mind
of a person as young as you?

842
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,362
Unh, reporting live from the kitchen

843
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,113
With a brand-new swag

844
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,823
Dude, do you feel kind of weird?

845
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,868
Yeah, I do, actually.
My face is feeling kind of numb.

846
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,119
Oh, flap.

847
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,788
The kids put something in here.

848
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,498
Was it drugs? Was it semen?

849
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,835
It doesn't taste like semen.

850
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,338
Uh! You flaping...

851
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,340
- ... loser!
- Give me another chance!

852
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,966
I'm begging you!

853
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,177
I'm really, really, really sorry!

854
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,640
That we had sex too well too often.

855
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,975
"Sorry" doesn't pop my cherry.

856
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,102
Somebody is gonna...

857
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,646
...flap me tonight! You!

858
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,899
Oh, no. Ha. Married.

859
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,484
- He's single.
- Hi. Kumar.

860
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,777
I don't date black guys.

861
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,320
- What? Whoa!
Unh!

862
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,406
- What are you doing?
Getting you ready.

863
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,324
- Get her off me!
- Right, sorry, sorry!

864
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,867
Uh, I'm not gonna let you...

865
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,787
...rape my friend on Christmas Eve.
He's married.

866
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,004
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

867
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,589
Who the flap are you?

868
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,514
Stop resisting.

869
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,932
Push harder, dude!

870
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,142
I am doing it!

871
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,184
I can't get her...

872
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,478
- ... off!
Oh, God!

873
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,773
Mariana?

874
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,568
Daddy.

875
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,903
Daddy.

876
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,449
That's Sergei...

877
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,783
...Katsov.

878
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,784
I know, dude.

879
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,161
Start talking.

880
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,704
- Start talking.
- Okay.

881
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,457
She-

882
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,875
Start talking! Now!

883
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,879
Sir. Hi. My name is Kumar, this is Harold.
It's very nice to meet you.

884
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,381
Um, I know this is gonna be hard
for you to believe...

885
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,551
...but your daughter, sir, was the one
who was trying to rape us.

886
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,719
She's the raper.

887
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,721
No! No, no, no! That is not true, Daddy.

888
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,307
These men came in here,
I didn't know who they were.

889
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,933
I think that they got me drunk.

890
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,894
No. Miss? Miss? That's incorrect.

891
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,437
You got my daughter drunk?

892
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,898
Sir, if I may. This is all a big...

893
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,733
Let me pull my pants up.

894
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,443
It's all a big misunderstanding.

895
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,737
Your children threw the party.

896
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:36,075
We have nothing to do with all the drugs
and all the alcohol.

897
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,286
Okay, listen up!

898
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,370
Party's over!

899
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,371
My baby...

900
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,708
- ... is fucked on cocaine!
I've heard enough.

901
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:44,834
Gustav.

902
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,629
- What? Oh, shooot!
- No! No!

903
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,923
Why does it always have to be "Gustav"?

904
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,675
- Why not "Yuri and Gustav, kill them"?
- He means both.

905
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,260
Why can't he say both of us?

906
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,762
Both of you...

907
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,431
...kill them. Kill them all!

908
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,768
- Aah!
Go!

909
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,602
Now!

910
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,771
Unh, ah! Ava!

911
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,731
Come with me if you wanna live!

912
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,066
What? No, no!

913
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:08,775
No, no, no!

914
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,980
Aah. Where's my baby?

915
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,189
- Ava! Ava!
- Shh!

916
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,650
Where could my baby be?
Where's my baby?

917
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,489
Your coke baby has superpowers.

918
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,744
- That was close.
- I know, right?

919
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,831
Were you starting to trip out a little bit?

920
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,210
Because I think I was starting
to trip out back there a little bit.

921
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,755
Yeah, definitely, man. I think there
was something in the eggnog.

922
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,340
It's pretty flaping sweet.

923
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,383
Don't worry.

924
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,343
I'm pretty sure it's wearing off.

925
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,514
Or maybe not?

926
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,017
Holy shooot! Dude, you're Claymated!

927
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,685
Ha-ha-ha. So are you!

928
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,894
So is he.

929
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,646
What's up, blood?

930
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,775
Dude, everything's Claymated!

931
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,027
flap you!

932
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,361
This is great!

933
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,531
No, it's not! How am I supposed
to get a tree now? I'm made of clay.

934
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,074
Ooh, hold on. I have an idea.

935
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,075
What the hell-?

936
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,368
Yah!

937
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,412
Clay cocks!
- Put your cock away.

938
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,041
Dude, relax. It's gonna wear off soon.

939
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,711
Dude, are you seeing what I'm seeing?

940
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,795
What the flap?

941
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,798
Don't worry, nothing bad
ever happens in Claymation.

942
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,676
Whoa!

943
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,053
shooot!

944
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,220
flap!

945
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,813
Dude, look out!

946
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,665
Come on, let's hide...

947
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,582
...in that tree.

948
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,708
Dude, come on!

949
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,715
Aww.

950
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,176
Hey, little guy.

951
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:44,263
Just wanna take you home
and cuddle with you all night long.

952
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,265
You hungry?

953
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,147
flap me!

954
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,943
Mommy!

955
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,152
Hold me!

956
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,612
- Roldy!
- Kumar!

957
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,115
- What the hell's the matter?
What are you doing?

958
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,117
- Rosenberg.
- Goldstein?

959
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,954
We were doing last-minute shopping
with my boy here when we saw you...

960
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,956
...tearing that snowman a new tuchus.

961
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,791
You are gonna catch your death...

962
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,127
...of cold out here.
Let's get you a nice meal.

963
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,129
Is there somewhere we can eat?

964
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,890
This is why I tell you not
to have people over.

965
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:32,854
Every single other person
got out of here except for us.

966
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,148
- I knew you'd bring that up.
- You grabbed me.

967
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,567
You said, "Come with me
if you want to live. "

968
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,740
- Man, I don't think that's okay.
- It's fine.

969
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,325
It's not fine! My baby's on cocaine.

970
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,369
I'm on cocaine.

971
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,788
I'm addicted to cocaine.

972
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,334
Yo! Idiots!

973
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,837
I want you to find...

974
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,298
...the men who violated...

975
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,841
...my daughter...

976
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,343
...and I want you to flaping kill them!

977
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,347
- Still hits the spot.
I know, right?

978
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,851
Oh, I almost forgot. Harold,
my Uncle Yoav, he threw his back out.

979
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,686
So me and him, we're not gonna...

980
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,521
...be able to make your party.

981
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,398
- I'm so sorry about that.
- It's okay.

982
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:21,360
There's not really a- We should get going.
We got a Christmas tree emergency.

983
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,864
I don't understand what it is
with you people and your trees.

984
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,032
For us Christians...

985
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,868
...the tree is a very important
part of our holiday.

986
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,953
Okay, don't start with this. All right?

987
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:36,042
Just because your wife made you convert
doesn't mean you're not a Jew!

988
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,545
His name is Seth Goldstein.
For Christ's sake!

989
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,839
First of all, don't ever take the Lord's...

990
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,424
...name in vain. Secondly...

991
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,967
...I was baptized, bitch!

992
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,803
The second the priest...

993
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,679
...poured that holy water over me...

994
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,766
...all my Jewish neurosis and self-hatred
just washed right off.

995
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,143
Sounds like you're enjoying
your new religion.

996
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,561
Dude, it's the balls.

997
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,355
These dirty Jew bastards have...

998
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,065
...no idea what they're missing.

999
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,275
Fishing! Hunting!
I tie knots on a sailboat.

1000
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,860
I made terrible investments...

1001
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,487
...doesn't bother me a bit.

1002
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,239
And guess what. Next week...

1003
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,825
...I have an appointment
to get uncircumcised.

1004
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,619
That's right, I'm gonna get my snozzle.

1005
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:15,581
Guys, I'd love to stay and chat
but I gotta go get this tree.

1006
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,250
Christmas tree! Christmas tree!

1007
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,880
It's glorious. Isn't it Christian?

1008
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,590
Great to see you guys.

1009
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,425
See you, guys.
No, wait.

1010
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,677
Excuse me!

1011
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:31,097
You still owe me 87 cents
for that jalapeño cheeseburger!

1012
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,017
Ah! Guess that holy water didn't
wash everything off, now did it?

1013
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,271
God, that tree is perfect.

1014
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,522
Let's go check it out.

1015
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,940
Tickets, please.

1016
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,692
I'm sorry, we don't have tickets.

1017
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,026
They sold out months ago.

1018
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,612
- But-
- Step aside, please.

1019
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,948
I said step aside.

1020
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,785
shooot.

1021
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,831
You know what? flap it,
it's almost midnight. I give up.

1022
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,124
You can't give up yet.

1023
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,126
Look...

1024
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,920
...I have an idea on how we might
get that tree out.

1025
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,714
- What?
- It's not gonna be easy.

1026
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,841
But this may be
the last chance we've got.

1027
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:08,968
Here's what we do.

1028
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,388
First, we need to steal some tickets.

1029
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,141
Then I slip off to the side
and take out the archbishop.

1030
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,936
I head down
to the nuns' shower room.

1031
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,316
I didn't know the nuns
all showered in the same room.

1032
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,359
How do you think they stay so clean?

1033
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,531
While the nuns are lezzing it out,
I'm gonna snag the key to the back room.

1034
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,158
What back room?

1035
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,661
The back room that the priests
are guarding. Am I going too fast?

1036
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,829
- No.
- Okay, good.

1037
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,831
You're in charge of distracting them.

1038
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,166
How the hell do I do that?

1039
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,501
That's easy, you'll just use
our secret weapon.

1040
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:47,173
Pillow fight in the altar boys' room.
Last one there's a rotten egg.

1041
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,677
Once the coast is clear, we use
the key to get into the back room.

1042
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,346
I guard while you kill the power.

1043
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,681
While everyone's trying
to turn the power on...

1044
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,808
...you and I will get the tree.

1045
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,728
We take it to your place,
and when Maria's dad comes home...

1046
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,772
...and sees this beautiful tree...

1047
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,191
...in your living room,
he'll jizz all over it.

1048
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,735
What do you think?

1049
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,029
Uncle Harold.

1050
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,949
I think I see Uncle Harold over there.

1051
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,242
What do you mean,
you see Uncle Harold?

1052
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,082
Baby?

1053
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,042
Oh, sorry, sir.

1054
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,293
It's okay, baby.

1055
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,046
They all look alike to me too.
Ha-ha-ha.

1056
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:33,135
flap! Midnight Mass.
Is it midnight already? flaping midnight!

1057
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,553
Running out of time.

1058
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,056
Wait, wait, wait!
What the hell are we doing?

1059
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,475
Hold on. What the hell's going on?

1060
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,603
He almost spotted us!
I'm supposed to be at home with the tree.

1061
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,064
But why are you making
such a big deal about this?

1062
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,400
Because it is a big deal.

1063
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,069
Who gives a shooot what
your father-in-law thinks?

1064
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,240
I give a shooot what my father-in-law thinks.
You wouldn't understand.

1065
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,743
No, dude, I don't understand.

1066
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,414
You got a great job, you make good money,
you don't beat your wife.

1067
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,749
What more could a Latino
father-in-law ask for?

1068
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,543
- Well...
- If I were you...

1069
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,753
...I'd tell him to eat
a cockmeat sandwich.

1070
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,840
You should not go through...

1071
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,758
...all this just to make him happy.

1072
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,094
You're right, I don't have to.

1073
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,096
I want to.

1074
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:21,517
I want him to be happy
because I want Maria to be happy.

1075
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,603
Because what makes Maria happy
is what makes me happy.

1076
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,063
Don't you get it?

1077
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,566
I don't have to be doing this.

1078
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,776
I wanna be doing this.

1079
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,612
What the flap?

1080
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,615
Smoke break ended 10 minutes ago!
We need all bodies on-stage!

1081
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,912
Oh, my God, you guys aren't even
dressed? Jesus flaping Christ!

1082
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,122
You have the wrong people.

1083
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,290
Wardrobe!

1084
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,084
Go! Come on, come on, come on!
Shut up!

1085
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,672
Ma'am, you seem like
a very nice person.

1086
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,132
Go! Move!

1087
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,592
flaping actors.

1088
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,428
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

1089
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,305
...without further ado...

1090
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,098
- ... the man...
- Look at these firs.

1091
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,808
...you've all been waiting for:

1092
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,310
America's sweetheart!

1093
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,311
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

1094
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,479
Holy shooot. Neil.

1095
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,231
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

1096
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,524
Dance.

1097
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,525
What?

1098
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,319
Blend. Blend. Blend.

1099
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,361
Harold. Wait!

1100
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,156
Don we now our gay apparel

1101
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,992
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

1102
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,328
Troll the ancient yuletide carol

1103
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,038
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la

1104
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,248
La-la!

1105
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,839
You better watch out
You better not cry

1106
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,383
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why

1107
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,803
Santa Claus is comin'

1108
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,554
To town

1109
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,849
He sees you when you're sleeping

1110
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,184
He knows when you're awake

1111
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,896
Oh, my God!

1112
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,232
So be good for goodness' sake

1113
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,658
Santa Claus is comin' to town

1114
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,999
WAFFLEBOTS
I played my drum for him

1115
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,876
Pa rum pum pum pum

1116
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,839
Then he

1117
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,257
Smiled at me

1118
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,509
Pa rum pum pum pum

1119
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,220
Me and my drum

1120
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:37,570
We wish you a merry Christmas

1121
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,030
And a happy New Year

1122
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:47,079
We wish you a merry Christmas

1123
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,957
And a happy

1124
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:55,254
New Year

1125
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,595
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1126
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,057
All right, that's a cut. Great job.

1127
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,310
Great job.
I've just got a few notes, okay?

1128
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,604
Just gonna come on the stage.

1129
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,938
Oh, God.

1130
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,899
flaping tight jeans.

1131
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:21,447
NPH, ha, ha. You are absolutely bringing
the heat, and you are bringing it hard.

1132
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,949
You're a dream, but unfortunately...

1133
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,118
...these backup blowjob artists...

1134
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,454
...are ruining everything!

1135
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,955
I can run it again.

1136
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:33,459
No, no, no. No, you skedaddle.
Go and get some rest, huh?

1137
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,461
Make yourself fresh, okay? Ha, ha.

1138
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,963
Damn it!

1139
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,844
Hey, Gracie, chin up.

1140
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,013
Happens to the best of us.
You up for...

1141
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,098
- ... one-on-one rehearsing later?
Wait.

1142
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,017
You know my name?

1143
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:54,271
Of course. You're doing great.
I thought we could work on a thing or two.

1144
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,316
- In my dressing room, five minutes.
- Yes!

1145
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,110
Thank you so much, Mr. Patrick Harris.

1146
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,030
- I'll get changed and be right over.
- I'll see you then.

1147
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,826
You really think Neil can
get us one of those trees?

1148
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,496
After all we've been through
with that guy, he better.

1149
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,997
No shooot.

1150
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,083
Neil, Neil, Neil, Dan Frye.

1151
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,503
Hollywood Hearsay.
Is it true that you're replacing Regis?

1152
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,837
It'll be tough between...

1153
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,674
...How I Met Your Mother
and charity work, but we'll see.

1154
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,802
Oh, wow. And you stunned fans
when you said you were gay.

1155
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,055
How has this affected your relationship
with your partner, David?

1156
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,683
Well, maybe this'll answer
your question.

1157
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,644
So hot, NPH.

1158
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,522
Mm, mm. Ha-ha-ha.
Hey. How about that?

1159
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,315
Thank you. I love you guys.

1160
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,527
Ugh. What did I tell you
about using tongue?

1161
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,529
You wanted it to look realistic.

1162
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,407
Yeah, realistic, not flaping gay as shooot.

1163
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,493
The only reason I put up
with this homo crap is for the p-tang.

1164
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,995
flap this! I got a wife...

1165
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,788
...and kid. I'm out of here.

1166
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,998
Wait, man.

1167
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,249
What about the stuff?

1168
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,875
What stuff?
- The stuff.

1169
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,168
Give me the stuff.

1170
00:54:58,878 --> 00:54:59,712
This stuff?

1171
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:01,839
Oh, yeah.

1172
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,549
You'd like this bag of crack.

1173
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,508
Wouldn't you?

1174
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,344
Well, maybe I should give it
to someone else.

1175
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,513
You know I got Fred Savage
on speed dial.

1176
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,849
flap Savage! That rock is mine!

1177
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,894
Give it to me. Come on, David,
give me the stuff. Give me the sugar.

1178
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,230
- Put money in my account.
- You got it. Done.

1179
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,191
- And sing at my niece's quinceañera.
- All right, I'll sing.

1180
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,235
- You can't flap her!
- I can't promise.

1181
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,403
- Fine.
- No! All right!

1182
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,362
I won't flap her!

1183
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,281
Just let me have the rock.

1184
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,365
Excuse me, Neil?

1185
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,658
Oh. Oh, this is-

1186
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,035
I can come back later.

1187
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,455
- No! No, I'm heading out. Ha, ha.
- No, we were just- Hi.

1188
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,373
Bye-bye, sweet pea.

1189
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,459
- You behave yourself, peaches. Ha-ha-ha.
Always.

1190
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,918
You guys are too cute.

1191
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:40,836
flap you.

1192
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:41,587
I do love...

1193
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,339
...that handsome man.

1194
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,132
Thank you so much for this...

1195
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,092
...opportunity to work with you.

1196
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,260
Sure. Come on in.

1197
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,887
What would you like to rehearse?

1198
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,181
Oh. Nothing specific.
Just some general stuff.

1199
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,933
You seemed tense.
I thought we could loosen you up.

1200
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,268
Take your sweater off.

1201
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,437
Oh, no, no.

1202
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,813
For a massage. Heh.

1203
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,399
David'll tell you,
these hands are magical.

1204
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,778
Well, I don't really have
anything on underneath, so...

1205
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,072
Oh, it's okay.
It's just a couple girlfriends.

1206
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,116
Now take it off.

1207
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,743
Okay.

1208
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,415
Why don't you lay on the bed?

1209
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,802
- Ow.
- Sorry.

1210
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,265
Feels good.

1211
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,142
Yeah, it does feel good.

1212
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,353
I can't... I can't...

1213
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,189
- Can I take this bra off?
- Um...

1214
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,817
- It's okay. Girlfriends.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1215
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,944
That's better.

1216
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,612
Should we do something?

1217
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,490
I don't know, I kind of wanna see
what happens next.

1218
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:52,950
Feels good.

1219
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,326
Oh, it's so hard.

1220
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,787
This knot on your back is so hard.

1221
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,622
Look, don't be alarmed...

1222
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,877
...but I'm gonna squirt some lotion
on your back in about...

1223
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,629
...35 seconds.

1224
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:06,672
Excuse me?

1225
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,048
- Shut up.
- What the flap?

1226
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,341
Shut the flap up!

1227
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,634
Get the flap off of me!

1228
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,678
You like it rough? I can play that way.

1229
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,513
God! I thought you were gay!

1230
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,181
I am gay. Gay for that pussy.

1231
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,349
Oh!

1232
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,560
I don't know what sick game
you're playing...

1233
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,979
...but touch me again,
I'll rip your dick off!

1234
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,570
Morty, Kumar, long time.

1235
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,740
It's Harold, actually.

1236
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,409
Ha-ha-ha. Of course it is.

1237
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,869
Come on, have a seat.

1238
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,539
How long has it been?
You two look great. Have you lost weight?

1239
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,332
Is that Hugo Boss? I love it.

1240
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,543
Well, thanks. Listen, um...

1241
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,880
Would you like a waffle, Mr. Harris?

1242
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,715
Shut up!

1243
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,883
God, I hate this...

1244
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,051
...flaping PancakeBot thing.

1245
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,720
Dude, it's a WaffleBot.

1246
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,013
They're awesome.

1247
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:56,763
WaffleThing.

1248
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,056
Get the flap...

1249
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,558
...out of my life!

1250
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,852
Ouch.

1251
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,396
Anyway...

1252
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,065
...what can I do for you,
my burglars of turd?

1253
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,401
Time-the-flap-out.
How are you still alive?

1254
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,736
Yeah, how the flap?

1255
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,446
What are you talking about?

1256
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,780
We saw you get shot.

1257
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,074
You have to be more specific.

1258
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,117
In that whorehouse.

1259
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:17,910
In Texas.

1260
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,453
You branded a prostitute.

1261
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,204
Remember?

1262
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,206
Oh, yeah!

1263
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,541
Now I remember.

1264
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,043
It hurt like hell...

1265
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,044
...at first.

1266
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:27,961
And then...

1267
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,715
...everything faded away.

1268
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,592
And I went to heaven.

1269
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,386
It was exactly...

1270
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,596
...like I imagined it.

1271
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,766
Saint Peter was there...

1272
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,934
...to meet me.

1273
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,602
Whoa. No way!

1274
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,270
- NPH?
- Yup.

1275
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,607
Make room! Make room! VIP!

1276
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,445
The chicks were hot.
The music was sick.

1277
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,113
There were lasers.

1278
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,990
It was like being famous...

1279
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,326
...in the early '90s. I was about to...

1280
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,161
...get my drink on, when I was...

1281
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,205
...interrupted by some dirty hippie.

1282
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,791
Neil Patrick Harris. My man.

1283
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,960
I'm sure you recognize me...

1284
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,587
...but I'm Jesus. So...

1285
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,172
Jesus...?

1286
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,800
Jesus Christ. That's me.
I'm Jesus Christ, Neil.

1287
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,760
Hey, ladies.

1288
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,388
Neil Patrick Harris.
I played Private Carl Jenkins...

1289
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,973
...in Starship Troopers.

1290
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:21,974
Wow.

1291
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,309
I love that movie. Cool, cool. Awesome.

1292
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,311
Let's get shots.
Keep the party going.

1293
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,354
- Who's in?
- Shots.

1294
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,230
So, girls...

1295
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,901
Aw, come on.

1296
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,361
How did that happen already?

1297
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,198
Give me the phone to Dad.

1298
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,201
This is God.
- Daddy?

1299
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,078
We need to 86 NPH ASAP.

1300
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,997
He's getting a handjob in my club.

1301
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,127
Jesus, what a cockblock.

1302
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,462
Doesn't explain the gay thing.

1303
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,964
You're not gay, motherfucker.

1304
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:54,840
At all.

1305
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,678
That's a little something
we magicians call "misdirection. "

1306
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,054
Little trick I learned...

1307
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,222
- ... from Clay Aiken.
What?

1308
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,807
Clay Aiken's not gay?

1309
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,894
Clay's the biggest coozehound I know.
That guy gets mad gash.

1310
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:08,979
Neil, listen.

1311
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,897
I was wondering if-

1312
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,150
I can get you one of those
Christmas trees?

1313
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,359
Sure, no problem.

1314
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,527
How'd you know that?

1315
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,654
I can read your mind.

1316
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,407
All right.

1317
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,700
You might be able to-?

1318
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,037
Hook you up with a free WaffleBot?
You know what? Take mine.

1319
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,580
I hate that android flap.

1320
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,583
Don't call him that, dude.
What's up, WaffleBot?

1321
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,918
Waffles are awesome.
Pancakes suck, right?

1322
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,879
I hate pancakes.

1323
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:34,921
I know, so do I.

1324
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,798
Kumar.

1325
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,009
Thanks, Neil.

1326
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,218
- Thanks.
No problem.

1327
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,221
Hey, merry Christmas, guys.
We'll see you in the fourth one.

1328
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,143
God, this is amazing. We're
actually gonna make it home before they do.

1329
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,562
- We saved Christmas, man.
Mission accomplished.

1330
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,023
- All right, put down the tree. Put it down.
- Unh!

1331
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,816
All right.
- Waffle break?

1332
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,902
All right. Oh, God.

1333
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,737
Oh, my God. WaffleBot.

1334
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,030
Dude, seriously...

1335
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,948
...these are incredible waffles.

1336
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,743
Kumar and WaffleBot friends forever.

1337
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,079
Ha, ha. No doubt, WaffleBot.

1338
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,830
I love you...

1339
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,666
- ... Kumar.
- Ha, ha.

1340
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,209
I love you too, little guy.

1341
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,418
What the flap?

1342
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,128
That is the weirdest flaping toy.

1343
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:16,588
You're happy.

1344
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,216
See? You're laughing.
You're having fun. Admit it:

1345
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,301
I'm more fun to hang out with than Todd.

1346
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,096
Todd and Ava.
I totally forgot about them.

1347
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,931
I'm sure they're fine, right?

1348
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,391
It's going to voicemail.

1349
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,351
I think they're fine.
Todd's a big boy.

1350
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,645
He's probably putting her
to bed or something.

1351
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,606
Yeah. They're probably fine, right?

1352
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,236
Look at me, look at me!

1353
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,113
Why wasn't you at school today?

1354
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,447
I went to the park.

1355
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,740
She lying.

1356
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,368
What was you doing?
You supposed to be at school.

1357
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,788
Little girl, I'm not gonna
ask you no more.

1358
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:53,959
I'm not smart like the other kids.
I can't do that stuff.

1359
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,669
Who told you that?

1360
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,963
NIKKl:
My last foster mother.

1361
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,092
She told me that the only thing I'm gonna
be smart enough to do is lay on my back.

1362
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,178
The best revenge you can have
on somebody that told you that...

1363
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,641
...is to prove them wrong. I went to
that school and I got your homework.

1364
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,728
TODD
Are you flaping kidding me?

1365
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,563
- Oh.
- Oh.

1366
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,648
Maybe that's Todd.

1367
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,650
Whoa, why is Vanessa calling you?

1368
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,444
Oh, that's because Maria is-

1369
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,820
- Hello?
Kumar?

1370
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,113
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1371
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,823
Why are you calling Harold?

1372
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,200
Can I just speak to him, please?

1373
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,785
What? No.

1374
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,162
I've been texting you.

1375
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,080
I haven't heard back.
What's going on?

1376
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,415
Tell him I'm not gonna...

1377
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,167
...make it to his party tomorrow.

1378
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,086
Oh. Oh, you're not gonna make it-

1379
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,213
She won't make it to your party.
Too bad.

1380
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,632
What else have you been
doing behind my back?

1381
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,926
Has she seen your dick?
Is it bigger than mine?

1382
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,679
Kumar, you're acting ridiculous, okay?
Goodbye.

1383
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,639
No, don't hang up the phone on me.

1384
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,183
Hello?

1385
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,935
Here's your phone.

1386
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,020
What is that?

1387
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,689
That's Vanessa, Todd,
Rosenberg, Uncle Yoav.

1388
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,691
Does everybody know
about this party?

1389
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,902
Listen, if you want you can come.

1390
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,654
I don't wanna come to your
shitty-ass party, dude.

1391
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,032
I can't believe you'd invite
Vanessa and not tell me.

1392
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,825
Am I supposed to feel bad?

1393
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,496
Maybe if you acted more like an adult,
you'd get invited to adult parties.

1394
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,873
Maybe you should go back
to your fancy house...

1395
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,292
...with your douchey friends
and gay-ass sconces.

1396
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,919
I don't need to be part of this.

1397
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,378
I love those sconces.

1398
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,048
You know, I was really happy
till you showed up today.

1399
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,008
Okay. Well, then, flap it, dude.

1400
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,635
- I'm out.
- Fine with me.

1401
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,344
Fine.

1402
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,720
- Cool.
- All right.

1403
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,889
- Are we having lovers' quarrel?
- Oh, shooot.

1404
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,898
Kumar, my friend.

1405
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,110
Oh, look.

1406
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,195
A WaffleBot.

1407
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:45,987
Mary would...

1408
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,572
- ... love one of these.
- Uh-huh.

1409
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,907
Grab it.

1410
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,742
Oh, crap.

1411
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,624
Wake up!

1412
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,919
Wake up! Wake up!

1413
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,796
Wake up.

1414
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,007
- Wake up.
- Oh.

1415
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,801
Oh, shooot.

1416
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,762
Please, I don't know what we've done,
but please let us go.

1417
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,265
After you made Eiffel Tower on Mary?

1418
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,766
That was a misunderstanding.

1419
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,893
I'm freezing!
Give us back our clothes.

1420
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,937
Yuri, warm them up.

1421
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,652
Kumar.

1422
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,945
Please don't do that.

1423
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,407
Please, please, please.
There is a very serious gas crisis...

1424
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,784
- ... in the world. Let's discuss.
- Come on, man!

1425
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,745
As they say in my country:

1426
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,623
No, don't say "do svidaniya. "

1427
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,333
Come on.

1428
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,963
You didn't get the lighter.

1429
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,592
You said gasoline, Orbits and coffee.

1430
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,968
Nothing about lighter.

1431
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,428
You stupid...

1432
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,763
...flaping moron!

1433
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,473
You're such a flap-up!

1434
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,268
Oh, shooot.

1435
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,068
Hey, guys, stop!

1436
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,571
Stop! Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.

1437
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,284
Now, look, I understand that you guys
have your issues, okay?

1438
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:18,580
But wasn't there a time you actually
used to get along? You might be in...

1439
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:22,334
...a different time and place,
but that doesn't change the fact that you...

1440
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:25,337
...have a long and probably
beautiful history together.

1441
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,717
Yeah, maybe one of you fucks up
every now and again.

1442
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,469
Happens.

1443
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,013
Maybe he fucks up all the time.

1444
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,350
Doesn't mean the other should
forget about the good times.

1445
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:43,146
Right.

1446
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:48,234
Yeah, and maybe just
because the other one...

1447
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,278
...is trying to act like an adult...

1448
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,156
...and be responsible
doesn't necessarily mean...

1449
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,325
...that he's being a flaping chode.

1450
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:59,454
Maybe he's been a chode,
caring more about bay windows...

1451
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,040
...and sconces
than a lifetime of friendship.

1452
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,251
What do you say, guys?

1453
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,384
- Yeah, hug it out.
- All right.

1454
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:13,760
Hey, guys.

1455
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,720
How about you cut us out?

1456
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:18,056
We'll go get ourselves
a Christmas beer.

1457
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,141
- A beer sounds great.
Awesome.

1458
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:22,727
But first...

1459
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,521
...we have some killing to do.

1460
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:25,355
Come on!

1461
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,232
After we just had that breakthrough?

1462
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,735
Sorry. Say your goodbyes.
It'll all be over quick.

1463
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,407
- Is this how we die?
- I think so, dude.

1464
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,076
Bye, Kumar.

1465
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,537
Bye, Harold.

1466
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,205
Kumar.

1467
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,581
Your waffles...

1468
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,250
- ... are ready.
- WaffleBot?

1469
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,421
These guys think pancakes
are better than waffles.

1470
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,922
I hate...

1471
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,674
...pancakes.

1472
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,265
They serve pancakes...

1473
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,267
...in hell.

1474
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:05,395
Ooh!

1475
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,649
Holy shooot!

1476
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,192
You hurt my brother!

1477
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,075
Whoo!

1478
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:22,412
- How do we get out of these ropes?
- WaffleBot.

1479
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,456
Kumar.

1480
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,499
Can you untie us?

1481
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,751
Battery low.

1482
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,377
Losing...

1483
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,670
...power.

1484
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:31,880
WaffleBot, look at me.

1485
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,131
You can do this, man.

1486
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,937
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, man. Thanks, WaffleBot.

1487
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,356
You're welcome, Kumar.

1488
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:55,779
Pancakes are flaping gay.

1489
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:01,159
Holy shooot. That is the best
Christmas toy ever.

1490
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,286
I guess. It's extraordinarily...

1491
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,789
...unsafe, but it did save our lives.

1492
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,917
- Listen, man, I-
- Man, this-

1493
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,127
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.

1494
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,338
Holy shooot!

1495
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,006
This is like that...

1496
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,674
...scene from A Christmas Story.

1497
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:19,010
Is it like the scene from
A Christmas Story?

1498
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,512
I just saw this scene.

1499
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,640
- Oh, flap!
- Okay, we need...

1500
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,351
...some sort of a warm liquid.
I'll spit on it.

1501
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,228
Don't flaping spit on my dick!

1502
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:29,646
Fine. Can you pee on it?

1503
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,356
Give me a second.

1504
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:34,025
- It's not working.
- Fine, I'll pee on it.

1505
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,276
Don't pee on me!

1506
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,903
Jesus! Well, then what the hell do-?

1507
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,405
- Oh. Our clothes.
- Oh.

1508
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,865
Cool about the clothes.

1509
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,867
My dick's stuck to a pole!

1510
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,747
Dude, you're in luck.
There's still coffee in here.

1511
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,624
Get it over here. Hurry the flap up!

1512
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,001
Okay, look, this is scalding hot coffee.

1513
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:55,880
So I'm just gonna pour a little bit on.
Probably gonna sting for a second.

1514
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,465
- Get it over with!
- All right.

1515
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,800
Just let me just-

1516
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:01,553
- I'm sorry.
- flap!

1517
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,887
Oh, flap! I'm sorry, dude!

1518
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,556
Oh, God, I ruined your dick!

1519
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:05,890
You asshole!

1520
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,350
Just walk it off.

1521
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,060
Walk it off.

1522
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,983
How long are we supposed
to stay in here?

1523
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,819
TODD
Until that flaping Russian sociopathic...

1524
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,237
...killing machine leaves.

1525
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,243
They gave my daughter ecstasy.

1526
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,247
I don't know Russian,
but he seems a little upset.

1527
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,832
I'd say so. Shh, shh!

1528
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,417
She's crashing hard.

1529
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,169
We gotta give her more blow.

1530
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,587
No, no! No more cocaine!

1531
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:36,629
I need it!

1532
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,840
- There's some.
- Do not give her more!

1533
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,091
Give it to me!

1534
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,301
Ava, no! No, please!

1535
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,969
Stop for Daddy. Shh, shh! Please!

1536
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,596
Dude, look.

1537
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:45,763
Oh, this is not good!

1538
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,015
Oh, this is not good.

1539
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,266
Oh, this is not good!

1540
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,102
Ava! Scooch to Daddy!
Hide behind Daddy!

1541
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,438
New plan. Let's bash through the door.

1542
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,606
You steal his gun.

1543
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,774
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

1544
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,255
Yah!

1545
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,467
Oh, flap me. flap. I'm-

1546
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,345
I'm so sorry. Wow.

1547
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:28,139
I thought that would
knock you out, obviously.

1548
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,474
Look. We are...

1549
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:30,892
...two reasonable guys...

1550
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,769
...and...

1551
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,318
These are dangerous,
but, aw, it's a great workout.

1552
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,487
You can really feel it.

1553
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,365
Bis, pecs, this one.

1554
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,200
Thank you, Adrian.

1555
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,202
That was a really great team effort.

1556
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,162
Who's my sidekick? You are.

1557
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:51,955
Let's go.

1558
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,999
Good girl! Let's go home!
Let's go see Santa.

1559
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,167
Oh, mints!

1560
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,003
Mm.

1561
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,674
Where the flap are we?

1562
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,510
Those guys weren't kidding.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1563
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,304
Do you have any bars?

1564
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,848
- I got no bars.
- shooot. Nothing here.

1565
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:12,558
Hello?

1566
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,853
Anybody here?

1567
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,855
Forget it. Just-

1568
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,691
Forget it. It's past 2 a. m.

1569
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,694
They're home, wondering where I am,
where the tree is.

1570
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,028
I just-

1571
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,906
It's such a disaster, this flaping night.

1572
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,033
Yeah, you have no flaping idea, dude.

1573
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,451
No. When Maria's dad...

1574
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,121
- ... was a young boy in Medellín-
- Vanessa's pregnant.

1575
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,706
What?

1576
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,625
She told me earlier today.
My reaction was not awesome.

1577
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,045
I thought weed stunted fertility.
That's why I quit.

1578
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,631
Yeah. Tell that to Snoop's kids.

1579
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,925
Wait a second,
that's why you quit weed?

1580
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,635
Yeah, that's why I-

1581
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:52,557
We've been trying for like a...
For a year.

1582
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,058
Oh, man.

1583
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:56,352
Now I feel even worse about your dick.

1584
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,770
I don't wanna-

1585
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,063
How do we get out?

1586
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,734
I got an idea.

1587
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,071
I saw this in a movie, man.

1588
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:09,615
Just shoot this motherfucker,
people come.

1589
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:10,783
We can find people.

1590
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,244
No, it's fine. Aah!

1591
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:17,957
Now what?

1592
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,751
I don't know.

1593
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,964
No flaping way.

1594
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,768
Santa, can you hear me?

1595
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,436
Oh, what the flap?

1596
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:42,106
Lie still. You've been in a terrible accident.
I'm gonna take a closer look.

1597
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:44,650
Oh, God!

1598
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:45,651
This isn't good.

1599
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,153
Mr. Claus, can you feel...

1600
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:47,904
...any of this?

1601
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,115
Just let me die, please!

1602
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,658
Let me die in peace!

1603
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,495
No. Nobody's dying, Claus.
Not on my watch.

1604
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:58,331
Listen to me. I need you to go
into Santa's gift bag...

1605
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,708
...get as many medical supplies
as you can.

1606
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,303
Oh, God!

1607
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,348
Aah!

1608
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,727
Ah, there.

1609
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,229
I think that'll do it.

1610
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,730
How do you feel, Mr. Claus?

1611
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,816
Uh, a little woozy.

1612
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,567
The morphine. It'll wear off.

1613
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,945
Nice. But I...

1614
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,071
...think I'm okay.

1615
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,449
Look, Santa, we're so sorry.

1616
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:35,868
Oh, I know it wasn't your fault.

1617
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,287
You two have always been good boys.

1618
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,665
Tell that to my father-in-law.

1619
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,668
Hey, man, I can take the blame
for that, all right?

1620
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,878
Listen, I'd love to stay and chat...

1621
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:49,132
...but I'm running a little late
and I have all these...

1622
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,175
...presents to deliver.

1623
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:53,344
So you guys need a ride
or something?

1624
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:54,971
Seriously?

1625
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,682
Ha, ha. Dude, this is awesome!

1626
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,517
It's not not awesome!

1627
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,477
On, Blitzen! Hyah!

1628
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,578
Thanks for the ride.

1629
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,037
I'm guessing...

1630
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,373
...you don't have a 12-foot Fraser fir?

1631
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,125
Sorry. I can't help you there.

1632
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,376
Besides...

1633
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,044
...I gave you your present.

1634
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,880
- You did?
Yes.

1635
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,256
You got my package, right?

1636
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,090
The joint?

1637
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,884
- That was you?
Yeah.

1638
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,761
It was my little way of bringing
you boys back together.

1639
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,098
Dude...

1640
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,642
...I'd really like it
if you came over tomorrow.

1641
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,603
Won't be a party unless you're there.

1642
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,897
It's about flaping time, Roldy.

1643
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,065
I wouldn't miss it, man.

1644
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,572
By the way, for what it's worth...

1645
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,407
...you'd make a great dad.

1646
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,659
Well, I guess...

1647
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,037
...this is goodbye, Roldy.
Be a good boy...

1648
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,079
...next year.

1649
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,247
All right.

1650
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:06,459
No more jerking off into a sock
filled with baby powder.

1651
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:09,462
- I-
Ha, ha. Don't worry.

1652
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,255
I'm just teasing you.

1653
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:12,757
I do it too.

1654
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:21,140
On, Prancer! On, Comet!
On, Blitzen! Hyah!

1655
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:22,892
I-

1656
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,770
Merry Christmas, Roldy!

1657
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,199
Where's the tree?

1658
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,122
It's, um...

1659
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,875
Okay, what happened is that, um...

1660
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,169
You said you were going to...

1661
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,964
...take care of it.
Now where's the tree?

1662
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,633
What happened to the tree is, uh...

1663
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,010
...I kind of burned it down.

1664
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,847
That tree was a Perez...

1665
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:03,683
...family tradition.

1666
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,810
You ruined Christmas!

1667
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,229
Ha, ha. I ruined your-?

1668
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,897
You ruined my Christmas, man!

1669
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,650
Heh, heh. Do you know what happened?

1670
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:16,487
Uh, I inadvertently introduced
a baby to cocaine.

1671
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:20,199
I was almost burned alive
by Ukrainian gangsters.

1672
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,909
I was drugged by...

1673
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:25,246
...asshole teenagers. Then I danced
in a Christmas extravaganza.

1674
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,331
And I'm a terrible dancer.

1675
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,041
I almost had my dick ripped off.

1676
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,585
And then I shot...

1677
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,505
...Santa Claus in the flaping face.
He's real, and I shot him in the face.

1678
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,423
Why?

1679
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:37,717
Because I wanted you...

1680
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:40,553
...to have a perfect
flaping Christmas.

1681
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,513
Now, here's a newsflash:

1682
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:44,640
This is my house.

1683
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,851
Maria is my wife.

1684
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,021
And if you want to be in our family...

1685
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,857
...you best show me some
flaping respect.

1686
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:56,736
Is that too much?

1687
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,281
I like it.

1688
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,866
- Really?
- Look.

1689
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,285
I always knew you were a nice guy.

1690
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:06,912
But that's not enough
to be with my Maria.

1691
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,414
I didn't want her to be...

1692
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,207
...with some wimpy pussy.

1693
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,168
But you...

1694
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,170
You showed me you got cojones.

1695
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,212
Testicles, right?

1696
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:17,548
Rosetta Stone.

1697
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,384
- You know what?
- What's that?

1698
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,261
This coming Easter...

1699
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,473
...you guys come to my house.

1700
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:28,893
That would really be great.
Thank you, Carlos.

1701
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,978
Mr. Perez.

1702
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,618
flap!

1703
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:47,286
Kumar!

1704
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,412
Jesus!

1705
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:52,917
I'm sorry. I was gonna use the doorbell
but I didn't want to wake your parents.

1706
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,336
What-? What are you doing?
You can't just-

1707
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,837
Hold on. There's something...

1708
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,422
...I need to say to you, okay?

1709
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,967
When you told me you were pregnant,
I admit I was scared as shooot.

1710
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,804
The more I think about it,
the more excited I am.

1711
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,806
I mean, I love kids.

1712
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,766
That's because you are a kid.

1713
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,687
I know. But... Look, if you
give me another chance...

1714
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:17,358
...I promise you I will go back to the
medical board, I'll get my job back.

1715
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,193
I'll even quit weed if I have to.

1716
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,611
You'd quit weed?

1717
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,364
Of course. I would do anything for you.

1718
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,325
When I saw what Harold did
for his family tonight...

1719
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,786
...it made me realize
how important you are to me.

1720
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,455
I wish I would've realized that sooner.

1721
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,290
You don't have to do this.

1722
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,001
I know I don't have to.

1723
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,170
I want to.

1724
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,010
Do me a favor.

1725
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:46,303
Yeah, anything.

1726
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,141
Don't quit weed.

1727
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,559
What?

1728
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:54,562
Just remember,
next time you take a drug test...

1729
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:55,896
...use my pee.

1730
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,023
I love you.

1731
01:18:58,483 --> 01:18:59,817
I love you too.

1732
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,907
Let's have some sex
before you get all fat on me.

1733
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,841
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1734
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,926
Harold! Wake up! Baby.

1735
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,597
- It's pink.
- Oh, my God.

1736
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:31,932
- It's pink.
- It's a miracle.

1737
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:33,726
It's a miracle.

1738
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,187
It's a miracle!

1739
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,605
It's a miracle!

1740
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:40,691
Isn't this the most beautiful tree
you've ever seen?

1741
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,235
I came downstairs this morning...

1742
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:44,862
...and here she was.

1743
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,367
God bless us, everyone!

1744
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:12,116
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!
