1
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,265
# Old Mr. Kringle
is soon gonna jingle #

2
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,132
# The bells that'll tingle
all your troubles away #

3
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,002
# Everybody's waiting
for the man with the bag #

4
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,973
# 'Cause Christmas is coming again #

5
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,710
# He's got a sleigh full #

6
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,873
# It's not gonna stay full
of stuff that he's dropping... #

7
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,942
# Everybody's waiting
for the man with the bag #

8
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,978
# 'Cause Christmas
is coming again #

9
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,649
# He'll be here #

10
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,369
# He's got a sleigh full #

11
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,270
# It's not gonna stay full #

12
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,606
# Of stuff that he's dropping
every stop of the way #

13
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,807
# Everybody's waiting
for the man with the bag #

14
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,509
# 'Cause Christmas
is coming again #

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,110
# He'll be here... #

16
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,977
Merry Christmas.

17
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,180
Merry Christmas
from your friends and family

18
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,314
at the Clark Sanitarium.

19
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,322
ORDERLY:
Merry Christmas.

20
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,921
Happy holidays.

21
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,093
PATIENT:
Leave me alone!

22
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,302
Merry Christmas.

23
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,002
Happy holidays.

24
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,175
Happy birthday.

25
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,942
Behold. Wise men from the east
came to Jerusalem,

26
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,505
saying, "Where..."

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,190
How'd you get in here?

28
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,923
The door was open.

29
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,828
I was looking for the children's
ward, and I got lost.

30
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,992
GUARD: This ain't no place
for Santa Claus.

31
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,368
Not at Christmas.

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,905
Lenz?

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,236
Billy Lenz?

34
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,408
That's the guy that killed

35
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,680
his family at Christmas,
back when I was a kid.

36
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,654
You know, a lot of
people say he's dead.

37
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,851
Poke your head inside.

38
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,625
Check if he's been naughty
or nice.

39
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,190
No, that's... it's okay.

40
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,531
I thought so.

41
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,732
You guys keep him locked
up with just a padlock?

42
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,708
That lock's just to make him
feel at home.

43
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,836
Right, 'cause his mom kept him

44
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,573
locked in the basement
his whole life.

45
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,773
The attic.

46
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,282
See, that's the key
to Billy Lenz.

47
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,581
<i>He just wants to feel at home,</i>

48
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,985
especially on Christmas.

49
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,182
He's tried to escape
every year...

50
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,059
...just to be home on Christmas.

51
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,062
It tastes like chicken.

52
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,333
Because it's chicken.

53
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,134
It's the closest
we could get to how

54
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,869
Mom used to taste.

55
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,642
Kyle...

56
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,349
- Mm.
- It's late.

57
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,856
I have to go inside.

58
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,256
Mm-mm.

59
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,589
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-mm.

60
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,060
They might be waiting for me.

61
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,061
See? That's them calling.

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,466
You can be with them any time.

63
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,129
Yeah, but it's not
any time, though.

64
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,297
It's Christmas.

65
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,569
I know, but it's our first.

66
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,665
We should be together.

67
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,767
We will.

68
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,539
On Christmas Day.

69
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,978
I can't wait until you
see what I got you.

70
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,382
And then, we'll be
together all week.

71
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,978
Well, besides when
I have to work.

72
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,818
Look, I'm excited,
baby, but I got to be

73
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,347
with my sorority sisters, too.

74
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,759
I mean, I've never
really had a big family.

75
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,026
I'm your family now.

76
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,271
I love you.

77
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,796
I'll see you later.

78
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,717
Hello.

79
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,956
# I love
those J-I-N-G-L-E bells #

80
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,355
# Bong! #

81
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,157
# Jingle bells #

82
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,596
# Jingle bells,
jingle all the way #

83
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:44,865
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh #

84
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,498
# Jingle bells,
jingle bells... #

85
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,633
WOMAN:
Billy.

86
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,644
Billy.

87
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,441
Billy...

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,505
Girls, I can't find
Billy's present

89
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,107
under the tree here.

90
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,176
Come on, girls, we can't
start the Secret Santa

91
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,948
without Billy's present.

92
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,514
Hello? Who drew

93
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,549
Billy's name?

94
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,527
Um, Ms. Mac,
it's a Secret Santa.

95
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,427
Can't we just get on with
this thing, so I can party

96
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,091
for a few days
before having to deal

97
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,656
with the family on Christmas.

98
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,065
Have you looked outside?

99
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,797
It's raining hail the size
of Yao's ball sack.

100
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,361
It'll stop.

101
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,805
The party gods won't allow me
to be here by myself

102
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,672
- over Christmas break.
- Oh, I'll be here, Dana.

103
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,734
Yeah, they're making me work
next week.

104
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,406
That sucks-- everyone
should be home for Christmas.

105
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,313
All right, all right,
who's not here?

106
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,577
Um, like everybody.

107
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,141
Chelsea?

108
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,448
She went home this morning.

109
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,818
- Greer?
- No, that was her on the phone.

110
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,447
She and Erin and Taylor

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,219
are off on that cozy
little ski trip

112
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,816
with the boys
from G.A.D. next door.

113
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,227
Didn't I see Clair earlier?

114
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,231
Isn't she upstairs
writing a card to her sister?

115
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,960
No, I think her sister
picked her up earlier.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,627
Remember, this is the occasion

117
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,261
for Clair and her sister
and her mom

118
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,829
to... bury the hatchet
and rediscover

119
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,965
each other.

120
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,565
Oh.

121
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,702
I'd like to bury the hatchet
with my sister...

122
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,679
...right in her head.

123
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,963
In your dreams, Billy.

124
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,800
In your dreams.

125
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,956
Lauren, we're opening up
presents.

126
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,533
Clair, we're opening up
presents.

127
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,799
Okay, I realize that
you're an only child,

128
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,772
so let me explain.

129
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,069
Christmas is just Darwin.

130
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,473
The weak get eaten.

131
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,843
We're opening up
gifts right now!

132
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,847
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes, your presents

133
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,973
are mine!

134
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,284
Now show me.

135
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,719
Okay.

136
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,289
We're opening up
presents in five minutes!

137
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,388
If you're not downstairs,

138
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,729
then I'm going
to take your presents.

139
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,598
Just flap Christmas.

140
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,103
flap it.

141
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,105
Whatever.

142
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,668
Hey, Megan, are you okay?

143
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,372
Yes!

144
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,347
No.

145
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,213
Megan...

146
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,552
LAUREN:
Honestly, Santa loves...

147
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,082
All right.

148
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,146
Who's flaping with me?

149
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,534
Clair?

150
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,810
What are you doing?

151
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,259
# Fa la la la la
la la la la #

152
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,392
# 'Tis the season to be jolly #

153
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,527
Hey, Santa, if I sit
on your lap,

154
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,595
will you give me
what I want for Christmas?

155
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,934
SANTA: I don't know,
you've been good all year.

156
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,947
You sure you want to blow it
on the last day, huh?

157
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,675
I'll be good.

158
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:14,584
I bet you will.

159
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,882
Happy holidays.

160
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,445
- Yeah.

161
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,083
Ever seen the backseat
of a sleigh?

162
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:28,094
# Fa la la la la la
la la la #

163
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,432
You know, Santa
checks his list twice.

164
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,338
I know you're
very, very naughty.

165
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,398
Hello?

166
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,909
WOMAN:
Santa, my shift's over.

167
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,648
You know, Santa's not one
to keep a girl waiting.

168
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,281
Mrs. Mac, why don't you
open the present we got you.

169
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,946
Because we have to open
Billy's present first.

170
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,490
It's a 15-year Delta
Alpha Kappa tradition.

171
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,617
Okay, I...

172
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,457
I drew that name.

173
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,858
But can I say,
I'm sorry, I'm just,

174
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,194
I'm really not okay
with any of this.

175
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,193
I mean, buying a
Christmas present

176
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,065
for a serial killer?

177
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,660
MELISSA:
No, you see,

178
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,071
serial killers murder
repeatedly for sexual thrill.

179
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,802
Billy Lenz
was a spree killer.

180
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,104
Dude just flaping lost it.

181
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,168
Thank you.

182
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,838
HEATHER:
Oh, whatever, Melissa, okay?

183
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,507
I'm just offended
by a pagan sacrifice

184
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,709
to ward off evil spirits
on Christmas.

185
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,945
Heather, we're just having
a little bit of fun.

186
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,318
Christmas is more about warding
off evil spirits than Halloween.

187
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,448
What Christmas shooot

188
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,015
in this room resembles
anything Christian, huh?

189
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,688
It's all neo-pagan magic.

190
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,855
Christmas tree--

191
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,559
a magical rite ensuring
the return of the crops.

192
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,261
The mistletoe is nothing
but a conception charm.

193
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,462
Fifth century Christians

194
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,937
jacked a Roman winter festival--

195
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,701
12 days in December
where the nights were long

196
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,302
and the Earth was roamed
by the demons of chaos.

197
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,745
And flaping Santa Claus?

198
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,648
This fat voyeur
that watches you all year long

199
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,413
to make sure you live up to

200
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,479
his standards of decency before
breaking into your house?

201
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,457
And that is different
from what Billy did... how?

202
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,785
Billy didn't break in.

203
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,990
Billy lived here.

204
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,921
<i>Billy Edward Lenz was born</i>

205
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,893
<i>with a rare liver disease
that gave him yellow skin.</i>

206
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,895
Merry Christmas, Billy.

207
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,523
<i>His parents hated each other.</i>

208
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,125
<i>The mother hated Billy.</i>

209
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,864
<i>He was not the child
she always wanted.</i>

210
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,135
<i>When she looked at her son,
all she saw</i>

211
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,267
<i>was her husband.</i>

212
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,180
MOTHER: Why you bothering
putting with those cookies?

213
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,919
Santa ain't coming to see you.

214
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,960
Russians shot his sleigh down.

215
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,625
Santa Claus... is dead.

216
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,248
Don't listen to her.

217
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,874
Listen, if you go
upstairs to your room,

218
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,441
you'll find something
for yourself.

219
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,010
Now, go.

220
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,887
FATHER: Look, I don't give
a shooot if you're mean to me,

221
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,188
but to your own kid
on Christmas?

222
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,455
MOTHER:
This is my present to myself.

223
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,656
I don't have to listen
to you no more.

224
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,130
FATHER:
You didn't listen to me before.

225
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,605
FATHER:
Who are you?

226
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,904
What the flap do you want?

227
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,932
MOTHER:
He's my family now.

228
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,671
FATHER:
Get out of here!

229
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,703
MAN:
She's mine now.

230
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,942
FATHER:
This guy?

231
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,108
This guy, this piece of shooot,
is your boyfriend?

232
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,551
MOTHER:
Gonna be my husband.

233
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,952
FATHER:
Hey, what the flap is that?

234
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,512
I was in Vietnam.

235
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,287
Do you think I'm afraid of
a dude holding a flaping hammer?

236
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,384
No!

237
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,964
Alpha Kappa.

238
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,305
Hello?

239
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,834
Hello-hello.

240
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,171
Very funny, Kyle.

241
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,051
I think someone's in trouble.

242
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,363
You want a Christmas cookie?

243
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:56,738
You're my cookie,
and I could gobble you up!

244
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,175
Billy, what have you done?!

245
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,179
What have you done?

246
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,339
Where's Agnes?!

247
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,942
She's my family now.

248
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,279
Hey, shouldn't
you get going?

249
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,786
Don't you have lots
of toys to deliver

250
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,048
- to good little boys and girls?
- Shh.

251
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,252
Get out of my house.

252
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,816
I'm gonna kill you.

253
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,061
- Call the police.
- LAUREN: Please.

254
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,928
Police ain't gonna do shooot
about one wack-job phone call.

255
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,490
Just dial "star 69."

256
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,728
MELISSA:
That just calls him back--

257
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,566
unless there's something
you need him to clarify.

258
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,706
Caller I.D.
says Clair's cell.

259
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,516
You really shouldn't
provoke somebody like that.

260
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,145
What would you know
about dealing with anyone

261
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,712
other than your NASCAR daddy?

262
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,451
I'm going home.

263
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,222
Yeah, yeah, run to Daddy!

264
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,598
At least my family
wants me to come home.

265
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,692
KELLI:
You guys,

266
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,702
come on.

267
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,203
It's, like, Christmastime.

268
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,204
Yeah.

269
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,205
Come on, Heather.

270
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,206
What about your present?

271
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,572
Give it to Billy.

272
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,441
Merry Christmas, Heather.

273
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,320
Merry Christmas, everyone.

274
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,053
You're all like my family now.

275
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,809
Oh.

276
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,512
Thanks, Eve.

277
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,214
That's... that's so sweet.

278
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,884
I know you like
the Bible and stuff.

279
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,722
MS. MAC:
Well, that's the spirit!

280
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,193
Well, come on, everybody.

281
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,423
Let's get
this thing rolling.

282
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,657
What have we got here now?

283
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,428
Oh! Melissa.

284
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,491
There you are.

285
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,502
And, uh...

286
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,528
Let's see-- Dana, very nice.

287
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,437
I wonder what this could be.

288
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,305
And let's see...

289
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,310
Aw, "Mrs. Mac."

290
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,606
You shouldn't have.

291
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,737
I'll open it later.

292
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,517
Not again.

293
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,855
Every goddamn time.

294
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,119
MOTHER:
My little Agnes.

295
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,335
She's my family now.

296
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,253
MS. MAC: All right,
let's get this party going.

297
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,813
Um, let's see.

298
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,155
This one's for Megan.

299
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,184
Kelli, is Megan coming down?

300
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,162
All right, we'll save
that one for later.

301
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,164
Uh... Oh.

302
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,893
Here's one for Mrs. Mac.

303
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,195
Ooh, it's a big one.

304
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,932
All right, I'll wait.

305
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,269
And here is another
one for Melissa.

306
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,740
It's a little one.

307
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,402
Well, you know what they say.

308
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,502
Big things come in small pa...

309
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,035
Well, something like that;
I don't know.

310
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,605
It's all right,
let's see what else.

311
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,414
Then we'll open the stockings.

312
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,544
Oh, Eve, wait, wait.

313
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,713
Let me find your gift.

314
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,746
Eve...

315
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,922
"To Eve from Santa."

316
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,298
Eve?

317
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,701
Does Eve have someplace to be?

318
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,605
The Island of Misfit Toys.

319
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,269
Her mother was a legacy.

320
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,538
And?

321
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,670
Her mother's dead.

322
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,374
She has no boyfriend,

323
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,473
no family.

324
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,108
I mean, really,
where does she have to go?

325
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,413
Who hasn't gotten
a gift yet? Uh...

326
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,890
Lauren?

327
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,916
Just give her a shot of tequila,

328
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,726
wish her happy holidays,
and she's good to go.

329
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,129
Happy holidays.

330
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,097
MELISSA:
All right, look, I know

331
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,536
this is the whole
Secret Santa thing,

332
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,164
but I know, um,
Clair drew your name.

333
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,272
Oh, yeah?
She get me anything good?

334
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,073
Oh, yeah.
It's a music box.

335
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,608
It plays "Dance of
the Sugar Plum Fairies."

336
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,279
Oh, flap, no.

337
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,946
I'm starting to see
the sugar plum fairies.

338
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,885
I don't need to hear
the little fuckers, too.

339
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,050
Language. Language.

340
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,566
Wireless services report

341
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,693
several microwave
relay stations are off-line.

342
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,331
Now, a relay station sends calls
out of the area, so that is why

343
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,398
your cell may work on local
calls, but not on long distance.

344
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,431
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

345
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,111
Does it come with a man
to wear it for?

346
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,315
Whoo!

347
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,683
Here is our real present.

348
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,325
I got it.

349
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,298
Why is Megan calling here?

350
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,797
Hey, where are you?

351
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,363
She's my family now.

352
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,341
Everyone should be home for Christmas.

353
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,834
I'll be home for Christmas.

354
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,839
I'm going to bury the hatchet,
in your head.

355
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,619
That was not Megan.

356
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,122
You have reached the main menu

357
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,634
of Clement University
campus security.

358
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:04,862
During the Christmas break...

359
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,235
Is Megan in her room?

360
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,899
I don't know.
I was just packing. What...

361
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,239
What's going on?

362
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,185
Oh, my God.

363
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,156
Kyle.

364
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,886
What are you doing in there?

365
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,656
I wanted to spend
the night with you.

366
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,957
It's okay.

367
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,363
KYLE:
And I knew that mama-san

368
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,925
and your sisters here would kick
me out, so I-I tried to sneak

369
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,802
into your room, but the window
wasn't open, so I, uh,

370
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,932
I saw that,
I saw that Megan's was,

371
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,238
so I climbed up here
to see you.

372
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,005
Is Megan in her room?

373
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,841
I don't know.

374
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,711
You climbed up into her room,

375
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,545
and you don't know
if she's in it?

376
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,381
It's dark.

377
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,114
LAUREN: Does he think
we're flaping stupid?

378
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,019
You were in Megan's room.

379
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,384
The call came from Megan's cell.

380
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,051
What call?

381
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:02,286
MELISSA:
Can I just say,

382
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,658
I'm sorry,

383
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,663
but that-that flaping voice,

384
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,187
that was not Megan or Kyle.

385
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,460
That was the flaping
devil, okay?

386
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,967
And they were not talking to us.

387
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,469
They were talking to Billy.

388
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,971
KYLE: Billy Lenz, the guy
that used to live in this house?

389
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,906
Well, you're definitely
getting punked.

390
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,342
Yeah, Billy Lenz
is our flaping life.

391
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,073
You know, you spoiled bitches,

392
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,946
you come here for a couple
of years and you leave.

393
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,213
I live here.

394
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,652
I stay here.

395
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,086
I used to play on this street

396
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,919
before they turned them
into frat houses.

397
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,358
This was the house that scared
the shooot out of us,

398
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,486
my whole life.

399
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,826
What happened?

400
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,994
You mean after
he washed down his...

401
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,231
Christmas cookies
with a glass of milk?

402
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,708
MOTHER:
Merry Christmas, Agnes.

403
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,962
Is that Santa's reindeer?

404
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,563
There's nothing up there.

405
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,507
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

406
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,113
You're my cookie,

407
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,820
and I could gobble you up.

408
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,559
Merry Christmas.

409
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,828
Merry Christmas...

410
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,960
Hey. Merry Christmas.

411
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,767
MAN:
She's my family now.

412
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,110
Agnes?

413
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,434
Billy!

414
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,631
What have you done?!

415
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,798
Where's Agnes?!

416
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,104
Billy, where's Agnes?

417
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,110
What your mother
and I must know is...

418
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,203
Billy!

419
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,174
Where's Agnes?!

420
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,684
- What have you done?

421
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,710
- What have you done?

422
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,461
Little girl in the corner,
she's hurt.

423
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,295
Go check her out.

424
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,328
<i>Billy was declared insane.</i>

425
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,340
<i>They sent him away
to Clark Sanitarium.</i>

426
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,110
Paramedics saved his sister,
Agnes.

427
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,511
She lost her right eye.

428
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:34,609
All scarred up, mother murdered,
an inbred.

429
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,918
Her father, Billy,
who was her brother, Billy--

430
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,390
a flaping psycho.

431
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,552
They sent her to an orphanage.

432
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,289
Like, what chance did she have

433
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,763
that a foster family
would ever take her?

434
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:51,495
No one's seen her since.

435
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,045
Did they ever
find out from him

436
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,877
why he killed his family?

437
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,874
Well... it seemed to him

438
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,319
that's how they showed
their love.

439
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,391
Clair?

440
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,490
MS. MAC:
Megan?

441
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,282
Can we help you?

442
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,550
She was supposed to call.

443
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,950
I'm Clair's sister.

444
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,652
Where is she?

445
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,322
I'm kind of worried about Megan.

446
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,728
Who knows
what her deal is, okay?

447
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,231
- Can we go to my apartment?
- No. She was weird before.

448
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,632
I mean, she was a bitch to me,
and that's never happened.

449
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,363
And we've been getting
these weird phone calls,

450
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,961
one from her cell,

451
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,836
and her car's still outside,
and she's just, what,

452
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,170
gone in the middle
of this weather?

453
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,541
- Hey.
- Ow.

454
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,205
What, exactly,
are you looking for?

455
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,077
Like, a note or something
that says she's okay.

456
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,447
All her stuff is here,
and her car is outside.

457
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,282
Okay. Call her cell.

458
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,379
MS. MAC:
You're a legacy?

459
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,151
What year?

460
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,317
'93, '94, I don't know.

461
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,519
I started late, I quit early.

462
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,255
1993's the year
I became housemother.

463
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,660
I don't remember you.

464
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,926
I mean, this was supposed to be
such a big flaping weekend.

465
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,125
Excuse my language,
but I drove

466
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,032
all the way out here
in this shitty, shitty weather.

467
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,195
I blew off a weekend

468
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,204
in Vail with a cardiologist...

469
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,502
I love that coat.

470
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,282
Voice mail.

471
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,450
Meg, hi, it's Kel.

472
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,654
Um, look, I was just wondering
if you were okay, and, you know,

473
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,390
wanted to know what happened
to you and stuff, so...

474
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,228
can you just call me back,
please, on my cell?

475
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,166
Okay, bye.

476
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,549
MS. MAC:
Clair's name is "Crosby."

477
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,609
This says "Colvin."

478
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,621
The divorce will
be final in March.

479
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,883
What else do you need?

480
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,185
Look, I can't tell you
any secrets

481
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,886
about my sister, because
I don't really know her.

482
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,986
I-I-I can't tell you anything
about this place,

483
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,292
because I really fuckin'
hated it here.

484
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,231
Um...

485
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,532
I see Billy
still gets a Christmas present.

486
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,834
Oh, this is new.

487
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,499
It's not, uh...

488
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,442
for Billy,
it's for Alpha Kappa from Billy.

489
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,204
That wasn't here before.

490
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,151
Well, let's open it.

491
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,969
What if there's something
on her computer, like, uh,

492
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,805
an e-mail or something
that says where she is?

493
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:20,970
Hey, you know what?
I don't...

494
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,808
I don't feel comfortable.
uh, whatever, like,

495
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,678
invading someone's privacy
like this.

496
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,309
Try calling the police again.

497
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,988
Who put this under the tree?

498
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:34,990
She put it there.

499
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,583
She found it.

500
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,992
Are you actually giving me shooot

501
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,997
when none of you can tell me
where my sister is, huh?

502
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,963
Where's her room?

503
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,763
Well, you know what that is?

504
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,929
The attic window's open.

505
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,768
What, you think she's up there?

506
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,008
LEIGH:
You know her better than I do.

507
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,310
I'm her half-sister,
12 years older.

508
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,544
Clair was in, um...

509
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:04,953
I don't know, second grade
when I moved in here, this room.

510
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,447
It's weird how, at this age,
12 years seems like nothing.

511
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:12,952
In fact, in a weird way,
she seems older.

512
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,055
She was the one who wanted
to bridge that time,

513
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,431
finally get to know each other
while we could.

514
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,871
Can, you know, while we can.

515
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,773
Hey.

516
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,571
Same paper as the present
Eve gave me.

517
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,171
That paper's dated
December 26, 1991.

518
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,374
Eve lives in Billy's room.

519
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,975
Maybe she's, like,
obsessed with him.

520
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,949
I'm gonna go up to her room
and see if there's

521
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,113
any of that old newspaper
or anything up there.

522
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,918
Look, I'm tellin' you, it's
the window, Kelli, okay?

523
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,925
Can we just get up to the attic,
and I will close it.

524
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,164
Maybe she changed her mind
and just...

525
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,363
...left.

526
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,713
Look, this was before
you came here.

527
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,548
Okay? I did not put this
on the 'Net.

528
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,110
A guy at my work,
he got pissed off at me,

529
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,678
and he stole my tapes.

530
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:49,523
Tapes, Kyle?

531
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,654
How many are there,
you flaping liar?!

532
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:22,323
I can't even believe that this person is you.

533
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,088
How could you do such a thing?

534
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,323
I saw you so different.

535
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,484
Get out!

536
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,425
Get the flap out!

537
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,486
Am I gonna show up on there?

538
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,122
Isn't sex enough, Kyle?

539
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,598
You need little visual trophies
to get your thrill?

540
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,260
Why don't you shut the flap up?!

541
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,769
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Go, Kyle, now!

542
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,101
I got her, Ms. Mac.
It's okay, baby.

543
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,901
- I got you.

544
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,339
Kelli, I really like you.

545
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,933
A lot.

546
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,943
I don't blame you
for hating me.

547
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,774
But I wasn't dealing.

548
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,648
I wasn't knocking over
7-Elevens.

549
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:23,050
I didn't hurt anybody.

550
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,046
Yeah, Merry Christmas, asshole.

551
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,079
flap all you bitches.

552
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,285
Get out of here now!

553
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,385
Get out of here.

554
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,760
Go. Go!

555
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,543
Kelli...

556
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:57,215
Um, th-this is Clair's sister.

557
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,563
How fucked up is it that

558
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,570
the only other house on this
street has power?

559
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,936
This one doesn't.

560
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,201
- You okay?

561
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,711
- Mel?
- Yeah?

562
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,942
You're a better sister to me
than my own sister.

563
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,812
Yeah, Dick Cheney's
a better sister to you

564
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,112
than your sister.

565
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,949
You know what I mean.

566
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,647
Yeah, I know. Ew.

567
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,451
I love you, too, but, honey,

568
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,752
you're really, really smelly.

569
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,555
You need to take a shower.
Can you handle it?

570
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:37,617
Mm-hmm.

571
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,253
Okay. Come on.

572
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,332
DANA:
Oh, shooot.

573
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,632
The main breaker's
underneath the house.

574
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,865
What? I'm not the totally
helpless daddy's girl

575
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,806
these bitches
make me out to be.

576
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,105
Okay, then go outside
and turn the power on.

577
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,542
Are you high?

578
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,842
I'm not goin' outside.
It's freezing.

579
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,814
It'll take two seconds.

580
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,146
You know where the power is.

581
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,412
I'll keep looking for Clair.

582
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,816
Oh, fine.

583
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,558
Ow.

584
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,432
I'm gonna go put a trash can
by your bed, okay?

585
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,111
LAUREN:
flap.

586
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,936
You good, drunky?

587
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,372
Okay. No more drinking.

588
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,274
Okay, trash can's
right here, okay?

589
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,945
Merry fuckin' Christmas.

590
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,219
Of course.

591
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,962
It's okay.

592
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,027
Up in Eve's closet,
I found this, and these.

593
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,077
Clair?

594
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,661
flap you, Santa Claus.

595
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,729
Eve, you crazy bitch.

596
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,431
I can see your breath.

597
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,828
It must be Kyle.

598
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,625
What do I do?

599
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,655
Answer it.

600
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,007
It says Dana's cell.

601
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,133
Help!

602
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,941
Help me. Help me.

603
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,743
She's my family now.

604
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,148
- Dana?

605
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,254
Dana, where are you?!

606
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,283
She went around back
to the fuse box.

607
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,623
Eve's car.

608
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,060
She never left.

609
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,595
Heather, we have
to find Dana first!

610
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,732
shooot.

611
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,436
Dana!

612
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,341
MELISSA: The fuse box
is under the house!

613
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,367
Dana!

614
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,710
Kelli!

615
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,515
Oh, my God.

616
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,794
Oh, and I can't open it!

617
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,298
Come on!

618
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,107
What's she doing,
sleeping in her car?

619
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,403
It's, like, zero degrees out.

620
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,751
Holy flap!

621
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,525
He's out here.

622
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,528
What? What?

623
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:35,799
Damn it!

624
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,973
shooot. shooot.

625
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,445
Come on.

626
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,973
flap!

627
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,551
What's going on?

628
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,985
911 is experiencing

629
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,488
heavy caller traffic
because of the storm.

630
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,080
Hello?

631
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,682
Hello. Yes, yes.

632
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,420
A girl is... is dead.

633
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,428
Outside.

634
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,362
Yes!

635
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,628
Yes, I know her.

636
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,931
Her name is Eve Agnew.

637
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,503
And we're positive
that she's been murdered.

638
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,670
He's home.

639
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,836
MELISSA:
No.

640
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,276
No, no, no, no, no, Ms. Mac.

641
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,279
Billy is dead.

642
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,712
And three other girls are...

643
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,715
Are missing. Missing.

644
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:20,943
Are missing.

645
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,815
566 Oakdale.

646
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,945
We're the second house on the...

647
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,545
Right.

648
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,578
Alpha Kappa sorority.

649
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,922
Kelli Presley.

650
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,950
Wait, how long until...

651
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,120
What?!

652
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,221
No, no!

653
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,129
We think he's still outside!

654
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,758
Would you wait
around that long

655
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:38,859
after what I just told you?

656
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:39,800
Get your purse!

657
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,463
KELLI:
Please, isn't there

658
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,971
anything that you...

659
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,768
Goddamn it!

660
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:48,205
The storm.

661
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,338
Pile-ups over 91.

662
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,611
Reservists can't make it out

663
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,515
because the streets
are all ice.

664
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:59,249
Trees have fallen, and they said
they can maybe,

665
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,917
maybe be here in two hours.

666
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,391
Well, we're all gonna be
out of here in two minutes.

667
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,860
Get your things.

668
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,385
- And what about Dana?
- We'll just go over

669
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,692
to the ADG house and get help.

670
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,360
No, they-they've all gone home
or-or skiing.

671
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,925
KELLI: Okay, okay,
whose family lives the closest,

672
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,401
just-just call them.

673
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,529
Lauren, her mom lives in Boston.

674
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:16,596
Even if we could

675
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,936
reach them on their cellphone,

676
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,204
it would take four or five hours
before they got here.

677
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,073
Oh, shooot, Lauren...

678
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,408
- Let's go.
- No.

679
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,605
We stay together.

680
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,807
We lock up the house--
we got the fireplace poker,

681
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,283
a ski pole or some shooot,
and for the next two hours

682
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,842
not let each other
out of our sights.

683
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,717
No. We are driving
to the police station.

684
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,222
- In this weather?
- Even if they can't

685
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:35,588
do anything, at least
we will all be safe there.

686
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,456
Yeah, and we're not all here!

687
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,655
If we were, then I would go.

688
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,628
That's right.

689
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:45,426
Unless I see otherwise, I'm
believing that Clair is alive.

690
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:50,462
<i>And when she comes back, it is
not gonna be to an empty house.</i>

691
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,203
We are safer
sticking together.

692
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,371
All right, then get your coats.

693
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,313
Mel, come on, we're leaving!
Let's go!

694
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,748
I'm not leaving Lauren,
you bitch!

695
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,911
We're sisters...

696
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,920
so act like it.

697
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:19,156
We'll get the police here
as soon as we can.

698
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,536
Let's go.

699
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,438
Whoa!

700
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,346
We can't see the car.

701
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,543
Maybe from Lauren's room?

702
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,791
Open up, please, Mrs. Mac.

703
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,104
Oh, come on, you piece of shooot.

704
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,413
Come on.

705
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,962
KELLI:
They got the car started.

706
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,725
Go, go, go.

707
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:56,663
All right.

708
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,893
What are you doing?

709
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,799
Here you go.

710
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,565
What is that thing?

711
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,062
Are you kidding?

712
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,139
Privileged bitch.

713
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,704
Frigid Southern princess.

714
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,411
# Good tidings for Christmas,
and a... #

715
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,504
LEIGH:
Why aren't they leaving?

716
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,769
Should we go check on them?

717
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,868
Let's go.
Stay with your friend.

718
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,015
Kelli?

719
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,015
Kelli!

720
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,818
Kelli?

721
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:38,999
Come on!

722
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,195
flaping window!

723
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,269
It's blocked.

724
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,703
Come on. Come on.

725
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:15,722
Oh, God.

726
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,750
Oh, shooot. Oh, shooot.

727
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,997
Go!

728
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,340
- Lauren, where's Mel?
- KELLI: Shut up.

729
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,209
- Where is Melissa?
- He'll hear you.

730
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,544
Oh, my God... Kyle!

731
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,949
LEIGH:
Stop! It's me!

732
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,887
- No!

733
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,194
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

734
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,724
There are two bodies
in the driveway.

735
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:33,894
- Maybe you did it!
- No!

736
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:34,766
Maybe you did that!

737
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,135
It wasn't... him.

738
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,264
How do you know?

739
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,584
- What have you done... Billy?

740
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,953
She's my family now.

741
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,595
He's in the attic...

742
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:38,293
and I hear
someone else.

743
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,442
Hey, hey, no flaping way.

744
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:54,608
Let's go.

745
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,413
Clair might be alive--
she might be up there.

746
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,817
No, Eve's not,
Heather's not, Ms. Mac...

747
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,787
I heard more than one voice
on those phone calls.

748
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,187
And I have searched
the whole house.

749
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,191
And I've seen under it.
Where else could he be?

750
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,059
Until I see that she's dead,
she is alive.

751
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,462
This is Billy flaping Lenz
we're talking about here, okay?

752
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,193
He's probably listening to us
right now.

753
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,701
Yeah, and if I had a sister, I
would expect her to go up there.

754
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,169
How would you know?
You don't have a sister.

755
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,501
She does.

756
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,140
Now, let's go.

757
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:23,941
Wait.

758
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,638
If we go up there,

759
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,546
the second we see they're dead,

760
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,210
we run the flap
out of this house.

761
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,704
I open the door,
and you hit the light.

762
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,207
Okay?

763
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,539
Okay.

764
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,822
One, two...

765
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,694
KELLI:
Kyle! Kyle!

766
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,584
No... no... no!

767
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,959
No...!

768
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:54,961
God, no!

769
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,395
Clair!

770
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,330
No!

771
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,912
No! No!

772
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,211
Oh, no! No!

773
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:18,516
He's my family now.

774
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,454
No! No...!

775
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,719
No! Leigh!

776
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:23,554
No! No!

777
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,943
KILLER: Everyone should be
home for Christmas.

778
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,786
Holy...

779
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:18,378
You're my family now.

780
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:19,676
No!

781
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,704
Come on!

782
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,114
No!

783
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,115
No!

784
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,328
No! No!

785
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,229
flap!

786
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,873
They're not your family.

787
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,315
Agnes.

788
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:32,350
I'm not your family.

789
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,822
And your brother's not here.

790
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,826
No, my daddy's here.

791
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,608
No!

792
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,295
Leigh!

793
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:30,267
Leigh!

794
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,209
Leigh!

795
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,808
Help me. Help!

796
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,752
Help me! Please!

797
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,153
I'm in the wall, please!

798
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,157
Leigh!

799
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,091
I'm in the wall!

800
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,560
Help! Help! Help!

801
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,027
Kelli?!

802
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,360
Help! Help!

803
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:53,425
I'm below you!

804
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,528
Below you!

805
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,767
Help! Help! I'm down here!

806
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:01,834
Help me!

807
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,005
Help me!

808
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,976
Help! Help! Help me, please!

809
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,287
Kelli!

810
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:17,815
Help me.
Billy's in the flaping wall.

811
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:18,792
Leigh!

812
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,796
- Oh! Help me!

813
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,598
Leigh!

814
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,837
Please, please!

815
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,170
Please!

816
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,303
Help! Help!

817
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,210
Kelli!

818
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,821
Dr. Forest, dial 118, please.

819
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,164
Dr. Forest, please dial 118...

820
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,295
All right,
good to go.

821
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,964
Still more questions
than answers tonight

822
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:39,064
at Clement University Hospital,

823
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,076
on what should have been a
typically quiet Christmas Eve.

824
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,738
Earlier, escaped notorious
murderer Billy Lenz,

825
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,441
along with his sister Agnes--

826
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,212
unaccounted for since her recent
release from Woodville--

827
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,116
together went on
a murderous rampage...

828
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,518
No, I'm the only one here.

829
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:57,889
What about the M.E.?

830
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,826
M.E. barely made it in.

831
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,352
Are you gonna be home soon?

832
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:02,795
No, I won't be home
till after noon.

833
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:06,289
Well, 'cause he wants us to
identify all the bodies,

834
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,132
and we've only done two.

835
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,899
Remember when we talked
about this last night?

836
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,031
Uh-huh.

837
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,041
- Don't you?
- Yes.

838
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,940
You know what day it is?

839
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:17,138
Of course I know what day it is;
the kids'll have to wait.

840
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,305
It's Christmas, jerk.

841
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,905
- flap!

842
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,438
- Bitch.

843
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:26,485
Think I want to be doing
this on Christmas?

844
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,786
I'm doing my frickin' job.

845
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,683
Mmm.

846
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,899
Ooh, yes, sir.

847
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,742
What the flap?

848
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,536
Holy shooot.

849
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,418
No, no!

850
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,396
How long could they have
been in the house for?

851
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,955
Months? Years?

852
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:47,468
We're not gonna know that now.

853
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:49,402
We're never gonna know.

854
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:05,343
I'm not gonna be able to open
this in front of...

855
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,685
my sister, so...

856
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,900
Baby...

857
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:44,289
Doctor wants some more
X-rays, and the technician's

858
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,954
about to go home and
won't be in tomorrow.

859
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,946
Kelli?

860
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,219
Kelli?

861
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,219
I thought they took you
to get your X-rays.

862
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,393
You okay?

863
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:58,956
No!

864
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,093
Forever!

865
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,406
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Leigh?

866
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,432
I don't know. Restroom, maybe?

867
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:19,008
They were supposed to
have someone fix this.

868
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,610
Leigh?

869
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,227
CHORUS: # Deck the halls
with boughs of holly #

870
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:44,102
# Fa la la la la
la la la la #

871
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,664
- # 'Tis the season to be jolly #

872
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:50,303
# Fa la la la la
la la la la... #

873
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,370
Open the door!

874
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:55,144
Please, somebody, help!
Open the door.

875
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:01,587
Oh, God.

876
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:04,558
Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.

877
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,392
Come on!

878
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,923
No!

879
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:31,243
Oh, flap.

880
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,734
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

881
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,499
No!
